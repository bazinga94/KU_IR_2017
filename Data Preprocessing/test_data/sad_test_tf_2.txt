Oh, how could anyone not want to rip it all apart
Into a life you never meant
This is a ballad for the good times
Oh the things that summer brings
Give me endless summer
And it would roll off my skin
And I wanted the whole
Let your memory reduce them to dust
They let Lisa go blind
Goddamn me
And as I helped, my mom would start to cry
I haven't found the one for me
Now I can't walk back, I can't leave behind
Thought we'd be flying
Look back before you leave my life
Let's make it up, let's even try
I admit I've lost control
But love had lost its cause
Snuck out to the greenhouse, put a bullet in his brain
I'm searchin' for a face
Don't hesitate
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
And I knew, I'd cherish all my misery alone
I just wish it would rain oh how I wish that it would rain
I watched and acted wordlessly as piece by piece you performed your story
As the waves break
What does it matter, a dream of love or a dream of lies
There are monsters outside
If you dream of me
And I have desired
Let it rain
And her hair in a fine mist floats on my pillow
So I'm up at dawn, putting on my shoes
Night is falling
And as you walk through valleys of fear
Now you got a little brother, maybe it's really you
Bet you noticed
Look at him smiling full of teeth
You said always and forever
O my heart, o my heart
And if you ask me, I will stay
With my candles and angels besides
Saying no but meaning yes
So you buried all your lover's clothes
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
The glue of love is still bonding us together
'Cause I need you more than dope
Yet you're going to look at me that way
You come from an island
When I die, then I die loving you
If you fall I will catch youI'll be waiting
Devil's hand across my heart
Go ahead and try
I don't need a better thing,
Yes, it all makes sense now
Now I know that she thinks I am dead
Down by the shore in the lazy summer
No one knows where we're from
Don't waste the sun on a rainy day 
You won't see the pious praying
Do you wonder why I prefer to be alone
One of these days letters are gonna
Since you walked away from me
It's the end of the world"
Sat on the corner of the room
In my worried shoes
Don't always need to do it by yourself
It's chilled us to the bone
Then I got on a plane and flew
That you've run this in the ground
I looked in your eyes
Beyond the constraints of my mind
Though you don't believe me
Through shadows falling
'Cause come tomorrow morning we're off to the county fair
After your picture fades and darkness has
Do you remember I do
Tryin' to figure out this life
And turned into a castle for some towering queen
I'll give this one more try
Lie with me one last time
I haven't lived my life, I haven't lived love
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Hey Charley, I think about you
We'll have a bit of fun
And the gold as I was told
Suddenly I see you change
This bitch is a Stan
And stand lost forever in a happy crowd
It's black in here blot out the sun
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
It's all heart and lungs
Alone
I'm the one you've been waiting for
He took my bones and turned them into bread
On the fourth of every single July
The type of shit'll make me flip out
I used to think about you all the time
For your eyes smiling
But I can't feel my head and it's unravelling
I won't let go at any price
If I don't stay on the charts, oh
Everything in no time at all
Promise me just one more night
Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
You need to be up all of the time
Is we're all gonna be, yeah
In a small brown house in suburban streets
What if there was no time
Who holds the stars up in the sky
But if you leave don't look back
And I'm up in the air, so baby hell yeah
But you've already lost
While you're picking pebbles out of the drain, miles ago
I'm too busy to be dreaming of you
And stand very, very still 
There's a feeling
Can we start all over again
You lost yourself
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
I try my best to let them go
Old picture on the shelf
Out in the frozen air
What's left in your mattress
'Cause I stay winning
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown
And I'm hanging on your words like I always used to do come swimming into view
But dear God, why did you choose her
Guide me safely in worlds I've never been to
Look back before you leave my life Don't leave my life
Well, how can I when you build the Great Wall around you
From a black little crack in a stone
So, go ahead, go ahead
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Once you've fallen from classical virtue
I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight for you, I will, I will, I will
A house of cards
Some will say
At , my biggest fear was losin' it all
Makes any boy feel like picking up roses
I close the book on them right there
The lover speaks about the monsters
And things to treasure days like that should last and last and last
He don't play the trombone
Swish, swish, aw I got them upset
And bring home the bacon each night
Ain't no use hanging on to her memory
In the evening
There's still fountains down there
And close my eyes real tight
"I didn't touch you there"
Plant this dying tree
Would you swallow me alive
And we fall asleep again with ties to mend
I want the truth from you
If you're gonna have a hit you gotta make it fit
Well it's lasted for a while
I still ponder this old question why
In a big city, they just dropped me off
Or we could leave it out to die
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
And I know you did it all
I think I'd better leave right now
How did you go bad
And I want to stop
Say hello and wave goodbye
I remember till I cry
Should I stand amid the breakers
Oh God, what have I done Ooh
Close your eyes so you don't feel them
Were you hare when I was fox
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
But tread softly, you tread on my dreams
Had a lot of fun living life on the run
So I'll hit the pavement
And we were best of friends
You call me a boy, but I'm trying to be the man
Glass is breaking, so don't let go of my arm
And other people got their own reasons for homicide
Won't somebody come take me home
When the light's out
Let the light shine the way,
I won't let you come to nothing
As it lights upon your eye
Read me your tombstone
Certain things just happen when you make no plans
And forgive me for not being in your life
I want to know, am I the sky or a bird
If anybody ever had a heart, he wouldn't be alone
If I could I would, I'd change everything
Now Cain slew Abel, killed him with a stone
Are your thoughts results of static cling Go your own way
But wasn't he a most peculiar man"
Tell myself you never loved me, no
I'ma tell my Biggz "yeah, dat's da guy"
If this was ever real
At  years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
But you stand by me nonetheless
Make their way to my door
'Cause what we had was so beautiful
Still on my brain, yeah
I cry, I don't want to lose you
Please pray for me
I've got to stop smoking Caramel
Life is a game and true love is a trophy
You gave me your name and signed
That's leading me around
The ink is still drying
Always thinking that you know
Don't call me love, don't call me
There's a lot of things that I gotta do
And I felt the fault was all mine
Never knew where this would lead
So your farther gone
For all that you've done wrong
Gravedigger, when you dig my grave,
But what if the pages stay pressed
Can you see the sky turn red
Safe in my arms
But she asked me to care for you
Cyrus Jones,  to 
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you
There would be a documentary on Radio 
They are beating me with ease
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
As comparing our new brand name black sunglasses
What's up, family Yeah, it's yo cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man I know you been havin' a lot on yo mind lately, and I know you feel like, you know, people ain't been prayin' for you But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy  says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart" See, family, that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way
'Cause I think I'm coming down
Live with my friends there
He's known by all in town
I thought that you'd be here by now
My heart would break without you
It's hard but you know it's worth the fight
Take the disaffected life
In every man, in every hand
And please don't find her skin
Darling I beg, come back to me
Together as one against all others
Oh, how could anyone not finally diminish
You will steer your life and die old in bed at home
Thinking of you like a movie star
There'd always been someone
She looked deep into you as you lay together
Soon as I let go
But even after all I still think of you that way, yeah
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
If only we could stay
Always be
Broadcast to each house, they drop your name
The channel fades to snow
And oh babe, can you tell what's on my tongue
And I'm not looking for answers, no, I'm not looking for answers
The preacher lost his son
It might smear their lovely career
There is this thing keeping everyone's lungs and lips locked 
I won't cry when the silver lining shows
This house that we have made,
Seem to have come undone
You're just paying, for all of the bad you have done
Away with these nightmares
Broken by the rules of love
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
Baby, is the thistle in the kiss
So I'm not hurt when you're not around
Hey, I got a feeling there's something going wrong
Everything was free and everything was fast
I'm sorry I'm hard to live with, but living is the problem for me
Does he kiss your eyelids in the morning
'Cause you're gone
I wanna hear you lie
Lord I fear the cold
Ooh  to heaven from here
This is everything
In an attic, in a house, in the dead of night
You're moving but not aware
Holds twentythousand days
On the way home this car hears my confessions
Little bird, please don't stay
After the war
Where you feel sheltered,
But I can't draw a hand
You are my sunshine,
It's like we never happened, was it just a lie
To see you walking down the road
My love and I are fleeing
I think about it every year so I picked up a pen
Tell me what's right, is it my right
A few were idiots, they were a really good laugh
Is it a kind of shadow
Where you feel safe
It's a shame and as you know
How much I love you love you
Mark my home and draw some lines that match
See, we are far less than we knew
Well, nobody's perfect
And nobody seems to know where you go
I write them out of the book right there
We'll go to a movie
When I awake, I'll see your face
How will I break the news to you
Still ended up in love
Tepid water chase the pills
Or should I lie with death my bride
And we always say, it would be good to go away, someday
I know what you did was wrong
Men cut marble to mark our graves,
Now I can try to act real strong
No, I think not
Scars are left behind, but some too deep to feel
And the wind called out
You son of a bitch, you fuckin' ruined my life
I drive fast, wind in my hair
Your memory is breakin' my heart
At the bottom of the sea"
I notice all the suffering
Like a little bit of revelation
A quiet truth to calm you down
It's what you told me anyway
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
Do you remember when you were young and very pretty I do
Too much too soon Hell yeah
They say with crippled grins
And upon the lips of everyone a curse they've never dreamed yeah
I can only try to make it right
Please don't take my heart away
I can't breathe
And everything you think you had, baby, is gone
And the hours of your life
And all the stars didn't wanna play 
Muriel Stonewall,  to 
Away from all welcome mats
When we were only kids
And the sixth is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little
Can I open my eyes
Check my phone, nothing though
Of faulty manufacturing
A mountain of a soul
We will put this flesh into the ground again
Straight sound like the end of the world or armageddeon man
I'm sick of always hearing 
I see the blood pool on the step
I could say this I could say that
I'm feeling scared and you know it
I know that this will break me
To the world outside
Sing for the bartender, sing for the janitor, sing 
Laying on the bathroom floor
I see your car parked on the road
Fundamentally evil
Trainwhistles, a sweet Clementine
Won't you please bring that flash to shine
First tell me which roads you will take
The sky cracked open and the thunder groaned
Liz likes to liquor up my thoughts
And bury your head in the sand
Six in the morning
There are times 
If the plane goes down, damn
It's always bittersweet
That is what I remember Do you remember
When all their power turns into vapor
Just give me the truth
That I only come home
It's a cycle really you think I'm withdrawing and guilt tripping you 
And it's all uphill from here
That we all need someone
Over and over circling around
Here is the time when we didn't speak
Late nights when I stayed up late
You come down, holding tight, to the railing on the side
Yesterday was mine
It becomes clear, this is all we got
And I got high
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
Two, is better than one
And I'm gone
Funny how the distance learns to grow
We are smoke
I'm so wasted on you x
There's a time and a place
Girls found honey to drench our hands
In every kiss you understand
Lose another blind game
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
With the twilight
It's a promise not forgotten
Mother can we start over
Started thinking about my old man
You're coming back to me
Change your heart 'cause I am already spoken for
Running into the sea
The light on at your window
And pace with you a while
I still feel it on my lips
Whistling my consence to make me cry
What we had, a beautiful magic love there
To get one last look at my baby
So maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Would it touch you deeper
'Cause girl you're love is still on my brain brain yeah
Into the hole that I have dug here,
I rose from a dream
But I was looking through slow, slow glass
And it's over, it just started
To understand why I'm not around
Don't let me make
When I'm so all alone
I feel younger, louder 
A boy and his friend
It's another thing for me,
I threw my hands in the air and said show me something
And it feels like a warrant is out for my arrest
Have I begun a feeble chase
'Cause the freaks are playing tonight
Waiting for my life to start
Can't explain the way today just fell apart like everything
When the houses came
I can't open up a thousand paper cuts
I let 'em rub my neck and I write 'em a check
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
I wanna sleep here but I've been denied
And there's nowhere left to fall
You could be my silver spring
Hot breath, rough skin
It took him hours, start a punk rock band
All that we leave behind is all that's left
I would think about you all the time
No one to forgive
The things I did not know at first, I learned by doing twice
So, Cyrus Jones lived forever
You're never coming home to me
This world is full, oh
When you're thinking about the things you do
Lay their boots upon my floor
I'll put my suitcase here for now 
And I think you know about me
We sing, how your love is like a knife to the back
Two pale figures ache in silence; timeless in the quiet ground
You look happier
It's been years since I saw you
You stole it, I beat yo ass if you say that game is broken
There's not a lot that I feel obliged to share or talk about
You know I need you so much
Quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer"
Oh tear his heart out cold as ice it's mine
No memory
And pay for their vices
We might be dead by tomorrow
We're yelling, "someone's got the answers,
And drop a smile passing in the hall
Your arms in mine
Then I'll be the one to find you
And I will shine on for everyone 
I think tonight I'll take the long way
And I'm never gonna love again
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
A love for everyone I know
I got no trouble with that
And your lids are your best canvas
The songs from the ugly organ
I wake up lonely
Well, I was almost honest
I was hoping I was hoping we could dance together
Don't need opinions
They are two alone
And think of you
The game is over
Suddenly burn so pale
And he wanted the sun
Of the time when she was mine
We have come now to the end
You won't get better till you'll get worse
It has a way of crystallizing the bad times
Alight for  billion years
When people all stare
That things were closing in and ready to blow
Take me in your arms and love me, love me
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray
Because I know there's nothing we can do
Wordlessly watching, he waits by the window and wonders 
That lingers in the afterwards
Hard not to make other plans
When you look them in the eye
Stillness has brought my love to cost
A breath between us could be miles
And it's going to cause a crisis
Obsessions lament to freedom
His ship came in
Do you remember dancing that night
Some things tie your life together, slender threads
My heart overfloods
But love is all around
I'm so sick and tired of trying to change your mind
Before my eyes
Lay your head where it burns
You came out a little faulty
And in their falling, make no sound
I'd rather trade it all while somehow saving you
There's no more trying
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And undress me from the sweaters better hurry
Someone said the truth will out
I scream, no one hears me
The largest ones, that changed my life
And there's blood on my sheets
I've fall behind
'Cause I just can't work it out
Their beauty carved out of absolutes you could never claim
Please say honestly
How many times have you told me now that you've tried
I was longing to be free
All of my life
That should be me, makin' you laugh
It's just a bird's eye view from, from up above
Seventeen years and all that he gave was a daughter
I can't fix a car
And when her own man comes to call on her
We can never catch up to it as fast as we run
It'll be perfect babe
So go on, go home
Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse Because he said he's gonna punish us, the socalled Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel We are the Israelites according to the Bible The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee So, just like your children, your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America I love you, son, and I pray for you God bless you, shalom
Took too much and now I'm done
Turn around the heartache
The shadows and regrets
How can you be ready for life
Let it rain let it rain, let it rain
And four and six have come and gone
The priests dressed children for choir
Into a white and soundless place
First, you think the worst is a broken heart
And I'm afraid to be alone
The people under me
I'm feelin' weaker and weaker
And sometimes I think you want to me to touch you
It's not for a fuck or a kiss
As I walk these streets
I'm never gonna love again
What's gonna kill you is the second part
I love you, however
Maybe you really forgave us knowing we was confused
A million stones, a million bones, a million holes within the chinking
I can stop and catch my breath
Yes, I wore a slinky red thing
That's my fault
In my fragile family tree
Everybody's laughin' in my mind
Hold on to this house
And nobody ever knows when you go
Took off my worried shoes
Obsessed by you, your looks
Stumblin' through the work that I have to do
It's all right, I'll be fine
With my gothic girlfriend, making love in the creek
I'd hate myself until I die
Yo' teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
Well, my husband he's leaving, and I can't convince him to stay
And talkin' to me I'm feelin' a little low"
Ghosts that haunt you with their sorrow
And when there's nothing left behind
And everything has changed
Could change all we've got
You know you'll up like the rest
You're still my everything
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
No matter how sad
If I bent like you said was best,
I had to watch my tone for fear of having you feel judged
I believe without a doubt
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
I am nothing more than to see you there
And as the years go by the other woman
Are the things that make you panic Go your own way
Don't you know the train keeps rolling
The band is playing our song again
Then one night she climbed into the picture frame
In the life I know
The bottle is waiting
Please not to purse their faces grim
When all is gone and can't be regained
These things go through you head
Some charity, a phone plan, a subscription to a magazine
And I'm not tryin' to take away Oh no
My babe is gone
To be with you wherever you are
Oh, when skies are gray
You wanna stay
I can only imagine what you're painting, what you're painting
She is on the other side
Riding home everyday
Don't blame it on your son
I'm a fool for you
No more "I love you's"
Still fighting all these years about the same old things
What if I never let you win, chase you with a rolling pin
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Everything falls apart
You with someone else that I have felt and seen
Three months of living here without you now
Drive all over town
And it's fun
And do you like being single 
Permanently at square one
And the peoples' hearts were pounding, they were throbbing, they were red
'Cause you are my star
And turn my eyes red
The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones,
If you knew I was dying would it change anything
I believe I believe in possibility
Out the gate you go and never stop
﻿House full of roses, a letter on the stairs
But I never quite knew how it feels
You have gray hair now,
Your love's not alive, it's dead
I'm going to make whatever it takes
On every face you'll ever know
With love in my heart
Or maybe die because these smokers
And there's something to cushion my callous sighs
Picked all my weeds but kept the flowers
There's no times at all
We would laugh and get high, and never answer the phone 
I searched the whole damn apartment from ceiling to carpet
Into a life I never meant
Don't pull over till you're sure 
Looking down every few steps
That overlook a highway
MARIANNE and we will sing
Will there be someone left to sing your blues
Couldn't pull my heart back together again
There's a little child
He thinks he owes some kind of debt
I play the shows
My worried shoes
Sometimes I'm wondering
When I pick them off the floor
My everything depends on you I depend on you
Like a pain in the river
Is what no one can break
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
It seems that all men
And I don't wanna lie but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Her heart like a crystal
Positively unemployed
When I go outside
And I don't wanna lie and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I still wonder
Hello, I love you will you tell me your name
Take the guitar player for a ride
I was blind
I'm writing songs to entertain
Shards of me, too sharp to put back together
MARIANNE one for sorrow
In dreams, I meet you in long conversation
Through the dark fall
Three months and I'm getting better, yeah
It's a chemical, chemical kind
And I wonder how mine would taste
You raped, I feel dirty
She ripped my heart out beating
Everything has changed
I passed through before I knew you
I tasted the answers
And say you'll hold
Then I'll return to you
If I can make myself believe
It's so hard to just let go
Let the factories rust
If I could ask God just one question
You're sitting on my chest
All of the colours I see my love every time I see you
Well I know I could have loved you
Tough girl whose soul aches
I am the entertainer, I bring to you my songs
Not what you are
Rest your daughter while your mother cries
Not really sure how to feel about it
With pencil and light
They are smoke
Why are we so alone 
Inside a lonely world
I can't give everything away
Please don't cry 
This is how I'd die, yeah
Let love take away all this pain,
From rock'n'roll to love and cash
If you love me, then that's your fault
He died last Saturday
Hear me sing, "Swim to me, swim to me
And it takes a whole lot of whiskey
What's so wrong Why the face so long Is it over
As we fall back into the impossible dream
And fate has led you through it
Where does it go, all the light that we had
Know tonight we'll make our bed
It's alright
That time that you danced with me
You're hurt but you don't know why
Will lessen in the moonlight
I used to be the tight one 
Say hello, goodbye
Nevermind what God said
But I don't ever tell you this distance
High times
If my love comes across
I barely go before you
Educated criminals work within the law
That my heart's been hard to find
I love you
All that is left is a heart made of tears
I look at your photograph all the time
And I'll be strong enough to try
Though its hard to tell
You would die for me
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The lure of my bed is ever near
And don't think I'll replace
The kiss is infinite
And there's no need to test my heart
You always said we'd meet again someday
What's the best way no one knows, yeah,
Got me through a lot
Don't ever forget me honey
And we can talk it round again girl
Another game
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
And I lose your hand through the waves
They wont let me turn around
Do you believe
Please try to understand
Walk down your streets
Underneath the stars
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
And burned the letters lover wrote
I remember the makeup running down your face
Big monster lover
The first orgasm of the morning 
You're not alone
I think I feel a little hurt
Can you feel my eyes on you
Afraid of the fall that never ends
Dishes, TV, bed
I'm standing on the harbour wall
Nothing I dream
And it's not a cry you can hear at night
Or should I lie with death, my bride
Is the only sense I've left
Never be the same as it was 'cause the way it was
Never gonna love again
Did you know how much I love you
And if you ask, I will stay
I wish they was mine
The towers had fallen
Watchin' the movie
And I ran off and ran on to something
It's just the chance we took
I hold your casket gently walking to the grave
Breaking them till they've become just another crown
I arch my back cause 
Melt in my mouth
And the white sun scattered
Among your noise and fuss, I've let it go
We were best friends
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 
You tell your friends, yeah, strangers too,
You can sink to the bottom of the sea
I'm having trouble sleeping
You talked about your ma and dad,
Into war's waters, I will wade
You could have done anything
The wind through your bones is all that remains
All lines have broken but we need you to hold on
Lights come on
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Love needs its martyrs
What they did that made you happy,
Whatever it is
Running into the sun
The patchwork explains
And the night will come
To offset my fucked up family land
Because we
One day soon I'll hold you like the sun holds the moon
My panic research was no help
But reasons like seasons they constantly change
But you would not let me
Possible to be loved
In this jigsaw of a relationship
But know there's no backing out
And I carry this
When you sleep with somebody else
I hope I mumbled goodbye as you walked out the door
And no one will ever know
I've got no one to send a letter to
I don't know how to let you go
The life I have isn't what I'd seen
And That I see a darkness
Are the ones you should've said
And compared your Jesus to a thief
You said always and forever, such a long, lonely time
And stand each Sunday, a hymnal steady in your hand
With each light of morning
Ooh, that's right
And I'm crying all the time
All my blood will spring and spill
I'm broken, don't break me, when I hit the ground
To get away, maybe I could sell kisses
And I loved you back then
I believe I believe someone's watching over me
Oh, what a shame
Still I'm proud to have known you
Once more from the start
I said I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry
But don't forget the knife that was thrust
It's a damn cold night
I'm back, back in town
I can feel the distance getting close
We wasted so many days
Today I am your champion, I may have won your hearts
You've murdered my thinking
Lay me down in waking light
Leave your pain in the river
Cancel our dinner with Max and Coraline
It is called fear and it's seeing a great renaissance 
You love her but you don't know why
For to smoke the days away into the evenings
But I pulled you and I called you here Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
With its hands stretched towards the calendar hanging itself
I've got to get over
Rather give the world away than wake up lonely
I no longer love
But here in the city that never sleeps
And don't believe the lies
We wrapped ourselves inside a dirty blanket
The view is beautiful
I wouldn't change a thing
I'd give anything now
If you can make a promise
We laughed at the darkness
Like the stone face of your lover
If you walk away, I'll walk away"
You said wouldn't it be a shame if I knew how great I was 
And I let him in
No, not today
Someone came and washed away your hardearned
And fuck, your own child
To let everybody know that you're coming back
But we still can't go
Nothing lasts forever, for all good things, it's true
There's a war inside my core
My head about it
I went to meet you at Central Square
And I'm hanging on your words like I always used to do
Every car crash, every misstep, every word
White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Holding your hand
Fire fireworks
Well, we'll still be there
Than tears that fall from eyes
Its just that we stayed, too long
Please tell me there's something better
Oh, how could anyone not love your cold, black heart
She packs her things and she goes
I've got to find genius Caramel
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes 
Well the clock's heart it hangs inside its open chest
Without finding closure, you take them back,
Don't look back
In this magical land behind your eyes
Hell's boiling over and heaven is full
Sorrow all across the surface rolls
All you touch turns to lead
Unengaged, dimlit love didn't taste the same
'Cause I've relied on my illusions
Somehow I know that we can't wake again from this dream
I don't know if the world will end today
So, just walk away,
On stony ground
Forgotten as soon as we meet
Yeah, you look happier, you do
You're wasted again
We let them lie in wait for us
Never felt so cold
That made our memories
And in a moment you're cast aside
In between life and death when there's nothing left
And we can stop our whoring
Still alone and lost indeed
I guess you heard he's gone to LA
I'm gonna keep your heart
Three whole words and eight letters late
I eat some rice chex 
Sometimes I feel discarded
Breaks baby, it's torn baby, every storm
Once bitten twice is shy
You'll be turning five
I wake up alone
My vision of a family was artificial and fake
I used to feel woebegone and so restless nights
And all of the people come and gone
I beat yo ass if I beat yo ass twice and you still here
And that I see a darkness
Red blood's a power fuel
And we're quick to surrender
Spin the sky
They poison our minds
Do what you like and do it honestly
And the memories I never can escape
"My family tree, is my history" *echoes*
Oh come, come back to me
For our love
Men who ran the company ran your life
Glaring over you and over you, this feeling of despair
Two dollar color pictures from a photo booth
Get the sense that you're on the move
This life is mine
All of us now bent as we fall
Won't, won't you read my mind
And the sun was shining bright
Leave the rest for my own sake
When the tide comes in
Is ours alone tonight
How could I replace you
I got a question for you, ooh, ooh
Or about her tonight
Sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you fought for your life
Maybe you'll get here someday 
'Round and around and around and around we go
You like all these things
I climb the walls for oxygen
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Swallow, choke, and die
'Cause every gift and every letter
When I will get you alone
Merry Christmas, my love
Oh my head is spinning around
I'd give all I have, honey
If you're compromised
It's lonely at the top, block outs and airplanes
I can't cry and I can't see
Then picked a star before we lost
Sometimes hate is not enough to turn this all to ashes
Your eyes to the ground
Gave you my heart
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
It could still be simple
He knows, she's been here too few years, to be gone
Well, you know I have a love
You stay the night at his house
I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground
That you've marked to find your way back
They had the shows on till way after dark
London halflife
This made me all of who I am inside
The speaker in this door is blown
Twilight, I sit at all tables
Remembering your life, 'cause we wish that you were here
And it's gone
Oh, I'll be getting closer
But I don't love you anymore
As she makes up her eyes
Who's the man in such a lonely world
You won't get better till you're worse
Morning calls for pain relief
And spent it all on girls
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
To forever torment me, and I wonder why
That you put around her face
Our bedroom
Oh let me tell you, I am
Here the sprightly Chickadee gone now is the Willow Wren
Made me a man ah but who cares what that is
And as I turned her down, I always do
Oh, you strike me with your silence baby, tonight
My friend can't see
Made his greatgrandchildren believe you could live to 
She's a burning string
And the ghost of your memory
We could use a handful of wheel
But we knew what we could taste
A cold sweat hotheaded believer
Well, I ain't got no mercy
Another one, another one 
I'm cryin' in pain, cryin' in pain cryin' in pain
I'm losing hold
Into the horror of the truth,
You love a stone
Is not a place to dwell
Nature's cruel she laughs at me
As many petalled kiss I place upon her brow
So that I can feel the rain,
But I can't sing in key
What will become of my dear friend 
Was in never having planned to fall to fall in love, Luv
It says
Open Sesame we've places to go
I'll prolly die with promises
Don't be tryna double back
There's an angel on my shoulder
For I am not the one
O my heart
Have a care and say a prayer
And now I'm left with nothing
It's a beautiful place to be wasted, don't you know
Things were looking up
Make you feel so full of it
Say what you say, say it like a cat
I was looking for a holy ghost
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie
He got one that whole deal before it happened
BOTH we will sing
And I give myself three days to feel better or else I
Hey yeah, hey yeah
My love, my love, my love, don't explain
If you stop speaking for me
In the corner of the frame
Where I was laid
I just tried to work it out
And out it came like summer rain
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
I've been hungry all my life
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
And if the ship was built in bottled sand
I put up with all the scenes, this is one scene that's goin' to be played my way
I say I loved you years ago
Down a road that's leading me nowhere
He said something to make you laugh
Feel their hearts they're cold and white
To ride the commuter train
These words, "You will be mine"
A curling fox in a hole
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair
And I can't take these feelings with me
I was better
For more than a minute, get used to it
And how tall did we stand
Will spend her life alone
But I can't tell which way my thoughts are travelling
And suddenly my cell phone's blowing up
And paint them all a shade of grey
I can't remember faces, I don't remember names
I'll see you sometime maybe
I'm too busy to be heartbroken
I see things you were too tired
Pretend I'm okay with it all
Well, you're my friend
Why you look me and you blink your eye
Sometimes
And I'll try and do the same
I have followed mountain bears
So it don't seem right
Kate claims she can't depend on me
And finally now, believing
Been hurting low from living high for so long
Just to reach your house
'Til they came to the river
You know you're just a mama's boy
Love me hard until it heats
No one lifts their eyes
Surrounded by your peers, without suffering or fear
Be years before he gets over it
Does anybody know the way to Atlantis
I wouldn't know how to say
Your head rests and slumbers
In this devil town
I'll be down, I'll be around
What is in her mind
That's the hardest thing to see
My broken heart inside
Find the words to say goodbye
Cobwebs, a bakery sign
It's a hell of a year for you and me my friend
In Portland I tried my pretty hand at fishing
Get on the train, train, train
Then I'll come for you
I have a hard time standing up
To stop the world decaying
Every time that I see your face
All I do is wait and wait
I tripped and fell and did I fall
Don't be afraid of what they'll say
Some people get it
Everything is quiet
He's so cold he will rule the world tonight
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
And through my tears I sang along
Why make it strong to break it once again
You left me low
She made herself a pair of orthopaedic shoes
But you're a beautiful woman,
But we will only come
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your PJ's
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
And I walked barefoot down the road
I will stay
So the metals faded black
She laughed as we picked out our children's names
And I ain't got no mercy
With feelings hid
One that wanted to land
Good girls, hopeful they'll be, and long they will wait
Too young for him, they told her
Say things I'd take back
Yeah, that's the time and place
And you never got a chance to even open your eyes
Shedding a tear for you
But, though you like all these things
I don't give a fuck about goin' home
A pale moon rises
Would that change a thing
You found a million ways to let me down
I gotta hide beneath my sleeve
The idea of perfection holds me
The truth
I never wanted anything more
My wife is in the next room 
You're the one I've been waiting for
Oh what have I done, why have I done it
Would you have made me quit smoking by finding one of my lighters
Seven years went under the bridge
"I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
I'm taking a ride off to one side
Harder to know right from wrong
Sometimes I don't longer know
Even though I try to hide
That there is no reason why it can't be like you said
And fought your own child
All face down
I hope it made you feel good
We're wild and on the run
It's off to work you go
And I wonder if, I'm alone in your head
"It's your choice, babe, just remember
Her face was just a smear on the pane
Till your singing eyes and fingers
I will always
'Cause I'm afraid to be alone
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us
I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow
Sing cause its obvious, sing for the astronauts, sing 
Everybody feels this way
Raskolnikov felt sick, but he couldn't say why
We live in a beautiful place
Ignorance was bliss
Then I'll slowly drag one home
Just turn to my embrace
I was born
To feel
Are the things that make you panic
And don't say that she's pretty
Why's it always you
Oh darkness I feel like letting go
Many times we've been out drinking
And lovers become trends
'Cause I don't care no more
Well I was, what I am
You sing 
When it's so easy to disconnect mine
Where I'd sit around
As I hold you to my bed
And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone like Jesus
Except when she got deathly high
Go ahead and build it up again
What I'm thinking of 
Although I'd like to join the crowd
A criminal who drinks champagne
Since I woke up today, up today
Every Saturday night I get dressed up to ride for you
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
Until my head hurts
Living on th Street
You're so misunderstood
Has stopped on the corner
Having seen this place before
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
And there's no air or sound
Still rings in my ears
We'll keep coming back because
And your soul will not be free
So I'll begin not to love you
In a place without time and space
Is this the end Are you sure
They are calling
At the bottom of the sea
Following the river of death downstream
'Cause I'm heating upward bound now
The land is unchanged
My grandfather's name
Habits
Oh, but those feelings ain't this strange
I think it's not to be
Great white wings beating
Soon comes rain
I can't tell you why I'm breaking down
The sound of the drum has called
Although it's last month it's like yesterday
Ghosts, they come and memories all repeat
As I will say
The trees are white with snow
But how do I let go when I've
I hate you, piece of shit, I hate you
Keep up the working, okay
And you've got to clean up this mess
This is goodbye, this is the end
An angel girl with an upturned face
And each album I get shit on a little more
When I pretend, tend, tend, tend
And always empty
It made me feel like I belonged
She's the silk lining my bed
Before the end of me and you
And I will bow gently by your feet
And you'd never hear me say
What if we stop having a ball
Oh, send your love my way
You sound so alone
Take me to the places that we lived
You have come to journey's end
Why no one told me so much work
Here's a hope that somehow you
Will then the street light
You'll be free, child, once you have died
It is a personal thing
But they won't change a thing
Cracked and growing grass, you see it all
Reminds you that the memories will fade
And I settled for a telephone
Maybe one day we can meet face to face
In every sky above my head
You are in my dreams
We sleep separately
Oh I wish it would rain
Disconnected from choices we make
"What a lovely day," says the butcher as he raises his arm
Hold your breath until you see the light
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even know he's right beside you
My sweet time
Still all I need is you
Running, running away
No they won't change a thing
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
If I miss you, well that's my fault
I almost forgot myself there
And the holy dove was moving too
And ours alone tonight
You leave on the bed
Standin' at the door of the pink Flamingo cryin' in the rain
At all of the lives that I never have led
I only know because I'm way
Slipping off my shoes
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I was driving south of Melrose, I happened upon my old lover's house
Folded and yellowed and torn at the edge
When I forget how to talk, I sing
I've stopped returning all their calls
The past is done we've been betrayed
Hold on, onto me
Is this as hard as it gets
It happens when you're hurtin'
Fare thee well
I suffocate until the end
Life is no cabaret 
And she knows, she's been here too few years
Through the tarlatan holes
But each time I try on the thought of leaving you
When I look back, never would have known that
If all of the strength
You'll be resting on my mind
I will stay, always stay
Some days you'll find me in a place I like to go
And fuck your own child
So scared to show intelligence
Hearts will hold
This crystal city's gonna fall apart
It's all success if it's what you need
Let's light the night
Until death, we seek destruction
I found a letter that said, "I'm sorry that you were asleep when I wrote these words down"
Go ahead and put it down
Refuse to feel anything at all,
'Cause all I need is you
I can't sleep so I take a breath and hide behind my bravest mask,
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Sandwich bars, and barbed wire
He says that he loves me
If truly his heart was made of icing
And hallelujah to the one that we love
They reminded me of yours
What it your eyes close before mine
We've people to see let's put 'em on hold
Break all of their wings and make sure it crashes
Or disarm it's getting harder to shield
But still they come to haunt me, still they want their say
Letters so hard to mail
Nothing seems to help me since you went away
And like pathetic stars, the truck stops and the rock club walls
The wind bites more bitter
If it's one that you can keep
Steal away where only angels tread
Now I hear you in my mind
A dance that lasted for a while
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
You're owning up to nothing and I wish that I was gone
Bruised and beaten in the fire
Only told to stay away
You're already in hell, you're already in hell
Now I could say that I don't love you no more
But in doing so, in letting you go
Because he's still there
Hating all the boys who got to you
A telethon 
And I'm up in the air, said baby hell yeah
Yeah I thought you were beautiful
An inferno that never ends
And they say "Where's that crazy girl
Sixes and sevens, we live on jet planes
And I forgot to tell you
I know something is wrong
If the weight it was to slide
Dark clouds eclipse, the sun won't shine again
There are some school kids 
I can see a new beginning rise behind the sun
When you are scared
God, I'm torn apart inside
The plans I make still have you in them
In passing greet each other as if old, old friends
And so I drink to stay warm and to kill selected memories
Living a life of fear
The boy next door turned out
And Mrs Reardon says he has a brother somewhere
She thought it was the answer to the fashion blues
Thursday night far from sleep
In your heart
Waiting to hold you"
And all the people said "What a shame that he's dead
Go ahead, go ahead
"I love you far too much"
In all the world than making love to you
Just stay this little
You feel it in your heart, but not for very long
And fuck your own child 
And they paid, I cry and cry for you
I feel reckless, clumsy 
Will you love my scars so I can heal
It's a good year for a murder
There's moneylenders inside the temple
Bleeding after beating his kid and she threw a shoe at his head
But I do believe
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Oh my love I can't let go
Well I think I would call tonight
Somebody cries in the middle of the night
And the look that you gave me
I was young and struggling, but old enough to be a dad
As long as you're still mine, then its all right
And if it could start being alive you'd stop living alone
I was stronger
Ela e mais sentimental que eu
If everything we've got is slipping away
Saying, "Ho, have you ever said an honest word"
Of how I loved and how I failed
I heard you fell into a rabbit hole
What are we running for
Baby you said watch my head about it
Suitcase of memories,
Like the way life scattered
Our love will remain, love will remain I'm cryin' in pain
Even only  hours under your touch
You touch my lips and grab the back of my hand
The girl I shared with was away for the night
Tried all the new designs
Telling me to keep trying
Is deafening and keeping you from sleep
I'd have you by my side
Without so much as hello
Hanging from my mirror
Snakes in the grass beneath our feet, rain in the clouds above
It's been there for a while
Someone better help me
To feel my spirit calm
And the ringing from this empty sound
Head on a stranger's knee
At least I can say that I never been a quitter
And to talk to her
The truth, if this is how you feel
Can't wind down, the ending outlasting the mood
Because it's smooth
Today I walked down our old street
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Designed for music
It's the slow fade of love"
With your ringtone
And so don't be so hard on yourself
And I'm habitually feelin' kinda blue
Maybe it's all we've got, but it's all I need
Just when I needed you
The last couple nights or so
The fairness of our trade
Then lost in that feeling
And a man on my back
I held your hand when we took shelter from the rain
A memory I wanna forget
If I hurt you then I hate myself
I found what I'd been looking for in myself
As you throw your arms up to the sky
So it's true what they say
But if she don't love children then we can't party
There's weight on your mind
There's no tears
And hold your own
That was hunting
And I have sense to recognize but
People have been travelling miles just to hear us sing
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me
It hurt as a child, tied down, you would hit me
Or we think we did
Your heart starts skipping steps
My friend came back from being abroad
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen
I'm grabbing at the fray for something that won't drown
Blood is like water
To pretend he walks with you
And to the voiceless trees it is their own they will lend
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
But though there are caveats galore
Our love will never end
When I lay tonight, when I close my eyes,
In your sister's apartment
Everything that I should never take away from you again
Your spirit don't leave knowing your face or your name
But they won't mean a thing
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Years later on, I saw your face in line to catch the morning train
So I came back to Minneapolis
Outside ecstatic love
Could it be the sea
I need you more than dope
We got nowhere to go and no home that's left
The party just gets better and better
Come and turn the lights down so I
I let you say goodbye with lips like dynamite
Naked bodies look like porcelain
Got back in the van and put the walkman on
Never fall away
But the mountain never moves
The faces stay the same
I breathe, I breathe no more
It hurt as a child, tied down
I'll leave when the wind blows
But sometimes hate is not enough to turn this all to ashes
Oh, cause others infiltrated
I never thought I could feel so low
Not just let the water
I found myself staring at the closed oak door like the day she threw me out
I've got a burning desire for you baby
And the dead are all living
I wish that I was good enough
I never understood how you should feel
Hit the wall,
Ah that's just not the way that friends behave
Yeah, what do I care
Didn't see that she was
All that you believe is here and now
What's in your heart
Back to the thoughts that keep you awake,
That if you're by my side,
Yes, I think I'm coming down
With your lips and your smile
Having never ever planned to fall in love, Luv
So many questions so much on my mind
You can love
And somehow I feel closer
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
'Cause in my mind, I've been there,
Drive me to the dead end, till I
Who sailed around the world
You love somebody new
Under parking garage lights
Come on, sister have a drink
Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops
It only serves to show me that I'm still in love with you
'Cause no one ever turns to me to say
Take me by the hand
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
And she turned me into sand,
The place where I am free
When every back is turned
The monsters are crazy
And I cannot sleep without the radio
I fell into the ocean
And then I sit down 
My heart will break
Stop me from feeling what I'm feeling now
Where we shared a sleeping bag
I get put in the back in a discount rack
We don't want to lose our souls
And run to the pines
Well who's laughin' now that I'm leaving your town, again
It's your turn to weep
It hurt so much to hurt you
I'm living in your letters
And old
My sad attempts at breakdancing
So I put my hands up; I say, "Enough is enough
I want you to stay
My life seems unreal, my crime an illusion
He smokes his cigarette, he stays outside 'til it's gone
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
Will love you forever
You'd do anything
Another one in the casket Ananother one, ananother one
I'm cryin' in pain, cryin' in pain
I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die for you, I will, I will, I will
I see you as you see me  look at me
Where are you gonna go if they come for you
And if the perfect spring is waiting somewhere
If you're the kind who keeps the veil on
And you gave me what I need
So when it came time to create I made a mistake
We're sounding out it's a terrible, terrible tide
Like in war no one can be blamed
Can you sleep as the sound hits your ears
If you walk away, I'll walk away
Yeah you punched me right in the heart
Here to see you through till the day's end
No there's no starting over,
But it still pays the bills 
You hold inside
The only place
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Because if seeing is believing,
Wishing he could fly
Yes, it's been hard to be strong with all this going on
I quit drinking whiskey
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
How'm I gonna keep your heart
Sing for the children shooting the children, sing 
You were too scared to see
I'll just stare and hope you'll care
Why did you not include me on your list
Where every tongue is wagging
Where you gonna run when they come for you
To comprehend this curse that I call love
Oh, it's true what they say
Waiting out this long light brigade
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would have been
Stuck and I could never change
The summer's gone, the years have passed
All that fake love you showin'
That I was a stone
Rape me like a child
And the sun's going down
If you leave I won't cry
Until you fall asleep then I will go
While she's still around
All that I hold
And every time I turn away
There ain't nothing left to say
And push back your seat
They show how stupid we've become,
Take me in your arms and love me, love me, love me
I made a mistake
But I want to turn you on, turn you up, figure you out, I want to take you on
Oh, the tears that you weep
In every child, in every eye
Did he hear a goodbye
Who are we to understand
About the tears been shed
Eyes the color of water left in wood
So please let the cleaning begin with evolution
Two falling sparks
When I think I might just fall apart
Take my call
But since you wanna play
Or cry like the stone white clown
'Cause it's the ones with the sorest throats, Laura,
Its gills will swim faster after a breath from the shore
I've been looking in the mirror for so long
I know you were not new
And every second I spend waiting
Little Mikey Carson, ' to '
It's a beautiful place if we make it
I hear the songs and the words don't change
And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight
With the world all falling apart
Spinning round and round with you
I'm gone, I'm gone
I need you so
They live for your beauty
Just to reach our door
When the bottle gets empty
You look in my eyes and I'm screaming inside
Tell yourself it's alright
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask
Like I'm making a bad mistake 
We're both alone
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way
Couldn't part from you
And at the wake I waited around to see my exfirst love
Yes she did
At the empty place inside
There are times
I'd like to spend a day or two, but I can't stay that long
I'm standin' on the bridge
In the same old sickly skin
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
She motions outside
Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor
Kneeling above this playful body
When I fly solo, I fly so high
Even though it hurts, baby
My lonely soul brothers
Mother wake me from my dream
And when the waves came crashing down, he closed his eyes and softly kissed her
Tell you that you knew
With the windows closed so he'd never wake up
Baby, think twice
Sad things have to happen
I got your number
Tell me I look stunning and cadaverous
I cannot rest, or my consciousness contest
You never did give a damn thing, honey
And all day all night I dreamed
But if you knew what's going on in her life
We're going to commandeer the local airwaves
Seems I never get your kick quite right
She hides the bruises with the linen and lace
A willow wand, a willowisp  our ghosts will wander all of the water
With no need to return
Without my love, my love
Morning will come
I'm so heavy tonight
A mirror was splintered on the decks floor
And I'll keep on moving on for a while
To the grave,
How your body felt beside me
If you can end this hell
I feel just like I'm sinking
I always hold a place for you in my heart
And I don't mind
This is the accent of the halfhearted land
Watching shadows melt
You hold the big picture so well
Oh, Does he know that place below your neck
Before I fall any deeper
No matter how bad
So many voices, and nothing is there
Why do you choose that pain if only you knew
Somebody better show me how
What could you be doing that is so much fun
Who cares what cowards think, anyway
Oh 'cause I need this hole gone
Mr Vertigo on the flying trapeze
Teach Superman to fly
Sometimes I'm just happy I'm older
This is the calming before the storm
Laugh if they try to be funny
And the factory closed
They travel in the air
'Cause he's the only one that I have ever loved
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I'm stuck on the ground
When love makes you wake up sore
The morning is just a few hours away
Crosses flying high above the malls
Mommy said she didn't care
I will always be your light 
The lovely air so thin
And there's nothing I can do
Still we're kind of shy
I know what lies beneath
I was over my head
Just fall asleep with the TV Darling
So let's just say so long
Was a place where my body could be laid
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
But the hours they creep
Drew me closer to your isle
We sat quietly in the corner, whispering close about loss
In the park past the statues
There'd be two hundred troubled teenagers to sit with her
How can the light that burned so brightly
Another serenader and another longhaired band
We're all gonna be, yeah
Never should've let you go
But there's a light that still remains
My feelings free
Would you let me
Let it rain rain, rain
Talking for hours, that should be me, that should be me
And I knew there was someone that loved me
Everybody has their reasons, that's the reason we're all going to die
All the world's history gradually dying of shock 
And I thought hey
When morning comes it will be too late
Hand out of the window
The earthiest smell, the hollowest tone
But must hold inside yourself
I can't sleep
The sweat in your bed sheets
'Cause when she's by his side
And I love you more than I did before
But still it's much too long, to let hurt go you let her go
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
Turning in circles confusion
You were old and hurt
If you need some money now, oh
And they came from the road
They are three together
How can you know it when you don't even try
Take a picture
And yes you're still a fine woman and I cringed
Since life has led us here
She's the sweetest honey pot
Yeah you got the glue
And nothing stops it happening
Can't stand still,
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
Gimme all your love
My dear Brena
But for now let's just pretend that we're gonna get bombed 
Hear it fight, hear it roar
Love me like I'm not made of stone
I watched the beauties, watched the fire
Love is all around
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Keeps itself locked in a suitcase
Have a care, but don't stare
It's not the same as running
You've waited long enough to know
Was it a dream
A good woman will pick you apart
You're only better off in half your life
Does it all make sense now
From offices to farms
And then you kissed me
I make all kinds of money when I go on the stage
I'm walking empty streets
For you sing, "Touch me not, touch me not
I won't be here in another year 
We'll be lost before the dawn
Where have they gone
You left me high
A life left behind she can find in her mind, gone away
And I miss you when you're around
I need you more
A draft from all sides
And one name read that nobody really cared
Now the killer was smiling with nerves made of stone
But it can't cancel out the stars
And nobody cares at all
All we ever got was cold
It seems, for years and years
The quill from a buzzard, blood writes the word
Oh you never felt this lost before
I know I could love you much better than this
I cried 'cause you were doomed
Like I dream of you
Was it something wrong that we did
This may sound bad, and don't take it the wrong way
Just sleeping
There's such a life to go and how much can you show
So I'll take my chances
In hell
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
Drive your car through the rain 
Too drunk 'n' still drinking
Hello, I'm good for nothing, will you love me just the same
She put her fist through the window pane
It's hard, hard when you're here all alone
Cheap flights from Paris to Bangkok, I thought it was nonstop
And the third is when your world splits down the middle
There's nothing more to it,
And you won't even remember this for long
Please beware the quiet front yard
Said he'd been thinking it over
A rape in my eyes, and on your flesh I'll eat
We are the pray
Lift your head
But I didn't hear the ringing bell
And I've look upon it for so many years
Noiselessly across the floor Dancing at the funeral party
And I hope you'll always be
I don't find myself bouncing around
I was locked all day in the summer heat
Led you back
The trouble understand, is she got reasons he don't
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Don't call me home, little sister
Or even hello
And I'm sorry it's this way
I stop and think it over
And the song you sing today
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
From our lives
I wish I had all the money
With a cigarette
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
Everything
You saygo slow
No comparing, secondguessing, no, not this time
No need for reminding
And I try so hard to be
'Cause when I die, then I die loving you
Who walked upon the moon
And it's hard to be a human being
To say goodbye goodbye
Has drained and it's gone
I only fuck wit' queens
I sink into myself
Will I win or lose if I go or if I stay, yeah
And we will lie like river stones, rolling only where it takes us
Take your woman by hand
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
Too much about honesty
And I don't mind sayin' so
Oh God, what have I done
Don't cry for audience
That both my arms were broken 
The dew will settle on our graves
Come back tomorrow"
Something's wrong, I can't let go
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me 
And I'm surprised to hear you say
Always someone's carrying
And you know  yeah, you know
It's a lot of shit, but that's just what the doctor said
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Then I'd know that I am not alone
Whenever I feel
Everything at once the same
'Cause it's all that you left that's mine
We laid in ruins trying to quote your phrase
You're my best friend
It's always incomplete
Those who care too much to see
There to haunt upon my shoulders
Screaming and crying wife
Yes, it struck me that love is sport
Then you passed it to someone new
I told you this that night,
The leaves will fall to feed the ground
All these things are ever lost
Wild flower in starlit heaven
One of these days the sky's gonna break
If I try to touch her
Another friend, the one I love
There's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet
And it's clouded and so is my head
I'll have my brother stop by this Saturday to
Anything to take from your mind
To wring out your bullshit
We've  gotta make it last
Walls are shaking, I hear them sound the alarm
Burnt flavor you hold the big picture so well
We had our knives drawn, they were as sharp as we were in love
As I slowly turn to house dust
And I pray begging to the Northern Star
Our love is a tricky love
And light it up forever
Till then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
When the days all seem the same 
I got to breathe
Oh promises, promises
And a head to match
I had one friend in high school, recently he hung himself with string
In the light, light, light
I cannot let you inside my cell
You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
You abuse the ones who love you
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
When you phone me tell me everything I did
Never had a chance to pause to get a better glance
If only things were black and white
The streets here at home had rapidly filled up
I can write a song 
Man I feel fine
By a black little wind you were blown
We let go of the rest
I will stay, I'll always stay
As I sit here, frozen, alone
So she would not cry as she lay in your lap
Except this one mattered and I felt it had a spirit
The words you're trying to say
This is where it ends
Like blood it covers over me
Say hello, wave goodbye
Everything will be fine
People watching with a cold, blank stare
Well, baby, what can I say
The loveliest words whispered and meant
Longer goodbyes
From your father
You have been left alone
A supple heart
That only cry
Another fight
The love died, but the hate can't fade
Say you love me more than you did before
Wash away all the things you've taken
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
You'll ask your reason why
We're all gonna be in the same place when we die
Breathe the taste of salt water
No one hears me
It seems I'm losing something deep inside of me
I've been up all night drinking
For fear I'll sink the ship and drag us both down
Matt makes his murderous demand
They'll give us something
For the island, for the thrill of it, for everything that mattered
Five am Friday morning
They're mixing with the rain
Had just held out for tomorrow
I pray I get the chance to make it up to you
Friends tell me it's spring
So I was wrong
Get it through your head and walk away
Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes
You're only doing things out of desperation,
It hurt, I'm not a liar
Through Jesusland
No one will ever know
To be washed away slow
It's been a bloody stupid day
I wanna be the boy I was back then
It all comes down on me
Maybe I'm a target for people that are bitter
I thought about it but it only made things worse
And in these walls I feel your sadness wane
Well, I hope that someday, buddy
This is our town
Oh, is it a dream
You threw our love away
We made love on the living room floor
For every fear that can't be named
It hurt as a child, tied down
You're a nightmare beating the dawn
And get yourself dressed instead
Counting all the scars you made
But I've been looking through slow, slow glass
Sunlight unfolds in my hair
Nothin' nice about me almost everyone agrees
Can't go home obviously
The cigarettes taste so good
I damn to hell every second you breathe
Stand by the stairway, you'll see something certain to tell you 
But with this long last rush of air let's speak our vows in starry whisper
You're silently broken
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you
Read my eyes just like a diary
I thanked my sister for keeping my head above the water
The water is rising on a river turning red
Listen, the birds sing
If you wait for me
The sun turns us to stone
The rain comes down like a victory
And tonight will be all I have left to recall
And soon the sea shall give up her dead
Trying to escape this desire
There was love I meant
Yelling and running 
And though all these things will change
Well I never tried to change you, honey I'm your biggest fan
And facing those fears
On your estate of sorrow
Through the night sky yeah
Your voice is dead
And I thought today had been ok
I can't draw a lot of things
You keep me high minded
I'm looking far too skinny
But my mind is made up and I'll never let you in again"
And you come away with a great little story,
So you slide to the floor
And every time it rings it gives me chills
Where have you been, Luv When the mistake we made
I woke up this morning, and played our song
Stay that way for the rest of the day
In Harmony Street, we beat a man just for standing there
Are the things that make you blow Hold your own, know your name
It's not that much fun
And there's kids playing guns in the street
The fallow field that will yield no more
Before the world came, made me colder
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
I wanna stay here 'til we've killed this bitter doubt
It's cold in here there's no one left
All I have left is the only place I've been
And I think what I just wrote is going over my head
"Don't waste your time with politics" he said
But he wanted the sun
You tell me sleeping only makes you tired, anyway
It's hard, hard to run
The boy in the corner
Your sweet and weary head
With the world's most populous drinking areas, you understand
The neighbour kid gets dare to touch the house
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
And where you been to that you no longer remember
And life must go on
Don't go, please don't go
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself
And I know you never meant to make me feel this way
As they wind a watch wrapped on a wrist
Is a wonderful thing
But don't make her drop you off around the block
And I barely recognized her, but I knew exactly what she was thinking of
Like a mother, or a maid bringing you down, down
Three months and I still mmm, oh
I'm not alone, no I'm just on my own
And you are a friend indeed
Lately I just lie awake and hear and dream
I was determined in Chicago
I made a mistake that I never forgot
Would I turn away from you
You'll rise each day as planned, your will is your command
I'm a complicated situation
What do you say we get high
Ah, you see me in the papers, I've been in the magazines
House of cards, you fall hard
And tell you that I landed somewhere
I used to be a lunatic from the gracious days
No one's gone in vain
And everybody here's waiting for the million dollar jackpot
PATRICK magpie, was it you who stole the wedding ring or what other thieving bird would steal such hope away magpie, I am lost among the hinterland, caught among the bracken and the fern and the boys who have no name
Your shining autumn, ocean crashing
The fear of being my father has never disappeared
They've packed up and turned out the lights
Push it to the limit 'cause I just don't care
This is neither the time nor place
For the love no longer here
I'm speeding by the place that I met you
To see what I might spend
But did you ever, ever notice
I made a promise when,
Now as I lie in pieces and wait for your return
That I was the one for you
And let the sunlight in my lap
And don't be so hard on yourself
With fate mooning back at me
Am I coming back 
Are you maybe here to help me hurt myself
Burn his money and his house down
The end's not near
Thinking, why does love leave me so damn cold
And hallelujah to the one in our bones
But do you think I am telling you the truth
I'm in the background 
But no flame burns forever, oh no
Our somersaults through socalled art
That hurts you oh so bad
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
Does he walk around all day at school,
The pigs arrived with tear gas, and I wept at the mistakes we made
Drive me closer to this grave
And if you lost it all
And he'll drive all over town
I've grown tired of holding this pose
I've heard there was a secret chord
I'm still up and driving
You're not going to die any time soon
They will understand one day, one day
What if there was no light
I'll kill myself, from holding my breath
My only sunshine
If the world all falls apart
Don't believe their headlines
To keep looking ahead at your future
It's just you and me on my island of hope
I tell myself a little harmless lie
It's a funny thing that I cannot explain
When all the world was green
If there's still time to turn around
How the girls can turn to ghosts before your eyes
For I know with the first light of dawn I'll be leaving
And I'm getting old
So that I can feel the rain
For you sing
I'm lookin' for a place
We're on the run, I can see it in your eyes
We would stay up all through the night 
I can hear the soft breathing of the girl that I love
Not in the name of love
Know your own name
Just to fool myself, to catch myself, to make it real, real
Like I don't always connect 
People, making fun of me
Don't talk about everyone,
No matter how nasty
Trapped on the terraces, I looked at you and knew
Saying she is lost
Moving through an unknown past Dancing at the funeral party
My life is shit and piss
That we were something fatal, that fell into the wrong hands
Like halfforgotten dreams
This isn't working out for you and me
And I just have to look away
All the sad songs on the radio 
Well, at least the war is over
Scars love me when I fall
I smoke your brand of cigarettes
Is true love just once in a lifetime
We're just a habit like saccharin
Expect me to apologize for things that you've done wrong
But I was swallowed up by doubt
On the way home, this car hears my confessions
Back in the days where the magic exists
Pick up my things, just make sure you're not there
And pulled me from the grass
The world around us disappears
It's not complex, see all of the signs flashing on
So close your eyes and stay away
His note said, "If living is the problem, well that's just baffling"
I only wanna be kind
If you see him say hi
All the days came, made us older
Her window was hung like a painting
Is just another thing that
Busting out the heavens 
Do you do what you did when you did with me
I cannot wait to call you
I'll fall for you again
When the rivers turn to roads
We tried to make it work, you in a cocktail skirt and me in a suit but it just wasn't me
Me together, I remember
The clouds crack and growl like some great cat on the prowl
I'm sorry and I love you
Insides gripped
You know with love come strange currencies
What's inside of me anyway
I need to borrow money
So this is the end of you and me
I have nothing left to fear
For a while I cried and tried not to make a scene
So I will never look for love again 
Everybody screams
It seems these kinds of questions, they come too easy to you now
Over over again like my only prayer
As green to gold and gold to brown
Show me lonely and show me openings
If you call me I won't be home
I've got to get better
Perhaps it shows
Ooh  I'm walking on air
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
Dry your eyes, you poor devil
To tear themselves to bits
I can dance and win at games
I'm so tired of this town
People, this hurt I feel inside
But I swear that I would follow anything
We will not write a new one
I only know because I 
All of these moments are lost in time
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten
Waking light, your profile in shadow
I think of you and everything's okay
Take your hands off me, hey
And the picture frames are facing down
When the longing returns
I'm talkin' in circles
And I will pray
Your eyes have opened but you've got to go on
Give everything to you
I know now I was naive
Clapped under our hands
The fearful always preyed upon your confidence
But among your books, among your clothes
Oh you just look away in the distance
And the years have been good to both of us
He's so cold he will ruin the world tonight
We got a rock and a rock 'til our dying day
And I don't know just who you are
My window show the same
Don't be cautious when I'm cautiously approaching on the other side
I'd separate the waves
This cities just cementaries enhaced
You wished you could change in the lazy summer
Just to sound confused
And I've figured out with all that's said and done
It's like the wind changed your mind
I never said goodbye
What that window door went to
As many petaled kiss I place upon her brow
Me and Jesus a few years back
When the letter says a soldier's coming home
Planets crash into dust
But just as summer's hold is fleeting
All day it is there to remind 
I think I'm coming down
Please don't tell her or anyone but I need to talk to somebody
The windows for sleepin'
You've been left out I'd never do that
That not everything is gonna be the way
It's a complicated situation mama
And does he cry through broken sentences like,
It hardly matters
And all of this will make sense when I get better
I might have loved a king
MARIANNE there's no name for us
On a bathroom floor
I haven't lived life, I haven't lived love
Give me just a chance Give me just a chance
Infinite silence
I won't tell if you lie
Fist tight, banging on the door
Walks alone in most walks in life
To tell you all the things I never said before
And I know the cause
Leave you alone
Where the things I really cared about
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah oohoohoohooh
Maggots put on shirts
And head on my way up there
When it rains
We will also feel the singing, oh
By the window 
Yes, we're back again
I used to have demons in my room at night
Shine on, light of love
Don't say what you're about to say No, no, no, no
Nothing to convey
I think of that day sittin' down at the pier
Say it to my face and say what you know every one says
Nothing I am
Try as I may, it doesn't last
Here is where you'll stay
That we only love the things we own, baby, you're wrong
And brother, don't you know
Covered ground
Floatin' on air
He thinks he's made a grave mistake
They gave her one more day to say the words I couldn't say
Talk to me, show some pity
I can't keep running away
To feel this old
How the time flies, even with the blink of an eye
Funny that how skipping years ahead
If you just give me all your love
It's not just something you take, it's given
And you won't let me sink
Riding horses cloaked in gray
From that job that makes you sleep
For a long time I thought that you'd be coming back to me
Your game is tired
'Cause I'm never gonna love again
Oh was a perfect day
By tomorrow I'll gone
And if the night comes
Three months and I'm still remembering
I'll keep on searchin' for an answer
All along it was a fever
When I sought out a light
Skeleton
I'd discovered something new
Oohhoo, let it rain let it rain
I look up at the stars
I got a million excuses, as to why you died
She lived upstairs from him
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Kneel into the frozen lights
And I wait praying to the Northern Star
We're all taking the same steps
We'll never leave this room
Give me the truth, even if it hurts me
Oh Is this forever, ever Oh, oh
We all deserve something
But you may be offended, and you may be afraid
No I won't say a word
It's just a different point of view
A scream which fills the air
To finally come around
And you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights
Turn around, see me running
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well it's good to hear your voice
As autumn turns its back on me again
No one lifts their hands
I know we need to talk
Comes rising up sometimes
Even though it hurts, even though it scars
Why are we so alone
She thought it would be fun to try photography
Came in through the back door at the start of the show
Our children will always hear
Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart
Yes, I'll leave you without a word
Get it stuck there in your head
Well, you're back in your old neighborhood
I wanna lie here 'til we've killed this bitter doubt
I've committed a crime, I've broken the law
Day in, day out, my tearstained face
Goddamn we
Remember when you were my boat and I was your sea
There all asking me to dance and sing
Of the woman that loves you
When it ends alright
You ride with both hands
Can save me from this darkness
And I can't get you off my mind
You are changing
It could bend or it could break
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
I've been lonely too, like you
When I awake, I'll see your light
Or slumped over in a vacant room
The land disappears
When we must go our separate ways
Sappy love songs on the radio 
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Take heart, my little friend
Every moment that will get you by
But you're caught in my head like a thorn on a vine,
Carrying a box through the rain
In each others' arms
Lift your hair while they change the hospital sheets
Adding scars to my heart
Baby, I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for a higher ground
Is it a kind of dream
Tell me it's nothing
Bright eyes
I'm fine right where I am
Isn't fair
You said, always and forever, is such a long and lonely time
There's no one home
I see, see shadows
Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams, he worries
Oh nobody knows me
Twisting in my head
Things that are supposed to mean lots
I know what you did to me
You fucked up my life 
You haunt me with your violent heartbeat
Throw your pain in the river
Well I always say, it would be good to go away
To face your mother
But you can always come around
I sure could use the rest
There's going to come a day when you feel better
Well I was stabbed and bleeding
But the song's gone on too long
We were running
Oh I, I'm alone tonight babe
Let the Universe call the bluff
We sat and watched the sun go down
Are the things that make you blow
But that was back when we could talk about anything
Stands alone in most walks of life
I know that there's others that deserve you hey yeah, hey yeah
Yeah, we are far less than we knew
Haven't you seen me sleepwalking
She lay in bed all night watching the colours change
When all the world is green
The ones I dream float like leaves
I picked myself back up
Is a hope that somehow you, you
Alone or with our wives
And will we ever end up together
I know this room, I've walked this floor
Thinking of blue thunder
And I'll stay here if you prefer
As the day turns to night
Looking down a cliff it isn't fun it's communicating fear
That I don't know how to let you go
And you're off with barely a sigh
You're only sleeping
Smile, all that you can feel
There's a fortune inside your head
Wonder years passed me by
And it's cold
One that wanted the floor
I push it to the limit 'cause I just don't care
Only a month we've been apart
King Saul fell on his sword when it all went wrong
Awaiting a word
And let's love loud
I can't change my name
Clean out the reds in my eyes to get by security lines
I remember high school; man I hated high school
And men do foolish things
You'd think I'd ought to be used to that by now
Me and a gun
Thought I'd make friends with time
The young must be our sacrifice
And I think that I know the bitter dismay
When I was , I grew accustomed to more fear
It's hard for me to say you were my soul
And you say "Take this,
Please try to never grow up
Give me just a chance
All that I feel for or trust in or love
It's like love
If you touch me you could never go back
When the hunger descends
We won't have to be, we won't have to be scared
Can someone take me away to a better place
You've kept your word
We meet at the lights, I stare for a while
Go beside you
In starlight, you came from the other side
They smiled patiently with disbelief
It's just a lyrical lie
And a day off and a bruised road
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And all around
The last day of summer
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
Sense of joy fills the air
I put my thoughts in a letter, send it when I'm feeling strong
I couldn't get up for my shift today
My friends have changed, a few did last
Will they breathe our air again
Worried about everyone but me
I've got a burning desire
Feeling like the wind from the sea
No heaven couldn't wait for you
And we wait above a road
We're not the same, I wish that could change
What's going on in her life
Turn my head and I can see you
I'll be back again
In the wind and the rain now, darling
And all is said and done
The wind will soon blow it all away Yeah 
How their eyes seemed to follow you
Living with me's like keeping a fool
But there's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
Our hearts are as dark as the rain
A tape full of messages for anyone who cares
And all of the things he was so scared of 
You left with her
And love can really tear you up and it can break you down
They're crooked love thieves
'Cause nothing's going right
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
I'm trying to listen to your words
Another one in the basket
To the heavens again
I'll stay with you
Push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care
Like backgammon and Life
But the cold light of day
Quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer
Until I come again
Now I'm drunk and wearing flipflops on Fifth Avenue
Tried too hard and I always lay
'Cause I lost my only friend
It's just the way I feel
'Til your singing eyes and fingers
I wanna hold you but my hands are tied
In its mouth where the tongue was torn
To say what I want changed
Tell me this is just a dream
How do you love someone
Hold my hand
You raped, I feel dirty
Some things you do for money and some you do for love, love, love
Don't blame your daughter
It finally dawned on me tonight
I see things change
You come to follow you around
You hear them say with smiles meant to cry
And who's to say it wouldn't have
I wish that I was stronger
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
My arms are open wide
She lost both of her babies in the second great war
I'm alone and I feel empty
Everyone I used to know
You lie for what you're worth
I've got to get better Caramel
From the flower bed
For you, your friends
Try not to look too scummy
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
And I keep drinking the ink from my pen
Twelve days gone by, since I have saw you last
I love you more than I did before
Before my heart grew cold
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you"
I'm so wasted on you x
And I cut my bleedin' heart out every night
Could put right what I got wrong
The tracks of a train's arm
There's something in the water
And there were rows of ripe tomatoes, where a secret was concealed
Go on wasting my time
As your own children are lowered in the ground, 
Oh, how could anyone not want to try and help you
I dream all day that they would get me far
Gimme all you got, baby
What you hope is love
Why don't you talk to me for just a little while
And you want to be dressed in poetry
The hardest, it made me the strongest
And you just walk away
If you could stay like that
Romantic tales of distant years
No one ever takes the garbage out
Maybe two is better than one
And our poor friend, Jim
If you touch me you can never go back
Stop before you fall
Make me a day, make me whole again
And I shot the stork because I didn't hear it that way
It's crystal clear
The heaviest weight, the clumsiest shape
As the city sleeps tonight
And I saw your face in everyone I swear
You owe me something still
I've broken every bone
Everything we'll be okay 
This is why hell is underground
It scattered easy in her hand
I'll always hang
Baby, think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
In the light
Don't leave the light on baby
A old man gave me a tip he said
Though I have a broken heart
But each day I'd see your face
The world's gonna end
Flax seeds, well they tear me open
It's the tattooed broken promise
If you're shocked it's just the fault
You left the thing stinking
Dans le bleu de toute l'immensite
And does he notice my feelings for him
And you know what mommy
That they have told to you Not one word was true
Saturated loneliness
There's a high wind in the trees
Everyday I feel the same
I think of you from time to time
These blue valentines
I feel, feel let down
I beat yo ass, you better not run to your father
They who wish to hurt you
And I wish I could feel it, abduct it, corrupt it
I'm not trying to find a way to get in your bed
You've been on my mind
'Cause this life is anything but certain
I believe it's just because
And you lost it
And they just dive right in
Certain things turn ugly when you think too hard
Father, can we start over
She thought it was an answer to the fashion blues
Never got to begin
It's hard, hard not to sit on your hands
Yeah I've been looking though slow, slow glass
All the angels kneeling to the Northern Lights
You're still all that matters to me
He says that behind my eyes I'm hiding
My dad moved out about that year or so
Sank into the dark
I need to rest in arms
When someone has broken your heart it changes how you feel
Looking right through the lens
Or what the wind says when she cries
Drive your car through the rain
Feeling how it turns
Goddamn you
But I'm not yours and you're not mine
My time will come, yours too
Now love is a game
All the sadness, all the rage
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
But if you want to I will try
Let love take away all this pain
Bury them away in the earth
Oh, how could anyone not love the terrible things you do
He's so cold raining on the world tonight
'Cause after a while and a thousand miles
We stand to fight for nothing
Time is tapping on my forehead
Fake a smile, yeah, lie and say that,
For those dying days
Where nobody leads at all
Now, that's not fair
I almost forgot myself again
It hurt as a child, tied down 
She said, "I'm surprised you noticed
Three months and I'm still standing here
Will you ever return
But don't blame your daughter
In every sky, in every kiss
I'll turn the TV to the bed 
I fell in love with you
Oh I miss you now, my love
Drag our secrets to the sea
Oh no, I see a darkness
It's left me feeling tired and exposed
When I used to be someone
What if you dream of somebody new
"Here is where you rest"
A scientist who'd tell the world
Is Staring at your shoulders
Somewhere you can't make it home
I had a premonition a movie in my mind
And I wish it was something more than this
And you hold the key
Healing waters to be
And no of course we can't be friends
And I can make you promises
That's right I'd die here
In time to haze their eyes
I've got to get rid of this hole inside
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
Stand there and look into my eyes
Not once did I think that
Into another space
And he wasn't like them
And take a look in my face, for the last time
'Cause in my mind, I need it,
The war is over
So many faces, I don't know the names
And glows in the dark
And you love a stone
Open your eyes with waking light
The grey ceiling on the earth
Give me the truth
Where everything we say and do
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And Joseph's brothers sold him down the river for a song
Can I coax it out its shell
And how the grace with which she walked into your life
I'm hiding from the kingdom come
Believing all that shit is gonna heal your soul
'Cause I don't care no more, no
You've got to you gotta say you will
The funeral had begun
They just know what is what Young Money
I know I could have loved you
There's a lot of things that need to be done
When the wolf comes home
I write on paper erased away
Having never ever planned to fall in love, Luv, Luv
They are one person
And I've got my new red fetching leather jacket
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers
Frozen kiss by the fountain
I will stay, I will stay
I always knew
And I cry and no one can hear
I only know because I
Oh, there's nothing more to it
Oh what's the fucking point at all
And I just keep losing myself
Through variations of hell
My tears I refuse to explain
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
And I kissed a girl with a broken jaw
But I fell for the promise of a life with a purpose
Little child, lookin' so sweet
Does it mean that I can never change my ways
And we are beginning
Three months and its still hard enough
Baby can you hear my heart cry tonight
It's all over but the crying
I see you in Citylight diner
All we ever wanted was everything
No matter how many times I tell myself
When the world is hers and she held your eyes
How can I expect anyone else to give a shit
She was easy on the eyes
I'm listening, but there's no sound
Little child, lookin' so pretty
I held my breath as I watched you swing, then run your fingers through your hair
If your thoughts should turn to death
And no one in turn ever spoke to him
But everyone she knew thought she was beautiful
You've raped, I feel dirty
Praying to the wound that swallows
Yesterday when we were walking
I wonder about your skin tone and shape of your nose
Someone worth walking on when you ask me to go
Where are you tonight
Dependin' on how I feel
Instrumental
Go wherever you need to go
Not while I still feel like this
Here or the next life
I'd put a knife right into his eyes
I'll pretend I'm okay with it all
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
And all of the days
Oh, let it rain
I beat yo ass, keep talkin' back
'Cause baby I didn't
I shall believe
Oh lord give me magic
He's so cold he will win the world tonight
This world is full
Last night I told a stranger all about you
I only say that word for you
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me
'Cause there's no more trying to make this so right
Only to trip at the sound of goodbye
I'd be luckier to walk around
To go our separate ways
In the name of love
I feel so low from living high
Better not hear you got caught up
I might have been a singer
A nice little housewife, who'll give me a steady life and not keep going off the rails,
Hush, you color my eyes red
And all the things they took from you again
Hold your own
I can't seem to breathe
Can you forgive me somehow
Together as one
We haven't seen the sun for weeks
And you are Caramel
Giving voice to the flame
Amen
And look out the window
To be free of all the pain
Sing for the soccer team, sing for the janjaweed, sing 
I feel I know you
She said, "I'm off in an hour, and I know where we can go"
The hearts of all lovers
Has finally turned gray
We gave you everything
I'll be back again
But these people they just
Why did I leave
She washes her hands
Half human, half machine
'Cause when I die then I die loving you
You will always
Know your name
She lay in bed all night watching the morning change
She said, "No one is alone the way you are alone"
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer
All we fight for
And people are being real crazy
It hits you so hard
You think you might just crawl back in bed
In the dark of the night I found
Don't touch me this way
The words they use so lightly, I only feel for you you come swimming into view
Beautiful lights, the starfilled nights
Don't say what you're about to say
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And cold here
With no music playing
Down on this floor
Up at the tree and I see
You're the cause of all my trouble and pain
If you want some money
Well, I'm as puzzled as the newborn child
I just let it fade away
I'll return and fill that space in your heart
What once was yours is mine
Those kind of thoughts can be so cruel
And the bath water's cold
The smallest dreams got pushed aside
Slow glass
There's nothing like a sunset"
How can you know it if you don't even try
In right or wrong good or bad you said
Now it just feels weird that there you are
To sit at your table
The fevers the heartaches
You always said we'd still be friends, someday
We might as well be apart
You've got nothing to regret
Can't touch this
Then there's no one there
'Cause when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down
It's a love you'd kill for
Marie you are the wild blue sky
Pretend you don't know me so well
An oversensitive guy that he's lost and alone, yeah 
I guess we both know we're in over our heads
We'll talk it over after I've had some time
I've never been anywhere cold as you
And tell the man in the black cloak
And memories we've saved,
So don't send me letters
The dark was filled with dread
If living is seeing
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, 'cause I don't know who you are
No footsteps on the ground
Fulfillment to their lack of strength at your expense,
So there won't be far to fall
I only ever told you one lie
You know that it all takes my breath away
Thats why I change my name
And since you are my friend
So was never known on which they choked
One last kiss, one only, then I let you go
All that is gone
Made up in my mind
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you Hey yeah, hey yeah
Not something she'd ever tell
As the fox lay sleeping beneath her kitchen floor
In the city where I'm from
It starts up in our bedroom after the war
If it's just another cheap line flung
There are things I could've told you
And your body on my mattress is proof
You keep saying the past is not dead
Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
And I came home to the love you gave
A place that now belongs to you
God bless them handsome men
And choking on hello
Well, I ran from him in all kinds of ways
I said I'm sorry, but what for
But when it's am he wonders where in the hell she went
Waiting to hold you
And they walked on the dirt
Without holding back my mind
There'll always be a few things, maybe several things
Dear Bradentown
Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away
Wind has burned your skin
When you start to raise your head
I remember what you wore on the first day
In your search to find
And maybe two is better than one
And claim that you've done all you can all along
And I was certain that the season
Pressed against the window pane
Would all go into tryin'
To see a whole new life
And breathing is a foreign task
Lamenting policewomen, policemen
Our gilded age may come and go
I wanna feel the way I did back then
Together or apart
I'm gonna see you every time I turn my back
Are you thinking 'bout you or us
I can't live this life
Break all of their wings and make sure that it crashes
Should we go Would we die
Across the sea
I won't lie and tell you it's alright
When they pushed you around
I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight for you
You're crying all these tears but they mean to leave you dry
Have yet to see a soul
I know, somehow
You looked like you'd been softened, like you never really loved the pain
Take whatever you need to take
And how could anyone
Envy your lover
I won't be your winter I won't
This is everyone
It's going to take you people years to recover from all of the damage
A place for me in your heart
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
Taste these teeth please
So let's love fully
My newfound life made all of me magnified
I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk
I don't want to hate myself, don't want to hurt you
And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
She said he was a most peculiar man
Lights upon your eye
Of faulty manufacturing
All of the reasons
But I know, I know that's just a sky
I'm doing everything
Another right
And tell me that all we had were lies
Such a lonely world
I've seen all kinds of strangers
You think it ought to be
And knocking me down on it's weight
Warm light when your eyes
The whole wide world is mine
Rise up from graves near cemeteries
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
Breathing the smoke of the train
Always
And we're all gonna be, yeah
'Cause girl you're love is still on my brain
I need a little time, can we even up the score
You know, I would not hesitate
A million miles between us
You're drowsy without a care
Thicker than pigshit
The sky's not blue and the field's not green green
So I'm always pacing around or walking away
For the poor tortured souls
So many questions, I need an answer
As she gets up from the floor
Fuck, I'll pay you anything
Love is, love is, love is, love is, love is
And every morning that I wake
Behind where the old Thames does flow
'Cause I heard you say
They barely notice 
Because there's no more trying to make this so right
Go back outside, I beat yo ass, lil nigga
That you'll read if you're so inclined
Pretend that you owe me nothing
Singing But I pulled you and I called you here Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Oh, why is everything so confusing
If I had her back, I'd be as real as my age
You were there for summer dreaming
Lord I have a broken heart
A star's a star
There was always someone carrying
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job
Without you here the seasons pass me by
Why the sky is blue
And I can see everything
All my friends keep asking why I'm not around
Dead things
We had a beautiful magic love there
That I have died, died, died, died, died, died
You tell me summer's here and the time is wrong
Did I dream you dreamed about me
Still you will and love me
Until we vomited blood
Won't have a soul for to wake up and hold you
Cut your hair like Joan of Arc
The boatswain calls upon the quay
I was so completely yours
Maybe there's a God above, all I ever learned from love
Can't you see that we're going to hell
Number to come up man, and you know
All lines have broken and we need you to hold on
But waking up is harder when you wanna die
Yet I know as I gaze at my young love beside me
I think I could last at least a week without someone to hold me 
Never thought that I could be, I could be
Say it will be alright
But ain't nobody need you like I do hey yeah, hey yeah
Do you want me back
I cursed the road
For the slow fade of love
You left behind some clothes
I can feel you there
My girl has found another and gone away
All the seeds in our garden fight
To anything
Our hell ends every weekend
My body aches, it heaves, it shakes
And in time you will remind me
Three months and I'm still breathing
Dianna, Dianna, Dianna, I would die for you
What it means to care about the things you wanna do
She tied you to a kitchen chair
For all the ones who've left
Take me somewhere new
Town to town
A place for me
My suicidal dream
Ask questions to myself about the things I'll never know
Along the walk
Said my love was never coming home
But I wish it would rain
Factorytown
I feel the world is tumbling
And there ain't no place for
On a lonely highway, how can we
Don't ever let me say
If you knew I was dying would it change you
I'm your son
But I was almost honest
And set up my holy holy still
Drinking coffee and reading lies
And she combed your hair and she kissed your teeth
How good it feels seeing you today
I know you're gotta God shaped hole
The face forgives the mirror
Don't hurt me this way
I'll remember where the love was found
I'm in pain
If only night can hold you where I can see you, my love
And I do believe
Did you hear about my friend
And disappeared in front of my eyes
So misunderstood
But darling dear get a grip
I would be your only dream
Life seems so obscene
When she turned him away to remember some knave
Please say you'll be waiting
He rode his bike like the devil until the day he died
Then life ain't worth the drown
You're in the car on the way to the movies
Keep pulling me close to home
I got beaucoup payments to make
I keep feeling the lights
I lost myself again
Dreamin' about my death, dream
And we won't have to be scared
And no reason or rhyme
One that's void of all discretion, such an awful tearing sound
But I hope that you're laughing now
Why am I holding my breath
The tears are coming down
Only nightmares take me in
With fists that are ready for more
Please don't let me make
Hey, you can tell the world
Said he's had a change of heart
It hits me so hard
It's working, 'cause you know
Watch me fly away
So they cut it down to 
Yeah, you hit me really hard
Terrifies me still
Shies from the sorrow
And you're out singing songs
And you'll sing to yourself the rising, falling melody
I come home on my own
'Cause I'm never gonna love a new
Thinking how blue it looks
Has held me back 
And the waves break
When all's gone and can't be regained
I said we're all gonna be, yeah
An eye on all my horses you've slept with all my men
Why I wasn't meant for you
Twilight
By tomorrow I'll be leaving
Up heaven's stairway to gold
But it's all I have to believe in
Tell me all about your men
I've seen the flash of teeth
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
And can you tell me was it worth it
We've got a lot of catching up to do
Well, for nine days
A broken heart that the world had forgot
My racin' heart
As you start to crawl
But everyday it never comes
Like he would his own son
One of these days the mountains are 
Across the room
Took me so many miles and they never wore out
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
Or maybe I'm a kite that's flying high and random
You're the one that I hold on to
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
The world is full of diamonds
And even know your friends tell me you're doing fine
Kneeling to the frozen lights
Some animal lies in the pasture
And been the one to end a war
Boat drinks for captains
Ever since we founded Rome
Toast one last puff
Round and round, round and round again
With nothing left
You fuckin' bitch, I hate you
We all fall down
Too many times I've planned 
I would've said something like 'Hey dude I could buy and sell this place 
Without finding closure, You take them back,
Watch my head about it
That circus tiger's gonna break your heart
But I still wonder why
This pain is my heart oh oh oh
And in a story told, she was a little girl in a redrouge, sunbruised field
Quem e mais sentimental que eu
In some other time a thousand miles away
You come in on your own
Every moment marked
I'll drive so far away
I hate our favorite restaurant, our favorite movie, our favorite show,
Scared to be alone
The fortune inside your head
There's pink flamingos living in the mall
Not while I'm still so obsessed
Oh babe, I've never been so lost
Rest assured my angels
It's hitting me hard
Should I thank you for that dear
And there's no way around it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
E'rey day feel like my birthday
And you saygo slow
And I'm thinking ooh I can't live without you
Tomorrow has to wait
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Catch me if I fall
I'm wasted
What they say 'bout me reveal
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
I am the entertainer and I've had to pay my price
Each time I say something I regret
Before I took my last breath
Lately got to thinking that
Scared to go back to Section  with my mama stressin'
We have no future
And look at me without you 
A timeless word, the meanings changed
Feel their hearts they're cold as ice
She was tired of sleeping
It's true what they say when you throw it away
Could be held between my arms
I'm shy and turn my head away
But I will pay you before I die
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody,
My shoes took me down a crooked path
Honest when you're tellin' a lie
Everybody seems so far away from me
To live today, so why not smile
And your lack of shame comes naturally
Their minds are on trial
Some hair from a horse
You know I was just a stranger
And never go to sleep
Nothing's ever left you scarred
If I loved you, well that's my fault
The painful realization that all has gone wrong
Wave goodbye
A lover would just complicate my plans 
But I believe in divinity
See me age nineteen with some dumb haircut from 
As we dance through the dark
Anyone who'll throw an arm around you, yeah
When you're gone
Blueeyed charmer
A short delay, the parrot blues
So come on, I'm thinking about history
He was waitin' for the bus in his army green
Are the details in the fabric Hold your own, know your name
Memories of children's dreams lie lifeless, fading, lifeless
And so I ask where are you now
Unabridged for so many years
If you stay baby, stay with me
As some will say
Well hey little girl you will always make up so take off that unbecoming frown,
I don't want noone else
Hanging round the bars at night, wishing I had never been born
You'd think after  years I'd be used to the spin
Gracefully unnamed and feeling guilty for the luck
But I've been living on the crumbs of your love
And quickly look away
 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
When this is the one and only love I've ever known
Come and lift me from this place
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Although I've stopped too
You're looking at a picture of me
And roads can't hold us down
I watch the stars crash in the sea
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
And did you know how much I love you
But found no joy in what was sung,
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
Alone, alone, alone
All the things we've written in it
So, I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
I remember pleated skirts, black and white sattle shoes
I'm taking matters into my own hands 
Darkness always turns into the dawn
A sleepy kisser, a pretty war
She got darling hazel eyes
And everything will be fine
It's not so hard to make that sound
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
It feels like tragedy's at hand
EightySix Charlie, he came back, he came back
And what I said was never said
My fists are turning coal to diamonds
Give me the truthx
To keep me warm at night
No, I'm not okay, but I guess I'm doin' fine
There were birds all around me
MARIANNE and still we sing little boy, little boy, lost and blue, listen now, let me tell you what to do you can run on, run along, alone or home between the knees of her; all among her bracken and her ferns and the boy will have a name
The things you think at times like these
Too amorous light we call out
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
That I need you
Times told
Makes me laugh a bit
She tries hard not to cry
Although we can't jitterbug as we did then
I said, "Darling, I'll give you everything I got
PATRICK six for gold
"You can't plan on the heart"
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Day is gone on a landslide areeling
A beautiful magic love there
Painting rings around your eyes, these peppered holes so filled with crying
Babe, I better rewind
And rip your own child
It's me and the moon she says
Raise a glass and tell some lies
And no poem or song
And this life's getting old
And they came to the river
The slow fade of love"
But I'm still burning in your flames,
You're so sorry about it all
It isn't any fun
Or a car to take me anywhere
There's nothing lovelier, girl
The small of your back, nape of your neck
I'm still frustrated from last night
Said he's finally made up his mind
Fill with laughter
Lord I have a broken dream
In every city, memories would whisper,
And pull the smiles inside
Did they paint your face that pasty white
O my heart shies from the sorrow
And Sonny Liston rubbed some tiger balm into his glove
Some animal sips where the river flows
Give me just a chance
'Cause the weak will
In such a lonely world
I spent all my money on whisky and beer
It's gonna be all right
But I can blame them, I'd sing her this"
'Cause its all smiles and business these days
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When winter sets in
Why aren't you here with me tonight
Listen, I gotta cry
Locked inside
And we called it a home
Just say it to me
And I'm wasted all the time
"I met a woman once, I gave her my best shot
Beautiful McMansions on a hill
Seek the weaker till they've broken them
And I breathe, I breathe no more
All of the seasons
That I should stare at 
God forgive my sins
If women and men would come to follow
And all was alive
Fred Jones was worn out
The policeman
The waiting's everything you know
And I, I could try
I know to you it might sound strange
And your friends on the road
Ah that's not the way that friends behave
Christened in blood
And left me behind
As we were talking outside it was cold
Well, I drug your ghost across the country
Could you see its opposition
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
Flowing right in with the dawn
I remember those simple things
Desire, despair, desire
And my face gets sick
And everything gone
To long too far from home
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
To drown my sorrow down
I should know better than anyone ever could
They're insisting that our love
Could be your biggest mistake
When there's nothing more to say
I'm thinking of what you said
My eyes wouldn't open, cemented to her face
Like every single wish we ever made
And the world's got me dizzy again
And you're thinking about the things you do
It was a kind of soso love and I'm gonna make sure it doesn't happen again
We'll raise an empire from the bottom of the sea
She's the only thing I trust
Have to touch myself to pretend you're there
I dreamt of a fever,
He said, if you dare come a little closer
It must have been the season that threw us out of line
And I wish it was something
I won't make a sound so you don't wake
So I'm gonna give my heart to you
I do the things we did before
And the very dreams that led to them
Behind our backs when mom would stay up late
From winter brings the spring again
So nothing sounds quite right
Working late in diner Citylight
I've played all kinds of palaces and laid all kinds of girls
Before you know it's come and gone
And I'm shouldering the blame
'Cause when I die then I die loving you,
You were perfect babe
I know you regret it, love
I'm as puzzled as the newborn child
My life will not be lost
The one thing you wish I'd forget
And we laughed them all
The party's just begun
And I'm starving now
Scooping up the soul of the wine
Now your back's to the road
I'm with you, I'm with you, yeah yeah
From your skin I am born again
There's something there that you can't find
She stared for hours
I've never cared
Here it comes, it's all blown in tonight
But I denied in my capacity to love
We was dancing the hora
But life is long, my love has gone away from me
A man said, "Folks, would you bow your heads
Sucked into a black balloon
This is how our story ends
I guess I always knew the score
But oh babe, I really wish you would not cry
'Cause my heart would stop without you
We were made to never fall away
He swung out over the crowd, I heard the hangman said
Than to bank on shit and dismay
When the truth was like swallowing sand
How many times have you told me you wanna die
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
Motherfucker, I fuckin' hate you, fuck you
And what comes out is a horrible mess
I'm letting you go
I'll find a yellow flower and I will lace it in her hair
I need you now like I needed you then
Oh remember, please remember oh
Running on empty, so out of gas
With the satellites and the roving drones
Haven't you noticed me drifting
'Cause soon enough we'll die
I don't think that you'll be back
The stories too dull to unfold
Some devil is stuck inside me
However, you might feel
I carry your image always in my head,
We've been having troubles you know 
She had eyes bright enough to burn me;
And tears you up, to start again
Oh yeah, let it rain
 you opened my blue eyes,
So here I go with all my thoughts I've been saving
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
But there's going to be a party
Another one in the basket Ananother one, ananother one
Voices telling me what to do
And he said, "Would you mind sittin' down for a while
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
And I must be one
So I say
But what do you say we go for a ride
As the belltower blocks the sunlight
To his silent world and his tiny room
Long after night has come to claim
That's just sentimental
For me it's just a pain in the ass
My dad would ask me about my grades
In sheets of shining memory
She's praying to Jesus
You tell me that you haven't slept in days
No one sees you here, roots are all covered
Love would stay till I come back
And I won't be here in another year
Mirror mirror, who's the fairest bitch in all the land
What if I fall further than you
You'll ask your reasons why
That organ's playing my song
There is a town
I won't let nobody hurt you
That sleepy person lying next to you
When the accusations fly, hold tight
I went and looked her in the eyes
I know some have fallen
I can see how you are beautiful
With the whitest of snow
And there's nothing there to ease this aching
But you're going on nonetheless
When you come swimming into view
But the things you do for love are going to come back to you one by one
Within a room, within himself
And now you're just a ghost
Think we both ought to put 'em on hold and I know you agree
Oh, you haunt me with your violent heartbeat at night
It feels like nothing really matters anymore
You'll get a glimpse of the truth
To make these nightmares go away
From the sound
I'm standing at the back
It was not about me
You're right next to me, I think that you can hear me
Carry you around, in the background
I missed my time, I don't think I could stand
Seeing more and feeling less
On all these bruises and scars
Icing sugar dust crazy green flashes
We're eight feet deep and the rain is still coming down 
And if I could have just one wish
The blinded eyes that see
'Cause baby two is better than one
But I wept with your movements
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
You told me you don't love me
Sayin' let me walk away, please
You fucked, I'm sick of it
But I know one day it's gonna happen
But I can't catch my thoughts
Well what about the man that I saw handcuffed in the emergency room 
And he'll take our daughter with him, she wants to go with him anyway
Like a white light scatters
Of the woman that loves you, loves you
It's the last laugh of the laughter
And that would have worked on me yesterday
On the last day of the year
'Cause I just can't think anymore about that
Laura are you still living there
Prayed for snow a long time
Courage my boy, when you look them in the eye
It's gone berserk
Will they see the sky again
Why Samson loved Delilah
You're used to wearing less, and now your life's a mess, so insecure you see
And everything will escape and I'll know
For Jesusland
And if today I don't see your face
Succumb to the line
I vow to come for you
Hotel rooms my only friend and friends like that just don't add up
I close my eyes to conjure up something
My old man plays the trombone
And you know I have a drive
You make me somebody
Now I dine alone in our old seats
But I still love her so
When you drive home to your place
The time that you danced with me
Wearing the same dress she wore yesterday
And falling in your eyes
I see that you get home alright
Bastard headmaster
You lined me up
Is this just a life preserve or a bivouac tenure
She stands hard as a stone
And, I will take a step away, and, see if you come back
The other woman finds time to manicure her nails
If I had a chance for another try
So I'll just change direction
But someone stole my record player
No, it's just more lockjawed popstars
"The life that you thought through is gone"
And pray that you might give me a call
I risked it all against the sea
When I call on the telephone
'Cause I just want to hold you tight
Where my words would allow me
A lifetime of questions
Always someone's carrying Cathy
We drunk dialed
So pay to ride the ferris wheel
No drama, no time for games
Oh sister, come for me
Proud to have been a step up on your way
Oh, the bed ain't made
With useless space
Innocent child, lookin' so sweet
You've told me so many times
My my blue thunder
My eyes are glued to the floor
Sing for the cameras, sing for the animals, sing 
Something has died
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
And I'd love to say I do
Nothing is harder than to wake up all alone
No one's so sure if her crime had a reason
That you don't want me there by your side
I'm in the background
Act like there's nothing wrong
One willing fool
Running round this house
Flashback to warm nights
Back in the day it just went without saying at all 
We can bring back the old days again
That I could look straight in the eye
Are there really ones like these
Oh, I told you all along there was no point looking to me
And it was so, so hard to do
When the stars all look the same 
Your autograph's worthless
You said, always and forever
Guess it was his turn this time
Love me when it storms, love me when I fall
Everyone knows it
Yeah you hit me really hard
Because if I can't learn to make myself feel better
Ruined my mind like a snake in the orchard
White shores are calling
I only want my mind to be clear
We didn't even bother to stay
I can't compete with all your damn ideas
I wake up lonely
Night is gone, long way turning
I don't know who you are
Five minutes before I died I'd be filled with such regret
With the mind of a man in the middle
Never gonna love again, no not I
Let the water come
Do you want me back 
'Cause I'm scared
Funny how those compliments can 
I am giving up on greener grasses
And two last regrets
I feel like a kid again
But in a moment you'll feel no pain
I'll be lost when you're gone
I used to be the bright one
What if there's always cups in the sink
We talked till we cried
No hesitation,
When the spotlight drifts away
To this gray town
There's a few that stayed
Before you roll those dice
Giving up what seems your lifetime
Dancing on the moon
I think of all the men I, I could've kissed
And haunts the smallest children's sleep upon the floor
And then I'd ask about the girls he'd date
And I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me die
Laura you were the saddest song
But her dreams give her wings
I do, I still think of you when we dance,
Accumulated  times over throughout the years
Throw it on the fire
And infinite silence
With no ride to work
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
Your hands were on my hips, your name was on my lips
Is anybody here I know
Be whatever you want to be
I was such a fool
The wind's a cheating wife
I stop
I am the first one I deceive
All know his sins
All the eunuchs, they were standing in rows, singing
But at least the war is over
And I said do you believe we are fundamentally judgemental
You hold me down
And smiling in my dreams The storm is coming, can you see
I keep getting snubbed
In a world that she can't rise above
My broken life will never stay
We'll sing love songs about heartbreak and grief
Tell him I am not at home
And I breathe, I breathe
To break and blossom all to be adored
The winter here's cold, and bitter
If love can move a mountain
Saying, "Yo, have you ever said a pretty word"
I beat yo ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
Cursed with a love that you can't express,
And the fire burn the beauty in their eyes
And the pain in the river
But you still carry on
Go home
On the same greasy street
And then I saw your face
So the sleeping children were awoke
And I just wish I was back home
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
Hoping you are doing the same
And I am a butterfly
But I am gone, I am not there
Give me all your love now
But I'm missing way too much
The sun and the moon, an ocean of air,
Makes any boy feel as pretty as princes
Santificado sea tu Nombre
And you said yes I said I don't believe in revenge 
All of the reasons why
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
I know you will forgive me for my honesty
So I've learned to dance with a hand in my pants
And when it all seems like a mistake
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
I'm lonely here tonight
In this weather, the wind outside is biting
As I pass out into a dream
A line above the step beneath
Two players in a puppet show
With a bucket bare and dry
And you'd never sleep away
Well, I've been running from something
Its alright
Don't worry, but I won't be able to write for a while"
To you everything's funny
Everything's reminding me of you
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
Nothing's real until you let go completely
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
You wake with a start from a dream and know that I am gone
You hit the drink, you take a toke
A whisperweight upon the tattered down where you and I were lying
I accept that some things will never change
And Laura's asleep in my bed
Can poison your voice
And cut me at the surface
The things we've written in it
My friends all say they're worried
That I know I was happier with you
Sing for the kid with the phone who refuses to sing 
I am not going back
It's only everything standing in front of me
I just want you to be true to me one time
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
Nothing much Friday night
Our sidestepping has come to be a brilliant dance
In the window when I ride for Chicago
And you'd love most to be told
And I can't see clearly right now
Until you wash off the buzz
The same eyes
And did you say that she loved you
Be sure before you close that door
And you'll be here in my arms
Alone
Whooping cranes and woodland beings
Refuse to fall
Proud to be a part of your illustrious career
And I want you to stay
Her cat was clawing the floorboards just outside of our door,
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
At the center of the world
Winds will move us around
Here's a good one
I was hoping I was hoping we could crack each other up
I'll kill myself, I'll put my head in a noose
Reflections of me in your eyes
And we walked through this land
There was a time you let me know
I love my hands but it hurts to pray
Well I made amends
No, I can't feel a thing at all
You can't say I do nothing
There was something trembling in her voice
The wind will soon blow it all away Yeah, oh yeah 
You used to wear in your hair
Did they make you stay up all night
And the seasons of lies still like reasons are flowing, away
And all of the grief we never even knew
Here in the nightstand drawer
For no reason but jealousy
Brush the dust off
But in their arms you feel so alive
Miasma sky
If you want to tell me something
Don't touch me
'Cause it's not my fault
But I feel heavy, like floating, at the bottom of the sea
Leaving your town again
And stay with you in your steps
I will grow through this pain
That should be me, holdin' your hand
Like a cigarette
Sitting on the windowsill near the flowers
And I, it's a little cold outside
Tarot cards
All makes sense now
Well, I wish there was someone to love me
I will pay you before I die
There must be something here
Their breath is as sweet as
But if things don't work out like we think
Hand in hand with fear and shadows, crying at the funeral party
Was I just a fool
Drain the veins in my head
To bring me some peace
And I daydream and I stare
There was no other way
So you walk that way, I'll walk this way
I'm having trouble breathing
With blackout hearts, the flowered news
But the devil's in the details
Let me surround you, a sea to your shore
Laura, us, people who suffer
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
Everybody's stopped believing
Well they'll seat us in the sun
He turned on the gas and he went to sleep
When you got the mind of a man in the middle
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
So the letters came from an army camp
To take the test, I'm feeling sick
Oh, blue, blue, black and blue
As you walk through the light
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
Would you still leave me here
That we don't wanna believe
These roads go on forever
I feel you taking power from me and I can't leave
There's no one that can take you home
While biting her lip
Don't feel the cold or wind or rain 
But my darling, I am still in love with you
But there's no laughs left 'cause we laughed them all
Let's just take a walk in the afternoon  look at me
And everyone else has gone home
'Cause a people united
And I still don't know exactly who I am
Cause you said this was right 
I wander lonely streets
All the angels kneeling to the frozen lights
Margaret, array the rocks around the hole before we're sinking
I've never been the type to call
I'm holding my breath
A nice heart and a white suit and a baby blue Sedan
And know your name
The damage is done
You better open the door
I'll just sing for you
We're chained to the world and we all gotta pull
Far from the street
Wouldn't trade anything
It's no different when you're leaving home
That I've been desdesperately alone
I'll find my way back to you
I remember when we kissed
The neighbors hear but they turn out the light
The TV's playing it all out of town 
You were a runaround, a lost and found and not for me I feel
Come on baby let's light the night
For your mouth singing
Then you look at me
I lie awake and try to recall
And she could take your life
When your heart don't have the heart to say to say, to say
Send someone to love me
Too small to matter
Nothing wrong, nothing right
You're the reason why I burst and why I bloomed
Love, you're news to me
There's never been such grave a matter
Till it rains I'm gonna stay inside
After all that's what you're looking for
But your excuses, they won't work
Goddamn us
But I know the game, you'll forget my name
I'm drunk and so is everyone else
If I had the chance, love
And if all we've got
And from the pasture the fence it is leaning away
I gotta get rid of this hole inside
Everyone loves you
Under some dirty words on a dirty wall
You've watched the shows,
But if no one calls and I don't speak all day 
I'm scared of falling in
If what we had was real, how could you be fine
There's one thing that you might have missed
If I still had your number
Saying, "come on, come on
Mother, please forgive me, I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Which of us do you love
These memories come back to life
I remember where the love was found
Like a cancer or a curse
The second hand unwinds
Love, love is going to lead you by the hand
Someone better hit the alarm
You could be so cold
I'll swim alone the long goodbye
Yes, why don't you sit with me for just a little while
Just give me the truth, give me the truth
Suicidal, suicidal, suicidal dream
Baby wait a lifetime before
Yeah everything will be fine
Hush, this is where it ends
And all of your timing has gone
If they believe me or not if they believe me or not
Oh, lonesome me
And you get two more to leave town
You're the reason why I burst and why I bloom
It's such a change from old routine
There's one where I stayed with you, across the sea
And I'm lonesome when you're around
Wanna get into a car and go
You're cutting diamonds
I heard a song and turned away as piece by piece you performed your story
Pour the wine, dear, you say we'll take a holiday
Still more
There were flowers pressed to my face
Things happened at halftime, I'm sick of the bends
From the chorus of people screaming
And I cannot sleep without the radio on
Two is better than one
Yes, this is love for the first time
Our crooked dreams will always glow
If there's no one there
Hmm, bye bye
I may cry, ruining my makeup
There's nothin' nice around me
Silly women, taxmen, uniformed whores
And we walked without words
Oh the reason I hold on
I'm holding to you holding on to me
She said, "You can sleep upon my doorstep, you can promise me indifference, Jim
Of my heart
It's not too late because
And I drive this ocean road and remember
And feast on your holiness
Don't let me know as it's happening
As the music fades
Way up high in the old blue sky
I see you feel for me
They let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind
From the heavens to the womb
I'm still waiting for you
We've been had, you say it's over
You gotta say what's on your mind, on your mind
You've marked to find your way back
In the snow on Christmas morning
When you had to escape, say the word
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
Full of grace
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen
Warm laughs and smiling
Just before she says goodbye
And so are you
For some action you lost in the dark
EightySix Charlie came over
That I'm sorry
The worst is just around the bend
Then we finally was married in 
And I knew better
If your map was torn
I just replay it, love
I can feel the distance as you breathe
She's lucid and departed
The nightmares, the lonely nights
Heaven or hell or somewhere in between
Were you here when I was full sail
I know that this might make me cry
So kiss it' I too once thought I was owed something
So you can't hold them liable
Of a lover who brought fresh bouquets every day
Beautiful, only temperamental
You've always been
And love me"
Red blood's a powerfuel
He'll drive all over town
For the fire and the faith that was you and me
Your hair riding over
Let's walk down the road that has no end
They stand to fight for nothing
You touch me in many, many ways
Closed the door
And drink with my friends
No, no one will desert you
Rip out the binding and tear the glue
Baby, we're done
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't care
Still, I'm gonna keep your heart
When you're sleeping with him
You're turning skin into a dirty secret
I know I need you
She whispers something in my ear, the message is unclear
I'm a little more careful
Time alone will tell
If the moon had to run away 
Reminds me of what I have run for
Unless you're mine
But it's just a faint taste in my mouth
Sweet sister, just feel me
Some days
No, I won't be your winter I won't
I stopped taking dope
It was near when I turned sixteen
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
Love, don't cry
On some forgotten hill, abandoned by the mill
'Cause I was almost honest
It was a beautiful song, but it ran too long
Then somebody says that it's always been this way
You've only got to prove your need
Take me in your arms and love me
But you're so misunderstood
I played a thousand times before
I can honestly say
Under the deep red light I can see the makeup slidin' down,
Reclined amongst these packs of reasons
And if I let you down I will follow you around 
Twilight, I fall in the harbor
It's late and morning's in no hurry
Together all these years
Only two more days until your birthday
I sense there's something in the wind
Well, I ain't got no money
I wanna hold you in the dark
Dropped all your clothes and life
Baby, think twice
I drive fast, radio blares
When you only had barely enough of her
The skateboard and my shit guitar
Every time it breaks, every time it's torn
And daylight knows
Open the door
Thought I wasn't enough
I can shuffle, cut and deal
I envy the road
Those starving children they ain't got no mother
Promise not to run, this time
At least she may forgive me for my honesty
Each day I cry
'Cause your money is no good
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light
Black, black sheep boy
We burn ourselves to hell
I'm selling people things they don't want when I don't know what you need"
Hell, no reason, go on and scream
And I remembered why I loved her, and I asked her why I drove her off
They think I've lost my mind
They are four for each other
There'd be a thousand barren mothers there to talk to her
There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues
It felt so sweet, it felt so strong
We were acting like a child
And with a malady of the soul
You're talking to me
They wanna hear my deepest sins
I don't need a better thing
Funny how he couldn't see at all, 'til she grabbed up her
Sing for the president, sing for the terrorists, sing 
With their love begging bowls
And we walked with our lives
The salty water's underneath your feet
But you're the one who can succeed
Now it's smoke
And, I will take a step back, and, I'll let you ahead
So sing 
Hey sister, I feel it, too
Why do you choose your pain if you only knew
The rest is easy
I'm sleepwalking
To bring me closer to you
I lie around in bed all day just staring at the walls
Girl I thought that you'd never do me that way
He raped me in the chalet lines
And I know what you're thinking
Overwise wasted
I've heard her call to me The clouds are clinging to your sail
There is this thing that's like talking except you don't talk 
He'll be careless of
Melted away like I was free
And I knew darkness swallowed
Now where the hell I've ended up
After the show you can not sing wherever you want 
So please explain
Maybe we could find a room
I stare across the street and see the churches and the blue 
And your body's a fire
Watch the past go up in smoke
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna to fall down
But I'm so tired of days that feel like the night
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
Oh let it rain, rain, rain, rain oh how I wish that it would rain
He looks all wrong but that's her alright
Eyes open, shut your eyes
To do as you want, to do as you please
Every promise of forever
While you clear your head
All her friends call her "Alaska"
You know something had to go
And the way you would have laughed and talked fast or slow
As nothing to us
Another one in the casket
Patterns in my mind now moving slow
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
Shine on for everyone ahah 
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Maybe I'll just place my hands over you
When you turn the lights out
Of course you can
On a blade of grass
And spend some time dissecting
He said, "When it's gettin' kinda rough over here
And now come the tears, heavy and hot
He was rich and I was overawed
I see reflections of me in your eye
Now I believe you baby
Everytime you walk into the room
They can't see everything on earth
Tears are in your eyes
But don't say anything at all
It was such a funny feeling
Like time was standing still
And the love that they swore
Crowd surf off to sea, float toward the beach
Swear I'll drive right off a fucking cliff
Yeah I feel fine
I did go from wanting to be someone
Does the silence get lonely
With a halo around my eye
Do you still love rock and roll
You showed me love was all you needed
You came into my life
This ain't no happy place to be
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world
There are diamonds in demand
The world was at her feet and she was looking down
Baby can you hear the rain fall on me
Can darken the heart
Be free of all the pain
'Cause she didn't have time
Grandchildren far and near, and none will shed a tear
And I'm sorry that it's this way
And don't blame your mom
I hope you live forever
Love my name
If I spent myself till nothings left
I can paint my face 
The thrill of blood comes instantly, there's only darkness at the finish
Once I stood so tall, now I'm searching for a sign
Can't shake this feeling that I have
You have inside
Give me all you got, baby
As we continue our goodbyes
And messages on my machine
To prove that you don't love me
Those who say the past is not dead
But you know you're not alone
And they walked from the road
We sat and waited for the sea
Oh, when skies are gray, and gray, and gray"
You put up walls,
"If you love something, give it away"
All of us now breathe it like smoke
Over that broken road
'Cause when I die, then I die loving you
Till earth swallowed the last of the sun
There's a heart I cannot hide
You're 'bout as cute as
Oh, it took me years to write it, they were the best years of my life
Let's love now
Ease the pain, would set the house ablaze
You stay strong and you carry on
Can you guess that I'll be gone
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
Grey ships pass
But you told me your love was blind
'Cause even though you left me here
When I awake, I'll see your face
We have peace in our lives
But I guess you look happier, you do
Drop it to the floor
I'm just gone, just gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
And die here
Your eyes
You're so impossible that I should sign a waiver
I can't help falling out of love with you
Saw you walk inside a bar
No matter how haunting
The moon is yellow silver
Give me the truth, even if it hurts
All we are is colored sand
You say it's only me, and, that I'm so perfect for you
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
And nothing works, just living hurts
Paid for the murder before they had determined the sex
I put one foot in front of the other
And I still pour you a glass of champagne
And blackest night and I wait for you
Just like a dream
Out past the land mines
With his feet inside your shoes
Sweet love tasted blood
I only read a word or two 
And look your skirt is torn
But somehow I know that you will never leave me
I'll see you on the other side
Did the captain of the Titanic cry high
Don't let me know what you've said
Never more to be alone
If you knew what's going on in her life
He found him with another son of God
If I don't stay on the charts
So keep your hands on your chest and sing with me
They argue "Walk this way", "No, walk this way"
And when I'm scared
I keep this moment by and by
Oh, and how many times will I let you get away with murder
You came to make sure that I'm not running
I knew I had to stay
That's why I'm always on the run
You're holding court
You make it hard for breathing
And I wait staring at the Northern Star
For love I can't feel
And it hit me that love is a game
Those words keep me on my feet
To go our separate ways Oh no, no
When there's a man on your back
If somebody would just take my call
And would you let me
Yeah, the truth will set you free
Far away but still on my mind
I'm about to take this drink and just stuff it
Wasn't always in your head
Can't sleep on the KLM again
When the things don't make sense
I don't think you'd know where to start
Make it rhyme, take you in and make you mine
I don't care no more, no
You know tomorrow
The words they use so lightly, I only feel for you
You can smell them when they burn
Then we shall see each other face to face
You know I'm leaving here tonight 
I thought some daisies
Flash of youth shoot out of darkness
I think you're insensitive and I don't feel heard 
She sends me blue valentines
And I would like to run away from
Reminders of you
And I am willing to give up this fight
Covered yourself up in snow
Felt clean for just a little while
Yes, it struck me that love is a sport
I rape, no one hears me
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me
As for me, well I'll find someone who's not goin' cheap in the sales,
The other woman enchantes her clothes with French perfume
Billboards quoting things you'd never say
Look on down from the bridge
Won't let no one break your heart
Foolish running for miles on the concrete ground 
And I breathe, I breathe no
"Take me in your arms
I see you've got your smile back
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
And she flies to a place
Forcing everything metal to shine
You tried to see inside of me
What if I got it wrong
You're here with me, sit down, have a seat
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm missing you
Hard for you, I've fallen, but you can't break my fall
Give myself to anyone who wants to take me home
She told you bad things
Oh, please
Oh fuck, I'll pay you anything 
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
In all the wrong directions, and by daybreak we'll be gone
So as you pull me from the bed
Since I've lay with you in bed
Gone away from me
As morning's light breaks over me
Or tear it apart
Now you say your right on track
And came to rest upon a beach
But tears fall from my eyes
Safe in my heart
Fade to black, I'm sick of trying
So when you see me falling backwards down the wall that says I'm still alive,
If I'll ever feel the same love
The men started working
I get nothing
As I'm leaving, she wakes up and says
If it weren't for my drinking
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
For days and days
Go to sleep
What would touch me deeper
'Cause you, you are the only one left
But while you wave goodbye
In your eyes I saw a future together
I could try to smile to hide the truth
And dream of the ones who came before
Lies that lead you to the grave,
But I'd rather think there's nothing to be found"
But now you never show it to me, do you
Lamenting policewomen, policemen,
Her tongue a thirsty knife
Skeleton me
That loved like me and you
Does he lay awake listening to your breath
Say, love's confined, on Earth
And I will surely break
Don't touch me now
With turpentine and chamomile
Hold my breath 'til communication is only just a test
I never tell a woman what to do with her body
I don't want to try no more
I could say that I yeah, yeah
Sweet love, tasty blood
In the background
But don't walk away, don't walk away
We'll go where it's always spring
Is like a fire drill 
I wait, but I'm too tired to play pretend
Shadows and regrets
The eyes of youth must lose their way
I told you the truth
Oh tears my soul apart
In three days time so you choose well"
And all still to come
And you are their jailor
You know that darkness always turns into light
Everybody hurts
Blue, blue, black and blue
A strange glow in the sky
We don't seek death, we seek destruction
The same mistake again
True love is cruel love
Don't think I can't feel that there's something wrong
Remember that she's getting older, too
A woman calls my house once a week, she's always selling things
Deep breaths
You need to be up all of the time
The hint of these new tears are sharp I try to choke them back
Waiting for something
Lie whit me one last time
If you're shocked it's just the fault Go your own way
To live, I won't let go
Hear me sing
I was hoping I was hoping we could be creamy together
If you want to know the truth of it
Pass outside of your window
All of the king's horses and all of the king's men
We used to spend on dope
She stood burning in front of me
I see myself change as the days change over
And my body was weak
Late last night I saw you in my living room
You make things so easy
Don't you remember that I promised I would write you
If you're lost you can lookand you will find me
Maybe we could change his mind
You abuse the ones who won't
I went back to Omaha
And they will shake their heads and wag their bony fingers
Been a long road since those hands I left my tears in
I'll love you forever
"Friends, you don't understand"
Jesusland
But at least the war was over
There's a light in your eyes
She thought it would be fun to try pornography
They need for you to be everything
Sing it's not just music but the pains not brief
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child
Cause so badly I wanna go outside such a lovely day
I did all my best to smile
Let it fall
I've seen this world before
Is designed for crashing bores
There will always be a light 
If you could end this 
And there's all these funny little men
The kettle sings it's tortured song
Everybody feels this way but it'll be okay
Could I kiss you and make you a queen,
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
I would not hesitate
I saw the future as a cloud
I noticed emotion
What if the paint chips from the wall
Broken, lovelorn on your rocks
Our hearts are as dark as the rain, ah oh
Watching shadows melt the light
And if you ask me I will stay
And wait for the fire to spread
If everything we got is blowing away
Holes in its throat where the blood was drawn
Did she make your heart beat faster than I could
And I don't know I could crash and burn but maybe
And everything, everything will be fine
I can never wash the guilt
It's very cold here 
As she gets up off the floor
I need you more than dope
Tell me you're sorry
I'll thrash the air and then be still
I shot for the sky
Yesterday is gone
Won't you take me by the hand
Grab your bags and a picture of when we met
No loneliness, no misery is worth you
It could be the end of the world as we know it
She thought it would be fun to try most anything
With this blind and broken heart
You're my one true friend
I wasn't born yesterday
Of knowing the truth
Though its breaking every rule I've ever made
For I cannot find the words to say
Why do the white gulls call
Some things you'll do for money and some you'll do for fun
You've only got to love him more
I hesitate but answer it anyway
I'd just drive a different car every day
With one good kiss
And where do you start
Comes blacking in my mind
When I drive, drive so slow
And laughed and said we're at the top of the food chain 
Sometimes she wishes she was never born
It's not much of a life you're living
She's the only one I love
Well maybe two is better than one
Taking my time, taking this drive
Your thoughts have always laid close to mine
There I wait by the mouth
That's why mommy stopped and stared
The creature of innocence
They don't mean a thing
Take your hands off him
Of summer's kiss upon the sky
My only sunshine"
From everything
Yeah, we were building a life
Go ahead and burn it down
And that's why, love, you shouldn't stay
You marry a role and you give up your soul till you break down
Help me now or hold me down
My best unbeaten brother
Is cold and hard as hell 
I learned to forgive them; now I got the balls they can lick on
And I'm phoning my friends
When you're feeling moved
And there's nothing to cushion your heart led fall
I've never dared to let
Like the circles
If you fall I will catch youI will be waiting
My baby called me up to say
Any light that still remains
I was all pigtails and cords and there was a day when
I was hoping I was hoping we could challenge each other
These words, they haunt me, hunt me down
But I don't wanna live this lie
The lights are out Where'd everybody go
I was singing something
As he buttoned down his pants
I went away alone
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from poopoo and 'prentice
We had a good run and I'm setting you free
I'll be alright
It would feel so good to be
I've gotta drink you right off of my mind
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
And Henry, you danced like a wooden Indian
How dark it gets this time of year
Changes are shifting outside the words
You're calling to me, I can't hear
I was here but now I'm gone
Five times before they're seen
And I don't know, this could break my heart or save me
And freeze to spread skeleton wings
Well some just can't be bothered to stick around another day
From that place on the carpet
"Can you see the sky turn red
Am I losing my cool, overstating my case
We walk slow now, but we still have each other
I've got to breathe
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
Who fall at your feet
Two years later you're still on my mind
Echo in rooms
Wipe the shadow from your eyes
Well I heard you been singing
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
In the window when I ride
I used to live alone before I knew you
Can feel your hand in mine
Still breaking old habits, 
So keep calm, honey I'ma stick around
Feed Jacky's gerbil and try to stay clean
You're the emptiness the whole world sings at night
Till the sound of my voice
Trading air
Your father, Mister Ed
Everybody hurts some days
I promise this drink is my last one
Bearing the burden of a secret storm
This is where our story ends
Baby you got me checkin' in my rearview mirror
Yeah you, send a little love my way
Oh, ooh, oh my love
He had no friends, he seldom spoke
Hell no reason go on and scream
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
I'm in love with you completely, I'm afraid that's all I can do
Who catch my tears
In a place where I can feel the beating of your heart
Stay on, sit down
With the boys from the amusement park
It rains so slowly
Choking back the urge to fight
Saying goodbye huum
I call your number
What I could be missing
I let the snow
Saw the back of your sweet mother's head
It washed the cars and everything
You heard your love again
But sleep won't set me free
Or something in between
It's all right, is what you told me
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Though unwillingly I left
All these blues I have cried
Ninety miles outside Chicago
That was worn by his mother
That its dreadful anteposition
Quit fightin' while your husband
You're staring at a picture of me
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun does rise
Till we see the moon
She worried it might come to life
I'm trying to get to you baby
Are starting to feel the way I used to,
Wait a moment until I'm gone
That should be me, this is so sad
Please say the right words
I'm holding on to you holding on to me
That sleeps beneath my lapel
Am going to a place where I am always high
It was like prison
It gets harder everyday
And the future hangs over our heads
Watching everyone
And the white light scatters
And hope someday you'll find it in your heart
Forget the lovers you've known
I've been a moonshiner
Now that all you touched
I've got a skin full of dope
As I drive
You love white veins, you love hard grey
Time keeps passing by, but it seems I'm frozen still
Somehow it got easy to laugh out loud
That living is for other men
An old coupon expired
There's all sorts of shapes that I bet you can make
I need to know should I fight for love
And I try to be the one
Cross your heart to take me when you leave
The pictures of anything
Just try to never grow up
Oh I, I'm along tonight babe
Feeling hung over and old
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me
All that's cold and cruel
Does he love you the way I can
For you to live, I took your place
And everything's a mess
I always knew you would succeed
Look back before you leave my life Don't leave my life
You've nothing to be ashamed of
I know that this will hurt me
You're so sorry about it all
How many accolades do I need to block denial
We're all just victims of a crime, yeah, woah
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like a jewelry store case
And distance tells you that distance must come between love
And I wait for you
Piece of mind
Even if it's a lie
And the world is closing doors
Is saying goodbye
And the moon's laying low in the sky
Come back tomorrow
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
And burning slow
And the weather will hold
And these hazards of love never more will trouble us
There is nothing within me now to gain
I just need you
There's some things you gotta know
So I won't worry about my timing I wanna' get it right
You tell me winter's here and your days are getting long
Cause crying, ooh, eases the pain, oh yeah
So scared that we lost it
Long afloat on shipless oceans
I was hoping I was hoping we could heal each other
Well you'd like to think that you were invincible
From her smile the golden tooth is worn
Goodbye
Who once gave just one rose, one day, years ago
It's hard, hard to stand up for what's right
Scared of what you'll think
When the memory leaves you
At a point between two tracks
Put on my worried shoes
I could make a dress 
I go to some bar room
Miles and miles
It's all right
I am giving up on half empty glasses and
It hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on
And float from branch to branch, lighter than the air
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
And thinking's just too much to ask
And I woke up and wagged my tongue
Even ghosts get tired and go home
Will stay you in your steps
All the babies tucked away in their beds, we're out here screaming,
Not I, I'm never gonna love again
And it's harder as anything else
That love is a powerful force
That I would love you from afar
I'm still in my bed
But your love is alright
I'm sick, no one hears me
It's gotta be better than waiting
Do you remember the times we would give up on each other and get back together
For seventeen long years
Something so wild turned into paper
And I'm tired of waiting
In a cold little mirror you were grown
Can't find another way around
Shine on for everyone
So what's so wrong Why the face so long Are you changing
What if our baby comes home after nine
And pulling all your threads saying
So stay
Can I buy an aeroplane
They're foolish now
Of all the sweetness that has passed through us"
Don't dream away your life
That's your favorite to be touched
So let's be married here today, these rushing waves to bear our witness
With the noise in the background from a televised war
The lights exploded
And one and one is two
The stream can't contain such the withering rain
Through books of older time
And I'd love to stay but there's bills to pay
Shield your eyes, conceal your lies
Let my feelings free
In a place that's warm and dark
Why should I play the fall guy to your love
Gasping at glimpses of gentle true spirit, he runs
Just sing 
And in every face I meet
Just get me passed this dead and eternal snow
I used to be the bright one 
You're a little bit more than I thought you'd be
Every time the rain falls, think of me
The doctor told her years ago that she was ill
You were the only thing that mattered, there was no one for me but you
I loved sneaking out when my momma's asleep
Oh how I wish that it would rain
If you miss me once in a while
So before you replace me
Put a rock beat over anything
And I can hear you say
Caroline says
Not just from letters read to you
Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry
And you said, "Don't give me nothing
But we let them get ahead of us
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun comes out
They'll always be failures
It could stay this simple
I got nothing to rely on
To a diary entry's end
Are your thoughts results of static cling
Oh, you're my best friend
This basement's a coffin
Yeah we all feel pain
These are only walls that hold me here
Would you have played in your school clothes and made me mad
It is hurting me
Sad song, last dance and no one knows who the band was
Dieu reunit ceux qui s'aiment
No one heals me like you
A new world, a new day to see
I am willing to give up this fight
Into the endlessness of blue,
I was almost honest
Just stay in when it's lookin' this way
Twilight, I fall in the hills
All souls pass
The moon
That you don't want me there in your life
Found I wasn't so tough
Even if you don't show up on time
There will not be a new one
Yeah baby yeah
All the living are dead
Our misery runs wild and free
You watch your back 'cause no one will
Living in fear
I truly love but I know
'Cause you know you've got the truth on your side
And love me
And I think I believe that if stones could dream
I still have that record
I was scared to call your mother
Rest your eyes in waking light
Perfect moments wait
Almost left behind
Ring around the rosey
They need to find another way for people I talk to
When the blue sky turns to grey
From caring for his often
Cry, cause your drought's been brought up
It all becomes the same
Watching through windowsI'm wondering
You best believe
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen
What really lies
I don't want to make this right
But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
Everybody's living or they're dead
'Cause everything you do and words you say
Just to call his own
I looked all around and saw the sun shining down
Put it in your mouth
I'll love you forever Caramel
'Cause I can feel your pain, in my bones, in my bones
A bitch in heat, the alpha male
Soaring through the utmost fear
They'll think you're up to something
If I'm looking for you,
Away with this dirty dishwater
Down a road that's leading nowhere
And I hope you'll always be
I woke up this morning to a blood red sky
And maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
The generous queen will kiss a fan
I'm a fool for staying home and having none
And I ain't got no money
And it's leaving you with such a heavy heart
But if I lose the highs, at least I'm spared the lows
That David played and it pleased the Lord
What went wrong with something once so good
Up and out that cellar door
Here I stand sad and free
Slowly I'm losing your face
I'll sing to you
All the little pieces falling, shatter
And does he sing to you, incessantly,
Bad things
That's what Mrs Reardon says, and she should know
I warned you before there were water skies
Before the night is done
'Cause baby, you look happier, you do
And forget about the stupid little things
I remember you best
I used to make her laugh
If you love someone, you should set them free
The phone sits on the windowsill
Doctor, doctor on the phone
Our mother has been absent
He couldn't sleep at night for fear that she
Let me unfold you
Catch your breath,
We live in a beautiful place,
To silver glass
I took my lucky break and I broke it in two
These words are not a bit profound
I would like to think our paths are straight
You're better now than ever, and your life's okay
I don't find myself bouncing home
Straight buzzin', Robitussin
They are coming from the woods
Please always stay
The anchor's kiss was scrawled in dyslexic crayon
I wish I was dead, and you're breathing
Love and happiness surround you
Here comes a long arm of the law
When We were only kids
I'll die in here just to be safe
And this is our town
Take up all your jewels and gold
You'll feel when the wind blows
Oh well it's just around the corner
And so was I
While she's still around,
So be whatever you want to be
From the space between your bed and wall
Won't you hold me, won't you hold me
In the shape of a woman
You are a long way away from me  look at me
I remember every look upon your face,
Before I replace you
The fool might be my middle name
That you're tired
I need you to survive
Sell each others shit
It only causes you pain
'Cause it did not 
The letters are sighing
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
We were living on a fault line
I'm eating less and thinking more 
Cryin' all alone under the stands
The place where I was freed
Walter's on the telephone
And everyone turned their backs, 'cause they knew
And I still wonder if you ever wonder the same
Now and always you
Failed to stop my heart from breaking in two
I can't be the same thing to you now
I'll tell them we just grew apart
To sing this summer serenade
All I want is someone who can fill the hole
Waiting for you to remember
Please, please tell me you know
On such a lovely Sunday
I don't want to risk our paths crossin' someday
Yeah you hit me right in the heart
Like a hated addiction
If you're moving on with someone new
And I can feel your pain, deep in my bones, deep in my bones
Faces fell long in the half light
Some moments last forever, but some flare out with love, love, love
That I'm crying crying crying crying
I had just destroyed everything
To send me blue valentines
I've got to let you go
And live by the mountains Caramel
Out of memory and time
Sing for the teachers who told you that you couldn't sing 
But she's not afraid to die
If you go back out there
Earth is no more, why don't you burn this muh'fucka
But how can I when you build the Great Wall around you
Now if you're trying to break my heart
We will meet again one day 
And you can tell the world
No time for halfhearted goodbyes,
You say the weather doesn't sit with you
Realize it's not okay, it's the end of all you've known
Or make you feel I belong
Twenty years in a car,
As they crawl back under the stones
With the world in our hands
There's nothing to be gained from this
I remember everything as I drive
And lies that lead you
Baby, it's the slow fade of love
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back
I put the past into the ground
EightySix Charlie, he came back
And I'm up in the air so baby hell yeah
Something else to hide behind
It's a February night and I don't wanna feel anything
Oh, and how many times will you make me feel more alive
I drive fast wind in my hair
One that won't know the street
Rumors spreadin' about this other guy
Wonder who won mine
Alone to sort it out
And I scream for the sunlight
The surface
'Goodbye sir thank you for your business sir you're successful and established sir 
I want the truth
Do we kill this one tonight
No time for love, no time for hate
Our love is a fickle love
When you're alone
I'll be outside of your window
What did we think we'd find
Tomboy running around, hanging with all the guys
I can't just carry on this way
I'm sleeping later and waking later 
There's a party there that we oughtta go to
I swore ourselves a better life
The gymnast, high above the ground,
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh, ah oh
I'm not tryin' to be cool
Like the horses of the
So watch your back, the Ides of March
Don't blink, everyone's watching
She says forever to light a fuse
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
Well, anyway, "I would any day die for you"
He says that he'll raise him up
She'll give me a place
If not the moon will us guide
All alone, come to me
In my heart
We're turning to go home
Oh, it's been hard to be strong, all of this going on
We're running to the edge of the world
With heat to melt these frozen tears burned with reasons as to carry on
I was walking slow to a dirty dive
I taste the sulfur on my breath
There was a time I'd dip my feet
Remember when I took you up to the top of the hill
I poured my heart out
Yeah you, send a little smile my way
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
Not ready to let go
I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance
And all the sadness inside me
Look and see the sky turn red
I never tried to trick you babe
No sign of the things she used to own
That's the message that I sent
Like the land joining the sea
I do not feel safe
Walk down your street
Turn to fly, go away
But I dug my teeth into my knees
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Everything you think you know, baby, is wrong
To take it all in stride
By the grace of God
It shouldn't come as a surprise
Lie to me, convince me that I've been sick forever
You turn kings into beggars
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
'Cause we all need a reason, a reason just to stay
Every step that you take
To have a better life
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
If you can make the damn thing work
Red blood sticks like glue
Choosing our life over your life meant your death
A statue stands in a shaded place
No matter what you tried
I could tell you I feel it's time for us
All my thoughts were real and so sincere
For the first time since my accident
Saying, "we'll need something to remind us
Never felt so old
Yeah you send a little love my way
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
And I'm found too fast, called too fond of flames
I'm a man and I got my pride
You still feel it on your lips
Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirit's well
Maybe, every time that he smiles
So don't need your salvation with promises unkind
Traded your worth for these scars,
Because of you
Oh, these feelings should not be in the man
When all objectivity's gone
Everything will be okay 
Don't say what you're about to say
What they did that made you sad
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I've been acting like a child
Now that I have made up my mind
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now x
Did I dream you dreamed about me
Now every morning, there is no more mourning
'Cause I know I'm wasting my time
I drive, drive these roads
MARIANNE seven for a secret, never to be told
We left the restaurant where the head waiter in his s said 
To sink our ship
The other woman will never have his love to keep
Go get lost where no one can be found
Never even thought it wouldn't last
It was me and a gun
Can't stop driving, I don't know why
And an old movie house
You ain't coming back
It always takes my by surprise
When he saw his face reflected in his victim's twinkling eye
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before
Along a river of flesh, can these dry bones live
Maybe it's all gone black, but you're all I see
You can never dream it down
Do you really think I'm made of stone, baby, come on
Without you by my side
You keep on saying the past is not even past you keep saying
But she walked with a limp
And no one's ever burned you
How much I love you, no
I can feel the distance
Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
Was , surviving my return to Saturn
Whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice
But the ghost of you asking me why,
It's a complicated situation
I wanna stay here but I've been denied
Is goodbye
When I return
I walk Haight Street to the store
Every step that I take is another mistake
I'll swim backwards, I'll swim backwards
If you knew I was dying would it change
And none of it is yours, man
I'll go to London there's a mate of mine I know
Where shadows choose their horrors
So here we are
Oh no, he was a most peculiar man
That you didn't have
To see your face, your smile
Ooh  dancers in line
And you are
For news that you weren't getting better
Funny how the cracks don't seem to show
But you can't borrow my clothes all the time
And how I failed in love and jumped out on my bail
Like a reclaimed bad part of town
We both wake in lonely beds, in different cities
I heard the words come out
Is holes and lack of love left
I felt that I would die
Of who we'll always be
He lived all alone within a house
Well I was almost honest
And all I've wished for has come to pass
Now when you're in love it takes time to heal
And I'll still believe
Cold smile on your lips
I could fix a lot of things
They don't need to see you cry
How could I say goodbye
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I found you on a Saturday and that was where I lost you
I still think of you that way
Well, stop and smell the smoke you keep saying
Nobody knows what she's holding back
Drive past the lifeguard stand
If it's a broken arm then brace it
If it's a broken heart then face it
I've gathered all my money and I'm goin' to town
Oh, but those feelings ain't the same
It's all in your imagination dear
But the last day of summer
Couldn't relax, couldn't sit back
Sure as Jonah turned whaler
Meet me after dark again and I'll hold you
You said, always and forever, is such a long, lonely time
I never knew you, you never knew me
Some angel is stuck inside me
To lighthouse shine, to calm tide
And she goes, she's been here too few years
'Cause we paint the foil with the flame
Well, everything's so different now
Calling you through flesh that burns
And I don't want to hear the sound, of losing what I never found
And I shall believe
Needs its sacrifices
If drinking do not kill me
"If we walk away, they'll walk away"
To a crackle in a radio song
What I've done
I woke from a dream
Well, baby, anyone can change
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
I am the entertainer, I've come to do my show
Phone calls from further away
The long distance runner
The weight of an empty life
Have I really lost control
Of running around
So obsessed was I and selfabsorbed that I
And I looked in the mirror
Woke up sad from this dream I've been having
Tells me everything and how we are
I've never dared to
And I shall wait forever
I never wanted anything more more
When you only had barely enough to hang on
You love a stone, because it's dark, and it's old
Outside the words
Collage of broken words and stories full of tears
But to imagine a fall
I know I'll rest tomorrow
And I caught you and I brought you here Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Because we don't take to arguing
Gems and stones,
What's left to find 'Cause I need a little more
Shoshana was jonesing
I can feel the rain, I can feel the rain
And I turned home
Well I watched your black tied family
Halfway to heaven from here
Oh, I need you
Let me enfold you
She's looking like a queen
How do you find the words to say to say, to say
You remember when we kissed
Girl you know me inside out
Through the wind and the rain
Don't think I'll escape
'Cause I let you alone for long
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
And many times we've shared our thoughts
When your war is over
I made up my mind
I can fall through one's fingers
You could love
Held tight, your voice inside my head
And I'm gonna die just a little more
The ocean rolls us away
Every Saturday night I seem to come alive for you baby
And don't get cheap with the wine
And do I like being single 
In the morning I'll find you,
Have a seat at the bar
Sing along, sing along, sing along
Gonna fall into the sea and they'll know
A name is written on a polished rock
Your body's a halo
That her father gave to her
The reasons for the tears
And I have the sense to recognize
And I feel like I'm getting old
And I never meant to hurt you
Here's an evening dark with shame
Maybe someday you'll really get to know me
Now that I am done, remember I will always love you
Rearrange well I'm nobody
She said, "The slow fade of love
And she bit your lip and she made you hers
The two apart
I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die for you
And show me your face tonight
He runs back only to announce
I never should've let you go
They, they just want pain
Who's to say it would have worked
With apparitions of your soul
Some devil, some angel has got me to the bones
Youth is wasted on the young
Sooometimes
You're coming back for me
When the morning comes to meet you
Before I take a hammer to the walls around it
Yeah, I think I'm coming down
And your money' and when I walked by he said, 'thank you too dear'
Oh maybe I'll build my house on your cloud
Hard not to break down and cry
Margaret, the lapping waves are licking quietly at our ankles
There are things I wish I didn't know
Maybe love is a hopeless crime
I was hoping I was hoping we could be raw together
The silver in your hair
Or maybe we can go together
Will give the game away
This could be one of those days
And I didn't think you'd ever find me here
There were times when I'd find myself saying that
You've been in bed for too long
Take my hand
Little voices mimic you
Worrying is the breathing that you need
And there's no one here but me
Everybody just want to be free
Another sleepless night again
Soft shining from our eyes
Feelin' weaker and weaker
Days are gray and the nights are black
Waving this town, goodbye
In your arms
I'm as troubled as the tide
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Once you've found that lover
When silence gets too hard to handle
Teargas and plateglass
I have to be sincere
Such a lonely world such a lonely world
But never did I talk
The blood stained the carpet
Take me in your arms
Can't be weak,
Burning on the bridge, turning off the lights
Blueberries, dancers in line
My name's Elizabeth
Tell me now, tell me this  a forest's son, a river's daughter
Got to be so completely
I'm coming to an end,
Haven't you noticed
The truth is I'm too tired to play pretend
Your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
Heaven wasn't made for me
I'm waitin' in the dark
How some things never change
I wish I could turn back the time
It's gonna be all right
This place, it's fucking cursed and it's plagued 
So here I go with all my fears weighing on me
Dry your eyes
I've been told that this will heal given time
We are alone
From the ending to the ending
Every little thing there is to know
Singing this song, singing along
Oh, I believe it's all because
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me false accused
And say and lie to me and say and lie to me and say
Just bird's eye view from the sky above
And I would never lie to you, no
Hey Charley, I think I'm happy
Mandala destroyed by the sea
And she told you, laughing down to her core
The winter birds have come back again
Now you'll have to decide the fate of my sanity
Before you roll Those dice Don't do it, baby, no, don't do it, baby
Save for a few of those late night episodes, missed opportunities, and "I don't care's"
The alarm clock's going off
Keep the thought of you aflame
You motherfuckers, you'll sing someday
I shake the very thought of you
You're right next to me but I need an air plane
There is a story you bring to life
Goddamn us all
So I was wrong 
Everything is back, and they'd use what
Oh, but what the hell, you know it's just as well
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces
I fall behind
You both know I'd be bleeding inside
What's in your eyes
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail
No they don't, they say they don't
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Well I won't be your winter
Everybody's going out and having fun
After Mario got busted
Or get these bloodstains off my hands
Though I have a broken dream
Although you don't believe me, you are strong
You wrestled your nightmares
I know you're the ticket, you gotta be
Trust in me through closing years
Now I'm back on my beat
Maybe when our story's over
Don't think I'll confess
You remember those simple things
Said its okay i knew exactly what you meant
I was made to taste your kiss
But it's useless I am useless against them
And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone
Or is it a dream
Oh fuck, I'll give you anything
I got your message
Look away from the sky
Walked out of the past and into the bar
If it's a broken part, replace it
Is beige with the pieces
I got a question for you
I'm stealing lines from myself
It seems like every time I try to make it right
I wonder, do you still think of me
I'll be running the other way
We were born before the waves
Hold me here, hold me here
And I claw for solid ground
I've been screaming for years
Another one, another one
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere
And you've already got me coming undone
Now I tremble in your arms
To remind me of my cardinal sin
I turn on the spotlight and flee from the scene
I've got to find mounts hill Caramel
There's no more trying tonight
You can laugh, it's kind of funny
In the hall where you had your first kiss
And it's hard to leave
You could be the one to help me help myself
If I'm sorry you lost me you'd better make it quick,
To say goodbye goodbye
So come with me in bed
I could help myself to something
No good times, no bad times
Well honey I can see your house from here
And we drive through the farmland,
He doesn't need to trouble his good soul
Don't hurt me again
She walks to school with the lunch she packed
I fantasize about my death
We've always had time on our sides
I'm sure back home
He said, "The slow fade of love
All the city streets a wondrous chorus singing
And lay your hands over me
Do the things that I'm afraid to do
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
It's not somebody who's seen the light
And how apparent it all becomes
My aching heart would bleed for you to see
You'd give anyone
Your star up there
You told me boy bite your tongue
You're making my heart bleed honey
I hope she'll give me a place
I can't give everything
He climbed the stairs and the gallows groaned
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed
This world  I am afraid 
For the ninetyseventh time tonight
Instead, these blue valentines
Compass gone, he long has lost his way
Well I'm a modern guy
'Cause I've been holding your hand
I used to be the smart one
So I pushed you a little bit more
Through the rain, hail, sleet and snow
I'll stop speaking for you
I never will, amen
She smiled in a big way, the way a girl like that smiles
Please say honestly you won't give up on me
Yes, I am falling how much longer till I hit the ground
But no one knows your face
But these hazards of love never more will trouble us
Tie your hair and gently fall from grace
The minor fall, the major lift
The sun upon my forehead it burns baby burns baby burns
"You are my sunshine,
'Cause I must sometimes see you
Of someone that I used to be
Leave you cold
The one making you laugh, oh baby oh
It's the burglar that can break a rose's neck
If you think of me
How does it feel
But you may never know why
Don't think I'll deny
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
I don't want to hate myself,
It's still raining, up here
Heaven couldn't wait for you
When she takes speed, they laugh and ask her
And in that deafening pleasure, I thought I heard someone say
When you're sleeping in someone else's bed
To hear those words from you
I too thought that when proved wrong I lost somehow
Then we'll go our separate ways
And break my heart and soul inside
Cause it is mine, it is mine
Pardon me, I didn't realize
You know that I love you, but look at what lovin' has done
In a stupor from the drugs that didn't
There's nothing left but hope
I think that what he did was wrong 
A cold sound in the air
Death is an angel and
And I'm down shouting names
I fuckin' hate you
And when that queen's daughter came of age
Oh, I am willing to give up this fight
Wipe the makeup from your face
I beseech, come to me
And the friends you have told
You had to finally walk away because of what it cost you
Should I stand amid the breakers
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
And no one likes to be alone
I held up and robbed a hard liquor store
I can't promise I will heal you
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
Conversations, full of words you never said
It's the slow fade of love
Could this be our last dance
Stuck inside of me
There's too much I can't say
You know this could be something
Side by side in age and sadness
Love will be the death of
And I wonder if I'm alone in your head
With bullies always putting me down
'Cause when you never see the light, it's hard to know which one of us is caving
Such a lonely world
I warned you not to drive
Just left along the way
And we followed the road
I beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here
And you will kiss the ring
And the fog comes up
Ooh  a sweet Clementine
A word, a signal, a nod, a little breath
I just have to wander through this world
I saw the stars spelled out SAVED
In all the world than you
And got me through these years
Bring you up, call you down, sign your name, secret love
But you don't really care for music, do you
So the pain begins
The songs you wrote
Throw a party for a thousand years
All of your fears will pass away
I had no choice, I erased the debt of our family
I've gotta tell you my tale
Death is policeman
The sound of the drum is calling
I said, "Hey, what troubles you"
Every moment like a sudden pleasure
With riverboat casinos and you still
PATRICK still we sing
Still enchanted in flight
She said, "Nobody here can live forever
I know I love you
When it sings, when it lies
Sometimes you picture me
What are these tears upon your face
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
Lately I can't seem to find myself no sleep at all
Well, I think she'd be lovely and stubborn and brave
With no one at all to catch you
But still begging for attack
They ate up everyone like they were fishes
When you're running circles in my head
Remember waiting for you to call
And when your devil complains
Swish, swish, aw, my haters is obsessed
Remember, remember
When desperate static beats the silence up
And I would've had a hard time feeling compassion for him
I know the sun will rise,
So I think I should get up and call you
And I'm wavin' you goodbye
"You don't get drunk on red wine and fight no more"
And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone
Oh, but you hit "send"
Drinkin' 'cause you're lookin' so good in your Starbucks cup
You'll be sad that you let me go
Feel I'm getting old
As I gently close my eyes
Then believe that we have lost our eyes
So please don't cry 
You could have been anything
I am too busy to have friends 
I'm always assuming the worst
Because it's you and me, we're history
Where she's loved
Makes me cry
She shakes underneath the pouring rain
On the hearth with his feet up
You've been the sweetest part of my life so long
I'm staring at the sky
I don't care much for the gogo 
I remember when I moved in you
The memories will remain
Tough girl, I'm in pain
Still I never want it all and I never want it now
And we plotted out my death
Do you remember when,
And supposedly you can crawl right through me
She was easy
Its just one day I fell asleep
And leave it all into my mind
Worried you smoke too many cigarettes
I thought about it 'til my head hurt
He knew the one time with the army captain
It's your turn to feel the pain
They'd dream of being laid sidebyside, piecebypiece
As she lies here beside me asleep with the night
Don't lose no sleep
If you ever had a real heart
Here it comes
What if you lose yourself sometimes
I know something's very wrong
Nothing is true
Can stop and smell the smoke
As you lay your weary head
And the silence from the side of the car
Three spirits and twelve lonely steps
This is our town
I want you to stay, stay
The house on the hill
Tears that fall from eyes
So here I am in my new apartment
Forgotten and
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
Right or wrong, right now it doesn't matter
You should tell your gathering friends
In the general sense
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen
That I have not been to since your goodbye
Are we breathing, are we breathing, are we wasting our breath
Found a life worth living for someone else
No, I can't sleep
Down this highway that I ride to Atlanta
'Cause life has been insane but
But I wish I was getting old with you
And I knew, the fire and the ashes of his grace
For a while I sat there staring at her photograph
She leaves the pictures hanging on the wall, she burns all
It's never to become
Jealous lovers left behind
One Friday night at a football game
And we will hear those planes overhead
Smell the soda, taste butane
But it's hard to form a good opinion
Let's televise and broadcast
I'll be on your street
De tanto eu te falar voce subverteu o que era um sentimento e assim
You have made me into a quiet man  look at me
Your trouble with living
'Cause you're still around,
"And I am what is left a puppet Laughing at the look of amazement on the musician's face, Pinocchio dove off the cliff and swam away"
Whiterobed small voices praise Him
At the end of this road I might catch a glimpse of me
Take my thoughts for what they're worth
I am the entertainer, been all around the world
And every waking hour
So stay with me
One that would cure me of this cold, winterset heart
What I thought was a dream
I'm coming home to you,
I'm lost here in this moment
Sometimes I feel so worthless
When the dark flood came
Until you're done
Where all my journeys end
And all the world is green
My tears in the typing pool
If I died, died for you, died for you
You're jumping in my bed
No, you've always been the one
Opened my eyes, had a dream last night 
Give me all your love
Crowd surf off a cliff, land out on the ice
The ground you tread under
The doctor told her years ago that she'd go blind if she wasn't careful
Feeding on the prayer
You're the echoes of my everything
Right in my face
Is hardly the best
Just walk away,
To check my inbox 
It's you proudly knowing that your father is doing the right thing now
If you're still free, start runnin' away
Now we see things as in a mirror, dimly
Could still be little
I too once thought life was cruel
Got bubble wrap around my heart
There was a day
Well, I wish there was someone
And the sun sets low
And so we meet alone
Without saying goodbye
Who have done the most singing
And I'm never lonesome when I'm by myself
Mommy, why your own child
There's more in a smile than in a hand
They run to the pines
How my eyes have tired
So rest in peace
Can you see the trees
But I know I was happier with you
Though I try to remain at large
Get off with you, ooh ooh ooh
Don't say
That I swore was everything but beautiful
I know the ocean speaks The stars retreat behind their veil
You hang your head and pray
You always said we'd meet again, someday
'Cause this call costs a fortune and it's late where you live,
Why am I feeling so guilty
I've faith that there's a soul somewhere
Where the biscuits are soft and sweet
That won't stop this drinking
And let go of the rest
Oh nights so loveless, love
Slow fade of love
That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side
I called you from the hotel phone 
Whatever else, what else can I do
I should not be surprised I should have seen it sooner
Her clothes hang in the closet still
And you keep saying you keep saying
From a shellfish or a sheep
Upon the lips of everyone a curse they've never dreamed
With one crushing blow
When the letter says a soldier's coming
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
What I want to feel, I want to feel it now
William & Margaret
I'm afraid to come back home
I'll say something that I'll grow to regret
Interpret the rooms
Yellow walls are lined with portraits
I wanna love you but my hands are tied
I gave into the loneliness
Nothing I think or believe in or say
But I'd be foolish not to say
When we return
Only slightly mental
Why don't we stop fooling ourselves
For  dollars and pieces of silver
I beat yo ass if you walk in this house
There'll always be a place
But I'm addicted to the taste
We don't care what you say 
Take a walk
As the smoke it flushes out
We stalked the streets like animals and danced as windows shattered
I'm walking too far ahead
And as I walked through my door
And there's no need, I know
Since you're not around
There's nothin' but the rain
I sang a hymn to bring me peace
When the days all feel the same 
Don't you make me lie here
But you carry on
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
Well my God, what the hell am I supposed to do
For the short time that I did
Why you haunt me with your violence baby, come hit me
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
And I, I always knew
And you said watch my head about it
Let our crowds be fed on
And I'm living for history
What a rainy ending, 
And sometimes I think you want me to touch you
The yearning to be near you
I'm going to keep your heart
I know for sure that you're home
I'm broken in two
And all the things they took
With every kiss and every letter
And I'm the one who tells you
Baby, don't go away, come here"
Scope out every angle of unfair advantage
You're happier, aren't you
Couldn't park that fucking car
When the laughter fades away
Oh honey I can see your house from here
Growing up without your father in your life
My sighs they ring victorious and fog this tinted glass
The page turns on me and you
You're the leaky sink of sentiment
That should be me, giving you flowers
Can't touch this Can't touch this
So no, of course we can't be friends
Yet you're wasted again
And nagging little thoughts change into things you can't turn off
This letter's written itself inside out again
I'm softly walking on air
And I wish I could feel it
With the loneliest eyes
Losing her lover
In your eyes
Into the world of night
Everybody was being real crazy
Yeah in fact we're almost strangers and I don't know how,
And spread your wings
'Cause I think that I
But you're right
All the martyrs with better ways
Would you have been a little genius, in love with math
This time I think I'm gonna stay
But for memory and clarity
I climbed up a mountain, and looked off the edge
What is an advisor Somebody that's holdin' my checks
And I'm left here with
Two silent birds circled by
Swallowed in the shadows that glow
The back of my hand
ver buscando o sentido daquilo que voce ouviria displicentemente
You told me boy look the other way
What if I'm not what you think I am
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
So I pretend I'm doing all I can
My, suicidal dream
And the city streets a wondrous chorus singing
Wandering over the hills unseen
Pulses glow from their homes
By leaving your town again
The doctor told her years ago to take a pill
You're gonna be swept off your feet
She is soft, she is warm, but my heart remains heavy
Still I sit in diner Citylight
She lay in bed all night watching the morning change into green and gold
Fall from the sky telling us all to go free
Without a word
Say goodbye
Oh, into the dark
That burns in desire's name
I touch you once I touch you twice
You and I had to be the standing joke of the year
I'm suicidal, suicidal dream
No matter where you live
Waiting here in line, hoping that I'll find what I've been chasing
Son, I see it in your eyes
I'm going to ask you to look away
Before you know it's come and gone, too soon
You're homeward bound
Embracing for forever
When I die then I die loving you,
Anything you want it can be done
Get its wings on
I told you this that night
For anything and I agree
Two days past eighteen
You've been asking me to bleed
Just one last time
In pouring rain
'Til the light shines on me
You had come back from the dead
A really big mistake 
Beautiful, only slightly mental
Dirty stepped on lying out on the floor of their room
I baby, I baby you bet your life baby
I envy the wind
The moon so thick, the wounds so fresh
And one's pointing his tree branch at me
Oh babe, meet me in Tompkins Square Park
I'd buy me a used car lot
Taken whatever you needed to
In your saddest dress
With skull designs upon my shoes
Almost too much for my heart
Here comes the first day
And we were only kids
You could have let him fly
I'm going to get myself in fighting trim
Say good morning to
Resting in my chair
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
The Faces stay the same
Walk out on a limb leaning on a cloud that isn't still reveals
And all the gardens bloomed a flower for each day I was away
Closed the door and I tried to hang on and she
White lips kissed
Is this what it feels like to really cry cry
You're all I need
If you'll be waiting
Leave her there with her things on the doorstep,
And what I've done
Through these walls the winter bites
I've let your tiny minds magnify my agony,
I dream about, how it's gonna end
And I watch as her breasts, gently rise, gently fall
I ponder it frequently while I'm sipping on my beer
There was a time when we were young
The spartan Mule and The Crippled Cow
The asshole sports that I never played
You can only see me through a clouded sphere  look at me
I want you to stay, oh
Another bow, another breath  this brilliant chill has come for to shackle
And blessed are the broken
Is this what it feels like to really cry
Every word he said
It's just saturated loneliness
Bright eyes, burning like fire
This is how you feel
Wash their hands and start to pray
I am not one
You've heard my latest record spin on the radio
I can finally say we're through
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
And I'll say your name and in the same breath
Into these twisted months I plunge without a light to follow
A light on the water
And this damp air it's fighting my defroster
And all of the fracturing starts
Spat into an empty room
And tell my secret plans
It's so cold in Alaska
Don't want to hurt you
But heaven couldn't wait for you
Without me by your side
It's all right, I'll be fine
If anyone asks
You're all right, you're all right, you're all right
And decided to stay
As days go by
It's nice to have a little warning 
The language is leaving me in silence
Somethings will never wash away
Santa Monica I'm racing in the lights for you baby
I picked up the phone and I put it down
Maybe I need a little company
And we followed the river
Write a letter to my love
Smoothing out the edges of the stone
Justified with empty words
I remember waiting for you to come
Red and yellow pink and green purple and orange and blue
Is either dead or in prison
My heart just stopped when I was told
For each day a striking distance
And some say this can't be real
I would never lie to you, no
She's gone
The kind of thoughts I got
He was a most peculiar man
I need you so I need you
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
I knew all along
But if there's nothing there to make things change
Up on the shoulder
Would you have been a little angel or an angel of sin
Remember waiting there to find nothing at all
He said, "I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I would like someone to make a map
Fall asleep
The cold wind blows right through my bones
 is forever when you're just a little kid
Take a breath there your heart goes
And I'm thinking two, is better than one
With their hearts on the bible
Nevermind
You saw her bathing on the roof
If nothing is safe then I don't understand
With her father and brothers we're all at the funeral
So many friends now, and none of them mine
Then let me never ever wake again
Looked in the mirror
'Cause you come swimming into view
You're doing all these things out of desperation,
A deal was made and I was paid
Could you get it back again
It always feels like torture
I'll swallow my pride and bite my tongue
Love left dry
Beautiful days are long gone
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you
My love
I'll prolly die anonymous
When the swan flies to heaven
We were shivering yet warmed by the subject matter
Oh you're my best friend
Voce me avisar, me ensinar, falar do que foi pra voce,
Your dad is not guilty
Don't get caught up on the evil things
You stayed up, left to dry, Now you're crumbling
But if I go cold, I won't get sold
Say your goodbyes but darling if you please
Don't you come for me
I can't accept this all because of you I've had to walk away
The days grow short as the nights grow long
Through this memory
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
And I said I haven't been eating chicken or meat or anything 
But the bed ain't made
What I'm thinking 
It was a party, it was going fine
Three months and I'm still sober
Long nights of pasty face tunes
All the people come have gone
Reflecting the glow of the winter moonlight
I'm way in the background
Is nothing new
Never should've let you go hey ey
Catch in my throat, make me pray,
Maybe you got lost in Mexico
But I didn't give them nothing else
I went walking around the city some more
Something in the way you move
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush
Not while I'm still this obsessed
But you were weak and so am I
Like the horses of the sun
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room
Nothing is new
We're all gonna be just dirt in the ground
That circus tiger's gonna break my heart
As my soul heals the shame
There is this thing that's like touching except you don't touch
For my land locked blues
Parking lots
I could clothe a continent 
Every second every moment
The television man is here to show you how
Limbers up and falls timber down
See you looking through me
And it's left me with a chemical dependency for sanity
We still might not want you around
From my mind
You told me boy hide those hands
Who will sing their blues for them
But I didn't mean to hurt you
I won't waste a single day
But if you're not ready for love
Long days of wanting you here
Told me how he's driven by a curse
I wish we could go to hell
And hand you a square of the airport
Brace yourself to the morning alone
Best to go down without a fight
And walk you through the maze of the map that I'm gazing at
Forget about my past, find someone new
And our time couldn't end
Just when that day is coming, who can say, who can say
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
And all will turn
It's in your lamplight burning low
She left before you woke
It's soft edge might cut you
I got to meet expenses, I got to stay in line
I lay back in a glittering mist, and I
Now I step into the line
The ships have come to carry you home
