House full of roses, a letter on the stairs
A tape full of messages for anyone who cares
Collage of broken words and stories full of tears
Remembering your life, 'cause we wish that you were here
Nothing is harder than to wake up all alone
Realize it's not okay, it's the end of all you've known
Time keeps passing by, but it seems I'm frozen still
Scars are left behind, but some too deep to feel
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime
Some days you'll find me in a place I like to go
Ask questions to myself about the things I'll never know
What's left to find? 'Cause I need a little more
I need a little time, can we even up the score?
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime, yeah, woah
Nothing lasts forever, for all good things, it's true
I'd rather trade it all while somehow saving you
It must have been the season that threw us out of line
Once I stood so tall, now I'm searching for a sign
So don't need your salvation with promises unkind
And all the speculation, save it for another time
'Cause we all need a reason, a reason just to stay
Well some just can't be bothered to stick around another day
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We've all been victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
Ooh, we've all been victims of a crime
Victims of a crime
Living with this crime
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
Waking light, your profile in shadow
Brace yourself to the morning alone
Night is gone, long way turning
You've waited long enough to know
When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Lay me down in waking light
No one sees you here, roots are all covered
There's such a life to go and how much can you show?
Day is gone on a landslide a-reeling
It's in your lamplight burning low
When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Rest your eyes in waking light
When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Open your eyes with waking light
It's the Widow now that owns that angry plow
The spartan Mule and The Crippled Cow
The fallow field that will yield no more
As the fox lay sleeping beneath her kitchen floor
The stream can't contain such the withering rain
And from the pasture the fence it is leaning away
The clouds crack and growl like some great cat on the prowl
Crying out, "I am, I am" over and over again
The days grow short as the nights grow long
The kettle sings it's tortured song
As many petalled kiss I place upon her brow
Oh, my lady, lady I am loving you now
The winter birds have come back again
Here the sprightly Chickadee gone now is the Willow Wren
In passing greet each other as if old, old friends
And to the voiceless trees it is their own they will lend
The days grow short as the nights grow long
The kettle sings it's tortured song
As many petaled kiss I place upon her brow
Oh, my lady, lady I am loving you now
And though all these things will change
The memories will remain
As green to gold and gold to brown
The leaves will fall to feed the ground
And in their falling, make no sound
Oh my lady, lady I am loving you now
I've gathered all my money and I'm goin' to town
To buy my lady a long and flowing gown
'Cause come tomorrow morning we're off to the county fair
I'll find a yellow flower and I will lace it in her hair
The days grow short as the nights grow long
The kettle sings it's tortured song
As many petaled kiss I place upon her brow
Oh, my lady, lady I am loving you now
Oh, my lady, lady I am loving you now
A house of cards
A supple heart
Is not a place to dwell
Now you have your cake
Don't hesitate
Come on just do it,
Come on just do it
Put it in your mouth
There is only now
Tomorrow has to wait
But know there's no backing out
This is gonna be reality
You can never dream it down
I have No way
Of telling
The two apart
Well I made amends
In the general sense
But the devil's in the details
And I know the cause
And I want to stop
But I can't do it,
I just can't do it
There was love I meant
There were accidents
So tell me which is which
'Cause I just can't work it out
But for memory and clarity
We had better write it down
I have no way
Of knowing the truth
With time dissolves
I put the past into the ground
I saw the future as a cloud
If there's still time to turn around
I'm going to
Its just one day I fell asleep
And all day all night I dreamed
I am the first one I deceive
If I can make myself believe
The rest is easy...
This is as quiet as it gets
Hush down now
Go to sleep
We were once perfect, me and you
We'll never leave this room
Hush, you color my eyes red
Your love's not alive, it's dead
This letter's written itself inside out again
When the rivers turn to roads
And lovers become trends
Hush, this is where it ends
This is where it ends
This is the calming before the storm
It's absolution
It's always incomplete
It's always bittersweet
Hush, you color my eyes red
Your love's not alive, it's dead
This letter's written itself inside out again
When the rivers turn to roads
And lovers become trends
Hush, this is where it ends
I won't make a sound so you don't wake
You don't wake, you don't wake
You don't wake
Hush, you color my eyes red
Your love's not alive, it's dead
This letter's written itself inside out again
When the rivers turn to roads
And lovers become trends
Hush, this is where it ends
Hush, you color my eyes red
Your love's not alive, it's dead
This letter's written itself inside out again
When the rivers turn to roads
And lovers become trends
Hush, this is where it ends
Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush
This is where it ends
Dear Bradentown
You have been good to me
You've kept your word
And got me through these years
All I ask
Is that you'll be there
When I return
From Anna's isle to
To lake woods fields
This is our town
This is who we're meant to be
And this is our town
Where our roots have grown so deep
This is our town
This is where we're meant to be
This is our town
We'll keep coming back because...
Dear Bradentown
As the city sleeps tonight
You found us hiding out
Under parking garage lights
And you know
You know you'll find us here
When we return
This is our town
This is our town
This is our town
(What are we running for?)
This is our town
(What are we running for?)
This is our town
(This is our town)
Dear Bradentown
As I gently close my eyes
I hear you whisper softly
As we continue our goodbyes
And all I ask
Is that you'll be there
When I return
Eighty-Six Charlie came over
He asked me for a favour
Asked me a question
Asked me to make an exception
Eighty-Six Charlie, he came back
Said he'd been thinking it over
Said he's had a change of heart
He thinks he's made a grave mistake
But I, I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you
You make things so easy
I'll never forget you
Eighty-Six Charlie, he came back, he came back
Sat down at the table, and for the last time
Said he's finally made up his mind
He wonders if it's not too late
It's not too late because
I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you
You made me so angry
I'll never forget you
The gymnast, high above the ground,
Limbers up and falls timber down
Ankles splayed and all tied
The gymnast long has arrived
Lazy, your long sister lays
Waiting out this long light brigade
Prayed for snow a long time
And lazy, it long has arrived
Through the tarlatan holes
You've been slipping, been slipping away
And the weather will hold
It's been ever so, ever so gray
La dee da dum.
And here as we're coming down
We're sounding out: it's a terrible, terrible tide
As it lights upon your eye
But there on the motorway, reeks of marmalade,
It's a chemical, chemical kind
As it lights upon your eye
Lights upon your eye
The boatswain calls upon the quay
Compass gone, he long has lost his way
To lighthouse shine, to calm tide
The boatswain long has arrived
Through the tarlatan holes
You've been slipping, been slipping away
And the weather will hold
It's been ever so, ever so gray
And here as we're coming down
We're sounding out: it's a terrible, terrible tide
As it lights upon your eye
But there on the motorway, reeks of marmalade,
It's a chemical, chemical kind
As it lights upon your eye
Lights upon your eye
April marches on
April marches on
April marches on
April marches on
Tall rock shelf
Are you maybe here to help me hurt myself
Miasma sky
Would you swallow me alive
Tall rock shelf
Are you maybe here to help me hurt myself
Miasma sky
Would you swallow me alive
(Otherwise there's very little you can do for me)
Tall rock shelf
Are you maybe here to help me hurt myself
Miasma sky
Would you swallow me alive
Tall rock shelf
Are you maybe here to help me hurt myself
(Otherwise there's very little you can do for me)
Miasma sky
Would you swallow me alive
Come to me now
And lay your hands over me
Even if it's a lie
Say it will be alright
And I shall believe
I'm broken in two
And I know you're on to me
That I only come home
When I'm so all alone
But I do believe
That not everything is gonna be the way
You think it ought to be
It seems like every time I try to make it right
It all comes down on me
Please say honestly you won't give up on me
And I shall believe
And I shall believe
Open the door
And show me your face tonight
I know it's true
No one heals me like you
And you hold the key
Never again
Would I turn away from you
I'm so heavy tonight
But your love is alright
And I do believe
That not everything is gonna be the way
You think it ought to be
It seems like every time I try to make it right
It all comes down on me
Please say honestly
You won't give up on me
And I shall believe
I shall believe
And I shall believe
That not everything is gonna be the way
You think it ought to be
It seems like every time I try to make it right
It all comes down on me
Please say honestly
You won't give up on me
And I shall believe
I shall believe
And I shall believe
And I shall believe
And I shall believe
Please say honestly
You won't give up on me
And I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
What's so wrong? Why the face so long? Is it over?
And where you going that you no longer belong here?
And distance tells you that distance must come between love
Where have you been, Luv? When the mistake we made
Was in never having planned to fall to fall in love, Luv
Singing this song, singing along
Makes it easier for me to see you go
But in doing so, in letting you go
It only serves to show me that I'm still in love with you
Singing this song, singing along
Makes it easier for me to see you go
But in doing so, in letting you go
It only serves to show me that I'm still in love with you
So what's so wrong? Why the face so long? Are you changing?
And where you been to that you no longer remember?
And distance tells you that distance must come between love
Where have you been, Luv? When the mistake we made
Was in never having planned to fall to fall in love, Luv
It's just the chance we took
Having never ever planned to fall in love, Luv
It's just the chance we took
Having never ever planned to fall in love, Luv, Luv
At the center of the world
There's a statue of a girl,
She is standing near a well
With a bucket bare and dry.
I went and looked her in the eyes
And she turned me into sand,
This clumsy form that I despise
It scattered easy in her hand.
And came to rest upon a beach
With a million others there,
We sat and waited for the sea
To stretch out so that we could disappear
Into the endlessness of blue,
Into the horror of the truth,
See, we are far less than we knew.
Yeah, we are far less than we knew.
But we knew what we could taste.
Girls found honey to drench our hands.
Men cut marble to mark our graves,
Saying, "we'll need something to remind us
Of all the sweetness that has passed through us."
(Fresh sangria and lemon tea.)
The priests dressed children for choir
(White-robed small voices praise Him.)
But found no joy in what was sung,
The funeral had begun.
In the middle of the day,
When you drive home to your place
From that job that makes you sleep
Back to the thoughts that keep you awake,
Long after night has come to claim
Any light that still remains
In the corner of the frame
That you put around her face.
Two pills just weren't enough,
The alarm clock's going off
But you're not waking up,
This isn't happening, happening, happening, happening, happening.
It is.
Opened my eyes, had a dream last night 
That both my arms were broken 
Evening time
Help me now or hold me down
I feel the world is tumbling
Spiralling down
Oh my love I can't let go
Something's wrong, I can't let go
Nature's cruel she laughs at me
As I make my way through the century
As I slowly turn to house dust
Tumbling down
The rain comes down like a victory
In sheets of shining memory
Over and over circling around
Oh my love I can't let go
Something's wrong, I can't let go
Nature's cruel she laughs at me
Almost too much for my heart
When it rains
Oh tears my soul apart
When it rains
It rains so slowly
In the city where I'm from
Let the water come
She's the only one I love
Let the fat man drop
She's the sweetest honey pot
Will they see the sky again?
Who will sing their blues for them?
Let the factories rust
She's the only thing I trust
Let the virus spread
She's the silk lining my bed
Will they breathe our air again?
Who will sing their blues for them?
When you're feeling moved
You can have your conscience all you want
You can't say I do nothing
Yeah, I put it off
Where are you gonna go if they come for you?
Will there be someone left to sing your blues?
Where you gonna run when they come for you?
Will there be someone left to sing your blues?
Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set me free
Oh, lonesome me
There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about my past, find someone new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me
I'll bet she's not like me
She's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so
And brother, don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about my past, find someone new
I can't get over how she set me free
Oh, lonesome me
I'm having trouble sleeping
You're jumping in my bed
Twisting in my head
Leave me
I'm having trouble breathing
You're sitting on my chest
I sure could use the rest
Leave me
It's you
Why's it always you
And never me?
I've never dared to let
My feelings free
Why's it always you
And never me?
I've never cared
Too much about honesty
I'm having trouble sleeping
I'm thinking of what you said
About the tears been shed
Leave me
It's you
Now and always you
But never me
I've never dared to
Let my feelings free
Why's it always you
And never me?
I've never cared
Too much about honesty
Laura are you still living there
On your estate of sorrow?
You used to leave it occasionally
But now you don't even bother
To ride the commuter train
West to Chicago,
To stroll through the greenery
In the park past the statues
How their eyes seemed to follow you
Like a hated addiction
Their beauty carved out of absolutes you could never claim
Or even envision
Laura you were the saddest song
In the shape of a woman
Yeah I thought you were beautiful
But I wept with your movements
But I hope that you're laughing now
From that place on the carpet
Where we shared a sleeping bag
In your sister's apartment
Oh how she would worry so
You know I was just a stranger
But she asked me to care for you
Yes she did
And I went and betrayed her
But do you know we're in high demand
Laura, us, people who suffer
Because we don't take to arguing
And we're quick to surrender
Well I think I would call tonight
If I still had your number
Your thoughts have always laid close to mine
We were both skipping supper
But you should never be embarrassed by
Your trouble with living
'Cause it's the ones with the sorest throats, Laura,
Who have done the most singing
La la la la la la. la la la lah...
I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
With blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
That's the message that I sent
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
With blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
Though I have a broken heart
I'm too busy to be heartbroken
There's a lot of things that need to be done
Lord I have a broken heart
Though I have a broken dream
I'm too busy to be dreaming of you
There's a lot of things that I gotta do
Lord I have a broken dream
And I'm wasted all the time
I've gotta drink you right off of my mind
I've been told that this will heal given time
Lord I have a broken heart
And I'm crying all the time
I have to keep it covered up with a smile
And I'll keep on moving on for a while
Lord I have a broken heart
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny
You've got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
No, no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen there is just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your PJ's
Getting ready for school
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Never grow up
Just never grow up
I've got to breathe
You can't take that from me
'Cause it's all that you left that's mine
You had to leave
And that's all I can see
But you told me your love was blind
There are times
You're so impossible that I should sign a waiver
And you will find
Someone worth walking on when you ask me to go
I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath there your heart goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
There was a day
You threw our love away
Then you passed it to someone new
You wanna stay
But since you wanna play
I can finally say we're through
There are times 
You're so impossible and you ask me to go
I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath there your heart goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
You can scream there's just echoes
Pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
I'll leave but just know
As I lay in solitude
Oh, what's a boy supposed to do?
I shake the very thought of you
Me together, I remember
Late nights when I stayed up late
All I do is wait and wait
You're never coming home to me
That's the hardest thing to see
I got to breathe
You can't take that from me
I can finally say we're through
I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath there your heart goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows
You can scream, there's just echoes
Pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
On every face you'll ever know
And everywhere you ever go
You'll feel when the wind blows
Oh, the tears that you weep
For the poor tortured souls
Who fall at your feet
With their love begging bowls
All the clerks and the tailors
The sharks and the sailors
All good at their trades but
They'll always be failures
Alms for the poor
For the wretched disciples
And the love that they swore
With their hearts on the bible
Beseeching the honour
To sit at your table
And feast on your holiness
As long as they're able
Love needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers
You're holding court
With your lips and your smile
Your body's a halo
Their minds are on trial
Sure as Adam is Eve
Sure as Jonah turned whaler
They're crooked love thieves
And you are their jailor
Love needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers
I wander lonely streets
Behind where the old Thames does flow
And in every face I meet
Reminds me of what I have run for
In every man, in every hand
In every kiss you understand
That living is for other men
I hope you too will understand
I've gotta tell you my tale
Of how I loved and how I failed
I hope you understand
Oh, these feelings should not be in the man
In every child, in every eye
In every sky above my head
I hope that I know
So come with me in bed
Because it's you and me, we're history
There ain't nothing left to say
When I will get you alone
Maybe we could find a room
Where we could see what we should do
Maybe you know it's true
Living with me's like keeping a fool
In every man, in every hand
In every kiss you understand
That living is for other men
I hope you know that I am me
So come on, I'm thinking about history
And I'm living for history
And I think you know about me
'Cause I am
And one and one is two
But three is company
When you're thinking about the things you do
And you're thinking about the things you do
I wanna tell you my tale
And how I failed in love and jumped out on my bail
Do you understand?
There's more in a smile than in a hand
In every sky, in every kiss
There's one thing that you might have missed
And why am I going to
A place that now belongs to you
But you were weak and so am I
Let's make it up, let's even try
To live today, so why not smile?
Don't dream away your life
Cause it is mine, it is mine
Is that a crime?
Is that a crime?
This life is mine
But the bed ain't made
It's filled full of hope
I've got a skin full of dope
Oh, the bed ain't made
But it's filled full of hope
I've got a skin full of dope
Calm down
Deep breaths
And get yourself dressed instead
Of running around
And pulling all your threads saying
Breaking yourself up
If it's a broken part, replace it
If it's a broken arm then brace it
If it's a broken heart then face it
And hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your own name
And go your own way
And everything will be fine
Hang on
Help is on the way
Stay strong
I'm doing everything
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
And everything, everything will be fine
Everything
Are the details in the fabric
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling?
Are the things that make you blow
Hell, no reason, go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault
Of faulty manufacturing.
Yeah everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Everything
Hold your own
And know your name
And go your own way
Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling? (Go your own way)
Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic (Go your own way)
Is it Mother Nature's sewing machine?
Are the things that make you blow (Hold your own, know your name)
Hell no reason go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault (Go your own way)
Of faulty manufacturing
Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Hearts will hold
The lights exploded
She stood burning in front of me
She ripped my heart out beating
My eyes wouldn't open, cemented to her face
Have I begun a feeble chase?
I'll be down, I'll be around
I'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be
I'll just stare and hope you'll care
It's only everything standing in front of me
I know what you did to me
I know what you did was wrong
You're allowed to torture me
Wait a moment until I'm gone
I know you're the ticket, you gotta be
'Cause I let you alone for long
Got to be so completely
Got to be so I can't hang on
(You're killing me)
I'll be down, I'll be around
I'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be
I'll just stare and hope you'll care
It's only everything standing in front of me
I'll be down, I'll be around
I'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be
Then that man is standing there
Now you'll have to decide the fate of my sanity
You better open the door
Before I take a hammer to the walls around it
I cannot let you inside my cell
For fear I'll sink the ship and drag us both down
Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in
Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in
Matt makes his murderous demand
Foreign films, I take a stand
And it's all uphill from here
At least I hope so
Kate claims she can't depend on me
For anything and I agree
It's crystal clear
I reach for the bottle and disappear
Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in
Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in
Frank fails to see the humor in
My sad attempts at breakdancing
In every bar
Along Lyndale Avenue
Liz likes to liquor up my thoughts
From the C.C. Club to the Triple Rock
There's no escape
From the chorus of people screaming
You better open the door
Before I take a hammer to the walls around it
I cannot let you inside my cell
For fear I'll sink the ship and drag us both down
Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in
Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in
I'll swim backwards, I'll swim backwards
I'll swim backwards, I'll swim backwards
I'll swim backwards, I'll swim backwards
I'll swim alone the long goodbye
You better open the door
Before I take a hammer to the walls around it
I cannot let you inside my cell
For fear I'll sink the ship and drag us both down
I'm back, back in town
And everything has changed
I feel, feel let down
The faces stay the same
I see, see shadows
Of who we used to be
When I drive, drive so slow
Through this memory
When we were only kids
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go of the rest
I heard, heard myself
Say things I'd take back
If I could, could retell
And make these stories last
I see, see shadows
Of who we'll always be
I drive, drive these roads
That made our memories
When we were only kids
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go of the rest
Shadows and regrets
We let go of the rest
Everything has changed
The Faces stay the same
Everything has changed
The Faces stay the same
When We were only kids
And our time couldn't end
And how tall did we stand
With the world in our hands
And we were only kids
And we were best of friends
And we hoped for the best
And let go of the rest
The shadows and regrets
We let go of the rest
The Shadows and Regrets
We let go of the rest
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So, I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls,
And paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there loving you,
And wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story,
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
So, just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody,
If I died, died for you, died for you
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you
It's a good year for a murder
She's praying to Jesus
She's pulling the trigger
There's no tears
'Cause he's not here
She washes her hands
And she fixes the dinner
But soon they'll be coming to rush her away
No one's so sure if her crime had a reason
But reasons like seasons they constantly change
And the seasons of lies still like reasons are flowing, away
Away with this spilled milk?
Away with this dirty dishwater?
Away
Seventeen years and all that he gave was a daughter
It's me and the moon she says
I got no trouble with that
And I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me die
It's me and the moon she says
And it's over, it just started
The blood stained the carpet
Her heart like a crystal
She's lucid and departed
A life left behind she can find in her mind, gone away
Away with these nightmares
Away with suburbia shakedown
Away
You marry a role and you give up your soul till you break down
It's me and the moon she says
I got no trouble with that
And I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me die
It's me and the moon she says
But what do you say we go for a ride
What do you say we get high
But I'm so tired of days that feel like the night
It's me and the moon she says
I got no trouble with that
And I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me die
And I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me die
And I am a butterfly
And I am a butterfly
And I am a butterfly
I force myself through another day
Can't explain the way today just fell apart like everything
Right in my face
And I try to be the one
I can't accept this all because of you I've had to walk away
From everything
And I'm afraid to be alone
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
I'm afraid to come back home
Another sleepless night again
Hotel rooms my only friend and friends like that just don't add up
To anything
And I try so hard to be
Everything that I should never take away from you again
'Cause I heard you say
And I'm afraid to be alone
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
I'm afraid to come back home
I cannot forget
I live with regret
I cannot forget
I live with...
I live through this
I can't see through this
I can't do this anymore
'Cause I'm afraid to be alone
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
I'm afraid to come back home
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
And I just wish I was back home
Oh babe, meet me in Tompkins Square Park
I wanna hold you in the dark
One last time
Just one last time
And oh babe, can you tell what's on my tongue?
Can you guess that I'll be gone?
With the twilight
With the twilight
But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't, they say they don't
Oh babe, I've never been so lost
I wanna hear you lie
One last time
Just one last time
But oh babe, I really wish you would not cry
I only ever told you one lie
When it could have been a thousand
It might as well have been a thousand
But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No they don't, they say they don't
And we can talk it round again girl
Round and round, round and round again
Or we could leave it out to die
Leave it out, just leave it out
I never tried to trick you babe
I just tried to work it out
But I was swallowed up by doubt
If only things were black and white
'Cause I just want to hold you tight
Without holding back my mind
Without holding back my mind
But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
So much is going on
But you can always come around
Yes, why don't you sit with me for just a little while?
Tell me, what's wrong?
If you just give me all your love
Gimme all you got, baby
Gimme all your love
Still more
So tell me what you wanna do
You say the weather doesn't sit with you
Why don't you talk to me for just a little while?
I can only try to make it right
If you just give me all your love
Gimme all you got, baby
Gimme all your love
Still more
Give me all your love
Give me all you got, baby
Give me all your love
We have no future
Heaven wasn't made for me
We burn ourselves to hell
As fast as it can be
And I wish that I could be the king
Then I'd know that I am not alone
Maggots put on shirts
Sell each others shit
Sometimes I feel so worthless
Sometimes I feel discarded
I wish that I was good enough
Then I'd know that I am not alone
Death is policeman
Death is the priest
Death is the stereo
Death is a TV
Death is the Tarot
Death is an angel and
Death is our God
Killing us all
She put the seeds in me
Plant this dying tree
She's a burning string
And I'm just the ashes
She put the seeds in me
Plant this dying tree
She's a burning string
And I'm just the ashes
Nothing I am
Nothing I dream
Nothing is new
Nothing I think or believe in or say
Nothing is true
It used to be so easy
I never even tried
Yeah it used to be so easy...
But the last day of summer
Never felt so cold
The last day of summer
Never felt so old
Never felt so...
All that I have
All that I hold
All that is wrong
All that I feel for or trust in or love
All that is gone
It used to be so easy
I never even tried
Yeah it used to be so easy...
But the last day of summer
Never felt so cold
The last day of summer
Never felt so old
The last day of summer
Never felt so cold
Never felt so...
(I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth)
What's up, family? Yeah, it's yo cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man. I know you been havin' a lot on yo mind lately, and I know you feel like, you know, people ain't been prayin' for you. But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart." See, family, that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way...
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, why don't you burn this muh'fucka?
I beat yo ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from poopoo and 'prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo ass, lil nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Yo' teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got beaucoup payments to make
County building's on my ass
Tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo ass if I beat yo ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth)
I'll prolly die anonymous
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me false accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers
Are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I've been hungry all my life
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
Now...
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out
And just kill somethin', drill somethin'
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal
If my reputation would miss me
What they see from me
Would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me
Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn
Goddamn you
Goddamn me
Goddamn us
Goddamn we
Goddamn us all
Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee. So, just like your children, your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you. God bless you, shalom
Well, you're back in your old neighborhood
The cigarettes taste so good
But you're so misunderstood
You're so misunderstood
There's something there that you can't find
Honest when you're tellin' a lie
You're hurt but you don't know why
You love her but you don't know why
Short on long term goals
There's a party there that we oughtta go to
Do you still love rock and roll?
Do you still love rock and roll?
It's only a quarter to three
Reflecting off the O.C.D.
You're looking at a picture of me
You're staring at a picture of me
Take the guitar player for a ride
'Cause he ain't never been satisfied
He thinks he owes some kind of debt
Be years before he gets over it
There's a fortune inside your head
All you touch turns to lead
You think you might just crawl back in bed
The fortune inside your head
You know you're just a mama's boy
Positively unemployed
So misunderstood
So misunderstood
I know you're gotta God shaped hole
Leanin' out your pedastal
So misunderstood
So misunderstood
So misunderstood
So misunderstood
I'd like to thank you all for nothin'
I'd like to thank you all for nothin' at all
I'd like to thank you all for nothin'
Nothin'
Nothin'
Nothin'
Nothin'
Nothin' at all
Nothin'
Nothin'
Nothin'
Nothin' at all
Well I'm a modern guy
I don't care much for the go-go 
Or the retro image I see so often
Telling me to keep trying
Maybe you'll get here someday 
Keep up the working, okay
I close the book on them right there
I see myself change as the days change over
I hear the songs and the words don't change
I write them out of the book right there
We've been had, you say it's over
Sometimes I'm just happy I'm older
We've been had, I know it's over
Somehow it got easy to laugh out loud
See me age nineteen with some dumb haircut from 1960
Moving to New York City
Live with my friends there
We're all taking the same steps
They're foolish now
We've been had, you say it's over
Sometimes I'm just happy I'm older
We've been had, I know it's over
Somehow it got easy to laugh out loud
When the laughter fades away
Ma vie
Tout ma vie
When there's nothing more to say
Ma vie
My oh my
It's the last laugh of the laughter
Sur la dernier page du chapitre
On the last day of the year
Ma vie
Tout ma vie
When the spotlight drifts away
Ma vie
C'est la vie
When the blue sky turns to grey
Ma vie
My oh my
It's the last laugh of the laughter
Sur la dernier page du chapitre
On the last day of the year
Ma vie
Tout ma vie
When the laughter fades away
Ma vie
Tout ma vie
When there's nothing more to say
Ma vie
My oh my
It's the last laugh of the laughter
Sur la dernier page du chapitre
On the last day of the year
Ma vie
Tout ma vie
Ma vie
My oh my
Our children will always hear
Romantic tales of distant years
Our gilded age may come and go
Our crooked dreams will always glow
Stick with me
Oh, you're my best friend
All of my life
You've always been
Remember, remember
All we fight for
Remember, remember
All we fight for
Don't leave me
Oh you're my best friend
All of my life
You've always been
Don't leave me now
You're my best friend
All of my life
You've always been
Remember, remember
All we fight for
Remember, remember
All we fight for
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Six in the morning
The men started working
I can't sleep
No, I can't sleep
I keep feeling the lights
So I think I should get up and call you
Going to find you
And it's fun
Thinking of you like a movie star
And it's dumb
Thinking of you like the way that you were
Everyone loves you
The boy in the corner
The postman
The policeman
It does me no good 
To keep looking ahead at your future
Adoration
And it's fun
Thinking of you like a movie star
And it's dumb
Thinking of you like the way that you were
Every moment like a sudden pleasure
Every moment that will get you by
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
I've seen all kinds of strangers
The rich and the famous
They don't count
No, they don't count
Now I'm back on my beat
On the same greasy street
There's an angel on my shoulder
Saying, "Ho, have you ever said an honest word?"
Saying, "Yo, have you ever said a pretty word?"
Every moment like a sudden pleasure
Every moment that will get you by
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
Don't touch me
If you touch me you could never go back
Faith
Come on, sister have a drink
Have a seat at the bar
Tell me all about your men
And your hopes 
And the hours of your life
You could love
After all that's what you're looking for
You can love
It's a currency unspoken of
But it's hard to form a good opinion
Yet you're going to look at me that way
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
Don't touch me
If you touch me you can never go back
Faith
Come on, sister have a drink
Have a seat at the bar
Tell me all about your men
And your hopes 
And the hours of your life
Thinking of blue thunder
Singing to myself
Thinking how fast it moves
Feeling how it turns
I was singing something
Out on Route 128
Thinking how blue it looks
Singing out aloud
My my blue thunder
My my blue thunder
My my blue thunder
Singing out aloud
My my blue thunder
My my blue thunder
My my blue thunder
Singing out aloud
I'll drive so far away
I'll drive so far away
I'll drive so far away
I'll drive so far away
Blue thunder
Blue thunder
Blue thunder
Blue thunder
In the dark of the night I found
Without my love, my love
These words are not a bit profound
If it's just another cheap line flung
Outside ecstatic love
What did we think we'd find?
Over that broken road
Out past the land mines
I'm going to keep your heart
I'm going to keep your heart
With the world all falling apart
I'm going to keep your heart
Can I coax it out its shell
Brush the dust off
Get its wings on
In this little bell
We will also feel the singing, oh
Shine on, light of love
On all these bruises and scars
Ruins in every less
But it can't cancel out the stars
Dropped all your clothes and life
Wonder who won mine
Kneeling above this playful body
Teach Superman to fly
How'm I gonna keep your heart?
How'm I gonna keep your heart?
If the world all falls apart
How'm I gonna keep your heart?
Time alone will tell
If you're the kind who keeps the veil on
Biding time will tell us
When and if to sail on
All these blues I have cried
Seem to have come undone
Tried all the new designs
Still ended up in love
Still we're kind of shy
You've nothing to be ashamed of
Though its hard to tell
If I'll ever feel the same love
I'm gonna keep your heart
I'm gonna keep your heart
If the world all falls apart
Still, I'm gonna keep your heart
Give me all your love now
'Cause for all we know
We might be dead by tomorrow
I can't
Go on wasting my time
Adding scars to my heart
'Cause all I hear is
"I'm not ready now"
And I can tell
That you didn't have
To face your mother
Losing her lover
Without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
'Cause she didn't have time
I don't want to judge
What's in your heart
But if you're not ready for love
How can you be ready for life?
How can you be ready for life?
So let's love fully
And let's love loud
Let's love now
'Cause soon enough we'll die
'Cause soon enough we'll die
'Cause soon enough we'll die
'Cause soon enough we'll die
'Cause soon enough we'll die
'Cause soon enough we'll die
This is a ballad for the good times
So put a battery in your leg
Put a rock beat over anything
Get it stuck there in your head
You can be with me
I got nothing to rely on
I've broken every bone
Everybody's stopped believing
But you know you're not alone
You can be with me
This is a ballad for the good times
And all the dignity we had
Don't get caught up on the evil things
You ain't coming back
You can be with me
If you wanna be
You can be with me
Le ciel bleu sur nous peut s'effondrer
Et la terre peut bien s'ecrouler
Peu m'importe si tu m'aimes
Je me fous du monde entier
Tant que l'amour inondera mes matins
Tant que mon corps fremira sous tes mains
Peu m'importent les problemes
Mon amour, puisque tu m'aimes
J'irais jusqu'au bout du monde
Je me ferais teindre en blonde
Si tu me le demandais
J'irais decrocher la lune
J'irais voler la fortune
Si tu me le demandais
Je renierais ma patrie
Je renierais mes amis
Si tu me le demandais
On peut bien rire de moi
Je ferais n'importe quoi
Si tu me le demandais
Si un jour la vie t'arrache a moi
Si tu meurs, que tu sois loin de moi
Peu m'importe, si tu m'aimes
Car moi je mourrai aussi
Nous aurons pour nous l'eternite
Dans le bleu de toute l'immensite
Dans le ciel, plus de problemes
Mon amour, crois-tu qu'on s'aime?
Dieu reunit ceux qui s'aiment
Father don't you go
Let's just take a walk in the afternoon ... look at me
Mother don't you know
You can only see me through a clouded sphere ... look at me
Walk out on a limb leaning on a cloud that isn't still reveals
Looking down a cliff it isn't fun it's communicating fear
Say what you say, say it like a cat
Say it to my face and say what you know every one says
Say what you say, say it like a cat
Say it to my face and say what you know every one says
Father don't you know
You have made me into a quiet man ... look at me
Mother don't you go
You are a long way away from me ... look at me
I see you as you see me ... look at me
Change your heart 'cause I am already spoken for
Change your heart 'cause I am already spoken for
Say what you say, say it like a cat
Say it to my face and say what you know every one says
Say what you say, say it like a cat
Say it to my face and say what you know every one says
Everyday I feel the same
Stuck and I could never change
Sucked into a black balloon
Spat into an empty room
Was it really worth it?
Did I really deserve it?
It happens when you're hurtin'
And cut me at the surface
Of my heart
Of my hea-a-art
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Only alive, -live, -live, -live
When I pretend, -tend, -tend, -tend
That I have died, died, died, died, died, died
I haven't lived life, I haven't lived love
Just bird's eye view from the sky above
I'm dead, dead, dead, dead
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead
Got bubble wrap around my heart
Waiting for my life to start
But everyday it never comes
Permanently at square one
When it's late at night
I'm so dissatisfied
The weight of an empty life
Will lessen in the moonlight
In the light
In the light, light, light
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Only alive, -live, -live, -live
When I pretend, -tend, -tend, -tend
That I have died, died, died, died, died, died
I haven't lived life, I haven't lived love
Just bird's eye view from the sky above
I'm dead, dead, dead, dead
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead
I lay back in a glittering mist, and I
I think of all the men I, I could've kissed
I haven't lived my life, I haven't lived love
It's just a bird's eye view from, from up above
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Only alive, -live, -live, -live
When I pretend, -tend, -tend, -tend
That I have died, died, died, died, died, died
I haven't lived life, I haven't lived love
Just bird's eye view from the sky above
I'm dead, dead, dead, dead
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead
Only alive, -live, -live, live
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Only alive, -live, -live, live
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Only alive, -live, -live, live
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead
Rihanna:
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air and said show me something
He said, if you dare come a little closer
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Mikky Ekko:
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay
Rihanna and Mikky Ekko:
Oh the reason I hold on
Oh 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light, it's hard to know which one of us is caving
Rihanna:
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Rihanna and Mikky Ekko:
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
Rihanna:
I want you to stay, stay
Rihanna and Mikky Ekko:
I want you to stay, oh
I found a letter that said, "I'm sorry that you were asleep when I wrote these words down"
You'd think I'd ought to be used to that by now
Save for a few of those late night episodes, missed opportunities, and "I don't care's"
There's not a lot that I feel obliged to share or talk about
I'll have my brother stop by this Saturday to
Pick up my things, just make sure you're not there
This may sound bad, and don't take it the wrong way
I love you, however...
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You're the echoes of my everything
You're the emptiness the whole world sings at night
You're the laziness of afternoon
You're the reason why I burst and why I bloom
How will I break the news to you?
How will I break the news to you?
Cancel our dinner with Max and Coraline
Feed Jacky's gerbil and try to stay clean
We'll talk it over after I've had some time
Alone to sort it out
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You're the echoes of my everything
You're the emptiness the whole world sings at night
You're the laziness of afternoon
You're the reason why I burst and why I bloomed
You're the leaky sink of sentiment
You're the failed attempts I never could forget
You're the metaphors I can't create
To comprehend this curse that I call love
How will I break the news to you?
How will I break the news to you?
How will I break the news to you?
How will I break the news to you?
How will I break the news to you?
So this is odd
The painful realization that all has gone wrong
And nobody cares at all
And nobody cares at all
So you buried all your lover's clothes
And burned the letters lover wrote
But it doesn't make it any better
Does it make it any better?
And the plaster dented from your fist
In the hall where you had your first kiss
Reminds you that the memories will fade
So this is strange
Our sidestepping has come to be a brilliant dance
Where nobody leads at all
Where nobody leads at all
And the picture frames are facing down
And the ringing from this empty sound
Is deafening and keeping you from sleep
And breathing is a foreign task
And thinking's just too much to ask
And you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights
This is incredible
Starving, insatiable
Yes, this is love for the first time
Well you'd like to think that you were invincible
Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time?
Well this is the last time
This is the last time
This is the last time
Wipe the make-up from your face
Tie your hair and gently fall from grace
Until I come again
Take the disaffected life
Men who ran the company ran your life
You could have been his wife
I wanna love you but my hands are tied
I wanna stay here but I've been denied
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun does rise
Wipe the sweat from off your brow
All that you believe is here and now
You could have had more doubt
Wipe the shadow from your eyes
Rest your daughter while your mother cries
You could have let him fly
I wanna hold you but my hands are tied
I wanna stay here but I've been denied
I wanna lie here 'til we've killed this bitter doubt
I wanna hold you but my hands are tied
I wanna stay here but I've been denied
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun does rise
I wanna hold you but my hands are tied
I wanna sleep here but I've been denied
I wanna stay here 'til we've killed this bitter doubt
I wanna hold you but my hands are tied
I wanna sleep here but I've been denied
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun comes out
Long afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
'Til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
And you sang, "Sail to me, sail to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am, here I am
Waiting to hold you"
Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you here when I was full sail?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken, lovelorn on your rocks
For you sing, "Touch me not, touch me not
Come back tomorrow"
O my heart, o my heart
Shies from the sorrow
Well, I'm as puzzled as the newborn child
I'm as riddled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Or should I lie with death, my bride?
Hear me sing, "Swim to me, swim to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am, here I am
Waiting to hold you"
Leaf by leaf and page by page
Throw this book away
All the sadness, all the rage
Throw this book away
Rip out the binding and tear the glue
And all of the grief we never even knew
We had it all along
Now it's smoke
The things we've written in it
Never really happened
All the things we've written in it
Never really happened
And all of the people come and gone
Never really lived
All the people come have gone
No one to forgive
Smoke
We will not write a new one
There will not be a new one
Another one, another one
Here's an evening dark with shame
(Throw it on the fire)
Here's the time I took the blame
(Throw it on the fire)
Here is the time when we didn't speak
It seems, for years and years
And here's a secret
No one will ever know
The reasons for the tears
They are smoke
Smoke
Smoke
We will not write a new one
There will not be a new one
Another one, another one 
Where do all the secrets live?
They travel in the air
You can smell them when they burn
They travel
Those who say the past is not dead
Can stop and smell the smoke
You keep saying the past is not dead
Well, stop and smell the smoke (you keep saying)
You keep on saying the past is not even past (you keep saying)
And you keep saying (you keep saying)
We are smoke
Smoke
Smoke
Well, you're my friend
(It's what you told me anyway)
And can you see
(What's inside of me anyway)
Many times we've been out drinking
And many times we've shared our thoughts
But did you ever, ever notice
The kind of thoughts I got
Well, you know I have a love
A love for everyone I know
And you know I have a drive
To live, I won't let go
Could you see its opposition
Comes rising up sometimes
That its dreadful anteposition
Comes blacking in my mind
(And) That I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And did you know how much I love you
Here's a hope that somehow you
Can save me from this darkness
Well, I hope that someday, buddy
We have peace in our lives
Together or apart
Alone or with our wives
And we can stop our whoring
And pull the smiles inside
And light it up forever
And never go to sleep
My best unbeaten brother
This isn't all I see
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Did you know how much I love you
Is a hope that somehow you, you
Can save me from this darkness
Beautiful days are long gone
I can't seem to breathe
Feels like it hasn't been that long
Since you walked away from me
Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know
I still think of you that way
And you should know that...
Beautiful lights, the star-filled nights
They don't mean a thing
'Cause you are my star
So it don't seem right
Without you here with me
Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know
It's hard for me to say you were my soul
Now I could say that I don't love you no more
And I could say that I've closed the door... for our love
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us
To go our separate ways
But baby I just wouldn't be the same
'Cause girl you're love is still on my brain
Now when you're in love it takes time to heal
When someone has broken your heart it changes how you feel
Girl I... thought that you'd never do me that way
But even after all I still think of you that way, yeah
No, no...
Now I could say that I don't love you no more
(I could say this... I could say that)
And I could say that I've closed the door... for our love
(For our love)
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us
To go our separate ways
But baby I just wouldn't be the same
'Cause girl you're love is still on my brain (brain yeah)
Now love is a game
That we both like to play
Will I win or lose if I go or if I stay, yeah
Even though I try to hide
My broken heart inside
Girl you know me inside out
And I can't get you off my mind
Now I could say that I don't love you no more
(I could say that I... yeah, yeah)
And I could say that I've closed the door... for our love
(Closed the door)
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us
(I could tell you I feel it's time for us)
To go our separate ways (Oh no, no)
But baby I just wouldn't be the same (Wouldn't be the same)
'Cause girl you're love is still on my brain
(Still on my brain, yeah)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la-la-la
Don't know, don't know if I can do this on my own
Why do you have to leave me
It seems I'm losing something deep inside of me
Hold on, onto me
Now I see
Now I see
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts
Everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay
La di da di da
It's okay
It feels like nothing really matters anymore
When you're gone
I can't breathe
And I know you never meant to make me feel this way
This can't be happening
Now I see
(Now I see)
Now I see
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts
Everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay
La da la da la
It's okay
La la la la la
So many questions so much on my mind
So many answers I can't find
I wish I could turn back the time
I wonder why
Everybody hurts some days
(Some days)
Everybody hurts some days
(Some days)
Everybody hurts some days
(Some days)
It's okay to be afraid
(I'm Afraid)
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts
Everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay
La da la da la
It's okay
La la la la la
It's okay
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts some days
(Yeah we all feel pain)
Everybody feels this way but it'll be okay
Can someone take me away to a better place
Everybody feels this way
It's okay
La di da di da
It's okay
La la la la la
It's okay
La di da di da
It's okay
La la la la la
It's okay
Train-whistles, a sweet Clementine
Blueberries, dancers in line
Cobwebs, a bakery sign
Ooh - a sweet Clementine
Ooh - dancers in line
Ooh ...
If living is seeing
I'm holding my breath
In wonder - I wonder
What happens next?
A new world, a new day to see
I'm softly walking on air
Halfway to heaven from here
Sunlight unfolds in my hair
Ooh - I'm walking on air
Ooh - to heaven from here
Ooh ...
If living is seeing
I'm holding my breath
In wonder - I wonder
What happens next?
A new world, a new day to see
I used to be a lunatic from the gracious days
I used to feel woebegone and so restless nights
My aching heart would bleed for you to see
Oh, but now
(I don't find myself bouncing home
Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the words
(The lover speaks about the monsters)
I used to have demons in my room at night
Desire, despair, desire
So many monsters
Oh, but now
(I don't find myself bouncing around
Whistling my consence to make me cry)
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the words
(And people are being real crazy
But we will only come
And you know what mommy?
Everybody was being real crazy
The monsters are crazy
There are monsters outside)
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the words
Outside the words
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the words
Outside the words
I am the entertainer and I know just where I stand
Another serenader and another long-haired band
Today I am your champion, I may have won your hearts
But I know the game, you'll forget my name
And I won't be here in another year
If I don't stay on the charts, oh
I am the entertainer and I've had to pay my price
The things I did not know at first, I learned by doing twice
But still they come to haunt me, still they want their say
So I've learned to dance with a hand in my pants
I let 'em rub my neck and I write 'em a check
And they go their merry way
I am the entertainer, been all around the world
I've played all kinds of palaces and laid all kinds of girls
I can't remember faces, I don't remember names
Oh, but what the hell, you know it's just as well
'Cause after a while and a thousand miles
It all becomes the same
I am the entertainer, I bring to you my songs
I'd like to spend a day or two, but I can't stay that long
I got to meet expenses, I got to stay in line
Got to get those fees to the agencies
And I'd love to stay but there's bills to pay
So I just don't have the time
I am the entertainer, I've come to do my show
You've heard my latest record spin on the radio
Oh, it took me years to write it, they were the best years of my life
It was a beautiful song, but it ran too long
If you're gonna have a hit you gotta make it fit
So they cut it down to 3:05
I am the entertainer, the idol of my age
I make all kinds of money when I go on the stage
Ah, you see me in the papers, I've been in the magazines
But if I go cold, I won't get sold
I get put in the back in a discount rack
Like another can of beans
I am the entertainer and I know just where I stand
Another serenader and another long-haired band
Today I am your champion, I may have won your hearts
But I know the game, you'll forget my name
I won't be here in another year 
If I don't stay on the charts
Cursed with a love that you can't express,
It's not for a fuck or a kiss.
Rather give the world away than wake up lonely.
Everywhere and every way I see you with me.
Crowd surf off a cliff, land out on the ice
Crowd surf off to sea, float toward the beach
If you find me, hide me, I don't know where I've been
If you find me, hide me, I don't know where I've been
Are we breathing, are we breathing, are we wasting our breath?
It won't be enough to be rich.
All the babies tucked away in their beds, we're out here screaming,
"The life that you thought through is gone."
Can't wind down, the ending outlasting the mood.
I wake up lonely.
Crowd surf off a cliff, land out on the ice
Crowd surf off to sea, float toward the beach
If you find me, hide me, I don't know where I've been.
When you phone me tell me everything I did.
If I'm sorry you lost me you'd better make it quick,
'Cause this call costs a fortune and it's late where you live,
It's late where you live.
Rather give the world away than wake up lonely.
Everywhere and every way I see you with me.
All the babies tucked away in their beds, we're out here screaming,
"The life that you thought through is gone."
Can't wind down, the ending outlasting the mood.
I wake up lonely
I wake up lonely
Today I walked down our old street
Past the diner where we'd meet
Now I dine alone in our old seats
The cold wind blows right through my bones
And I feel like I'm getting old
But I wish I was getting old with you
I held your hand when we took shelter from the rain
She laughed as we picked out our children's names
White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray
Her clothes hang in the closet still
The phone sits on the windowsill
And every time it rings it gives me chills
My heart just stopped when I was told
Doctor, doctor on the phone
Said my love was never coming home
I hold your casket gently walking to the grave
Dark clouds eclipse, the sun won't shine again
White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray
They gave her one more day to say the words I couldn't say
I'm cryin' in pain, cryin' in pain
And I'm not looking for answers, no, I'm not looking for answers
But dear God, why did you choose her?
White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray
They gave her one more day to say the words I couldn't say
I'm cryin' in pain, (cryin' in pain) cryin' in pain
Our love will remain, (love will remain) I'm cryin' in pain
Watch me fly away
Through the night sky yeah
Now that all you touched
Has finally turned gray
And roads can't hold us down
Winds will move us around
With no need to return
To this gray town
Wanna bet I can tell
You've been in bed for too long
So let's just say so long
And I watched you at the cove
You read on rocks below
And I turned home
Without so much as hello
Wanna know where I go
I've been away for too long
And it's hard to leave
When I haven't seen
You in so long
And if we
Had just held out for tomorrow
We might have seen
What seemed so far away
We didn't even bother to stay
There it goes I can tell
You're gonna to keep
Your eyes to the ground
Waiting for something
To finally come around
Tell you that you knew
That you weren't wrong
And it's finally time for so long
I have a smile stretched from ear to ear
To see you walking down the road
We meet at the lights, I stare for a while
The world around us disappears
It's just you and me on my island of hope
A breath between us could be miles
Let me surround you, a sea to your shore
Let me be the calm you seek
But every time I'm close to you
There's too much I can't say
And you just walk away
And I forgot to tell you
I love you
And the night's too long
And cold here
Without you
I grieve in my condition
For I cannot find the words to say
I need you so
And every time I'm close to you
There's too much I can't say
And you just walk away
And I forgot to tell you
I love you
And the night's too long
And cold here
Without you
I grieve in my condition
For I cannot find the words to say
I need you so I need you
My reflection wraps and pulls me under
Healing waters to be
Bathed in Brena
Guide me safely in worlds I've never been to
Heal me, heal me
My dear Brena
Vulnerable
Its alright
Heal me, heal me
My dear Brena
Show me lonely and show me openings
To bring me closer to you
My dear Brena
Vulnerable
It's alright
Opening to
Heal
Opening to
Heal
I dream about, how it's gonna end
Approaching me quickly
Living a life of fear
I only want my mind to be clear
People, making fun of me
For no reason but jealousy
I fantasize about my death
I'll kill myself, from holding my breath
My suicidal dream
Voices telling me what to do
My, suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too
Help me, comfort me
Stop me from feeling what I'm feeling now
The rope is here, now I'll find a use
I'll kill myself, I'll put my head in a noose
My suicidal dream
Voices telling me what to do
My, suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too
Dreamin' about my death, dream
Suicidal, suicidal, suicidal dream
I'm suicidal, suicidal dream
Lay down
Your sweet and weary head
Night is falling
You have come to journey's end
Sleep now
And dream of the ones who came before
They are calling
From across the distant shore
Why do you weep?
What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see
All of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms
You're only sleeping
What can you see
On the horizon
Why do the white gulls call
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home
And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
All souls pass
Hope fades
Into the world of night
Through shadows falling
Out of memory and time
Don't say
We have come now to the end
White shores are calling
You and I will meet again
And you'll be here in my arms
Just sleeping
What can you see
On the horizon
Why do the white gulls call
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home
And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
Grey ships pass
Into the west
What does it matter, a dream of love or a dream of lies
We're all gonna be in the same place when we die
Your spirit don't leave knowing your face or your name
The wind through your bones is all that remains
And we're all gonna be, yeah
I said we're all gonna be, yeah
I said we're all gonna be, yeah
I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground
The quill from a buzzard, blood writes the word
I want to know, am I the sky or a bird?
Hell's boiling over and heaven is full
We're chained to the world and we all gotta pull
And we're all gonna be, yeah
I said we're all gonna be, yeah
I said we're all gonna be, yeah
I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground
Now the killer was smiling with nerves made of stone
He climbed the stairs and the gallows groaned
And the peoples' hearts were pounding, they were throbbing, they were red
He swung out over the crowd, I heard the hangman said
We're all gonna be, yeah
I said we're all gonna be, yeah
I said we're all gonna be, yeah
I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground
Now Cain slew Abel, killed him with a stone
The sky cracked open and the thunder groaned
Along a river of flesh, can these dry bones live?
Take a king or a beggar and the answer they'll give
Is we're all gonna be, yeah
I said we're all gonna be, yeah
I said we're all gonna be, yeah
I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground
We're all gonna be just dirt in the ground
We're all gonna be just dirt in the ground
I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground
We're all gonna be just dirt in the ground
All of the king's horses and all of the king's men
Couldn't pull my heart back together again
All of the physicians and mathematicians too
Failed to stop my heart from breaking in two
'Cause all I need is you
I just need you
Yeah you got the glue
So I'm gonna give my heart to you
I had a premonition a movie in my mind
Confirming my suspicions of what I would find
It followed me to LA down to Mexico
Came in through the back door at the start of the show
Still all I need is you
I just need you
Yeah you got the glue
So I'm gonna give my heart to you
Oh was a perfect day
Oh in a perfect way
You know something had to go
You left me high
You left me low
Now as I lie in pieces and wait for your return
The sun upon my forehead it burns baby burns baby burns
An eye on all my horses you've slept with all my men
I'm never gonna get it together again
Still all I need is you
I just need you
Yeah you got the glue
So I'm gonna give my heart to you
Yeah you got the glue
And there's nothing I can do
Yeah you got the glue
So I'm gonna give my heart to you
Long days of wanting you here
Living in fear
Shedding a tear for you
Long nights of pasty face tunes
Echo in rooms
Filling with gloom for me
Letters so hard to mail
Feeling like the wind from the sea
Now I step into the line
Girl on the
In all the world than you
There's nothing lovelier, girl
In all the world than making love to you
Letters so hard to mail
Feeling like the wind from the sea
Lately got to thinking that
How I long to have you here with me
Black, black sheep boy
Blue-eyed charmer
Head hanging with horns
From your father
Oh
In a cold little mirror you were grown
By a black little wind you were blown
Alone, alone, alone
Cold smile on your lips
You shake and shiver
Some animal sips where the river flows
From a black little crack in a stone
To a crackle in a radio song
Sing along, sing along, sing along
Warm light when your eyes
Fill with laughter
Some animal lies in the pasture
Holes in its throat where the blood was drawn
In its mouth where the tongue was torn
By your claws, your claws, your claws
I woke from a dream
We were running
From every being
That was hunting
But we let them get ahead of us
We let them lie in wait for us
We're fucked, we're fucked, we're fucked
I rose from a dream
I had just destroyed everything
With one crushing blow
And I woke up and watched it go
And I woke up and wagged my tongue
So long, so long, so long
I fought for you
The hardest, it made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving
But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed
But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
So go on, go home
Padre Nuestro
Queestas en el cielo
Santificado sea tu Nombre
Venga tu reino
Hagase tu voluntad
En la tierra como en el cielo
Amen
I can hear the soft breathing of the girl that I love
As she lies here beside me asleep with the night
And her hair in a fine mist floats on my pillow
Reflecting the glow of the winter moonlight
She is soft, she is warm, but my heart remains heavy
And I watch as her breasts, gently rise, gently fall
For I know with the first light of dawn I'll be leaving
And tonight will be all I have left to recall
Oh what have I done, why have I done it?
I've committed a crime, I've broken the law
For 25 dollars and pieces of silver
I held up and robbed a hard liquor store
My life seems unreal, my crime an illusion
A scene badly written in which I must play
Yet I know as I gaze at my young love beside me
The morning is just a few hours away
I know what lies beneath
I've seen the flash of teeth
Conspiring with the reef
To sink our ship
The wind's a cheating wife
Her tongue a thirsty knife
And she could take your life
With one good kiss
Can you see the sky turn red
As morning's light breaks over me?
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea
I know the ocean speaks (The stars retreat behind their veil)
I've heard her call to me (The clouds are clinging to your sail)
And smiling in my dreams (The storm is coming, can you see?)
She whispers this:
"Can you see the sky turn red
As morning's light breaks over me?
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea"
Look and see the sky turn red
Like blood it covers over me
And soon the sea shall give up her dead
We'll raise an empire from the bottom of the sea.
She walks to school with the lunch she packed
Nobody knows what she's holding back
Wearing the same dress she wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with the linen and lace
Oh oh
The teacher wonders but she doesn't ask
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask
Bearing the burden of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was never born
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place
Where she's loved
Concrete Angel
Somebody cries in the middle of the night
The neighbors hear but they turn out the light
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When morning comes it will be too late
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place
Where she's loved
Concrete Angel
A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world had forgot
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place
Where she's loved
Concrete Angel
Innocent, they swim
I tell them no
And they just dive right in
But do they know
It's a long way down
When you're alone
And there's no air or sound
Down below
The surface
There's something in the water
I do not feel safe
It always feels like torture
To be this close
I wish that I was stronger
I'd separate the waves
Not just let the water
Take me away
There was a time I'd dip my feet
And it would roll off my skin
Now every time I get close to the edge
I'm scared of falling in
'Cause I don't want to be stranded again
On my own
When the tide comes in
And pulls me below
The surface
There's something in the water
I do not feel safe
It always feels like torture
To be this close
I wish that I was stronger
I'd separate the waves
Not just let the water
Take me away
You have been left alone
The creature of innocence
You lie for what you're worth
And struggle with your confidence
And when your devil complains
And tears you up, to start again
And when you're lying on the stage
And nothing works, just living hurts
Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion
Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion
And so we meet alone
Two players in a puppet show
Don't cry for audience
There's no one that can take you home
And when your devil complains
And tears you up, to start again
And when you're lying on the stage
And nothing works, just living hurts
Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion
Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion
Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion
Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion
Forget, forget
With the secret harmonic emotion
I'm always assuming the worst
But you're going on nonetheless
And there's nothing to cushion your heart led fall
Letters from further away
Keep pulling me close to home
And there's something to cushion my callous sighs
And I know that you hope for
Longer good-byes
Embracing for forever
And falling in your eyes
In your eyes
Your eyes
Pouring over photographs
I'm living in your letters
Breathe
Deeply from this envelope
It smells like you
And I can't be
Without that scent
It's filling me
With all you mean to me
To me
Continually failing these trials
But you stand by me nonetheless
And you won't let me sink
Though I'm begging you
I'm begging you
Phone calls from further away
And messages on my machine
But I don't ever tell you this distance
Seems terrible
And there's no need to test my heart
With useless space
These roads go on forever
There'll always be a place
For you
In my heart
So I'll hit the pavement
It's gotta be better than waiting
And pushing you far away
'Cause I'm scared
So I'll take my chances
And head on my way up there
Cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten
Swan dive down eleven stories high
Hold your breath until you see the light
You can sink to the bottom of the sea
Just don't go without me
Go get lost where no one can be found
Drink so long and deep until you drown
Say your goodbyes but darling if you please
Don't go without me
C'est la vie
C'est la mort
You and me
Forevermore
Let's walk down the road that has no end
Steal away where only angels tread
Heaven or hell or somewhere in between
Cross your heart to take me when you leave
Don't go, please don't go
Don't go without me

She's a jar with a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser, a pretty war
With feelings hid
She begs me not to miss her
She says forever to light a fuse
We could use a handful of wheel
And a day off and a bruised road
However, you might feel
Tonight is real
When I forget how to talk, I sing
Won't you please bring that flash to shine
And turn my eyes red
Unless they close when you click
And my face gets sick
Stuck, like a question unposed
Just climb aboard
The tracks of a train's arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people under me
Please beware the quiet front yard
I warned you before there were water skies
I warned you not to drive
Dry your eyes, you poor devil
Are there really ones like these?
The ones I dream float like leaves
And freeze to spread skeleton wings
I passed through before I knew you
I believe it's just because
Daddy's payday is not enough
Oh, I believe it's all because
Daddy's payday is not enough
Just climb aboard
The tracks of a train's arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people under me
She's a jar with a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser, a pretty war
With feelings hid
You know she begs me not to hit her
Composicao: Rodrigo Amarante
O quanto eu te falei que isso vai mudar
Motivo eu nunca dei
Voce me avisar, me ensinar, falar do que foi pra voce,
Nao vai me livrar de viver
Quem e mais sentimental que eu?
Eu disse e nem assim se pode evitar.
De tanto eu te falar voce subverteu o que era um sentimento e assim
Fez dele razao
Pra se perder no abismo que e pensar e sentir
Ela e mais sentimental que eu!
Entao fica bem
Se eu sofro um pouco mais.
"Se ela te fala assim, com tantos rodeios, e pra te seduzir e te
ver buscando o sentido daquilo que voce ouviria displicentemente.
Se ela te fosse direta, voce a rejeitaria."
Eu so aceito a condicao de ter voce so pra mim.
Eu sei, nao e assim, mas deixa
Eu so aceito a condicao de ter voce so pra mim.
Eu sei, nao e assim, mas deixa eu fingir e rir.
And now it's all the same to me
Be whatever you want to be
Go wherever you need to go
And when it all seems like a mistake
Take whatever you need to take
Leave the rest for my own sake
I will always
Go beside you
You will always
Understand it
And now, it's all the same to me
So be whatever you want to be
Go wherever you need to go
And when there's nothing left behind
Taken whatever you needed to
And leave it all into my mind
I will always
Go beside you
You will always
Understand it
If you walk away, I'll walk away
First tell me which roads you will take
I don't want to risk our paths crossin' someday
So you walk that way, I'll walk this way
And the future hangs over our heads
And it moves with each current event
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
Just stay in when it's lookin' this way
And the moon's laying low in the sky
Forcing everything metal to shine
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like a jewelry store case
They argue "Walk this way", "No, walk this way"
And Laura's asleep in my bed
As I'm leaving, she wakes up and says
"I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
Baby, don't go away, come here"
And there's kids playing guns in the street
And one's pointing his tree branch at me
So I put my hands up; I say, "Enough is enough
If you walk away, I'll walk away"
(And he shot me dead)
I found a liquid cure
For my land locked blues
It will pass away like a slow parade
It's leaving but I don't know how soon
And the world's got me dizzy again
You'd think after 22 years I'd be used to the spin
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
So I'm always pacing around or walking away
And I keep drinking the ink from my pen
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
"If you love something, give it away"
A good woman will pick you apart
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
But you may be offended, and you may be afraid
But don't walk away, don't walk away
We made love on the living room floor
With the noise in the background from a televised war
And in that deafening pleasure, I thought I heard someone say
"If we walk away, they'll walk away"
But greed is a bottomless pit
And our freedom's a joke; we're just taking a piss
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
If you're still free, start runnin' away
('Cause we're comin' for ya!)
I've grown tired of holding this pose
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
Sayin' let me walk away, please
You'll be free, child, once you have died
From the shackles of language and measurable time
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Till then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
So I'm up at dawn, putting on my shoes
I just want to make a clean escape
I'm leaving but I don't know where to
I know I'm leaving but I don't know where to
Nothing much Friday night
Pinball, the Lower East Side
Walked out of the past and into the bar
I used to think about you all the time
I would think about you all the time
Now it just feels weird that there you are
The damage is done
I feel like a kid again
My eyes are glued to the floor
I hope I mumbled goodbye as you walked out the door
The damage is done
The damage is done
Hey, you can tell the world
That you're leaving
And you can pack your bags
And spread your wings
And you can tell them all
That it's over
But while you wave goodbye
Oh, I'll be getting closer
Stand there and look into my eyes
And tell me that all we had were lies
Show me that to you it don't count
And I'll stay here if you prefer
Yes, I'll leave you without a word
Without a word
And you can tell the world
That you're tired
But your excuses, they won't work
'Cause I'll know that you're lying
Every time that I see your face
I notice all the suffering
Just turn to my embrace
I won't let you come to nothing
Stand there and look into my eyes
And tell me that all we had were lies
Show me that to you it don't count
And I'll stay here if you prefer
Yes, I'll leave you without a word
Without a word
Without a word
Without a word
Without a word
Without a word
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My girl has found another and gone away
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain
(Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Cause so badly I wanna go outside (such a lovely day)
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry
Cause crying, ooh, eases the pain, oh yeah
People, this hurt I feel inside
Words could never explain
I just wish it would rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh let it rain, rain, rain, rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooh, baby
Let it rain (rain, rain)
Oh yeah, let it rain
Day in, day out, my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pane
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know
That I'm crying (crying) crying (crying)
When I go outside
To the world outside
My tears I refuse to explain
Oh I wish it would rain
(Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooh-hoo, let it rain (let it rain)
Let it rain
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
Oh, let it rain
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen
I'm a man and I got my pride
Till it rains I'm gonna stay inside
Let it rain (let it rain, let it rain)
You must be wondering how
The boy next door turned out
Have a care, but don't stare
Because he's still there
Lamenting policewomen, policemen
Silly women, taxmen, uniformed whores
They who wish to hurt you
Work within the law
This world is full, oh
So full of crashing bores
And I must be one
'Cause no one ever turns to me to say
"Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms
And love me"
You must be wondering how
The boy next door turned out
Have a care and say a prayer
Because he's still there
Lamenting policewomen, policemen,
Silly women, taxmen, uniformed whores
Educated criminals work within the law
This world is full
So full of crashing bores
And I must be one
'Cause no one ever turns to me to say
"Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms and love me
And love me"
What really lies
Beyond the constraints of my mind?
Could it be the sea
With fate mooning back at me?
No, it's just more lock-jawed pop-stars
Thicker than pig-shit
Nothing to convey
So scared to show intelligence
It might smear their lovely career
This world - I am afraid -
Is designed for crashing bores
I am not one
I am not one
You don't understand
You don't understand
And yet you can
Take me in your arms and love me, love me
And love me
Take me in your arms and love me, love me, love me
Take me in your arms and love me
Take me in your arms and love me
Would you do, would you do what you should do?
One last kiss, one only, then I let you go
Hard for you, I've fallen, but you can't break my fall
I'm broken, don't break me, when I hit the ground
Some devil, some angel has got me to the bones
You said, always and forever
Now I believe you baby
You said, always and forever, is such a long and lonely time
Too drunk 'n' still drinking
It's just the way I feel
It's all right, is what you told me
'Cause what we had was so beautiful
But I feel heavy, like floating, at the bottom of the sea
You said, always and forever
Now I believe you baby
You said, always and forever, is such a long, lonely time
Some devil is stuck inside me
Why can't I set it free
I wish I was dead, and you're breathing
Just so that you could know
Some angel is stuck inside me
Why can't I set you free
You said always and forever
Now I believe you baby
You said always and forever, such a long, lonely time
Stuck inside of me
Is it a kind of dream
Floating out on the tide
Following the river of death downstream
Oh, is it a dream?
There's a fog along the horizon
A strange glow in the sky
And nobody seems to know where you go
And what does it mean
Oh, is it a dream?
Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes
Is it a kind of shadow
Reaching into the night
Wandering over the hills unseen
Or is it a dream?
There's a high wind in the trees
A cold sound in the air
And nobody ever knows when you go
And where do you start
Oh, into the dark
Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes
Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes
Please don't cry 
You know I'm leaving here tonight 
Before I go I want you to know 
There will always be a light 
If the moon had to run away 
And all the stars didn't wanna play 
Don't waste the sun on a rainy day 
The wind will soon blow it all away (Yeah) 
Too many times I've planned 
To be much more than who I am 
And if I let you down I will follow you around 
Until you understand 
If the moon had to run away 
And all the stars didn't wanna play 
Don't waste the sun on a rainy day 
The wind will soon blow it all away (Yeah, oh yeah) 
When the days all feel the same 
Don't feel the cold or wind or rain 
Everything will be okay 
We will meet again one day 
And I will shine on for everyone 
So please don't cry 
Although I leave you here this night 
Where I go how far I don't know 
I will always be your light 
If the moon had to run away 
And all the stars didn't wanna play 
Don't waste the sun on a rainy day 
The wind will soon blow it all away (Yeah, oh yeah) 
When the days all seem the same 
Don't feel the cold or wind or rain 
Everything will be okay 
We will meet again one day 
And I will shine on for everyone 
Shine on for everyone (ah-ah) 
When the stars all look the same 
Don't feel the cold or wind or rain 
Everything we'll be okay 
We will meet again one day 
And I will shine on for everyone 
Shine on for everyone
I'm letting you go
I'm setting you free
I no longer love
Head over heels
Morning will come
My heart will break
So before you replace me
Lie with me one last time
Just like a dream
Oh come, come back to me
And I'll still believe
If you stay baby, stay with me
Darling I beg, come back to me
Just like a dream
Before you forget
Was I ever real
Before you forgive me darling
For love I can't feel
Before I replace you
Lie whit me one last time
Just like a dream
Oh come, come back to me
And I'll still believe
If you stay baby, stay with me
Darling I beg, come back to me
Just like a dream
You're making my heart bleed honey
Don't ever forget me honey
Just like a dream
Oh come, come back to me
And I'll still believe
If you stay baby, stay with me
Darling I beg, come back to me
Just like a dream
Instrumental
What ravages of spirit
Conjured this temptuous rage?
Created you a monster
Broken by the rules of love
And fate has led you through it
You do what you have to do
And fate has led you through it
You do what you have to do
And I have the sense to recognize
That I don't know how to let you go
Every moment marked
With apparitions of your soul
I'm ever swiftly moving
Trying to escape this desire
The yearning to be near you
I do what I have to do
The yearning to be near you
I do what I have to do
And I have the sense to recognize
That I don't know how to let you go
That I don't know how to let you go
A glowing ember
Burning hot
And burning slow
Deep within I'm shaken by the violence
Of existing for only you
I know I can't be with you
I do what I have to do
I know I can't be with you
I do what I have to do
And I have sense to recognize but
I don't know how to let you go
I don't know how to let you go
I don't know how to let you go
One dove
You're the one I've been waiting for
Through the dark fall
The nightmares, the lonely nights
I was born
A curling fox in a hole
Hiding from danger
Scared to be alone
One dove
To bring me some peace
In starlight, you came from the other side
To offer me mercy, mercy, mercy
One dove
I'm the one you've been waiting for
From your skin I am born again
I wasn't born yesterday
You were old and hurt
I was longing to be free
I see things you were too tired
You were too scared to see
One dove
To bring me some peace
In starlight, you came from the other side
To offer me mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy
One dove
To bring me some peace
In starlight, you came from the other side
To offer me mercy, mercy, mercy
One dove
To bring me some peace
In starlight, you came from the other side
To offer me mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy
Eyes open, shut your eyes
Eyes open, shut your eyes
Eyes open up
On the way home, this car hears my confessions
I think tonight I'll take the long way
In this weather, the wind outside is biting
It's left me feeling tired and exposed
You've been asking me to bleed
It seems these kinds of questions, they come too easy to you now
And your lack of shame comes naturally
I should not be surprised. I should have seen it sooner
Expect me to apologize for things that you've done wrong
But you're inciting others
You're owning up to nothing and I wish that I was gone
'Cause you're not going anywhere
And this damp air it's fighting my defroster
My sighs they ring victorious and fog this tinted glass
And it's clouded and so is my head
The hint of these new tears are sharp I try to choke them back
But it's useless. I am useless against them
They are beating me with ease
On the way home this car hears my confessions
I think tonight I'll take the long way
Expect me to apologize for things that you've done wrong
While you're inciting others
You're owning up to nothing and I wish that I was gone
'Cause you're not going anywhere
On the way home this car hears my confessions
I think tonight I'll take the long way
Mother, please forgive me, I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Now that I am done, remember I will always love you
I'm your son
Little child, lookin' so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Innocent child, lookin' so sweet
A rape in my eyes, and on your flesh I'll eat
You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child, tied down 
"That's a good boy"
And fuck, your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God saw you watching
Mommy, why your own child?
Little child, lookin' so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
You've raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child, tied down!
"That's a good boy"
And fuck, your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God saw you watching
Mommy, why?
It's all right
You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child, tied down 
"That's a good boy"
And fuck your own child 
I rape, no one hears me
It hurt as a child, tied down, you would hit me
And rip your own child
I'm sick, no one hears me
It hurt as a child, tied down 
"That's a good boy"
And fought your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt as a child, tied down
No one hears me
Mommy, why your own child?
"I didn't touch you there"
Mommy said she didn't care
"I didn't touch you there"
That's why mommy stopped and stared
Little child, lookin' so sweet
A rape in my eyes, and on your flesh I'll eat
You raped, I feel dirty!
It hurt as a child, tied down!
"That's a good boy"
And fuck your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God saw you watching
Mommy, why your own child?
You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child, tied down!
"That's a good boy"
And fuck your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God saw you watching
Mommy, why your own child?
You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child, tied down!
"That's a good boy"
And fuck your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God saw you watching
Mommy, why your own child?
I fuckin' hate you
Oh, you fuckin'
Motherfucker, I fuckin' hate you, fuck you
You son of a bitch, you fuckin' ruined my life
You fucked, I'm sick of it
You fuckin' bitch, I hate you
I fuckin' hate you
I hate you, piece of shit, I hate you
(When I awake, I'll see your face
When I awake, I'll see your light
When I awake, I'll see your face
When I awake, I'll see your light
Mother wake me from my dream
Mother wake me in the night)
I can't forget it
Though I've tried
I know you regret it, love
You've told me so many times
But I still wonder why
You left with her
And left me behind
Take your hands off him
'Cause he's the only one that I have ever loved
And please don't find her skin
When you turn the lights out
I can't erase it
From my mind
I just replay it, love
Think of it all of the time
But I don't want to imagine
Words you spoke to her that night
Naked bodies look like porcelain
You both know I'd be bleeding inside
Did she make your heart beat faster than I could?
Did she give you what you hoped for?
Oh nights so loveless, love
I hope it made you feel good
Knowing how much I adored you
As the belltower blocks the sunlight
All the seeds in our garden fight
To break and blossom all to be adored
And look your skirt is torn
And there's blood on my sheets
Here comes a long arm of the law
Fist tight, banging on the door
And knocking me down on it's weight
And I let him in
As I pass out into a dream
Whooping cranes and woodland beings
Great white wings beating
In an attic, in a house, in the dead of night
Singing, oh! My Augustine, Augustine!
Oh! Is this forever, ever? Oh, oh
Sweet Augustine, Augustine
What does this mean for us?
Does it mean that I can never change my ways?
And that's why, love, you shouldn't stay
Still you will and love me
Like a mother, or a maid bringing you down, down
Down on your brazen knees
Watering the worms and the weeds
Thinking, why does love leave me so damn cold?
And I'm getting old
And is this what it should be
Well... Is it?
Oh! My Augustine, Augustine!
Oh! Is this forever, ever? Oh, oh
Sweet Augustine, Augustine
Do we kill this one tonight?
And now come the tears, heavy and hot
It becomes clear, this is all we got
As I hold you to my bed
Like a cancer or a curse
Now, be my loving nurse
As we fall back into the impossible dream
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life
And I thought hey
You know this could be something
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing
So maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Well maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one
I remember every look upon your face,
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
And finally now, believing
And maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life
And I got high
Maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Maybe two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking ooh I can't live without you
'Cause baby two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And I've figured out with all that's said and done
Two, is better than one
Two is better than one
I was stronger
I was better
Picked you out
No I won't say a word
No don't yell out
Nevermind
Let you out
Led you back
Stay on, sit down
Let it fall
Let it fall
Let it fall
Let it fall
Infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio on
And how could anyone?
You are in my dreams
Half human, half machine
You with someone else that I have felt and seen
I cannot rest, or my consciousness contest
Looking right through the lens
From winter brings the spring again
And infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio on
And we fall asleep again with ties to mend
So please let the cleaning begin with evolution
Hold my breath 'til communication is only just a test
Hold my breath 'til communication is only just a test
Hold my breath 'til communication is only just a test
You are in my dreams
Half human, half machine
Looking right through the lens
From winter brings the spring again
And infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio on
Infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio
You're like me
We're both alone
What's the problem
I don't know
With the same high
The same eyes
But you can't borrow my clothes all the time
Bad things
Dead things
Sad things have to happen
Sometimes
I let the snow
Melt in my mouth
Until my head hurts
Until I'm out
Makes me laugh a bit
Makes me cry
Same way you confuse me all the time
Bad things
Dead things
Sad things have to happen
Bad things
Dead things
Sad things have to happen
Bad things
Dead things
Sad things have to happen
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sooometimes
I can honestly say
You've been on my mind
Since I woke up today, up today
I look at your photograph all the time
These memories come back to life
And I don't mind
I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
I remember those simple things
I remember till I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
A memory I wanna forget
Is goodbye
I woke up this morning, and played our song
And through my tears I sang along
I picked up the phone and I put it down
'Cause I know I'm wasting my time
And I don't mind
I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
I remember those simple things
I remember till I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
A memory I wanna forget
And suddenly my cell phone's blowing up
With your ringtone
I hesitate but answer it anyway
You sound so alone
And I'm surprised to hear you say
You remember when we kissed
You still feel it on your lips
That time that you danced with me
With no music playing
You remember those simple things
We talked till we cried
You said that your biggest regret
The one thing you wish I'd forget
Is saying goodbye
Saying goodbye... huum
Goodbye
When the dark flood came
We wrapped ourselves inside a dirty blanket
Citing different opinions
On whether we should move
When the houses came
They ate up everyone like they were fishes
Saying, "come on, come on
It's the end of the world"
And then I saw your face
You're turning skin into a dirty secret
I watched the beauties, watched the fire
And the fire burn the beauty in their eyes
When I took the blame
We laid in ruins trying to quote your phrase
We're yelling, "someone's got the answers,
But I'd rather think there's nothing to be found"
If you knew I was dying would it change you?
If you knew I was dying would it change...
If you knew I was dying would it change you?
If you knew I was dying would it change anything?
So when you see me falling backwards down the wall that says I'm still alive,
Don't be cautious when I'm cautiously approaching on the other side
Everybody has their reasons, that's the reason we're all going to die
Because if seeing is believing,
Then believe that we have lost our eyes
When I fly solo, I fly so high
Don't touch me now.
We all deserve something.
Don't speak to me this way
Don't ever let me say
Don't leave me again
Don't leave me again
Oh you never felt this lost before
And the world is closing doors
I never wanted anything more (more)
Oh you never felt this lost before
And the world is closing doors
I never wanted anything more (more)
Don't hurt me this way
Don't touch me this way
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me this way
Don't touch me this way
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Oh you never felt this lost before
And the world is closing doors
I never wanted anything more (more)
Oh you never felt this lost before
And the world is closing doors
I never wanted anything more (more)
Don't let me make
The same mistake again
Please don't let me make
The same mistake again
Please don't let me make
The same mistake again
Don't let me make
The same mistake again
Oh you never felt this lost before
And the world is closing doors
I never wanted anything more
Oh you never felt this lost before
And the world is closing doors
I never wanted anything more
Don't let me make
The same mistake again
Don't let me make
The same mistake again
Please don't let me make
The same mistake again
Please don't let me make
The same mistake again
All of us now bent as we fall
Too amorous light we call out
Why are we so alone
Even with company?
If not the moon will us guide
Will then the street light?
All of us now breathe it like smoke
To know what it's like
Breathe to choke
Well, for nine days
A small moth has tried to escape
Our bedroom
Why are we so alone 
Even with company?
We are the pray
For each day a striking distance
Mother can we start over?
I wanna be the boy I was back then
Before the world came, made me colder
I wanna feel the way I did back then
With love in my heart.
We live in a beautiful place
Let love take away all this pain
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh
We wasted so many days
Our hearts are as dark as the rain
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh
Father, can we start over?
Take me to the places that we lived
All the days came, made us older
I wanna feel the way I did back then
Before my heart grew cold.
We live in a beautiful place
Let love take away all this pain
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh
We wasted so many days
Our hearts are as dark as the rain
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh, ah oh
Our hearts are as dark as the rain, ah oh
Our hearts are as dark as the rain, ah oh
It's a beautiful place if we make it
It's a beautiful place to be wasted, don't you know?
We live in a beautiful place,
Let love take away all this pain,
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh
We live in a beautiful place,
Let love take away all this pain,
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh, ah oh
We wasted so many days
Our hearts are as dark as the rain
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh, ah oh
They stand to fight for nothing.
They show how stupid we've become,
As fortune favours only
Those who care too much to see.
It will never be ok,
Some will say.
We stand to fight for nothing.
So close your eyes and stay away.
Don't believe their headlines.
They poison our minds
Every day.
It will never be the same,
The purpose buried every day.
And lies that lead you
To the grave,
Some will say.
And you will never be ok,
As some will say.
The purpose buried every day,
As some will say.
Lies that lead you to the grave,
As some will say.
Your revolution
Is a joke,
As I will say.
Now your back's to the road
The waiting's everything you know
I'm sure you know that I'm leaving
Riding home everyday
Sure in a cinematic way
Breathing the smoke of the train
Keep the thought of you aflame
I'm sure you know that I'm leaving
Curse God for my regret
I miss you indefinite
Not once did I think that
Love would stay till I come back
Now your back's to the road
The waiting's everything you know
I'm sure you know that I'm leaving
I'm standin' on the bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothin' but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening, but there's no sound
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?
It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you, mm
I'm lookin' for a place
I'm searchin' for a face
Is anybody here I know?
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?
It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you, yeah yeah
Oh, why is everything so confusing?
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah??
It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, oh, I'm with you
I'm with you
And I could never tell as a kid
What that window door went to
Only told to stay away
I almost had an accident, age 6
When I found the key in the attic
And now the smell of these wood frames
Is the only sense I've left
So as you pull me from the bed
Tell me I look stunning and cadaverous
And since you are my friend
I would ask that you lower me down slow
And tell the man in the black cloak
He doesn't need to trouble his good soul
With those Latin conjugations
And if it's all the same to them
You should tell your gathering friends
Please not to purse their faces grim
On such a lovely Sunday
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
We will put this flesh into the ground again
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
We will put this flesh into the ground again
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
We will put this flesh into the ground again
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
We will put this flesh into the ground again
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
We will put this flesh into the ground again
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
We will put this flesh into the ground again
What I've kept with me
And what I've thrown away
Now where the hell I've ended up
On this glary random day
Where the things I really cared about
Just left along the way
From being too pent up and proud
Woke up way too late
Feeling hung over and old
And the sun was shining bright
And I walked barefoot down the road
Started thinking about my old man
It seems that all men
Wanna get into a car and go
Anywhere
Here I stand sad and free
I can't cry and I can't see
What I've done
Oh God, what have I done?
Don't you know I'm numb, man
No, I can't feel a thing at all
'Cause its all smiles and business these days
And I'm indifferent to the loss
I've faith that there's a soul somewhere
That's leading me around
I wonder if she knows
Which way is down
Here I stand sad and free
I can't cry and I can't see
What I've done
Oh God, what have I done? Ooh
I poured my heart out
I poured my heart out
It evaporated
See?
Blind man on a canyon's edge of a panoramic scene
Or maybe I'm a kite that's flying high and random
Dangling a string
Or slumped over in a vacant room
Head on a stranger's knee
I'm sure back home
They think I've lost my mind
Here I stand sad and free
I can't cry and I can't see
What I've done
Oh God, what have I done?
I'm not tryin' to be cool
I only wanna be kind
I know that I piss you off
Babe, I better rewind
But I'm not yours and you're not mine
No, I'm not okay, but I guess I'm doin' fine
Jealous lovers left behind
Wonder years passed me by
Far away but still on my mind
I think of you from time to time
But I'm not yours and you're not mine
No, I'm not okay, but I guess I'm doin' fine
If you leave, don't leave now
Please don't take my heart away
Promise me just one more night
Then we'll go our separate ways
We've always had time on our sides
Now it's fading fast
Every second every moment
We've  gotta make it last
I touch you once I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I needed you then
You always said we'd still be friends, someday
If you leave I won't cry
I won't waste a single day
But if you leave don't look back
I'll be running the other way
Seven years went under the bridge
Like time was standing still
Heaven knows what happens now
You've got to you gotta say you will
I touch you once I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I needed you then
You always said we'd meet again, someday
I touch you once I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I needed you then
You always said we'd meet again someday
If you leave
If you leave
Don't look back
Don't look back
Coma kid tell me how
You come to follow you around
Wherever you go
Said "I don't go
Where I'm supposed to go
And I don't go really anywhere, you know"
Told me how he's driven by a curse
'Til he kicked out into reverse
Said "I don't go
Where I'm supposed to go
And I don't go
Really anywhere you know"
I made up my mind
And I don't mind sayin' so
I went to meet you at Central Square
When I couldn't find you there
I went walking around the city some more
People watching with a cold, blank stare
And I saw your face in everyone I swear
Seems I never get your kick quite right
I was walking slow to a dirty dive
I'm so sick and tired of trying to change your mind
When it's so easy to disconnect mine
High times
High times
High times
Yeah I feel fine
High times
High times
High times
Man I feel fine
Don't pick me up
I'm fine right where I am
I don't go
Where I'm supposed to go
Where I'm supposed to go
Close your eyes so you don't feel them
They don't need to see you cry
I can't promise I will heal you
But if you want to I will try
To sing this summer serenade
The past is done we've been betrayed
It's true
Someone said the truth will out
I believe without a doubt
In you
You were there for summer dreaming
And you gave me what I need
And I hope you'll find your freedom
For eternity, for eternity
Yesterday when we were walking
You talked about your ma and dad,
What they did that made you happy,
What they did that made you sad.
We sat and watched the sun go down
Then picked a star before we lost
The moon
Youth is wasted on the young
Before you know it's come and gone, too soon
You were there for summer dreaming
And you gave me what I need
And I hope you'll find your freedom
For eternity, for eternity
To sing this summer serenade
The past is done we've been betrayed
It's true
Youth is wasted on the young
Before you know it's come and gone
Too soon
You were there for summer dreaming
And you are a friend indeed
And I hope you'll find your freedom
For eternity
You were there for summer dreaming
And you gave me what I need
And I know you'll find your freedom
Eventually
For eternity, for eternity
She lay in bed all night watching the colours change
She lay in bed all night watching the morning change
She lay in bed all night watching the morning change into green and gold
The doctor told her years ago that she was ill
The doctor told her years ago to take a pill
The doctor told her years ago that she'd go blind if she wasn't careful
They let Lisa go blind
The world was at her feet and she was looking down
They let Lisa go blind
But everyone she knew thought she was beautiful
Only slightly mental
Beautiful, only temperamental
Beautiful, only slightly mental
Beautiful
She thought it would be fun to try photography
She thought it would be fun to try pornography
She thought it would be fun to try most anything
She was tired of sleeping
They let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind
They let Lisa go blind
She's looking like a queen
But if you knew what's going on in her life
There'd be a thousand barren mothers there to talk to her
If you knew what's going on in her life
There'd be two hundred troubled teenagers to sit with her
And to talk to her
If you knew what's going on in her life
What's going on in her life
What's going on in her life
There would be a documentary on Radio 4
She made herself a pair of orthopaedic shoes
She thought it was the answer to the fashion blues
She thought it was an answer to the fashion blues
But she walked with a limp
They let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind
They let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind
They let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind
They let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind
Well I watched your black tied family
Rise up from graves near cemeteries
That I have not been to since your goodbye
And I drank another simile
And compared your Jesus to a thief
He took my bones and turned them into bread.
'Cause I can feel your pain, in my bones, in my bones.
I was scared to call your mother
For news that you weren't getting better
Well my God, what the hell am I supposed to do?
And I ran off and ran on to something
That I swore was everything but beautiful
I only say that word for you
'Cause I can feel your pain, in my bones, in my bones.
And I can feel your pain, deep in my bones, deep in my bones.
And hallelujah to the one in our bones
And hallelujah to the one that we love
I don't know just what I'll do
Everytime you walk into the room
Oh my head is spinning around
And I can't see clearly right now
I'm wasted
I'm so wasted on you (x2)
I don't know if I'll survive
In this magical land behind your eyes
And there's all these funny little men
There all asking me to dance and sing
I'm wasted
I'm so wasted on you (x2)
Red and yellow pink and green purple and orange and blue
All of the colours I see my love every time I see you
I'm wasted
I'm so wasted on you (x4)
Can you forgive me again
I don't know what I said
But I didn't mean to hurt you
I heard the words come out
I felt that I would die
It hurt so much to hurt you
Then you look at me
You're not shouting anymore
You're silently broken
I'd give anything now
To hear those words from you
Each time I say something I regret
I cry, I don't want to lose you
But somehow I know that you will never leave me
Cause you were made for me
Somehow I'll make you see
How happy you make me
I can't live this life
Without you by my side
I need you to survive
So stay with me
You look in my eyes and I'm screaming inside
That I'm sorry
And you forgive me again
You're my one true friend
And I never meant to hurt you
Here it comes, it's all blown in tonight
I woke up this morning to a blood red sky
Burning on the bridge, turning off the lights
We're on the run, I can see it in your eyes
If nothing is safe then I don't understand
You call me a boy, but I'm trying to be the man
One more day and it's all slipping with the sand
You touch my lips and grab the back of my hand
The back of my hand
I guess we both know we're in over our heads
We got nowhere to go and no home that's left
The water is rising on a river turning red
It all might be okay or we might be dead
If everything we've got is slipping away
I meant what I said when I said until my dying day
I'm holding on to you holding on to me
Maybe it's all gone black, but you're all I see
You're all I see
Walls are shaking, I hear them sound the alarm
Glass is breaking, so don't let go of my arm
Grab your bags and a picture of when we met
All that we leave behind is all that's left
If everything we got is blowing away
We got a rock and a rock 'til our dying day
I'm holding to you holding on to me
Maybe it's all we've got, but it's all I need
You're all I need
And if all we've got
Is what no one can break
I know I love you
If that's all we can take
The tears are coming down
They're mixing with the rain
I know I love you
If that's all we can take
Foolish running for miles on the concrete ground 
We're eight feet deep and the rain is still coming down 
The TV's playing it all out of town 
I'm grabbing at the fray for something that won't drown
Hold my hand
I am afraid
Please pray for me
When I am away
Comfort the girl
Help her understand
No memory
No matter how sad
And no violence 
No matter how bad
Can darken the heart
Or tear it apart
Take my hand
When you are scared
And I will pray
If you go back out there
Comfort the man
Help him understand
That no floating sheet
No matter how haunting
And no secret 
No matter how nasty
Can poison your voice
Or keep you from joy
Time rolls
As days go by
And now I've figured
That I ain't gonna last
Summer skies
Are leaving me behind
So resolve your loving said all
I'll be lost when you're gone
Blind me from keep
Blind me
Times told
As days go by
I still ponder this old question why
But now I know
There's no time to decide
So resolve your loving said all
I'll be lost when you're gone
Blind me from keep
Blind me
And daylight knows
How my eyes have tired
Like the circles
Life evermore will bear
So resolve your loving said all
I'll be lost when you're gone
Blind me from keep
Blind me
Fred Jones was worn out
From caring for his often
Screaming and crying wife
During the day but
He couldn't sleep at night for fear that she
In a stupor from the drugs that didn't
Ease the pain, would set the house ablaze
With a cigarette
You'd do anything
Just to reach our door
But I won't be there
How does it feel
The house on the hill
You'd give anyone
Just to reach our door
And I won't be there
Dressed in bishop's robes
Terrifies me still
In bishop's robes
Bastard headmaster
I am not going back
I am not going back
I am not going back
Children taught to kill
To tear themselves to bits
On playing fields
Dressed in bishop's robes
I am not going back
I am not going back
I am not going back

Morning calls for pain relief
A line above the step beneath
The worst that you could do
And the best that you could hope for
Is hardly the best
Tepid water chase the pills
With turpentine and chamomile
And don't get cheap with the wine
You need to be up all of the time
Shield your eyes, conceal your lies.
Don't blink, everyone's watching.
They'll think you're up to something.
They need for you to be everything
That they cannot
Morning calls for pain relief
A line above the step beneath
The worst that you could do
And the best that you could hope for
Is hardly the best
Tepid water chase the pills
With turpentine and chamomile
And don't get cheap with the wine
You need to be up--- all of the time
All of the time
Shield your eyes, conceal your lies.
Don't blink, everyone's watching.
They'll think you're up to something.
They need for you to be everything
That they cannot
Don't blink, everyone's watching.
They'll think you're up to something.
They need for you to be everything
That they cannot be themselves----
Be themselves------
I took my lucky break and I broke it in two
Put on my worried shoes
My worried shoes
Took me so many miles and they never wore out
My worried shoes
My worried shoes
My worried shoes
I made a mistake that I never forgot
Tying knots in the laces of
My worried shoes
Every step that I take is another mistake
I march further and further away
In my worried shoes
My worried shoes
My shoes took me down a crooked path
Away from all welcome mats
My worried shoes
I looked all around and saw the sun shining down
Took off my worried shoes
My worried shoes
My worried shoes
Would you let me
Walk down your street
Naked if I wanted to?
Can I
Fire fireworks
On the fourth of every single July?
Can I buy an amplifier
On time?
My sweet time
Well, I ain't got no money
But I will pay this time
And I ain't got no money
But I will pay you before I die
And would you let me
Walk down your streets
Naked if we all wanted to?
Can I
Fire fireworks
On the fourth of every single July?
Can I buy an aeroplane
Way up high in the old blue sky?
Well, I ain't got no mercy
But I will pay this time
And I ain't got no mercy
I will pay you before I die
China all the way to New York
I can feel the distance getting close
You're right next to me but I need an air plane
I can feel the distance as you breathe
And sometimes I think you want me to touch you
Well, how can I when you build the Great Wall around you
In your eyes I saw a future together
Oh you just look away in the distance
China decorates our table
Funny how the cracks don't seem to show
Pour the wine, dear, you say we'll take a holiday
But we never can agree on where to go
And sometimes I think you want to me to touch you
But how can I when you build the Great Wall around you
In your eyes I saw a future together
Oh you just look away in the distance
China all the way to New York
Maybe you got lost in Mexico
You're right next to me, I think that you can hear me
Funny how the distance learns to grow
And sometimes I think you want me to touch you
Well, how can I when you build the Great Wall around you
I can feel the distance
I can feel the distance
I can feel the distance getting close
I'm here
Just like I said
Though its breaking every rule I've ever made
My racin' heart
Is just the same
Why make it strong to break it once again?
And I'd love to say I do
Give everything to you
But I can never now be true
So I say
I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Feelin' weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
I'm here
So please explain
Why you're openin' up a healin' wound again
I'm a little more careful
Perhaps it shows
But if I lose the highs, at least I'm spared the lows
Now I tremble in your arms
What could be the harm
To feel my spirit calm
So I say
I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
I'm feelin' weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
I wouldn't know how to say
How good it feels seeing you today
I see you've got your smile back
Now you say your right on track
But you may never know why
Once bitten twice is shy
If I'm proud perhaps I should explain
I couldn't bear to lose you again
I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Feelin' weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Yes I will
I think I'd better leave right now
I'm feelin' weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Middle-aged
Do the low rise
On the waist
London halflife
Middle-aged
You the low riser
Little over wiser
Today
If you're compromised
Drive your car through the rain
If you've been beaten
Drive your car through the rain 
Until you wash off the buzz
Don't pull over till you're sure 
One that wanted the floor
One that won't know the street
One that wanted to land
On the hearth with his feet up
Won't watch out
You're only better off in half your life
Overwise wasted
Overwise wasted
House of cards, you fall hard
Where are you tonight?
Wild flower in starlit heaven
Still enchanted in flight
Obsessions lament to freedom
A timeless word, the meanings changed
But I'm still burning in your flames,
Incessant, lustral masquerade,
Unengaged, dimlit love didn't taste the same
And I still wonder if you ever wonder the same
And I still wonder...
So here we are
We are alone
There's weight on your mind
I wanna know
The truth, if this is how you feel
Say it to me
If this was ever real
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth, even if it hurts me
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth, even if it hurts me
I want the truth
So this is you
You're talking to me
You found a million ways to let me down
So I'm not hurt when you're not around
I was blind
But now I see
This is how you feel
Just say it to me
If this was ever real
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth, even if it hurts me
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth, even if it hurts me
I know that this will break me
I know that this might make me cry
You gotta say what's on your mind, on your mind
I know that this will hurt me
And break my heart and soul inside
But I don't wanna live this lie
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth, even if it hurts me
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth, even if it hurts
I don't care no more, no
Just give me the truth, give me the truth
'Cause I don't care no more
Give me the truth
'Cause I don't care no more, no
Just give me the truth
Give me the truth[4x]
'Cause I don't care no more, no
Well, I wish there was someone
Well, I wish there was someone to love me.
When I used to be someone
And I knew there was someone that loved me.
As I sit here, frozen, alone
Even ghosts get tired and go home
As they crawl back under the stones.
And I wish it was something
Please tell me there's something better
And I wish it was something more than this
Saturated loneliness.
And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could steal it, abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can
It's just saturated loneliness.
Does the silence get lonely?
Does the silence get lonely?
Who knows?
I've been hearing it tell me
I've been hearing it tell me
Go home.
'Cause the freaks are playing tonight
They've packed up and turned out the lights.
And I wish it was something
Please tell me there's something better
And I wish it was something more than this
Saturated loneliness.
And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could steal it, abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can
It's just saturated loneliness.
And the bath water's cold
And this life's getting old.
And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could steal it, abduct it, corrupt it
And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could steal it
And I wish I could feel it, abduct it, corrupt it
But I...
Never can.
But I...
Never can.
Never can.
Never can.
Never can.
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?
Katy Perry
A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
Your game is tired
You should retire
You're 'bout as cute as
An old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts
So keep calm, honey I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what (Katy Perry)
They just know what is what (Young Money)
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut (Ha ha)
What the fuck?
Nicki Minaj
Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my a-migos (no, not Offset)
Swish, swish, aw I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aw, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back
I already despise you
All that fake love you showin'
Couldn't even disguise you
Yo, yo
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror, who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man
This bitch is a Stan
The generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my Biggz "yeah, dat's da guy"
A star's a star
Da ha, da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only fuck wit' queens
So I'm makin' hits with Katy
Katy Perry
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket (An-another one, an-another one)
Can't touch this (Can't touch this)
Another one in the casket (An-another one, an-another one)
They know what is what (Do they know?)
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the?
What if we stop having a ball
What if the paint chips from the wall
What if there's always cups in the sink
What if I'm not what you think I am
What if I fall further than you
What if you dream of somebody new
What if I never let you win, chase you with a rolling pin
Well what if I do
I am giving up on making passes and
I am giving up on half empty glasses and
I am giving up on greener grasses
I am giving up
What if our baby comes home after nine
What it your eyes close before mine
What if you lose yourself sometimes
Then I'll be the one to find you
Safe in my heart
I am giving up on making passes and
I am giving up on half empty glasses and
I am giving up on greener grasses
I am giving up
I am giving up
I am giving up
I am giving up on greener grasses
I am giving up for you
I am giving up for you
I am giving up
Sister of night
When the hunger descends
And your body's a fire
An inferno that never ends
An eternal flame
That burns in desire's name
Sister of night
When the longing returns
Giving voice to the flame
Calling you through flesh that burns
Breaking down your will
To move in for the kill
Oh sister, come for me
Embrace me, assure me
Hey sister, I feel it, too
Sweet sister, just feel me
I'm trembling, you heal me
Hey sister, I feel it, too
Sister of night
In your saddest dress
As you walk through the light
You're desperate to impress
So you slide to the floor
Feeling insecure
Sister of night
With the loneliest eyes
Tell yourself it's alright
He'll make such a perfect prize
But the cold light of day
Will give the game away
Oh sister, come for me
Embrace me, assure me
Hey sister, I feel it, too
Sweet sister, just feel me
I'm trembling, you heal me
Hey sister, I feel it, too
Ninety miles outside Chicago
Can't stop driving, I don't know why
So many questions, I need an answer
Two years later you're still on my mind
Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart?
Who holds the stars up in the sky?
Is true love just once in a lifetime?
Did the captain of the Titanic cry? (high)
Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you
Does anybody know the way to Atlantis?
Or what the wind says when she cries?
I'm speeding by the place that I met you
For the ninety-seventh time tonight
Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Someday we'll know
Why Samson loved Delilah
One day I'll go
Dancing on the moon
Someday you'll know
That I was the one for you
Oh, ooh, oh my love
I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow
I watch the stars crash in the sea
If I could ask God just one question
Why aren't you here with me tonight?
Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Someday we'll know
Why Samson loved Delilah
Someday I'll go
Dancing on the moon
Someday you'll know
That I was the one for you
The other woman finds time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair
The other woman enchantes her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere
And when her own man comes to call on her
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause when she's by his side
It's such a change from old routine
But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman
Will spend her life alone
The other woman enchantes her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere
And when her own man comes to call on her
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause when she's by his side
It's such a change from old routine
But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman
Will spend her life alone
It's hard, hard not to sit on your hands
And bury your head in the sand
Hard not to make other plans
And claim that you've done all you can all along
And life must go on
It's hard, hard to stand up for what's right
And bring home the bacon each night
Hard not to break down and cry
When every idea that you've tried has been wrong
But you carry on
It's hard but you know it's worth the fight
'Cause you know you've got the truth on your side
When the accusations fly, hold tight
Don't be afraid of what they'll say
Who cares what cowards think, anyway
They will understand one day, one day
It's hard, hard when you're here all alone
And everyone else has gone home
Harder to know right from wrong
When all objectivity's gone
And it's gone
But you still carry on
'Cause you, you are the only one left
And you've got to clean up this mess
You know you'll up like the rest
Bitter and twisted, unless
You stay strong and you carry on
It's hard but you know it's worth the fight
'Cause you know you've got the truth on your side
When the accusations fly, hold tight
Don't be afraid of what they'll say
Who cares what cowards think, anyway
They will understand one day, one day
I was locked all day in the summer heat
In a small brown house in suburban streets
The skateboard and my shit guitar
I dream all day that they would get me far
My dad would ask me about my grades
The asshole sports that I never played
And then I'd ask about the girls he'd date
Behind our backs when mom would stay up late
It was near when I turned sixteen
Got kicked out of school and so it seemed
That things were closing in and ready to blow
My dad moved out about that year or so
It took him hours, start a punk rock band
To offset my fucked up family land
And as I helped, my mom would start to cry
I swore ourselves a better life.
If I had a chance for another try...
I wouldn't change a thing...
This made me all of who I am inside...
And if I could thank God
That I am here and that I am alive...
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie...
The whole wide world is mine...
The summer's gone, the years have passed
My friends have changed, a few did last
The smallest dreams got pushed aside
The largest ones, that changed my life
And all I've wished for has come to pass
From rock'n'roll to love and cash
It's all success if it's what you need
Do what you like and do it honestly.
If I had a chance for another try...
I wouldn't change a thing...
This made me all of who I am inside...
And if I could thank God
That I am here and that I am alive...
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie...
The whole wide world is mine...
Yo, oh, oh-oh
Yo, oh, oh
Yo, oh, oh-oh
Yo, oh, oh
Yo, oh, oh-oh
Yo, oh, oh
Yo, oh, oh-oh
Yo, oh, oh
If I had a chance for another try...
I wouldn't change a thing...
This made me all of who I am inside...
And if I could thank God
That I am here and that I am alive...
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie...
The whole wide world is mine...
If I had a chance for another try...
I wouldn't change a thing...
This made me all of who I am inside...
And if I could thank God
That I am here and that I am alive...
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie...
The whole wide world is mine...
She smiled in a big way, the way a girl like that smiles
When the world is hers and she held your eyes
Out in the breezeway
Down by the shore in the lazy summer
And she pulled you in
And she bit your lip and she made you hers
She looked deep into you as you lay together
Quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough to hang on
And she combed your hair and she kissed your teeth
And she made you better than you'd been before
She told you bad things
You wished you could change in the lazy summer
And she told you, laughing down to her core
So she would not cry as she lay in your lap
She said, "Nobody here can live forever
Quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer"
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough to hang on
She said, "No one is alone the way you are alone"
And you held her looser than you would have
If you ever could have known
Some things tie your life together, slender threads
And things to treasure days like that should last and last and last
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough of her
To hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on
This is the accent of the halfhearted land
Does it all make sense now?
And if the ship was built in bottled sand
Does it all make sense now?
The anchor's kiss was scrawled in dyslexic crayon
Does it all make sense now?
Is this just a life preserve or a bivouac tenure?
The tropic of cancer answered
"Drink the quicksand"
A mirror was splintered on the decks floor
Does it all make sense now?
A stowaway that lived beneath this hull
Does it all make sense now?
The anchor's kiss was scrawled in dyslexic crayon
Yes, it all makes sense now
Is this just a life preserve or a bivouac tenure?
This tropic of cancer answered
"Drink the quicksand"
Its gills will swim faster after a breath from the shore
Is this just a life preserve or a bivouac tenure?
Breathe the taste of salt water
Dry-heave up and overboard!
Ponce de Leon wrinkles
Let's make it young again!
Boat drinks for captains
Row our boat, stowaway!
Boat drinks for captains
Row our boat, stowaway!
Is this just a life preserve or a bivouac tenure?
This tropic of cancer answered
"Drink the quicksand"
Its gills will swim faster after a breath from the shore
All makes sense now
If your map was torn
Navigate, navigate
All makes sense now
If your compass broke
Navigate, navigate
All makes sense now
If your map was torn
Navigate, navigate
All makes sense now
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even know your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even know he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
All my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never sleep away
And you'd never hear me say
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all
He was a most peculiar man
That's what Mrs. Reardon says, and she should know
She lived upstairs from him
She said he was a most peculiar man
He was a most peculiar man
He lived all alone within a house
Within a room, within himself
A most peculiar man
He had no friends, he seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't care
And he wasn't like them
Oh no, he was a most peculiar man
He died last Saturday
He turned on the gas and he went to sleep
With the windows closed so he'd never wake up
To his silent world and his tiny room
And Mrs. Reardon says he has a brother somewhere
Who should be notified soon
And all the people said "What a shame that he's dead
But wasn't he a most peculiar man?"
Trapped on the terraces, I looked at you and knew
You were the only thing that mattered, there was no one for me but you
In Harmony Street, we beat a man just for standing there
I held my breath as I watched you swing, then run your fingers through your hair
Oh, how could anyone not love the terrible things you do?
Oh, how could anyone not want to try and help you?
In Bermondsey, in Burberry, you held me at the barricade
The pigs arrived with tear gas, and I wept at the mistakes we made
We stalked the streets like animals and danced as windows shattered
For the island, for the thrill of it, for everything that mattered
Oh, how could anyone not want to rip it all apart?
Oh, how could anyone not love your cold, black heart?
I found you on a Saturday and that was where I lost you
You had to finally walk away because of what it cost you
Years later on, I saw your face in line to catch the morning train
You looked like you'd been softened, like you never really loved the pain
Oh, how could anyone not finally diminish?
The thrill of blood comes instantly, there's only darkness at the finish
Meet me at the barricade
I'll be at the barricade
Meet me at the barricade
The love died, but the hate can't fade
I'll be at the barricade
The love died, but the hate can't fade
There's a heart I cannot hide
There's a beat I can't deny
When it sings, when it lies
When it cheats, when it bribes
There's a war inside my core
Hear it fight, hear it roar
Go ahead, go ahead
Lay your head where it burns
Even though it hurts, even though it scars
Love me when it storms, love me when I fall
Every time it breaks, every time it's torn
Love me like I'm not made of stone
Devil's hand across my heart
As we dance through the dark
So, go ahead, go ahead
Love me deep, until you can't
Even though it hurts, even though it scars
Love me when it storms, love me when I fall
Every time it breaks, every time it's torn
Love me like I'm not made of stone
Love me hard until it heats
Will you love my scars so I can heal
Even though it hurts, baby
Scars... love me when I fall
Breaks baby, it's torn baby, every storm
Love me like I'm not made of stone
Send someone to love me
I need to rest in arms
Keep me safe from harm
In pouring rain
Give me endless summer
Lord I fear the cold
Feel I'm getting old
Before my time
As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord I'm doing all I can
To be a better man
Go easy on my conscience
'Cause it's not my fault
I know I've been taught
To take the blame
Rest assured my angels
Who catch my tears
Walk me out of here
I'm in pain
As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord I'm doing all I can
To be a better man
Once you've found that lover
You're homeward bound
Love is all around
Love is all around
I know some have fallen
On stony ground
But love is all around
Send someone to love me
I need to rest in arms
Keep me safe from harm
In pouring rain
Give me endless summer
Lord I fear the cold
Feel I'm getting old
Before my time
As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord I'm doing all I can
To be a better man
I would like to think our paths are straight
Disconnected from choices we make
That there is no reason why it can't be like you said
One day it's gonna happen
I don't know when
I'll be on your street
But I know one day it's gonna happen
You're gonna be swept off your feet
I would like someone to make a map
Mark my home and draw some lines that match
All of the reasons why
It can be like you said
One day it's gonna happen
I don't know when
I'll be on your street
But I know one day it's gonna happen
You're gonna be swept off your feet
I don't know when
I don't know why
I don't know when
I don't know why
One day it's gonna happen
I don't know when
I'll be on your street
But I know one day it's gonna happen
You're gonna be swept off your feet
But all that I know is it's gonna happen
I don't know when
I'll be on your street
But I know one day it's gonna happen
You're gonna be swept off your feet
Can you sleep as the sound hits your ears?
One at a time
An unspoken balance here
Unabridged for so many years
That I should stare at 
Receivers
To receive her
Isn't fair
Don't worry I'll catch you
Don't worry I'll catch you
Don't ever worry
Your arms in mine
Any time
Wouldn't trade anything
You're still my everything
To my surprise
Before my eyes
You arrive
Don't worry I'll catch you
Don't worry I'll catch you
Don't ever worry
Still breaking old habits, 
Habits
You pulled the wool over me
And I can see everything
Everything
Remembering
Jinx removing
Don't worry I'll catch you
Don't worry I'll catch you
Don't ever worry
No need for reminding
You're still all that matters to me
Under some dirty words on a dirty wall
Eating takeout by myself
I play the shows
Got back in the van and put the walkman on
And you were playing
In some other time a thousand miles away
I played a thousand times before
And like pathetic stars, the truck stops and the rock club walls
I always knew
You saw them too
But you never will again
It's too late
Don't you know
It's been too late
For a long time
Elliott, man, you played a fine guitar
And some dirty basketball
The songs you wrote
Got me through a lot
Just wanna tell you that
But it's too late
It's too late
Don't you know
It's been too late
For a long time
Oh no
Things were looking up
Least that's what I heard
Oh no
Someone came and washed away your hard-earned
Piece of mind
When desperate static beats the silence up
A quiet truth to calm you down
The songs you wrote
Got me through a lot
Just wanna tell you that
Oh, but it's too late
It's too late
Don't you know?
It's been too late
For a long time
Instrumental
You sent a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were building a life
With every kiss and every letter
Every promise of forever
Oh, but you hit "send"
And disappeared in front of my eyes
And now you're just a ghost
When I look back, never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now
Something has died
Now that I have made up my mind
I'll be alright
It doesn't haunt me at night
'Cause every gift and every letter
Every promise of forever
Now, it's out of sight
Like you were never alive
And now you're just a ghost
When I look back, never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now now
So rest in peace
I'll see you on the other side
And now you're just a ghost
When I look back, never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now now
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now now
I see through you now
Happy Birthday
So make a wish
Please accept my apologies, wonder what would have been
Would you have been a little angel? or an angel of sin?
Tom-boy running around, hanging with all the guys?
Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes?
Paid for the murder before they had determined the sex
Choosing our life over your life meant your death
And you never got a chance to even open your eyes
Sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you fought for your life?
Would you have been a little genius, in love with math?
Would you have played in your school clothes and made me mad?
Would you have been a little rapper like your poppa the piper?
Would you have made me quit smoking by finding one of my lighters?
I wonder about your skin tone and shape of your nose
And the way you would have laughed and talked fast or slow
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would have been
Happy birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
Happy birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
I made a mistake
I got a million excuses, as to why you died
And other people got their own reasons for homicide
Who's to say it would have worked
And who's to say it wouldn't have
I was young and struggling, but old enough to be a dad
The fear of being my father has never disappeared
I ponder it frequently while I'm sipping on my beer
My vision of a family was artificial and fake
So when it came time to create I made a mistake
Now you got a little brother, maybe it's really you
Maybe you really forgave us knowing we was confused
Maybe, every time that he smiles
It's you proudly knowing that your father is doing the right thing now
I never tell a woman what to do with her body
But if she don't love children then we can't party
I think about it every year so I picked up a pen
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would have been
Happy birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
Happy birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
I made a mistake
From the heavens to the womb
To the heavens again
From the ending to the ending
Never got to begin
Maybe one day we can meet face to face
In a place without time and space
Happy birthday
From the heavens to the womb
To the heavens again
From the ending to the ending
Never got to begin
Maybe one day we can meet face to face
In a place without time and space
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
Happy birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
I made a mistake
There's a little child
Running round this house
And he never leaves
He will never leave
And the fog comes up
From the sewers
And glows in the dark
Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast
Grow up fast
Anything you want it can be done
How did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Somethings will never wash away
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
I've got to get over
I've got to get over
I've got to get better
Will love you forever
I've got to find genius (Caramel)
I've got to get better (Caramel)
I've got to stop smoking (Caramel)
I've got to get better (Caramel)
Where is the magic?
I've got to get better
Oh lord give me magic
I'll love you forever
I've got to find mounts hill (Caramel)
And live by the mountains (Caramel)
I'll love you forever (Caramel)
And you are (Caramel)
And you are
(Caramel)
Don't think I'll confess
Why would I confess, that I
Don't think I'll deny
Why would I deny, that I
And don't be so hard on yourself
You won't get better till you're worse
Yeah you, send a little smile my way
And don't be so hard on yourself
You won't get better till you're worse
Yeah you, send a little love my way
And every second I spend waiting
Drive me closer to this grave
I'm not alone, no I'm just on my own
And I, it's a little cold outside
Don't think I'll escape
Why would I escape you
And don't think I'll replace
How could I replace you
And don't be so hard on yourself
You won't get better till you're worse
Yeah you, send a little smile my way
And don't be so hard on yourself
You won't get better till you're worse
Yeah you send a little love my way
And every second I spend waiting
Drive me closer to this grave
I'm not alone, no I'm just on my own
And I, it's a little cold outside
And so don't be so hard on yourself
You won't get better till you'll get worse
Oh, send your love my way
Two pale figures ache in silence; timeless in the quiet ground
Side by side in age and sadness
I watched and acted wordlessly as piece by piece you performed your story
Moving through an unknown past. Dancing at the funeral party
Memories of children's dreams lie lifeless, fading, lifeless
Hand in hand with fear and shadows, crying at the funeral party
I heard a song and turned away as piece by piece you performed your story
Noiselessly across the floor. Dancing at the funeral party
And they came to the river
And they came from the road
And he wanted the sun
Just to call his own
And they walked on the dirt
And they walked from the road
'Til they came to the river
'Til they came up close
Throw your pain in the river
Throw your pain in the river
Leave your pain in the river
To be washed away slow
And we walked without words
And we walked with our lives
Two silent birds circled by
Like a pain in the river
And the pain in the river
And the white sun scattered
Washed away this slow
And we followed the river
And we followed the road
And we walked through this land
And we called it a home
But he wanted the sun
And I wanted the whole
And the white light scatters
And the sun sets low
Like a pain in the river
Like a pain in the river
Like a white light scatters
To be washed away slow
Like a pain in the river
Like a pain in the river
Like the way life scattered
To be washed away slow
PATRICK: magpie, was it you who stole the wedding ring? or what other thieving bird would steal such hope away? magpie, I am lost among the hinterland, caught among the bracken and the fern and the boys who have no name
MARIANNE: there's no name for us
PATRICK: still we sing
MARIANNE: and still we sing. little boy, little boy, lost and blue, listen now, let me tell you what to do. you can run on, run along, alone or home between the knees of her; all among her bracken and her ferns and the boy will have a name
BOTH: we will sing
MARIANNE: and we will sing
MARIANNE: one for sorrow
PATRICK: two for joy
MARIANNE: three for a girl
PATRICK: four for a boy
MARIANNE: five for silver
PATRICK: six for gold
MARIANNE: seven for a secret, never to be told
Helplessly hoping her harlequin hovers nearby
Awaiting a word
Gasping at glimpses of gentle true spirit, he runs
Wishing he could fly
Only to trip at the sound of goodbye
Wordlessly watching, he waits by the window and wonders 
At the empty place inside
Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams, he worries
Did he hear a goodbye?
Or even hello?
They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are four for each other
Stand by the stairway, you'll see something certain to tell you 
Confusion has its cost
Love isn't lying, it's loose in a lady who lingers
Saying she is lost
And choking on hello
They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are four for each other
So the pain begins
As the music fades
And I'm left here with
With more than I can take
If you lift me up
Just get me through this night
I know I'll rest tomorrow
And I'll be strong enough to try
When the static clears
And all is said and done
I will realize
That we all need someone
If you lift me up
Just get me through this night
I know I'll rest tomorrow
And I'll be strong enough to try
So when you see me crashing
And there's nowhere left to fall
Will you lift me even higher
To rise above this all
If you lift me up
If you lift me up
Said if you lift me up
Will you lift me higher
When you see me crashing
And there's nowhere left to fall
Will you lift me even higher
To rise above this all
If you lift me up
Said if you lift me up
If you lift me up
Just get me through this night
Hmm, bye bye
How do you love someone
That hurts you oh so bad
With intentions good
Was all he ever had
But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long and I've
Given him all that I could
Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Giving up what seems your lifetime
What went wrong with something once so good?
How do you find the words to say (to say, to say)
To say goodbye? (goodbye)
(Find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (to say, to say)
To say goodbye (goodbye)
(Find the words to say goodbye)
I know now I was naive
Never knew where this would lead
And I'm not tryin' to take away (Oh no)
From the good man that he is
But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long and I've
Givien him all that I could
Was it something wrong that we did?
Oh, cause others infiltrated
What went wrong with something once so good?
Is this the end? Are you sure?
How should you know when you've never been here before?
It's so hard to just let go
When this is the one and only love I've ever known
(Fades)
You could be my silver spring
Blue green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn, ocean crashing
And don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby I don't want to know
So I'll begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
Tell myself you never loved me, no
And don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby I don't want to know
Oh no
And can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby I don't want to know
Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
Well time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
Well I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
Well time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
Well I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
Go ahead and try!
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
Was I just a fool?
I'll follow you down
Till the sound of my voice
Will haunt you
Give me just a chance!
You'll never get away
From the sound
Of the woman that loves you
Was I just a fool?
I'll follow you down
Till the sound of my voice
Will haunt you, haunt you
Give me just a chance!
You'll never get away
From the sound
Of the woman that loves you, loves you
I was such a fool
I'll follow you down
Till the sound of my voice
Will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away
From the sound
Of the woman that loves you
Give me just a chance! Give me just a chance!
When the light's out
And all of the fracturing starts
You're just paying
For some action you lost in the dark
You come down, holding tight, to the railing on the side
You stayed up, left to dry, Now you're crumbling
Now your guard's down
And all of your timing has gone
You were patient
Till earth swallowed the last of the sun
You come down, holding tight, to the railing on the side
You stayed up, left to dry, Now you're crumbling
It's not complex, see all of the signs flashing on
You're just paying, for all of the bad you have done

I had one friend in high school, recently he hung himself with string
His note said, "If living is the problem, well that's just baffling"
And at the wake I waited around to see my ex-first love
And I barely recognized her, but I knew exactly what she was thinking of
We sat quietly in the corner, whispering close about loss
And I remembered why I loved her, and I asked her why I drove her off
She said, "The slow fade of love
It's soft edge might cut you
And our poor friend, Jim
Well, he just lived within
The slow fade of love"
A woman calls my house once a week, she's always selling things
Some charity, a phone plan, a subscription to a magazine
And as I turned her down, I always do
There was something trembling in her voice
I said, "Hey, what troubles you?"
She said, "I'm surprised you noticed
Well, my husband he's leaving, and I can't convince him to stay
And he'll take our daughter with him, she wants to go with him anyway
I'm sorry I'm hard to live with, but living is the problem for me
I'm selling people things they don't want when I don't know what you need"
He said, "The slow fade of love
And its mist might choke you
It's my gradual descent
Into a life I never meant
It's the slow fade of love"
I was driving south of Melrose, I happened upon my old lover's house
I found myself staring at the closed oak door like the day she threw me out
Dianna, Dianna, Dianna, I would die for you
I'm in love with you completely, I'm afraid that's all I can do
She said, "You can sleep upon my doorstep, you can promise me indifference, Jim
But my mind is made up and I'll never let you in again"
For the slow fade of love
It might hit you from below
It's your gradual descent
Into a life you never meant
It's the slow fade of love
It's the slow fade of love
It's the slow fade of love
It's the slow fade of love
Baby, it's the slow fade of love
It's the slow fade of love
It's the slow fade of love
It's the slow fade of love
Slow fade of love
It's the slow fade of love
It's been a bloody stupid day
My baby called me up to say
Don't call me love, don't call me
It's not all she said
I truly love but I know
I'm bad for her, I'm bad and so
At least she may forgive me for my honesty
My friend came back from being abroad
He was rich and I was overawed
His ship came in
I'm standing on the harbour wall
Another friend, the one I love
Turns to me"Have you seen enough?"
"Let's hang about
There's nothing like a sunset"
It's been a bloody stupid day
Don't leave the light on baby
My baby called me up to say
Don't leave the light on baby
I'll see you sometime maybe
Don't leave the light on baby
It finally dawned on me tonight
Best to go down without a fight
I know you will forgive me for my honesty
King Saul fell on his sword when it all went wrong
And Joseph's brothers sold him down the river for a song
And Sonny Liston rubbed some tiger balm into his glove
Some things you do for money and some you do for love, love, love
Raskolnikov felt sick, but he couldn't say why
When he saw his face reflected in his victim's twinkling eye
Some things you'll do for money and some you'll do for fun
But the things you do for love are going to come back to you one by one
Love, love is going to lead you by the hand
Into a white and soundless place
Now we see things as in a mirror, dimly
Then we shall see each other face to face
And way out in Seattle, young Kurt Cobain
Snuck out to the greenhouse, put a bullet in his brain
Snakes in the grass beneath our feet, rain in the clouds above
Some moments last forever, but some flare out with love, love, love
Hey Charley, I'm pregnant
Living on 9th Street
Right above a dirty bookstore
Off Euclid Avenue
I stopped taking dope
I quit drinking whiskey
My old man plays the trombone
Works out at the track
He says that he loves me
Even though it's not his baby
He says that he'll raise him up
Like he would his own son
He gave me a ring
That was worn by his mother
And he takes me out dancin'
Every Saturday night
Hey Charley, I think about you
Every time I pass a filling station
On account of all the grease
You used to wear in your hair
I still have that record
Little Anthony & the Imperials
But someone stole my record player
Well, how do you like that?
Hey Charley, I almost went crazy
After Mario got busted
I went back to Omaha
To live with my folks
Everyone I used to know
Is either dead or in prison
So I came back to Minneapolis
This time I think I'm gonna stay
Hey Charley, I think I'm happy
For the first time since my accident
I wish I had all the money
We used to spend on dope
I'd buy me a used car lot
And I wouldn't sell any of 'em
I'd just drive a different car every day
Dependin' on how I feel
Hey Charley, for chrissakes
If you want to know the truth of it
I don't have a husband
He don't play the trombone
I need to borrow money
To pay this lawyer
And Charley, hey
I'll be eligible for parole
Come Valentine's Day
The lake is frozen over
The trees are white with snow
And all around
Reminders of you
Are everywhere I go
It's late and morning's in no hurry
But sleep won't set me free
I lie awake and try to recall
How your body felt beside me
When silence gets too hard to handle
And the night too long
And this is how I see you
In the snow on Christmas morning
Love and happiness surround you
As you throw your arms up to the sky
I keep this moment by and by
Oh I miss you now, my love
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas,
Merry Christmas, my love
Sense of joy fills the air
And I daydream and I stare
Up at the tree and I see
Your star up there
And this is how I see you
In the snow on Christmas morning
Love and happiness surround you
As you throw your arms up to the sky
I keep this moment by and by
Her window was hung like a painting
She worried it might come to life
She stared for hours
So obsessed was I and self-absorbed that I
Didn't see that she was
Crying
There was always someone carrying
There was always someone carrying
Always someone's carrying Cathy
There were times when I'd find myself saying that:
"Friends, you don't understand"
And she's different when it's just me and her, and I
Closed the door and I tried to hang on and she
Sank into the dark
I was over my head
There was always someone carrying
There was always someone carrying
Always someone's carrying Cathy
We gave you everything
You could have been anything
We gave you everything
You could have done anything
But to imagine a fall
With no one at all to catch you
There'd always been someone
Then one night she climbed into the picture frame
Out in the frozen air
And out of sight
Woke up sad from this dream I've been having
The last couple nights or so
With her father and brothers we're all at the funeral
Carrying a box through the rain
Then somebody says that it's always been this way
Always someone's carrying
There was always someone carrying
Always someone's carrying Cathy
I sense there's something in the wind
It feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice my feelings for him?
And will he see how much he means to me?
I think it's not to be
What will become of my dear friend? 
Where will his actions lead us then? 
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may, it doesn't last
And will we ever end up together?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
And will we ever end up together?
No, I think not
It's never to become
For I am not the one
Yellow walls are lined with portraits
And I've got my new red fetching leather jacket
All these poses such beautiful poses
Makes any boy feel like picking up roses
There's never been such grave a matter
As comparing our new brand name black sunglasses
All these poses such beautiful poses
Makes any boy feel as pretty as princes
The green autumnal parks conductin'
And the city streets a wondrous chorus singing
All these poses oh how can you blame me
Life is a game and true love is a trophy
And you said
Watch my head about it
Baby you said watch my head about it
My head about it
Oh no oh no oh no
Oh no oh no 
No kidding
Reclined amongst these packs of reasons
For to smoke the days away into the evenings
All these poses of classical torture
Ruined my mind like a snake in the orchard
I did go from wanting to be someone
Now I'm drunk and wearing flip-flops on Fifth Avenue
Once you've fallen from classical virtue
Won't have a soul for to wake up and hold you
In the green autumnal park conductin'
All the city streets a wondrous chorus singing
All these poses now no longer boyish
Made me a man ah but who cares what that is
And you said watch my head about it
Baby you said watch my head about it
My head about it
Oh no oh no oh no
Oh no oh no
And you said watch my head about it
Baby you said watch my head about it
My head about it
Oh no oh no oh no
Oh no oh no
No kidding
I climbed up a mountain, and looked off the edge
At all of the lives that I never have led.
There's one where I stayed with you, across the sea.
I wonder, do you still think of me?
I carry your image always in my head,
Folded and yellowed and torn at the edge.
And I've look upon it for so many years.
Slowly I'm losing your face.
Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away.
The ocean rolls us away.
Sixes and sevens, we live on jet planes.
So many faces, I don't know the names.
So many friends now, and none of them mine.
Forgotten as soon as we meet.
All of these moments are lost in time.
But you're caught in my head like a thorn on a vine,
To forever torment me, and I wonder why
Do I wish I'd never known you at all?
Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away.
The ocean rolls us away.
Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away.
The ocean rolls us away.
The sun and the moon, an ocean of air,
So many voices, and nothing is there
But the ghost of you asking me why,
Why did I leave?
Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away.
The ocean rolls us away.
Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away.
And I lose your hand through the waves.
Friends tell me it's spring
My window show the same
Without you here the seasons pass me by
I know you were not new
That loved like me and you
All the same I miss you
Today has been ok
Today has been ok
The preacher lost his son
He's known by all in town
He found him with another son of God
Feeding on the prayer
Nevermind what God said
But love had lost its cause
And I thought today had been ok
Today has been ok
Today has been ok
Wind has burned your skin
The lovely air so thin
The salty water's underneath your feet
No one's gone in vain
Here is where you'll stay
'Cause life has been insane but
Today has been ok
Today has been ok
Today has been ok
Today has been ok
Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)
Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)
Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)
Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)
When I reminisce
Ignorance was bliss
Back in the days where the magic exists
Never be the same as it was 'cause the way it was
Just another day in the maze of a myth
Had a lot of fun living life on the run
Never had a chance to pause to get a better glance
Everything was free and everything was fast
Never even thought it wouldn't last
When you got the mind of a man in the middle
Life is just a big fat riddle
So figure it out
Always thinking that you know
Every little thing there is to know
But you don't really know (you know)
It's like love
Some people get it
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
For me it's just a pain in the ass
But I'm addicted to the taste
Of hoping it could last
Another day
Another night
Inside a lonely world
Another game
Another fight
Inside a lonely world
Another wrong
Another right
Inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world
Such a lonely world
Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)
Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)

Who's the man (th-th-man-the man in the middle)
Maybe I'm a target for people that are bitter
At least I can say that I never been a quitter
I remember high school; man I hated high school
It was like prison
With bullies always putting me down
Just a little skater boy they could pick on
I learned to forgive them; now I got the balls they can lick on
I loved sneaking out when my momma's asleep
With my gothic girlfriend, making love in the creek
With the mind of a man in the middle
It could be the end of the world as we know it
Still I never want it all and I never want it now
I just wanna cruise if I lose then I'll figure it out
How the time flies, even with the blink of an eye
When your young you absorb like a sponge in the skies
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
It's amazing what you learn when you never been taught, y'know
Another day
Another night
Inside a lonely world
Another game
Another fight

No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world

There's all sorts of shapes that I bet you can make
When you had to escape, say the word
Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move
And you'll probably be leaving soon, so I'm telling you
 
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you, ooh ooh ooh
Eyes the color of (water left in wood)
Icing sugar dust (crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps rolling
 
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you, ooh ooh ooh
 
Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both ought to put 'em on hold and I know you agree
 
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you, ooh ooh ooh
So in the meantime
You'll be resting on my mind
For the last time
I will leave myself behind
In the evening
Raise a glass and tell some lies
Make a pass, impress another girl,
She was easy on the eyes
She was easy
And so was I
My reflection
In the window when I ride for Chicago
She is on the other side
Take a picture
Write a letter to my love
Well I was almost honest
I was almost honest
Been a long time
Since I've lay with you in bed
Conversations, full of words you never said
I got your message
But I didn't hear the ringing bell
I gave into the loneliness
But I didn't give them nothing else
Which direction
Down this highway that I ride to Atlanta
She is on the other side
Take a picture
Write a letter to my love
I was almost honest
Well, I was almost honest
Yeah, Oh oh oh Hmmmmm
My reflection
In the window when I ride
Could not save us
But I swear to God I tried
Take a picture
Write a letter to my love
I was almost honest
But I was almost honest
'Cause I was almost honest
If anyone asks
I'll tell them we both just moved on
When people all stare
I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk
Whenever I see you
I'll swallow my pride and bite my tongue
Pretend I'm okay with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong
Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry? cry?
If anyone asks
I'll tell them we just grew apart
Yeah, what do I care
If they believe me or not (if they believe me or not)
Whenever I feel
Your memory is breakin' my heart
I'll pretend I'm okay with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong
Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry? cry?
I'm talkin' in circles
I'm lyin', they know it
Why won't this just all go away?
Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry?
Cry? Cry?
I could make a dress 
A robe fit for a prince 
I could clothe a continent 
But I can't sew a stitch 
I can paint my face 
And stand very, very still 
Its not very practical 
But it still pays the bills 
I can't change my name
But I could be your type
I can dance and win at games
Like backgammon and Life
I used to be the smart one
Sharp as a tack
Funny that how skipping years ahead
Has held me back 
I used to be the bright one
Top in my class
Funny what they give you when you
Just learn how to ask
I can write a song 
But I can't sing in key
I can play piano
But I never learned to read
I can't trap a mouse
But I can pet a cat
No, I'm really serious
I'm really very good at that
I can't fix a car
But I can fix a flat
I could fix a lot of things
But I'd rather not get into that
I used to be the bright one 
Smart as a whip 
Funny how you slip so far when 
Teachers don't keep track of it 
I used to be the tight one 
The perfect fit 
Funny how those compliments can 
Make you feel so full of it
I can shuffle, cut and deal
But I can't draw a hand
I can't draw a lot of things
I hope you understand
I'm not exceptionally shy
But I've never had a man
That I could look straight in the eye
And tell my secret plans
I can take a vow
And I can wear a ring
And I can make you promises
But they won't mean a thing
Can't you do it for me
I'll pay you well 
Fuck, I'll pay you anything
If you could end this 
Can't you just fix it for me
It's gone berserk
Oh fuck, I'll give you anything
If you can make the damn thing work
Can't you just fix it for me
I'll pay you well
Oh fuck, I'll pay you anything 
If you can end this hell
Hello, I love you will you tell me your name?
Hello, I'm good for nothing, will you love me just the same?
The same
Why don't we stop fooling ourselves?
The game is over
Over
Over
No good times, no bad times
There's no times at all
Just The New York Times
Sitting on the windowsill near the flowers
We might as well be apart
It hardly matters
We sleep separately
And drop a smile passing in the hall
But there's no laughs left 'cause we laughed them all
And we laughed them all
In a very short time
Time is tapping on my forehead
Hanging from my mirror
Rattling the teacups
And I wonder
How long can I delay?
We're just a habit like saccharin
And I'm habitually feelin' kinda blue
But each time I try on the thought of leaving you
I stop
I stop and think it over
Two days past eighteen
He was waitin' for the bus in his army green
Sat down in a booth at a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said, "Would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me? I'm feelin' a little low..."
She said, "I'm off in an hour, and I know where we can go..."
So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said, "I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I've got no one to send a letter to...
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you?"
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him, they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home
So the letters came from an army camp
In California, then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of 
He said, "When it's gettin' kinda rough over here
I think of that day sittin' down at the pier
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile...
Don't worry, but I won't be able to write for a while..."
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him, they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home
One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said, "Folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead..."
Cryin' all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read that nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him, they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him, they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home
Instrumental
She sends me blue valentines
All the way from Philadelphia
To mark the anniversary
Of someone that I used to be
And it feels like a warrant is out for my arrest
Baby you got me checkin' in my rearview mirror
That's why I'm always on the run
Thats why I change my name
And I didn't think you'd ever find me here
To send me blue valentines
Like half-forgotten dreams
Like a pebble in my shoe
As I walk these streets
And the ghost of your memory
Baby, is the thistle in the kiss
It's the burglar that can break a rose's neck
It's the tattooed broken promise
I gotta hide beneath my sleeve
I'm gonna see you every time I turn my back
She sends me blue valentines
Though I try to remain at large
They're insisting that our love
Must have a eulogy
Why do I save all this madness
Here in the nightstand drawer
There to haunt upon my shoulders
Baby I know
I'd be luckier to walk around
Everywhere I go
With this blind and broken heart
That sleeps beneath my lapel
Instead, these blue valentines
To remind me of my cardinal sin
I can never wash the guilt
Or get these bloodstains off my hands
And it takes a whole lot of whiskey
To make these nightmares go away
And I cut my bleedin' heart out every night
And I'm gonna die just a little more
Each St. Valentine's Day
Don't you remember that I promised I would write you
These blue valentines
Blue valentines
Blue valentines
Catch me if I fall
I'm losing hold
I can't just carry on this way
And every time I turn away
Lose another blind game
The idea of perfection holds me
Suddenly I see you change
Everything at once the same
But the mountain never moves
Rape me like a child
Christened in blood
Painted like an unknown saint
There's nothing left but hope
Your voice is dead
And old
And always empty
Trust in me through closing years
Perfect moments wait
If only we could stay
Please say the right words
Or cry like the stone white clown
And stand lost forever in a happy crowd
No one lifts their hands
No one lifts their eyes
Justified with empty words
The party just gets better and better
I went away alone
With nothing left
But faith
Hand out of the window
Floatin' on air
Just a flip of the wrist
And I'm wavin' you goodbye
Drive past the lifeguard stand
Where I'd sit around
Waiting for you to remember
As I drive
How the girls can turn to ghosts before your eyes
And the very dreams that led to them
Are keeping them from dying
And how the grace with which she walked into your life
And stay with you in your steps
And pace with you a while
For so long, so long, so long, so long
The speaker in this door is blown
So nothing sounds quite right
Taking my time, taking this drive
Waving this town, goodbye
And I drive this ocean road and remember
The small of your back, nape of your neck
I remember everything as I drive
Waving this town, goodbye
How the girls can turn to ghosts before your eyes
And the very dreams that led to them
Are keeping them from dying
And how the grace with which she walked into your life
Will stay you in your steps
And pace with you a while
So long, so long, so long, so long
So long, so long, so long, so long
Taking my time, taking this drive
(So long, so long)
Waving this town, goodbye
(So long, so long)
So long, so long, so long, so long
And I will leave under the cover
Of summer's kiss upon the sky
Like the stone face of your lover
Just before she says goodbye
And I was certain that the season
Could be held between my arms
But just as summer's hold is fleeting
I was here but now I'm gone
(So long, so long)
And I'm gone
(So long, so long)
I'm gone, I'm gone
(So long, so long)
I'm gone, I'm gone
(So long, so long)
I'm gone, I'm gone
(So long, so long)
I'm gone, I'm gone
(So long, so long)
I'm gone, I'm gone
(So long, so long)
Take a walk
Out the gate you go and never stop
Past dollar stores and wig shops
A quarter in a cup for every block
And watch the buildings grow
Smaller as you go
Down the tracks
Beautiful McMansions on a hill
That overlook a highway
With riverboat casinos and you still
Have yet to see a soul
Jesusland
Jesusland
Town to town
Broadcast to each house, they drop your name
But no one knows your face
Billboards quoting things you'd never say
You hang your head and pray
For Jesusland
Jesusland
Miles and miles
And the sun's going down
Pulses glow from their homes
You're not alone
Lights come on
As you lay your weary head
On their lawn
Parking lots
Cracked and growing grass, you see it all
From offices to farms
Crosses flying high above the malls
Along the walk
Through Jesusland
Jesusland
Go ahead and put it down
I'm drunk and so is everyone else
In this devil town
They wont let me turn around
To get one last look at my baby
While she's still around,
While she's still around,
While she's still around,
While she's still around
Go ahead and build it up again
This cities just cementaries enhaced
Forgotten and
My only hopes to see you
And even if I never do
While she's still around,
While she's still around,
While she's still around,
While she's still around
And I know what you're thinking
That won't stop this drinking
It's the least I can do
'Cause this life is anything but certain
When they close the final curtain
You'll get a glimpse of the truth
'Cause you're still around,
While she's still around,
While she's still around,
While she's still around
Go ahead and burn it down
I'm drunk and so is everyone else
In this devil town
Look on down from the bridge
There's still fountains down there
Look on down from the bridge
It's still raining, up here
Everybody seems so far away from me
Everybody just want to be free
Look away from the sky
It's no different when you're leaving home
I can't be the same thing to you now
I'm just gone, just gone
How could I say goodbye?
How could I say goodbye?
Goodbye
Maybe I'll just place my hands over you
And close my eyes real tight
There's a light in your eyes
And you know - yeah, you know
Look on down from the bridge
I'm still waiting for you
One of these days the sky's gonna break
And everything will escape and I'll know
One of these days the mountains are 
Gonna fall into the sea and they'll know
That you and I were made for this
I was made to taste your kiss
We were made to never fall away
Never fall away
One of these days letters are gonna
Fall from the sky telling us all to go free
But until that day I'll find a way
To let everybody know that you're coming back
You're coming back for me
'Cause even though you left me here
I have nothing left to fear
These are only walls that hold me here
Hold me here, hold me here
One day soon I'll hold you like the sun holds the moon
And we will hear those planes overhead
And we won't have to be scared
We won't have to be, we won't have to be scared
You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me
You're coming back to me
I'm still frustrated from last night
Things happened at half-time, I'm sick of the bends
My panic research was no help
I sink into myself
Afraid of the fall that never ends
I wait, but I'm too tired to play pretend
I suffocate until the end
No time for halfhearted goodbyes,
I turn on the spotlight and flee from the scene
Cheap flights from Paris to Bangkok, I thought it was nonstop
Can't sleep on the KLM again
I haunt the halls of medicine at night
Choking back the urge to fight
Her cat was clawing the floorboards just outside of our door,
The panic begins
I searched the whole damn apartment from ceiling to carpet
No sign of the things she used to own
As autumn turns its back on me again
I climb the walls for oxygen
My body aches, it heaves, it shakes
Our somersaults through so-called art
And I still don't know exactly who I am
I never will, amen.
She whispers something in my ear, the message is unclear
She motions outside.
I trail her closely from behind
She tries hard not to cry
She shakes underneath the pouring rain
I can't compete with all your damn ideas
This isn't working out for you and me
The truth is I'm too tired to play pretend
This is goodbye, this is the end.
If I bent like you said was best,
Would that change a thing?
If I spent myself till nothings left
Would you still leave me here?
You're so sorry about it all
Now that it's over...
Should I thank you for that dear?
You're so sorry about it all...
And I hope you'll always be.
I remember you best
Hating all the boys who got to you
And all the things they took
That you'd kept for yourself
Every car crash, every misstep, every word
You're so sorry about it all
Now that it's over...
Should I thank you for that dear?
You're so sorry about it all...
And I hope you'll always be
Always be.
I remember you best
Hating all the boys who got to you
And all the things they took from you again...
It's all wrong... all wrong
I can see how you are beautiful
Can you feel my eyes on you
I'm shy and turn my head away
Working late in diner Citylight
I see that you get home alright
Make sure that you can't see me
Hoping you will see me
Sometimes I'm wondering
Why you look me and you blink your eye
You can't be acting like my Dana 
(Can you?)
I see you in Citylight diner
Serving all those meals and then
I see reflections of me in your eye
Oh, please
Talk to me, show some pity
You touch me in many, many ways
But I'm shy, can't you see
Obsessed by you, your looks
Well, anyway, "I would any day die for you"
I write on paper erased away
Still I sit in diner Citylight
Drinking coffee and reading lies
Turn my head and I can see you
Could that really be you?
Sometimes I'm wondering
Why you look me and you blink your eye
You can't be acting like my Dana?
I see your beautiful smile
And I would like to run away from
Reflections of me in your eyes
Oh, please
Talk to me, show some pity
You touch me in many, many ways
But I'm shy, can't you see
I see, can't have you, can't leave you there 
'Cause I must sometimes see you
But I don't understand how you can keep me in chains
And every waking hour
I feel you taking power from me and I can't leave
Repeating the scenery over again
Sometimes I'm wondering
Why you look me and you blink your eye
You can't be acting like my Dana?
I see your beautiful smile
And I would like to run away from
Reflections of me in your eyes
Oh, please
Talk to me, show some pity
You touch me in many, many ways
But I'm shy, can't you see, oh baby, 
Talk to me, show some pity
You touch me in many, many ways
But I'm shy can't you, I'm shy can't you
I'm shy can't you see
I think I feel a little hurt
My fists are turning coal to diamonds
Why no one told me so much work
Would all go into tryin'?
Oh, but those feelings ain't the same
How some things never change
Well, nobody's perfect
And I knew better
Anyway
I thought about it 'til my head hurt
I thought about it but it only made things worse
I thought about it 'til my head hurt
I thought about it but it only made things worse
So I was wrong 
What could I do?
I knew all along
I think I feel a little hurt
My fists are turning coal to diamonds
Why no one told me so much work
Would all go into tryin'?
Oh, but those feelings ain't this strange
How some things never change
Well, nobody's perfect
And I knew better
Anyway
I thought about it 'til my head hurt
I thought about it but it only made things worse
I thought about it 'til my head hurt
I thought about it but it only made things worse
So I was wrong
What could I do?
I knew all along
I'm a fool for you
Catch your breath,
Hit the wall,
Scream out loud,
As you start to crawl
Back in your cage
The only place
Where they will
Leave you alone.
'Cause the weak will
Seek the weaker till they've broken them.
Could you get it back again?
Would it be the same?
Fulfillment to their lack of strength at your expense,
Left you with no defense;
They tore it down.
And I have felt the same as you,
I've felt the same as you,
I've felt the same.
Locked inside
The only place
Where you feel sheltered,
Where you feel safe.
You lost yourself
In your search to find
Something else to hide behind.
The fearful always preyed upon your confidence.
Did they see the consequence,
When they pushed you around?
The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones,
Breaking them till they've become just another crown.
Refuse to feel anything at all,
Refuse to slip,
Refuse to fall.
Can't be weak,
Can't stand still,
You watch your back 'cause no one will.
You don't know why they had to go this far,
Traded your worth for these scars,
For your only company.
And don't believe the lies
That they have told to you. Not one word was true
You're all right, you're all right, you're all right.
So this is the end of you and me
We had a good run and I'm setting you free
To do as you want, to do as you please
Without me
Remember when you were my boat and I was your sea?
Together we'd float so delicately
But that was back when we could talk about anything
'Cause I don't know who I am
When you're running circles in my head
And I don't know just who you are
When you're sleeping in someone else's bed
Three whole words and eight letters late
And that would have worked on me yesterday
We're not the same, I wish that could change
But it can't
And I'll say your name and in the same breath
I'll say something that I'll grow to regret
So keep your hands on your chest and sing with me
That we don't wanna believe
'Cause I don't know who I am
When you're running circles in my head
And I don't know just who you are
When you're sleeping in someone else's bed
So it's true what they say
If you love someone, you should set them free
Oh, it's true what they say
When you throw it away
I don't know who you are
I don't know who you are
Oh, 'cause I don't know who you are
When you sleep with somebody else
'Cause I don't know who I am
When you're sleeping with him
It's true what they say when you throw it away
Hot breath, rough skin
Warm laughs and smiling
The loveliest words whispered and meant
You like all these things
But, though you like all these things
You love a stone
You love a stone
Because it's smooth
And it's cold
And you'd love most to be told
That it's all your own
You love white veins, you love hard grey
The heaviest weight, the clumsiest shape
The earthiest smell, the hollowest tone
You love a stone
And I'm found too fast, called too fond of flames
And I'm phoning my friends
And I'm shouldering the blame
While you're picking pebbles out of the drain, miles ago
And you're out singing songs
And I'm down shouting names
At the flickerless screen
Going fucking insane
Am I losing my cool, overstating my case?
Well, baby, what can I say?
You know I never claimed
That I was a stone
And you love a stone
You love white veins, you love hard grey
The heaviest weight, the clumsiest shape
The earthiest smell, the hollowest tone
You love a stone
You love a stone, because it's dark, and it's old
And if it could start being alive you'd stop living alone
And I think I believe that if stones could dream
They'd dream of being laid side-by-side, piece-by-piece
And turned into a castle for some towering queen
They're unable to know
And when that queen's daughter came of age
Well, I think she'd be lovely and stubborn and brave
And suitors would journey from kingdoms away
Just to make themselves known
And I think that I know the bitter dismay
Of a lover who brought fresh bouquets every day
When she turned him away to remember some knave
Who once gave just one rose, one day, years ago
Oh whoa-oh
I take as much as I can get
I don't take any regret
I close my eyes to conjure up something
But it's just a faint taste in my mouth
I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down
By tomorrow I'll be leaving
By tomorrow I'll gone
If you want to tell me something
You had better make it strong
'Cause I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down
(Here I go)
I think I'm coming down
(Here I go)
I think I'm coming down
(Here I go)
I think I'm coming down
Here I go
There I go
You abuse the ones who love you
You abuse the ones who won't
If you ever had a real heart
I don't think you'd know where to start
'Cause I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down
Yeah, I think I'm coming down
Yes, I think I'm coming down
Yes, I think I'm coming down
Son, I see it in your eyes
There is a burden you cannot hide
But in their arms you feel so alive
And in a moment you're cast aside
All lines have broken and we need you to hold on
Your eyes have opened but you've got to go on
I'll comfort you
I'll stay with you
It's a promise not forgotten
Now I hear you in my mind
There is a story you bring to life
And I will bow gently by your feet
But tread softly, you tread on my dreams
All lines have broken and we need you to hold on
Your eyes have opened but you've got to go on
I'll comfort you
I'll stay with you
It's a promise not forgotten
You're crying all these tears but they mean to leave you dry
Still fighting all these years about the same old things
We wished we never had
The vision softly fades
But there's a light that still remains
And in these walls I feel your sadness wane
But in a moment you'll feel no pain
All lines have broken but we need you to hold on
Your eyes have opened but you've got to go on
I'll comfort you
I'll sing to you
It's a promise not forgotten
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Come on baby let's light the night
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Come on baby let's light the night
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Come on baby let's light the night
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Come on baby let's light the night
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Come on baby let's light the night
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Come on baby let's light the night
Light the night
Let's light the night
She grabs her magazines
She packs her things and she goes
She leaves the pictures hanging on the wall, she burns all
Her notes
And she knows, she's been here too few years
To feel this old
He smokes his cigarette, he stays outside 'til it's gone
If anybody ever had a heart, he wouldn't be alone
He knows, she's been here too few years, to be gone
And we always say, it would be good to go away, someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang
The trouble understand, is she got reasons he don't
Funny how he couldn't see at all, 'til she grabbed up her
Coat
And she goes, she's been here too few years
To take it all in stride
But still it's much too long, to let hurt go (you let her go)
And we always say, it would be good to go away, someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang, the same for you
I'll always hang
Well I always say, it would be good to go away
But if things don't work out like we think
And there's nothing there to ease this aching
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang
Don't think I can't feel that there's something wrong
You've been the sweetest part of my life so long
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light
And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight
This is getting serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us?
Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby, think twice
Baby, think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
For the fire and the faith that was you and me
Baby, I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for a higher ground
'Cause when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down
But, baby, this is serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us?
Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby, think twice
Baby, this is serious (This is serious)
Are you thinking 'bout you or us?
Baby!
(Don't say what you're about to say) No, no, no, no!
Look back before you leave my life (Don't leave my life!)
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby, think twice!
(Don't do what you're about to do
My everything depends on you) I depend on you
Whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice
Before you roll (Those dice) Don't do it, baby, no, don't do it, baby!
(Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life) Don't leave my life!
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby, think twice
Tough girl in the fast lane
No time for love, no time for hate
No drama, no time for games
Tough girl whose soul aches
I come home on my own
Check my phone, nothing though
Act busy, order in
Pay TV, it's agony, oh
I may cry, ruining my make-up
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
Tough girl, I'm in pain
It's lonely at the top, block outs and airplanes
And I still pour you a glass of champagne
Tough girl whose soul aches
I come home on my own
Check my phone, nothing though
Act busy, order in
Pay TV, it's agony, oh
I may cry, ruining my make-up
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
I wake up, I wake up, I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up, I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up, I wake up, I wake up
I wake up alone
I may cry, ruining my make-up
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
If I'm looking for you,
I call your number
But I can't get through
If I'm looking for you,
I call your number
But I can't get through
I've been a moonshiner
For seventeen long years
I spent all my money on whisky and beer
I go to some hollow
And set up my holy holy still
If drinking do not kill me
Then I don't know what will
I go to some bar room
And drink with my friends
If women and men would come to follow
To see what I might spend
God bless them handsome men
I wish they was mine
Their breath is as sweet as
The dew on the holy holy vine
You're already in hell, you're already in hell
I wish we could go to hell
When the bottle gets empty
Then life ain't worth the drown
You told me you don't love me
Over a cup of coffee
And I just have to look away
A million miles between us
Planets crash into dust
I just let it fade away
I'm walking empty streets
Hoping we might meet
I see your car parked on the road
The light on at your window
I know for sure that you're home
But I just have to pass on by
So no, of course we can't be friends
Not while I'm still this obsessed
I guess I always knew the score
This is how our story ends
I smoke your brand of cigarettes
And pray that you might give me a call
I lie around in bed all day just staring at the walls
Hanging round the bars at night, wishing I had never been born
Give myself to anyone who wants to take me home
So no, of course we can't be friends
Not while I still feel like this
I guess I always knew the score
This is where our story ends
You left behind some clothes
My belly somersaults
When I pick them off the floor
My friends all say they're worried
I'm looking far too skinny
I've stopped returning all their calls
And no of course we can't be friends
Not while I'm still so obsessed
I want to ask where I went wrong
But don't say anything at all
It took a cup of coffee
To prove that you don't love me
Five a.m. Friday morning
Thursday night far from sleep
I'm still up and driving
Can't go home obviously
So I'll just change direction
'Cause they'll soon know where I live
And I want to live
Got a full tank and some chips
It was me and a gun
And a man on my back
And I sang "holy holy"
As he buttoned down his pants
You can laugh, it's kind of funny
The things you think at times like these
Like I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
Yes, I wore a slinky red thing
Does that mean I should spread
For you, your friends
Your father, Mister Ed
It was me and a gun
And a man on my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
And I know what this means
Me and Jesus a few years back
Used to hang and he said
"It's your choice, babe, just remember
I don't think that you'll be back
In three days time so you choose well"
Tell me what's right, is it my right
To be on my stomach of Fred's Seville
It was me and a gun
And a man on my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
And do you know Carolina
Where the biscuits are soft and sweet?
These things go through you head
When there's a man on your back
And you're pushed flat on your stomach
It's not a classic Cadillac
Me and a gun
And a man on my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
Floating here like this with you
Underneath the stars
Alight for 13 billion years
The view is beautiful
And ours alone tonight
Underneath the stars
Spinning round and round with you
Watching shadows melt the light
Soft shining from our eyes
Into another space
Is ours alone tonight
Watching shadows melt
And the waves break
And the waves break
Whisper in my ear a wish
"We could drift away"
Held tight, your voice inside my head
The kiss is infinite
And ours alone tonight
"We could drift away"
Flying here like this with you
Underneath the stars
Alight for 13 billion years
The view is beautiful
And ours alone tonight
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars
And everything gone
And all still to come
As nothing to us
Together as one
In each others' arms
So near and so far
Forever as now
Underneath the stars
As the waves break
"My family tree, is my history" {*echoes*}
Yeah baby (yeah)
I baby, I baby you bet your life baby
That's right I'd die here
With the world's most populous drinking areas, you understand?
This is how I'd die, yeah
Everything is back, and they'd use what
And everybody here's waiting for the million dollar jackpot
Number to come up man, and you know
It's a lot of shit, but that's just what the doctor said
Too much too soon! Hell yeah
Straight sound like the end of the world or armageddeon man
They need to find another way for people I talk to
Oughta know, who is gon' take the responsibility nigga
Say it
Too much too soon! Hell yeah
Say it
Bombs droppin'
I dreamt of a fever,
One that would cure me of this cold, winter-set heart
With heat to melt these frozen tears burned with reasons as to carry on
Into these twisted months I plunge without a light to follow
But I swear that I would follow anything
Just get me out of here
But you get six months to adapt
And you get two more to leave town
And in the event that you do adapt
We still might not want you around
But I fell for the promise of a life with a purpose
But I know that that's impossible now
And so I drink to stay warm and to kill selected memories
'Cause I just can't think anymore about that
Or about her tonight
And I give myself three days to feel better or else I
Swear I'll drive right off a fucking cliff
Because if I can't learn to make myself feel better
How can I expect anyone else to give a shit?
And I scream for the sunlight
Or a car to take me anywhere.
Just get me passed this dead and eternal snow
'Cause I swear that I'm dying
Slowly, but it's happening
And if the perfect spring is waiting somewhere
Just take me there
Just take me there
Just take me there
And say and lie to me and say and lie to me and say
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right...
Two dollar color pictures from a photo booth
Dirty stepped on lying out on the floor of their room
Faces fell long in the half light
He looks all wrong but that's her alright
Look at him smiling full of teeth
Clenched tight
He knew the one time with the army captain
He got one that whole deal before it happened
Said its okay i knew exactly what you meant
When you said you were an accident
But when it's 3am he wonders where in the hell she went
And he'll drive all over town
Drive all over town
And he'll drive all over town
Drive all over town
Until he tracks her down
He'll drive all over town
Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
'Cause I lost my only friend
God forgive my sins
Don't leave me, I
I'd hate myself until I die
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry and I love you
Stay with me Bell Bottom Blue
I'll keep on searchin' for an answer
'Cause I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
Toast one last puff
And two last regrets
Three spirits and twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of a soul
Each day I cry
I feel so low from living high
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry and I love you
Stay with me Bell Bottom Blue
I'll keep on searchin' for an answer
'Cause I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more...
Need you more...
I need you more than dope.
Wake me up
Only nightmares take me in
Through these walls the winter bites
A draft from all sides
Why did you not include me on your list?
Let me in through the ceiling
White lips kissed
Our love is a fickle love
Keeps itself locked in a suitcase
To be ready to go
Always
I won't cry when the silver lining shows
But you're right
You understand
You ride with both hands
Worrying is the breathing that you need
So there won't be far to fall
You mustn't climb tall
Things that are supposed to mean lots
Leave you cold
And with a malady of the soul
Our love is a tricky love
Bet you know this
Bet you noticed
Bet you know, which is why
I should know better than anyone ever could
Soon as I let go
Everything falls apart
I won't cry when the silver lining shows
But you're right
You understand
You ride with both hands
Worrying is the breathing that you need
So there won't be far to fall
You mustn't climb tall
Wake me up
Only nightmares take me in
Through these walls the winter bites
A draft from all sides
Of course you can
There are diamonds in demand
It's a shame and as you know
The stain will not go
I could help myself to something
Like a little bit of revelation
You could be the one to help me help myself
Maybe if I could see exactly what
Was in your way I'd move it for you
Don't always need to do it by yourself
I'm not trying to find a way to get in your bed
I'll just sing for you
Until you fall asleep then I will go
I never understood how you should feel
You've been left out I'd never do that
It's all in your imagination dear.
I'm going to ask you to look away
I love my hands but it hurts to pray
The life I have isn't what I'd seen
The sky's not blue and the field's not green (green)
Wait for me (Wait for me)
  x12
I'm going to ask you to look away
My broken life will never stay
Tried too hard and I always lay
Days are gray and the nights are black
Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait
For me
Wait for me
Wait for me (Wait for me)
  x4
You stay the night at his house
With no ride to work
And I'm the one who tells you
He's another jerk
But you're the one who can succeed
You've only got to prove your need
And you do
You really do
The sex you're trading up for
What you hope is love
Is just another thing that
He'll be careless of
But though there are caveats galore
You've only got to love him more
And you do
You really do
Even when it's all too clear
You write a little note that
You leave on the bed
And spend some time dissecting
Every word he said
And if he seemed a little strange
Well, baby, anyone can change
And you do
You do
You really do
There is this thing that's like touching except you don't touch
Back in the day it just went without saying at all 
All the world's history gradually dying of shock 
There is this thing that's like talking except you don't talk 
You sing 
You sing 
Sing for the bartender, sing for the janitor, sing 
Sing for the cameras, sing for the animals, sing 
Sing for the children shooting the children, sing 
Sing for the teachers who told you that you couldn't sing 
Just sing 
There is this thing keeping everyone's lungs and lips locked 
It is called fear and it's seeing a great renaissance 
After the show you can not sing wherever you want 
But for now let's just pretend that we're gonna get bombed 
So sing 
Sing cause its obvious, sing for the astronauts, sing 
Sing for the president, sing for the terrorists, sing 
Sing for the soccer team, sing for the janjaweed, sing 
Sing for the kid with the phone who refuses to sing 
Just sing 
Life is no cabaret 
We don't care what you say 
We're inviting you anyway 
You motherfuckers, you'll sing someday
You motherfuckers, you'll sing someday
You motherfuckers, you'll sing someday
They'll give us something
They'll give us so much to forget
Or enough rope to deal with it
They'll give us something
They'll give us so much to forget
Or enough rope to deal with it
With pencil and light
You heard your love again
You wrestled your nightmares
The sweat in your bed sheets
This is all of it
This is everything
I'm wanting to forget
When winter sets in
It has a way of crystallizing the bad times
The fevers the heartaches
This is all of it
This is everyone
I'm wanting to forget
They'll give us something
They'll give us so much to forget
Or enough rope to deal with it
They'll give us something
They'll give us so much to forget
Or enough rope to deal with it
With pencil and light
You heard your love again
You wrestled your nightmares
The sweat in your bed sheets
This is all of it
This is everything
I'm wanting to forget
Big monster
Big monster lover
A bigger pusher over
Stands alone in most walks of life
Walks alone in most walks in life
See you looking through me
Like you've unzipped the zipper
You hold the big picture so well
Can't you see that we're going to hell
Couldn't park that fucking car
Couldn't part from you
Saw the back of your sweet mother's head
Now I know that she thinks I am dead
Burnt flavor you hold the big picture so well
Can't you see that we're going to hell
Big monster lover
A bigger pusher over
Stands alone in most walks of life
Walks alone in most walks in life
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
That I know I was happier with you
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?
(Hey yeah, hey yeah)
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (Hey yeah, hey yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey yeah, hey yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (hey yeah, hey yeah)
But my darling, I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
'Cause baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you
Standin' at the door of the pink Flamingo cryin' in the rain
It was a kind of so-so love and I'm gonna make sure it doesn't happen again
You and I had to be the standing joke of the year
You were a run-around, a lost and found and not for me I feel
Take your hands off me, hey
I don't belong to you, you see
And take a look in my face, for the last time
I never knew you, you never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
We tried to make it work, you in a cocktail skirt and me in a suit but it just wasn't me
You're used to wearing less, and now your life's a mess, so insecure you see
I put up with all the scenes, this is one scene that's goin' to be played my way
Say hello and wave goodbye
Take your hands off me, hey
I don't belong to you, you see
And take a look in my face, for the last time
I never knew you, you never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Under the deep red light I can see the make-up slidin' down,
Well hey little girl you will always make up so take off that unbecoming frown,
As for me, well I'll find someone who's not goin' cheap in the sales,
A nice little housewife, who'll give me a steady life and not keep going off the rails,
Take your hands off me, hey
I don't belong to you, you see
And take a look in my face, for the last time
I never knew you, you never knew me
Say hello, goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye
Say hello, wave goodbye
Goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
We were born before the waves
Who are we to understand
We were born before the waves
Say goodbye
Through the rain, hail, sleet and snow
Say goodbye
Get on the train, train, train
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
In the wind and the rain now, darling
Say goodbye
In the wind and the rain now, darling
Well, I've been running from something.
Twenty years in a car,
Down a road that's leading nowhere.
And we drive through the farmland,
No one knows where we're from.
Could I kiss you and make you a queen,
Or something in between?
Do you want to see it?
The place where I was freed.
'Cause in my mind, I need it,
But you're nowhere near to me...
Move to New York City.
Take your woman by hand.
Leave her there with her things on the doorstep,
And there's no way around it.
Could this be our last dance?
Just fall asleep with the T.V. Darling.
I'll be back again.
Do you want to see it?
The place where I am free.
'Cause in my mind, I've been there,
And there's no one here but me.
In the morning I'll find you,
Let the light shine the way,
Down a road that's leading me nowhere
And there's no way around it.
Could this be our last dance?
Just fall asleep with the T.V. Darling.
I'll be back again...
I cursed the road
I cursed the road
And I came home to the love you gave
And as I walked through my door
I saw the stars spelled out S.A.V.E.D.
And all the gardens bloomed a flower for each day I was away
Now I'm saved
Baby saved
And all was alive...
And all was alive...
And all was alive...
And all was alive...
You and me
We're wild and on the run
Busting out the heavens 
Like the horses of the sun
You and me
We're wild and on the run
Busting out the heavens 
Like the horses of the sun
I cursed the road
I cursed the road
And I came home to the love you gave
And as I walked through my door
I saw the stars spelled out S.A.V.E.D.
And all the gardens bloomed a flower for each day I was away
Now I'm saved
Baby saved
And all was alive...
And all was alive...
And all was alive...
And all was alive...
You and me
We're wild and on the run
Busting out the heavens 
Like the horses of the sun
You and me
We're wild and on the run
Busting out the heavens 
Like the horses of the sun
You and me
We're wild and on the run
Busting out the heavens 
Like the horses of the sun
You and me
We're wild and on the run
Busting out the heavens 
Like the horses of the...
Sun
This could be one of those days
When we must go our separate ways
It's good for you to be out of my sight
Cause you never know you might
And I carry this
It's heavy
I miss you
Already
You were perfect babe
My time will come, yours too
I barely go before you
I hope you live forever
Or maybe we can go together
It'll be perfect babe
And I carry this
It's heavy
I miss you
Already
You were perfect babe
I'm taking a ride off to one side
It is a personal thing.
Where?
When I can't stand
Up in this cage I'm not regretting.
I don't need a better thing,
I'd settle for less,
It's another thing for me,
I just have to wander through this world
Alone.
Stop before you fall
Into the hole that I have dug here,
Rest even as you
Are starting to feel the way I used to,
I don't need a better thing
Just to sound confused
Don't talk about everyone,
I am not amused by you.
'Cause I'm gonna lose ya,
Yes I'm gonna lose ya
If I'm gonna lose ya,
'Cause I'm gonna lose ya,
Yes I'm gonna lose ya
If I'm gonna lose ya
I'll lose ya now for good.
Calm down
Deep breaths
And get yourself dressed instead
Of running around
And pulling all your threads saying
Breaking yourself up
If it's a broken part, replace it
If it's a broken arm then brace it
If it's a broken heart then face it
And hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your own name
And go your own way
And everything will be fine
Hang on
Help is on the way
Stay strong
I'm doing everything
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
And everything, everything will be fine
Everything
Are the details in the fabric
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling?
Are the things that make you blow
Hell, no reason, go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault
Of faulty manufacturing.
Yeah everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Everything
Hold your own
And know your name
And go your own way
Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling? (Go your own way)
Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic (Go your own way)
Is it Mother Nature's sewing machine?
Are the things that make you blow (Hold your own, know your name)
Hell no reason go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault (Go your own way)
Of faulty manufacturing
Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Hearts will hold
Life... has betrayed me once again,
I accept that some things will never change.
I've let your tiny minds magnify my agony,
And it's left me with a chemical dependency for sanity.
Yes, I am falling... how much longer till I hit the ground?
I can't tell you why I'm breaking down.
Do you wonder why I prefer to be alone?
Have I really lost control?
I'm coming to an end,
I've realized what I could have been.
I can't sleep so I take a breath and hide behind my bravest mask,
I admit I've lost control.
Covered ground
Just to reach your house
I know we need to talk
But I can't catch my thoughts
Insides gripped
Scared of what you'll think
Words I can't repeat
Could change all we've got
Set it off
Someone better hit the alarm
Set it off
Someone better help me
Disarm myself
I don't want no-one else
All I want is you
All I want is you
Trading air
Once more from the start
I can't open up a thousand paper cuts
People hear
What they want to hear
But they won't change a thing
No they won't change a thing
Set it off
Someone better hit the alarm
Set it off
Someone better help me
Disarm myself
I don't want no-one else
All I want is you
All I want is you
Disarm myself
I don't want no-one else
All I want is you
All I want is you
Every Saturday night I get dressed up to ride for you
Baby
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you
Baby
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limit 'cause I just don't care
You ask me where I've been, I been everywhere
But I don't wanna be nowhere but here
(Come on tell me boy)
I've got a burning desire for you baby
(I've got a burning desire)
(Come on tell me boy)
I've got a burning desire for you baby
(I've got a burning desire)
(Come on tell me boy)
I drive fast, wind in my hair
Push it to the limit 'cause I just don't care
I've got a burning desire for you baby
(I've got a burning desire)
Every Saturday night I seem to come alive for you baby
Santa Monica I'm racing in the lights for you baby
I drive fast, radio blares
Have to touch myself to pretend you're there
Your hands were on my hips, your name was on my lips
Over over again like my only prayer
(Come on tell me boy)
I've got a burning desire for you baby
(I've got a burning desire)
(Come on tell me boy)
I've got a burning desire for you baby
(I've got a burning desire)
(Come on tell me boy)
I drive fast, wind in my hair
Push it to the limit 'cause I just don't care
I've got a burning desire for you baby
(I've got a burning desire)
I'm driving fast, flash
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it
I'm driving fast, flash
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it
I'm driving fast, flash
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it
I'm driving fast, flash
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it
I've got a burning desire for you baby
(I've got a burning desire)
(Come on tell me boy)
I've got a burning desire for you baby
(I've got a burning desire)
(Come on tell me boy)
I drive fast wind in my hair
Push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care
I've got a burning desire for you baby
(I've got a burning desire)
Dear Bobbie,
Do you remember when you were young and very pretty? I do.
I remember pleated skirts, black and white sattle shoes.
Do you remember dancing that night?
I do, I still think of you when we dance,
Although we can't jitterbug as we did then.
Do you remember when,
How long has it been?
1945 you opened my blue eyes,
To see a whole new life.
Do you remember when,
I told you this that night,
That if you're by my side,
When everyday begins,
I'll fall for you again.
I made a promise when,
I told you this that night.
I'll be fine.
When I die, then I die loving you.
It's all right, I'll be fine.
When I die then I die loving you,
Loving you, loving you.
Do you remember the times we would give up on each other and get back together.
Then we finally was married in 1949.
We drove the yellow convertible all night long.
Do you remember? I do.
Life has led us here,
Together all these years.
This house that we have made,
Holds twenty-thousand days.
And memories we've saved,
Since life has led us here.
And I'll be fine.
'Cause when I die, then I die loving you.
It's all right, I'll be fine.
'Cause when I die then I die loving you,
Loving you, loving you.
I'm coming home to you,
Slipping off my shoes.
Resting in my chair.
See you standing there,
The silver in your hair.
I'm coming home to you,
When I lay tonight, when I close my eyes,
I know the sun will rise,
Here or the next life.
As long as you're still mine, then its all right.
I'll be fine
'Cause when I die, then I die loving you
It's all right, I'll be fine
'Cause when I die then I die loving you
Loving you, loving you
You have gray hair now,
But you're a beautiful woman,
And the years have been good to both of us.
We walk slow now, but we still have each other.
The glue of love is still bonding us together.
That is what I remember. Do you remember?
Walking away.
It's not the same as running
Is it to you now
That you've run this in the ground?
And you say "Take this,
This medicine is just what you deserve
Swallow, choke, and die.
And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
One that's void of all discretion, such an awful tearing sound
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
Glaring over you and over you, this feeling of despair
Is never wearing out.
It's wearing off
And it's leaving you with such a heavy heart
And a head to match
The bottle is waiting
The cap is twisted, begging to be used
And so are you.
And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
One that's void of all discretion, such an awful tearing sound
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
Glaring over you and over you, this feeling of despair
Is never wearing out.
Wearing out, wearing out.
He raped me in the chalet lines
The girl I shared with was away for the night
I couldn't get up for my shift today
I'll have to leave the camp now anyway
I'll go to London there's a mate of mine I know
She'll give me a place
Full of woe and further to go
He raped me in the chalet lines
I had just said no for the final time
Although it's last month it's like yesterday
I missed my time, I don't think I could stand
To take the test, I'm feeling sick
Fuck this, I've felt like this for a week
I'd put a knife right into his eyes
My friend can't see
She asks me why I don't
Tell the law
Oh what's the fucking point at all?
He raped me in the chalet lines
It was a party, it was going fine
With the boys from the amusement park
A few were idiots, they were a really good laugh
They had the shows on till way after dark
I hope she'll give me a place
Full of woe and further to go
She caught the bus
"Oh I'll go anywhere"
She caught the bus
Her face was just a smear on the pane
The grey ceiling on the earth
Well it's lasted for a while
Take my thoughts for what they're worth
I've been acting like a child
Your opinion, what is that?
It's just a different point of view
Whatever else, what else can I do?
I said I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry
I said I'm sorry, but what for?
If I hurt you then I hate myself
I don't want to hate myself,
Don't want to hurt you
Why do you choose your pain if you only knew
How much I love you love you
Well I won't be your winter
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry
And we can be forgiven
And I will be here
Old picture on the shelf
It's been there for a while
A frozen image of ourselves
We were acting like a child
Innocent and in a trance
A dance that lasted for a while
Read my eyes just like a diary
Oh remember, please remember oh
Well I'm not a beggar, but what's more
If I hurt you then I hate myself
I don't want to hate myself, don't want to hurt you
Why do you choose that pain if only you knew
How much I love you, no
Well I won't be your winter
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry
We can be forgiven
And I will be here oh
No, I won't be your winter (I won't)
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry
And we can be forgiven
And I will be here
I won't be your winter (I won't)
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry
If we can't be forgiven
I won't be here
Baby can you hear the rain fall on me?
Never gonna love again
Baby can you hear my heart cry tonight?
I can't keep running away
This time
I can't keep running away
'Cause I'm never gonna love again
Every time the rain falls, think of me
On a lonely highway, how can we
Turn around the heartache?
Oh I, I'm alone tonight babe
And I'm never gonna love again
Baby wait a lifetime before
You love somebody new
Come and turn the lights down so I
Can feel your hand in mine?
Can we start all over again
'Cause I'm never gonna love a new
Every time the rain falls, think of me
On a lonely highway, how can we
Turn around the heartache?
Oh I, I'm along tonight babe
And I'm never gonna love again
Never gonna love again, no not I
Never gonna love again, no not I
Never gonna love again, no not I
Never gonna love again, no not I
Not I, I'm never gonna love again
Never gonna love again, no not I
Never gonna love again, no not I
Never gonna love again, no not I
Never gonna love again, no not I
Drive me to the dead end, till I
Promise not to run, this time
I can't keep running away
'Cause I'm never gonna love again
Every time the rain falls, think of me
On a lonely highway, how can we
Turn around the heartache?
Oh I, I'm along tonight babe
And I'm never gonna love again
Never gonna love again, no not I
Never gonna love again, no not I
Never gonna love again, no not I
Never gonna love again, no not I
Not I, I'm never gonna love again
Never gonna love again, no not I
Never gonna love again, no not I
Never gonna love again, no not I
Not I, I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
Baker, baker, baking a cake
Make me a day, make me whole again
And I wonder what's in a day
What's in your cake this time
I guess you heard he's gone to L.A.
He says that behind my eyes I'm hiding
And he tells me I pushed him away
That my heart's been hard to find
Here
There must be something here
There must be something here
Here
Baker, baker, can you explain
If truly his heart was made of icing
And I wonder how mine would taste
Maybe we could change his mind
I know you're late for your next parade
You came to make sure that I'm not running
Well, I ran from him in all kinds of ways
Guess it was his turn this time
Time
Thought I'd make friends with time
Thought we'd be flying
Maybe not this time
Baker, baker, baking a cake
Make me a day, make me whole again
And I wonder if he's okay
If you see him say hi
Don't call me home, little sister
Before the night is done
My love and I are fleeing
Running into the sun.
Turn to fly, go away
Little bird, please don't stay
Fare thee well
Take up all your jewels and gold
Bury them away in the earth
Let your memory reduce them to dust
But don't forget the knife that was thrust
Turn to fly, go away
Little bird, please don't stay
Fare thee well
Frozen kiss by the fountain
Running into the sea
Where shadows choose their horrors
Designed for music
Turn to fly, go away
Little bird, please don't stay
Fare thee well
Catherine De Barra
You've murdered my thinking
Gave you my heart
You left the thing stinking
I'd shake from your spell
If it weren't for my drinking
The wind bites more bitter
With each light of morning
I envy the road
The ground you tread under
I envy the wind
Your hair riding over
I envy the pillow
Your head rests and slumbers
I envy to murderous
Envy your lover
'Til the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
'Til the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
I envy the road
The ground you tread under
I envy the wind
Your hair riding over
I envy the pillow
Your head rests and slumbers
I envy to murderous
Envy your lover
'Til the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
'Til the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
'Til the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
'Til the light shines on me
Oh my Catherine
For your eyes smiling
For your mouth singing
With time I'd have won you
With wile I'd have won you
For your eyes smiling
For your mouth singing
With time I'd have won you
Oh my Catherine
With time I'd have won you
With wile I'd have won you
The end's not near
It's here
Hallelujah
Spread the cheer
And watch the millenarians
Throw a party for a thousand years
You won't see the pious praying
They'll be too busy flaying
All the martyrs with better ways
To stop the world decaying
If you call me I won't be home
I'm hiding from the kingdom come
They can't see everything on earth
With the satellites and the roving drones
This is why hell is underground
Like a reclaimed bad part of town
We don't want to lose our souls
We're the saints who don't want to be found
If you wait for me
Then I'll come for you
Although I'll travel far
I always hold a place for you in my heart
If you think of me
If you miss me once in a while
Then I'll return to you
I'll return and fill that space in your heart
Remembering
Your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting
If you dream of me
Like I dream of you
In a place that's warm and dark
In a place where I can feel the beating of your heart
Remembering
Your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting
Oh, I??ve longed for you
And I have desired
To see your face, your smile
To be with you wherever you are
Remembering
Your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
Please say you'll be waiting
Together again
It would feel so good to be
In your arms
Where all my journeys end
If you can make a promise
If it's one that you can keep
I vow to come for you
If you wait for me
And say you'll hold
A place for me
In your heart
A place for me in your heart
A place for me in your heart
A place for me in your heart
And I don't know, this could break my heart or save me
Nothing's real until you let go completely
So here I go with all my thoughts I've been saving
So here I go with all my fears weighing on me
Three months and I'm still sober
Picked all my weeds but kept the flowers
But I know it's never really over
And I don't know I could crash and burn but maybe
At the end of this road I might catch a glimpse of me
So I won't worry about my timing I wanna' get it right
No comparing, second-guessing, no, not this time
Three months and I'm still breathing
Been a long road since those hands I left my tears in
But I know it's never really over, no
Wake... up
Three months and I'm still standing here
Three months and I'm getting better, yeah
Three months and I still... mmm, oh
Three months and its still hard enough
Three months of living here without you now
Three months and three months I, oh...
Three months and I'm still breathing
Three months and I'm still remembering
Three months and wake... up
Three months and I'm still sober
Picked all my weeds but kept the flowers
Only two more days until your birthday
Yesterday was mine
You'll be turning five
I know what it's like
Growing up without your father in your life
So I pretend I'm doing all I can
And hope someday you'll find it in your heart
To understand why I'm not around
And forgive me for not being in your life
I remember waiting for you to come
Remember waiting for you to call
Remember waiting there to find nothing at all
I remember waiting for you to come
Remember waiting for you to call
Remember waiting there to find nothing at all
Maybe someday you'll really get to know me
Not just from letters read to you
I pray I get the chance to make it up to you
We've got a lot of catching up to do
So I pretend I'm doing all I can
And hope someday you'll find it in your heart
To understand why I'm not around
And forgive me for not being in your life
I remember waiting for you to come
Remember waiting for you to call
Remember waiting there to find nothing at all
I remember waiting for you to come
Remember waiting for you to call
Remember waiting there to find nothing at all
If I had the chance, love
I would not hesitate
To tell you all the things I never said before
Don't tell me it's too late
'Cause I've relied on my illusions
To keep me warm at night
But I denied in my capacity to love
I am willing to give up this fight
I've been up all night drinking
To drown my sorrow down
Nothing seems to help me since you went away
I'm so tired of this town
Where every tongue is wagging
When every back is turned
They're telling secrets that should never be revealed
There's nothing to be gained from this
But disaster
Here's a good one
Did you hear about my friend
He's embarrassed to be seen now
Because we...
All know his sins
If I had the chance, love
You know, I would not hesitate
To tell you all the things I never said before
Don't tell me it's too late
'Cause I've relied on my illusions
To keep me warm at night
But I denied in my capacity to love
And I am willing to give up this fight
Oh, I am willing to give up this fight
So close...
You're wasted again
I know, somehow...
I lost myself... again
Making me high again
I almost forgot myself again
It hits me so hard
It kills me again
Today
So close
Yet you're wasted again
I know, somehow...
We'll find ourselves...
I don't know, I don't know
Then we'll be high again
I almost forgot myself there
It hits you so hard
And kills again
I almost forgot myself again
I almost forgot myself there
It's hitting me hard
It moves me again
Again...
I don't know where I'm at
I'm standing at the back
And I'm tired of waiting
Waiting here in line, hoping that I'll find what I've been chasing.
I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna to fall down
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
Never know why it's coming down, down, down.
Not ready to let go
'Cause then I'd never know
What I could be missing
But I'm missing way too much
So when do I give up what I've been wishing for.
I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna to fall down
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
Never know why it's coming down, down, down.
Oh I am going down, down, down
Can't find another way around
And I don't want to hear the sound, of losing what I never found.
I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna to fall down
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
I never know why it's coming down, down, down.
I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna to fall down
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
I never know why it's coming down, down, down.
Pardon me, I didn't realize
What's in your eyes
My arms are open wide
But I can't even decide what I wanna do
I'm staring at the sky
But I can't tell which way my thoughts are travelling
I'm trying to listen to your words
But I can't feel my head and it's unravelling
Sometimes I don't longer know
What it means to care about the things you wanna do
Everybody's living or they're dead
I'm still in my bed
And I don't have a clue
I won't lie and tell you it's alright
I won't lie and tell you it's alright
Last night I told a stranger all about you
They smiled patiently with disbelief
I always knew you would succeed
No matter what you tried
And I know you did it all
In spite of me
Still I'm proud to have known you
For the short time that I did
Proud to have been a step up on your way
Proud to be a part of your illustrious career
And I know you did it all
In spite of me
In spite of me
Late last night I saw you in my living room
You seemed so close but yet so cool
For a long time I thought that you'd be coming back to me
Those kind of thoughts can be so cruel
So cruel
And I know you did it all
In spite of me
In spite of me
Love my name
Love left dry
Frost or flame
Skeleton me
Fall asleep
Spin the sky
Skeleton me
Love, don't cry
Love, don't cry
Love, don't cry
Skeleton me
Skeleton me
Soon comes rain
Dry your eyes
Frost or flame
Skeleton me
Fall asleep
Spin the sky
Skeleton me
Love, don't cry
Love, don't cry
Love, don't cry
Skeleton me
Skeleton me
Skeleton
We'll sing love songs about heartbreak and grief
Sing it's not just music but the pains not brief
We sing, how your love is like a knife to the back
Well I was stabbed and bleeding
But still begging for attack
But I was looking through slow, slow glass
Looking through slow
Slow glass
Well I heard you been singing
Well I was, what I am
Well I never tried to change you, honey I'm your biggest fan
And I loved you back then
But I don't recognize you now
Yeah in fact we're almost strangers and I don't know how,
But I've been looking through slow, slow glass
Yeah I've been looking though slow, slow glass
Drain the veins in my head
Clean out the reds in my eyes to get by security lines
Dear x-ray machine
Pretend you don't know me so well
I won't tell if you lie
Cry, cause your drought's been brought up
Drinkin' 'cause you're lookin' so good in your Starbucks cup
I complain for the company that I keep
The windows for sleepin'
Rearrange well I'm nobody
Well who's laughin' now that I'm leaving your town, again
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air so baby hell yeah
Well honey I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
Damn, I should be so lucky
Even only 24 hours under your touch
You know I need you so much
I cannot wait to call you
And tell you that I landed somewhere
And hand you a square of the airport
And walk you through the maze of the map that I'm gazing at
Gracefully unnamed and feeling guilty for the luck
And the look that you gave me
You make me somebody
Oh nobody knows me
Not even me can see it yet I bet I'm
Leaving your town again
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air, so baby hell yeah
Oh honey I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
You keep me high minded
You keep me high
Flax seeds, well they tear me open
And supposedly you can crawl right through me
Taste these teeth please
And undress me from the sweaters better hurry
'Cause I'm heating upward bound now
Oh maybe I'll build my house on your cloud
Here I'm tumbling for you
Stumblin' through the work that I have to do
Don't mean to harm you
By leaving your town again
But I'm over the quilt that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air, said baby hell yeah
Well honey I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
I remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
I remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
Damn
Damn
Damn you...
You get me high
You keep me high minded
You get me high
You keep me high minded
A old man gave me a tip he said
"Don't waste your time with politics" he said
"Just chase skirts instead
Life is too short, and you're almost dead" he said
"I met a woman once, I gave her my best shot
But never did I talk
If I had her back, I'd be as real as my age
I so don't blame them, I wouldn't do the same
But I can blame them, I'd sing her this"
And you want to be dressed in poetry
But imagery doesn't fit
And you want resizing
But darling dear get a grip
And I think what I just wrote is going over my head
I'm stealing lines from myself
And what I said was never said
It's just a lyrical lie
Made up in my mind
And you want to be dressed in poetry
But imagery doesn't fit
And you want resizing
But darling dear get a grip
You're moving but not aware
You're drowsy without a care
Except keeping your whites behind your lids
And your lids are your best canvas
I can only imagine what you're painting, what you're painting
And your body on my mattress is proof
And your makeup on my pillow is proof
But do you think I am telling you the truth
It's just a lyrical lie
Made up in my mind
And you want to be dressed in poetry
But imagery doesn't fit
And you want resizing
But darling dear get a grip
And you want to be dressed in poetry
But imagery doesn't fit
And you want resizing
But darling dear get a grip
Instrumental
There's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet
No matter where you live
There'll always be a few things, maybe several things
That you're going to find really difficult to forgive
There's going to come a day when you feel better
You'll rise up free and easy on that day
And float from branch to branch, lighter than the air
Just when that day is coming, who can say, who can say?
Our mother has been absent
Ever since we founded Rome
But there's going to be a party
When the wolf comes home
We're going to commandeer the local airwaves
To tell the neighbors what's been going on
And they will shake their heads and wag their bony fingers
In all the wrong directions, and by daybreak we'll be gone
I'm going to get myself in fighting trim
Scope out every angle of unfair advantage
I'm going to bribe the officials, I'm going to kill all the judges
It's going to take you people years to recover from all of the damage
Our mother has been absent
Ever since we founded Rome
But there's going to be a party
When the wolf comes home
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you
I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight for you
I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill for you
I will, I will, I will
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you
I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight for you
I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die for you
I will, I will, I will
And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone
On some forgotten hill, abandoned by the mill
All my blood will spring and spill
I'll thrash the air and then be still
You wake with a start from a dream and know that I am gone
You feel it in your heart, but not for very long
You'll rise each day as planned, your will is your command
And stand each Sunday, a hymnal steady in your hand
And you'll sing to yourself the rising, falling melody
That you could never read without the choir's lead
Still alone and lost indeed
And your soul will not be free
I will go, I will go, I will go
Into war's waters, I will wade
And I will know without remorse or regret
The fairness of our trade
For you to live, I took your place
A deal was made and I was paid
And the gold as I was told
Was a place where my body could be laid
You will steer your life and die old in bed at home
Surrounded by your peers, without suffering or fear
Grandchildren far and near, and none will shed a tear
For the love no longer here
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go for you, I will
I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight for you, I will, I will, I will
I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill for you, I will
I'll die, I'll die, I'll die, I'll die for you, I will, I will, I will
And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone like Jesus
On the cross, my faith cannot be tossed
My life will not be lost
If my love comes across
You tell me summer's here and the time is wrong
You tell me winter's here and your days are getting long
Tears are in your eyes
Tonight
You tell me that you haven't slept in days
You tell me sleeping only makes you tired, anyway
Tears are in your eyes
Tonight
Tears are in your eyes
Every night
Although you don't believe me, you are strong
Darkness always turns into the dawn
And you won't even remember this for long
When it ends alright
Please tell me how
You know tomorrow
(Is?) Staring at your shoulders
Tears are in your eyes
Every night
Tears are in your eyes
Every night
Tears are in your eyes
Tonight
Hideaway,
Well they'll seat us in the sun
By the way,
No, you've always been the one
You'll ask your reasons why
What once was yours is mine
My babe is gone
Ride away
Gonna take me from my man
By the way
No they'll never understand
We'll have a bit of fun
Watching everyone
Pass us by
You'll ask your reason why
What once was yours is mine
My babe is gone
Hideaway
Well they'll seat us in the sun
By the way
No, you've always been the one
You'll ask your reasons why
What once was yours is mine
My babe is gone
Ride away
Gonna take me from my man
By the way
No, they'll never understand
We'll have a bit of fun
Watching everyone
Pass us by
You'll ask your reason why
What once was yours is mine
My babe is gone
Wake up
Say good morning to
That sleepy person lying next to you
If there's no one there
Then there's no one there
But at least the war is over
It's us
Yes, we're back again
Here to see you through till the day's end
And if the night comes
And the night will come
Well, at least the war is over
Lift your head
And look out the window
Stay that way for the rest of the day
And watch the time go
Listen, the birds sing
Listen, the bells ring
All the living are dead
And the dead are all living
The war is over
And we are beginning
Gridlock
On the parkway now
The television man is here to show you how
The channel fades to snow
It's off to work you go
But at least the war is over
She's gone
She left before you woke
As you ate last night
Neither of you spoke
Dishes, TV, bed
The dark was filled with dread
But at least the war was over
Lift your head
And look out the window
Stay that way for the rest of the day
And watch the time go
Listen, the birds sing
Listen, the bells ring
All the living are dead
And the dead are all living
The war is over
And we are beginning
We won
Or we think we did
When you went away
You were just a kid
And if you lost it all
And you lost it
Well, we'll still be there
When your war is over
Lift your head
And look out the window
Stay that way for the rest of the day
And watch the time go
Listen, the birds sing
Listen, the bells ring
All the living are dead
And the dead are all living
The war is over
And we are beginning
Here it comes
Here comes the first day
Here it comes
Here comes the first day
It starts up in our bedroom after the war
It starts up in our bedroom after the war
After the war
After the war
After the war
After the war
After the war
After the war
After the war
Was 27, surviving my return to Saturn
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets locked up tight like Iron Mountain
Running on empty, so out of gas
Thought I wasn't enough
Found I wasn't so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn't take it anymore
By the grace of God
There was no other way
I picked myself back up
I knew I had to stay
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
And decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way
I thanked my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning, there is no more mourning
Oh I can finally see myself again
I know I am enough
Possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the Universe call the bluff
Yeah, the truth will set you free
By the grace of God
There was no other way
I picked myself back up
I knew I had to stay
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
And decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way
Oh
That way, no
That way, no
Not in the name of love
In the name of love
That way, no
That way, no
I am not giving up
By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
Looked in the mirror
By the grace of God
There was no other way
I picked myself back up
I knew I had to stay
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
And decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way
And you said, "Don't give me nothing
You don't want to lose"
I said, "Darling, I'll give you everything I got
If I want them to choose"
Then I got on a plane and flew
Far away from you
Though unwillingly I left
And it was so, so hard to do
The streets here at home had rapidly filled up
With the whitest of snow
And they don't make no excuse for themselves
And there's no need, I know
Now I miss you more than I can take
And I will surely break
And every morning that I wake
God, it is the same
There's nothing more to it,
I just get through it
Oh, there's nothing more to it
I just get through it
It always takes my by surprise
How dark it gets this time of year
And how apparent it all becomes
That you're not close, not even near
No matter how many times I tell myself
I have to be sincere
I have a hard time standing up
And facing those fears
But Frank put it best when he said
"You can't plan on the heart"
Those words keep me on my feet
When I think I might just fall apart
Now I miss you more than I can take
And I will surely break
And every morning that I wake
God, there is this ache
There's nothing more to it,
I just get through it
Oh, there's nothing more to it
I just get through it
Oh, there's nothing more to it
I just get through it
And so I ask where are you now
Just when I needed you
I won't ask again
Because I know there's nothing we can do
Not now, darling, you know it's true
Tell me what you've seen
Was it a dream?
Was I in it?
Life seems so obscene
Until it's over
Who knows
All I want is someone who can fill the hole
In the life I know
In between life and death when there's nothing left
Do you wanna know?
You come in on your own
And you leave on your own
Forget the lovers you've known
And your friends on the road
Tell me if it's true
That I need you
You are changing
I've seen this world before
Down on this floor
It is hurting me
All I want is someone who can fill the hole
In the life I know
In between life and death when there's nothing left
Do you wanna know?
You come in on your own
And you leave on your own
Forget the lovers you've known
And your friends on the road
You come in on your own
And you leave on your own
Forget the lovers you've known
And the friends you have told
Lies
I've got to get rid of this hole inside
Lies
I've got to get rid of this hole inside
Yeah, I'm coming in on my own
I'm coming in on my own
I'm coming in on my own
I gotta get rid of this hole inside
I fell in love with you
But I know, I know that's just a sky
I don't know where, where I go
From the woods, from the woods
They are coming from the woods
Riding horses cloaked in gray
Make their way to my door
Lay their boots upon my floor
Wash their hands and start to pray
But I am gone, I am not there
I have followed mountain bears
To a cave of deepest tome
There I wait by the mouth
As the smoke it flushes out
Then I'll slowly drag one home
All these things are ever lost
Stillness has brought my love to cost
From the woods, from the woods
Once a vision from the woods
At a point between two tracks
Bound by tape and by wire
Bruised and beaten in the fire
So the metals faded black
Newer ropes, stronger nets
Have us plumbing further depths
For the wolves we'll never be
Should we go? Would we die?
If the weight it was to slide
Drag our secrets to the sea
All these things are ever lost
Stillness has brought my love to cost
I taste the sulfur on my breath
I see the blood pool on the step
The moon so thick, the wounds so fresh
And all is well
From the woods, from the woods
They are coming from the woods
From the woods, from the woods
They are coming from the woods
From the woods, from the woods
They are coming from the woods
From the woods, from the woods
They are coming from the woods
From the woods, from the woods
They are coming from the woods
From the woods, from the woods
They are coming from the woods
Everything is quiet
Since you're not around
And I live in the numbness, now
In the background
I do the things we did before
I walk Haight Street to the store
And they say "Where's that crazy girl
"You don't get drunk on red wine and fight no more."
I don't see you anymore
Since the hospital
The plans I make still have you in them
'Cause you come swimming into view
And I'm hanging on your words like I always used to do
The words they use so lightly, I only feel for you
I only know because I 
Carry you around, in the background
(I'm in the background) 
Ghosts, they come and memories all repeat
Lift your hair while they change the hospital sheets
And I would never lie to you, no
I would never lie to you, no
I felt you long after we were through
When we were through
The plans I make still have you in them
'Cause you come swimming into view
And I'm hanging on your words like I always used to do
The words they use so lightly, I only feel for you
I only know because I
Carry you around, in the background
'Cause I felt you long after we were through
When you come swimming into view
And I'm hanging on your words like I always used to do (come swimming into view)
The words they use so lightly, I only feel for you (you come swimming into view)
I only know because I'm way
I'm way... in the background
I'm in the background
On silver mount zion
All buried in ruins
We was dancing the hora
Until we vomited blood
Spinning like crazy
Shoshana was jonesing
The towers had fallen
And the wind called out
My grandfather's name
Let's kill first the banker
With his professional demeanour
Let's televise and broadcast
The raping of kings
Let our crowds be fed on
Teargas and plate-glass
'Cause a people united
Is a wonderful thing
I know that you're dying
And I know I'm unwell
And together we sashay
Through variations of hell
And as you walk through valleys of fear
The lure of my bed is ever near
Oh, don't be afraid, though the parade
Will not pass our way
It's nobler to never get paid
Than to bank on shit and dismay
I heard you fell into a rabbit hole
Covered yourself up in snow
Baby, tell me where'd you go
For days and days
Did they make you stay up all night?
Did they paint your face that pasty white?
You're thirsty but your appetite
Is chased away
The sun turns us to stone
It's a cloudy day
But we still can't go
Up and out that cellar door
Till we see the moon
We're invisible
No one ever takes the garbage out
The neighbour kid gets dare to touch the house
He runs back only to announce
There's no one home
'Cause we paint the foil with the flame
Smell the soda, taste butane
For every fear that can't be named
To calm you down
Your heart starts skipping steps
So your farther gone
Then you might expect
If your thoughts should turn to death
Gotta stomp them out
Like a cigarette
I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Baby I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the Marble Arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
I remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above, all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I called you from the hotel phone 
I haven't dialled this code before 
I'm sleeping later and waking later 
I'm eating less and thinking more 
And how am I without you? 
Am I more myself or less myself? 
I feel younger, louder 
Like I don't always connect 
Like I don't ever connect 
And do you like being single? 
Do you want me back? 
Do you want me back? 
And do I like being single? 
Am I coming back? 
Am I coming back? 
I'll put my suitcase here for now 
I'll turn the TV to the bed 
But if no one calls and I don't speak all day 
Do I disappear? 
And look at me without you 
I'm quite proud of myself 
I feel reckless, clumsy 
Like I'm making a bad mistake 
A really big mistake 
And do you like being single? 
Do you want me back? 
Do you want me back? 
And do I like being single? 
Am I coming back? 
Am I coming back? 
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
And now I know 
Each time I go 
I don't really know 
What I'm thinking 
And now I know 
Each time I go 
I don't really know 
What I'm thinking of 
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Remember when I took you up to the top of the hill?
We had our knives drawn, they were as sharp as we were in love
If God crossed us we'd take all his drugs
Burn his money and his house down
And wait for the fire to spread
But sometimes hate is not enough to turn this all to ashes
Together as one against all others
Break all of their wings and make sure it crashes
We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today
I had no choice, I erased the debt of our family
I let you say goodbye with lips like dynamite
And everyone turned their backs, 'cause they knew
When we held on tight to each other
That we were something fatal, that fell into the wrong hands
Sometimes hate is not enough to turn this all to ashes
Together as one against all others
Break all of their wings and make sure that it crashes
We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today
We don't seek death, we seek destruction
Until death, we seek destruction
We don't seek death, we seek destruction
Until death, we seek destruction
We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today
We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today
I can see a new beginning rise behind the sun
We can never catch up to it as fast as we run
I can see a new beginning rise behind the sun
We can never catch up to it as fast as we run
I can see a new beginning rise behind the sun
We can never catch up to it as fast as we run
There's a time and a place
This is neither the time nor place
Where do I fit in
In this jigsaw of a relationship?
Why should I play the fall guy to your love?
I keep getting snubbed
What dumb luck, what dumb luck
So rub it in with your dumb lyrics
Yeah, that's the time and place
To wring out your bullshit
And each album I get shit on a little more
Who's Tim's latest whore?
Now, that's not fair
No, that's just obscene
I'll stop speaking for you
If you stop speaking for me
I'm writing songs to entertain
But these people they just
They, they just want pain
They wanna hear my deepest sins
The songs from the ugly organ
And what comes out is a horrible mess
Songs I can't forget, what's been said
And this guilt I can't shed
Still rings in my ears
Again at the butcher's knife
I've been screaming for years
But it gets me nowhere
Just get out the butcher's knife
Will you get out the butcher's knife?
Get out the butcher's knife
That organ's playing my song
But the song's gone on too long
What a day to sever such ugly extremities
"What a lovely day," says the butcher as he raises his arm
"And I am what is left: a puppet. Laughing at the look of amazement on the musician's face, Pinocchio dove off the cliff and swam away..."
I don't know why you're mean to me
When I call on the telephone
And I don't know what you mean to me
But I want to turn you on, turn you up, figure you out, I want to take you on
These words, "You will be mine."
These words, "You will be mine."
All the time
The fool might be my middle name
But I'd be foolish not to say
I'm going to make whatever it takes
Bring you up, call you down, sign your name, secret love
Make it rhyme, take you in and make you mine
These words, "You will be mine."
These words, "You will be mine."
All the time, oh
I tripped and fell and did I fall
What I want to feel, I want to feel it now
You know with love come strange currencies
And here is my appeal:
I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance
A word, a signal, a nod, a little breath
Just to fool myself, to catch myself, to make it real, real
These words, "You will be mine."
These words, "You will be mine."
All the time, oh
These words, "You will be mine."
These words, they haunt me, hunt me down
Catch in my throat, make me pray,
Say, love's confined, on Earth
Instrumental
Man, I've had a few
But they wouldn't quite blow me like you
You gave me your name and signed
With a halo around my eye
And it hit me like never before
That love is a powerful force
Yes, it struck me that love is a sport
So I pushed you a little bit more
Love, you're news to me
You're a little bit more than I thought you'd be
A mole in my well-fed lawn
You're a nightmare beating the dawn
Oh, it hit me like never before
That love is a powerful force
Yes, it struck me that love is sport
So I pushed you a little bit more
Blue, blue, black and blue
Red blood sticks like glue
True love is cruel love
Red blood's a power-fuel
Sweet love, tasty blood
My heart overfloods
Oh you hit me!
Yeah, you hit me really hard
Man, you hit me!
Yeah you hit me right in the heart
Lord, I've had my deal
But I never quite knew how it feels
When love makes you wake up sore
With fists that are ready for more
And it hit me that love is a game
Like in war no one can be blamed
Yes, it struck me that love is a sport
So I pushed you a little bit more
Oh, blue, blue, black and blue
Red blood sticks like glue
True love is cruel love
Red blood's a power fuel
Sweet love tasted blood
My heart overfloods
Man, you hit me!
Yeah you hit me really hard
Baby, you hit me!
Yeah you punched me right in the heart
And then you kissed me
And then you hit me
And then you kissed me
And then you hit me
Oh, you haunt me with your violent heartbeat at night
Oh, you strike me with your silence baby, tonight
Why you haunt me with your violence baby, come hit me!
You haunt me with your violent heartbeat
There are things I could've told you
There's a time and a place
Where my words would allow me
To say what I want changed
Don't let me know as it's happening
Don't let me know what you've said
There were birds all around me
There were flowers pressed to my face
And in time you will forget me
And I'll try and do the same
Don't let me know as it's happening
Don't let me know what you've said
It's been years since I saw you
But each day I'd see your face
And in time you will remind me
That I wish we were the same
Don't let me know as it's happening
Don't let me know what you've said
I'm sick of always hearing 
All the sad songs on the radio 
All day it is there to remind 
An over-sensitive guy that he's lost and alone, yeah 
I hate our favorite restaurant, our favorite movie, our favorite show,
We would stay up all through the night 
We would laugh and get high, and never answer the phone 
I can't forgive, can't forget 
Can't give in, what went wrong 
Cause you said this was right 
You fucked up my life 
I'm sick of always hearing 
Sappy love songs on the radio 
This place, it's fucking cursed and it's plagued 
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes 
I can't forgive, can't forget 
Can't give in, what went wrong 
Cause you said this was right 
You fucked up my life 
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me 
What went wrong 
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me 
What went wrong 
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me 
What went wrong 
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me 
What went wrong 
I'm kicking
A nice heart and a white suit and a baby blue Sedan
And I am doing the best that I can
All the eunuchs, they were standing in rows, singing
Please stud us out just as fast as you possibly can
Sad song, last dance and no one knows who the band was
And Henry, you danced like a wooden Indian
Except this one mattered and I felt it had a spirit
And I shot the stork because I didn't hear it that way
And it's hard to be a human being
And it's harder as anything else
And I'm lonesome when you're around
And I'm never lonesome when I'm by myself
And I miss you when you're around
And I miss you when you're around
And I miss you when you're around
A nice heart and a white suit and a baby blue Sedan
And I am doing the best that I can
All the eunuchs, they were standing in rows, singing
Please stud us out just as fast as you possibly can
Sad song, last dance and no one knows who the band was
And Henry, you danced like a wooden Indian
And it's hard to be a human being
And it's harder as anything else
And I'm lonesome when you're around
And I'm never lonesome when I'm by myself
And I miss you when you're around
And I miss you when you're around
And I miss you when you're around
A nice heart and a white suit and a baby blue Sedan
Twilight, I fall in the harbor
Twilight, I fall in the hills
But here in the city that never sleeps
I can fall through one's fingers
When the swan flies to heaven
Soaring through the utmost fear
There's a feeling
That lingers in the afterwards
Will you ever return?
Will you ever return?
Will you ever return?
Twilight
Twilight
Twilight
Twilight, I sit at all tables
With my candles and angels besides
And I shall wait forever
As the day turns to night
Swallowed in the shadows that glow
Swallowed in the shadows that glow
Swallowed in the shadows that glow
When I sought out a light
And I knew darkness swallowed
I beseech, come to me
All alone, come to me
Twilight
You've read the books,
You've watched the shows,
What's the best way no one knows, yeah,
Meditate, hypnotized.
Anything to take from your mind.
But it won't, oh oh
You're doing all these things out of desperation,
Oh oh,
You're going through six degrees of separation.
You hit the drink, you take a toke
Watch the past go up in smoke.
Fake a smile, yeah, lie and say that,
You're better now than ever, and your life's okay
When it's not. No.
You're doing all these things out of desperation,
Oh oh,
You're going through six degrees of separation.
First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little
(Oh no there ain't no help, it's every man for himself)
(No no there ain't no help, it's every man for himself)
You tell your friends, yeah, strangers too,
Anyone who'll throw an arm around you, yeah
Tarot cards
Gems and stones,
Believing all that shit is gonna heal your soul.
Well it's not, no
You're only doing things out of desperation,
Oh oh,
You're goin' through six degrees of separation.
First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little
No there's no starting over,
Without finding closure, you take them back,
No hesitation,
That's when you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation
No there's no starting over,
Without finding closure, You take them back,
No hesitation,
That's when you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation
First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little
Succumb to the line
The finishing time
The long distance runner
Has stopped on the corner
But I won't give up
Although I've stopped too
Before the end of me and you
The patchwork explains
The land is unchanged
Interpret the rooms
My tears in the typing pool
The letters are sighing
The ink is still drying
I told you the truth
And now I sigh too
The page turns on me and you
Across that white plain
The land is unchanged
It is a Thursday 
I get up early 
It is a challenge 
I'm usually lazy 
I make some coffee 
I eat some rice chex 
And then I sit down 
To check my inbox 
I only read a word or two 
I stare across the street and see the churches and the blue 
The first orgasm of the morning 
Is cold and hard as hell 
There won't be any second coming 
As far as I can tell 
I arch my back cause 
I'm very close now 
It's very cold here 
By the window 
There are some school kids 
Yelling and running 
They barely notice 
That I am cumming 
The first orgasm of the morning 
Is like a fire drill 
It's nice to have a little warning 
But not enjoyable 
I am too busy to have friends 
A lover would just complicate my plans 
So I will never look for love again 
I'm taking matters into my own hands 
I'm taking matters into my own hands 
I think I could last at least a week without someone to hold me 
I think I could last at least a week without someone to hold me 
Won't you hold me, won't you hold me
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be, and long they will wait
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
In dreams, I meet you in long conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, in different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
Meet me after dark again and I'll hold you
I am nothing more than to see you there
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn
If only night can hold you where I can see you, my love
Then let me never ever wake again
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn
Somehow I know that we can't wake again from this dream
It's not real, but it's ours
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn
William:
Margaret, array the rocks around the hole before we're sinking
A million stones, a million bones, a million holes within the chinking
Painting rings around your eyes, these peppered holes so filled with crying
A whisper-weight upon the tattered down where you and I were lying
Tell me now, tell me this - a forest's son, a river's daughter
A willow wand, a will-o-wisp - our ghosts will wander all of the water
William & Margaret:
So let's be married here today, these rushing waves to bear our witness
And we will lie like river stones, rolling only where it takes us
But I pulled you and I called you here (Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I)
And I caught you and I brought you here (Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I)
But these hazards of love never more will trouble us
William:
Margaret, the lapping waves are licking quietly at our ankles
Another bow, another breath - this brilliant chill has come for to shackle
William & Margaret:
But with this long last rush of air let's speak our vows in starry whisper
And when the waves came crashing down, he closed his eyes and softly kissed her
(Singing) But I pulled you and I called you here (Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I)
And I caught you and I brought you here (Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I)
But these hazards of love never more will trouble us
And these hazards of love never more will trouble us
Everything you think you know, baby, is wrong
And everything you think you had, baby, is gone
Certain things turn ugly when you think too hard
And nagging little thoughts change into things you can't turn off
Everything you think you know, baby, is wrong
It's all over but the crying
Fade to black, I'm sick of trying
Took too much and now I'm done
It's all over but the crying
Do you really think I'm made of stone, baby, come on
That we only love the things we own, baby, you're wrong
Certain things just happen when you make no plans
And love can really tear you up and it can break you down
Everything you think you know, baby, is wrong
It's all over but the crying
Fade to black, I'm sick of trying
Took too much and now I'm done
It's all over but the crying
Baby, we're done
If I could I would, I'd change everything
'Cause I can't forget you
Though you don't believe me
Now I can't walk back, I can't leave behind
Where does it go, all the light that we had?
Everything you think you know, baby, is wrong
And everything you think you had, baby, is gone
Baby, we're done
Baby, we're done
Baby, we're done
Baby, we're done
Baby, we're done
Baby, we're done
Baby, we're done
As we were talking outside it was cold
We were shivering yet warmed by the subject matter
My wife is in the next room 
We've been having troubles you know 
Please don't tell her or anyone but I need to talk to somebody
You said wouldn't it be a shame if I knew how great I was 
Five minutes before I died I'd be filled with such regret
Before I took my last breath
And I said you're willing to tell me this now and
You're not going to die any time soon
And I said I haven't been eating chicken or meat or anything 
And you said yes but you've been wearing leather 
And laughed and said we're at the top of the food chain 
And yes you're still a fine woman and I cringed
I was hoping I was hoping we could heal each other
I was hoping I was hoping we could be raw together
We left the restaurant where the head waiter in his 60s said 
'Good-bye sir thank you for your business sir you're successful and established sir 
And we like the frequency with which you dine here sir 
And your money' and when I walked by he said, 'thank you too dear'
I was all pigtails and cords and there was a day when
I would've said something like 'Hey dude! I could buy and sell this place 
So kiss it' I too once thought I was owed something
I was hoping I was hoping we could challenge each other
I was hoping I was hoping we could crack each other up
I too thought that when proved wrong I lost somehow
I too once thought life was cruel
It's a cycle really you think I'm withdrawing and guilt tripping you 
I think you're insensitive and I don't feel heard 
And I said do you believe we are fundamentally judgemental?
Fundamentally evil?
And you said yes I said I don't believe in revenge 
In right or wrong good or bad you said
Well what about the man that I saw handcuffed in the emergency room 
Bleeding after beating his kid and she threw a shoe at his head
I think that what he did was wrong 
And I would've had a hard time feeling compassion for him
I had to watch my tone for fear of having you feel judged
I was hoping I was hoping we could dance together
I was hoping I was hoping we could be creamy together
All of the seasons
And all of the days
All of the reasons
Why I've felt this way
So long
So long
Then lost in that feeling
I looked in your eyes
I noticed emotion
And that you had cried
For me
I can see
What would touch me deeper
Tears that fall from eyes
That only cry?
Would it touch you deeper
Than tears that fall from eyes
That know why?
A lifetime of questions
Tears on your cheek
I tasted the answers
And my body was weak
For you
The truth
What would touch me deeper
Tears that fall from eyes
That only cry?
Would it touch you deeper
Than tears that fall from eyes
That know why?
I've been looking in the mirror for so long
That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side
All the little pieces falling, shatter
Shards of me, too sharp to put back together
Too small to matter
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces
If I try to touch her
And I bleed, I bleed
And I breathe, I breathe no more
Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirit's well
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child
Lie to me, convince me that I've been sick forever
And all of this will make sense when I get better
But I know the difference between myself and my reflection
I just can't help but to wonder
Which of us do you love
So I bleed, I bleed
And I breathe, I breathe no
Bleed, I bleed
And I breathe, I breathe
I breathe, I breathe no more
All we ever wanted was everything
All we ever got was cold
Get up, eat jelly
Sandwich bars, and barbed wire
Squash every week into a day
The sound of the drum is calling
The sound of the drum has called
Flash of youth shoot out of darkness
Factorytown
Oh to be the cream
Couldn't relax, couldn't sit back
And let the sunlight in my lap
I sang a hymn to bring me peace
And then it came, a melody
It felt so sweet, it felt so strong
It made me feel like I belonged
And all the sadness inside me
Melted away like I was free
I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be, I could be
Happy, happy
Don't go out much at all
I've never been the type to call
I realize, to be happy
Maybe I need a little company
So now you know, you know it all
That I've been des-desperately alone
I haven't found the one for me
But I believe in divinity
I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be, I could be
Happy, happy
I believe (I believe) in possibility
I believe (I believe) someone's watching over me
And finally (Finally) I have found a way to be
Happy, happy
From the concrete to the coast
I was looking for a holy ghost
Like the land joining the sea
Happiness, it followed me
I believe (I believe) in possibility
I believe (I believe) someone's watching over me
And finally (Finally) I have found a way to be
Happy, happy, happy
Take heart, my little friend
And push back your seat
Soon we'll be far away
Far from the street
Where you learned how to be
Not what you are
Up on the shoulder
There is a town
With a little motel
And an old movie house
We'll go to a movie
Whatever it is
Watchin' the movie
The world's gonna end
And there ain't no place for
A boy and his friend
To go
I'll pick some daisies
From the flower bed
Of the Galaxy Theater
While you clear your head
I thought some daisies
Might cheer you up
Oooooooooooooo
Oooooooooooooo
Oooooooooooooo
Oooooooooooooo
Oooooooooooooo
Oooooooooooooo
Oooooooooooooo
Oooooooooooooo
Long afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
Till your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me closer to your isle
And you sang
Sail to me
Sail to me
Let me unfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you
Did I dream you dreamed about me
Were you hare when I was fox
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sing
Touch me not
Touch me not
Come back tomorrow
O my heart
O my heart shies from the sorrow
I'm as puzzled as the newborn child
I'm as troubled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers
Or should I lie with death my bride
Hear me sing
Swim to me
Swim to me
Let me unfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you
A short delay, the parrot blues
Little voices mimic you
It's not so hard to make that sound
So watch your back, the Ides of March
Cut your hair like Joan of Arc
Disguise your will, they'll find you out
And when they do
Look out
There's money-lenders inside the temple
That circus tiger's gonna break your heart
Something so wild turned into paper
If I loved you, well that's my fault
A bitch in heat, the alpha male
Not something she'd ever tell
Except when she got deathly high
And out it came like summer rain
It washed the cars and everything
Felt clean for just a little while
A telethon 
We drunk dialed
Those starving children they ain't got no mother
There's pink flamingos living in the mall
I'd give a fortune to your infomercial
If somebody would just take my call
Take my call
Take my call
Hello
Patterns in my mind now moving slow
Sorrow all across the surface rolls
Smoothing out the edges of the stone
The lights are out. Where'd everybody go?
Alone
Erase yourself and you'll be free
Mandala destroyed by the sea
All we are is colored sand
So pay to ride the ferris wheel
Smile, all that you can feel
Is gratitude for what has been
'Cause it did not 
Happen
There's money-lenders inside the temple
That circus tiger's gonna break my heart
Something so wild turned into paper
If you love me, then that's your fault
There's money-lenders inside the temple
This crystal city's gonna fall apart
When all their power turns into vapor
If I miss you, well that's my fault
That's my fault
That's my fault
Everybody's laughin' in my mind
Rumors spreadin' about this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me
Does he love you the way I can
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me
'Cause baby I didn't
That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me
That should be me
You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
Whatcha doin' to me?
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're trying to break my heart
It's working, 'cause you know
That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That should be me
I need to know should I fight for love
Or disarm it's getting harder to shield
This pain is my heart (oh oh oh)
That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me
Holding your hand
That should be me
The one making you laugh, oh baby oh
That should be me
That should be me, giving you flowers
That should be me
Talking for hours, that should be me, that should be me
That should be me
Never should've let you go
I never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go
Oh-oh-oh-ohh
That should be me
Never should've let you go hey ey
I never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go
What if there was no light
Nothing wrong, nothing right
What if there was no time?
And no reason or rhyme?
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?
What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?
Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try?
Ooh, that's right
Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
But that's the risk that you take
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life?
That you don't want me there by your side?
Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
How can you know it when you don't even try?
Ooh, that's right
Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
You know that darkness always turns into light
Ooh, that's right
For a while I sat there staring at her photograph
For a while I cried and tried not to make a scene
There was a time when we were young
I used to make her laugh
But life is long, my love has gone away from me
Gone away from me
Gone away from me
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
Gone away from me
Gone away from me
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
Lately I can't seem to find myself no sleep at all
Lately I just lie awake and hear and dream
Of the time when she was mine
Felt like I had it all
But life is long, my love has gone away from me
Gone away from me
Gone away from me
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
Gone away from me
Gone away from me
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
Yesterday is gone
Yesterday is dead
Get it through your head and walk away
Yesterday is gone
Ain't no use hanging on to her memory
It only causes you pain
For a while I sat there staring at her photograph
For a while I cried and tried not to make a scene
There was a time when we were young
I used to make her laugh
But life is long, my love has gone away from me
Gone away from me
Gone away from me
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
Gone away from me
Gone away from me
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
And we wait above a road
We're turning to go home
And the silence from the side of the car
Tells me everything and how we are
'Cause there's no more trying to make this so right
There's no more trying tonight
And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone
And I wonder if, I'm alone in your head
I know something is wrong
I just don't know what to do
You say it's only me, and, that I'm so perfect for you
I don't want to try no more
I don't want to make this right
I just want you to be true to me one time
And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone
And I wonder if I'm alone in your head
Twelve days gone by, since I have saw you last
I'll give this one more try
I'll give it all my best, and, I'll ask
What could you be doing that is so much fun?
Without me by your side
Without me by your side
And, I will take a step back, and, I'll let you ahead
And, I will take a step away, and, see if you come back
Because there's no more trying to make this so right
There's no more trying
There's no more trying tonight
We will never be the same
We will never be the same
We will never be the same
We will never be the same
Until you're done
Well, everything's so different now
A scream which fills the air
And haunts the smallest children's sleep upon the floor
Where have they gone?
You hear them say with smiles meant to cry
As they wind a watch wrapped on a wrist
And quickly look away
And four and six have come and gone
Five times before they're seen
And upon the lips of everyone a curse they've never dreamed yeah
Upon the lips of everyone a curse they've never dreamed
It's a complicated situation
It's a complicated situation mama
I'm a complicated situation
The young must be our sacrifice
They say with crippled grins
The eyes of youth must lose their way
And stumble here within
So the sleeping children were awoke
In time to haze their eyes
So was never known on which they choked
Through books of older time
So was never known on which they choked
Through books of older time
It's a complicated situation
It's a complicated situation mama
I'm a complicated situation
Laying on the bathroom floor
Kitty licks my cheek once more
And I, I could try
But waking up is harder when you wanna die
Walter's on the telephone
Tell him I am not at home
'Cause I think that I
Am going to a place where I am always high
My name's Elizabeth
My life is shit and piss
This ruined puzzle
Is beige with the pieces
All face down.
So the placing goes slowly.
The pictures of anything
Other than it's meant to be.
But the hours they creep
The patterns repeat
Don't be concerned
You know I'll be fine on my own.
I never said "Don't Go" (don't go)
But I've hidden a note
It's pressed between pages that
You've marked to find your way back.
It says...
"Does he ever get the girl? "
But what if the pages stay pressed
The chapters unfinished
The stories too dull to unfold?
Does he ever get the girl?
This basement's a coffin
I'm buried alive
I'll die in here just to be safe.
I'll die in here just to be safe.
'Cause you're gone
I get nothing
And you're off with barely a sigh
I never said goodbye.
But I've hidden a note
It's pressed between pages
That you've marked to find your way back
It says...
"Does he ever get the girl?"
But I've hidden a note
That's pressed between pages
That you'll read if you're so inclined
Does he ever get the girl?
But the hours they creep
The patterns repeat
Don't be concerned
I know I'll be fine on my own.
I never said "Don't Go" (don't go)
Does he ever get the girl?
Does he kiss your eyelids in the morning
When you start to raise your head?
And does he sing to you, incessantly,
From the space between your bed and wall?
Does he walk around all day at school,
With his feet inside your shoes?
Looking down every few steps
To pretend he walks with you?
Oh, Does he know that place below your neck
That's your favorite to be touched?
And does he cry through broken sentences like,
"I love you far too much"?
Does he lay awake listening to your breath?
Worried you smoke too many cigarettes?
Is he coughing now?
On a bathroom floor?
For every speck of tile
There's a thousand more
You won't ever see
But must hold inside yourself
Eternally
Well, I drug your ghost across the country
And we plotted out my death
In every city, memories would whisper,
"Here is where you rest."
I was determined in Chicago
But I dug my teeth into my knees
And I settled for a telephone
Sang into your machine,
"You are my sunshine,
My only sunshine.
You are my sunshine,
My only sunshine."
And I kissed a girl with a broken jaw
That her father gave to her
She had eyes bright enough to burn me;
They reminded me of yours
And in a story told, she was a little girl in a red-rouge, sun-bruised field
And there were rows of ripe tomatoes, where a secret was concealed
And it rose like thunder
Clapped under our hands
And it stretched for centuries
To a diary entry's end
Where I wrote,
"You make me happy,
Oh, when skies are gray.
You make me happy
Oh, when skies are gray, and gray, and gray."
Well the clock's heart it hangs inside its open chest
With its hands stretched towards the calendar hanging itself
But I will not weep
For those dying days
For all the ones who've left
There's a few that stayed
And they found me here
And pulled me from the grass
Where I was laid
I fell into the ocean
When you became my wife
I risked it all against the sea
To have a better life
Marie you are the wild blue sky
And men do foolish things
You turn kings into beggars
And beggars into kings
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old days again
When all the world was green
The face forgives the mirror
The worm forgives the plow
The questions begs the answer
Can you forgive me somehow?
Maybe when our story's over
We'll go where it's always spring
The band is playing our song again
And all the world is green
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old days again
When all the world was green
The moon is yellow silver
Oh the things that summer brings
It's a love you'd kill for
And all the world is green
He's balancing a diamond
On a blade of grass
The dew will settle on our graves
When all the world is green
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old days again
When all the world was green
You told me boy look the other way
You told me boy bite your tongue
Yes that's not the way,
Yeah that's not the way
Ah that's not the way that friends behave
Ah that's just not the way that friends behave
Oh no, no, no,
No, no, no, no
You lined me up
Across the room
Two falling sparks
One willing fool
And I, I always knew
That I would love you from afar
You told me boy look the other way
You told me boy hide those hands
But I've been living on the crumbs of your love
And I'm starving now
And that is the way that we remain
Ah that will be the way that we remain
Oh no no no
No no no no
You lined me up
Across the room
Two falling sparks
One willing fool
And I, I always knew
That I would love you from afar
You lined me up
Across the room
Two falling sparks
One willing fool
And I, I always knew
That I would love you from afar
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
She got darling hazel eyes
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now (x4)
In all I know
And what I've done
I take you along
Though you're not here
I can feel you there
I take you along
And when I'm scared
I imagine you're there
Telling me to be brave
So I will be brave for you
Stand on a stage for you
Do the things that I'm afraid to do
I know you want me to
I will be brave
I know you want me to
I see things change
And now watch them grow
And I know you do too
When the things don't make sense
I have courage
Because of you
And when I'm scared
I imagine you're there
Telling me to be brave
So I will be brave for you
Stand on a stage for you
Do the things that I'm afraid to do
I know you want me to
I will be brave
I will be brave
Do the things that I'm afraid to do
I know you want me to
There are things I wish I didn't know
I try my best to let them go
Instrumental
How many times have you told me you wanna die?
How many times have you told me now that you've tried?
Oh, and how many times will I let you get away with murder?
Oh, and how many times will you make me feel more alive?
Hey, I got a feeling there's something going wrong
I put my thoughts in a letter, send it when I'm feeling strong
In the time you became the girl that you wanted to be
Oh, I told you all along there was no point looking to me
Oh, it's been hard to be strong, all of this going on
Yes, it's been hard to be strong with all this going on
I've been lonely too, like you
I'm just like you, I'm just like you
People have been travelling miles just to hear us sing
It's a February night and I don't wanna feel anything
To get away, maybe I could sell kisses
In Portland I tried my pretty hand at fishing
Oh, it's been hard to be strong, all of this going on
Yes, it's been hard to be strong with all this going on
I've been lonely too, like you
I'm just like you, I'm just like you
I'm just like you, I'm just like you
Hey, I got a feeling there's something going wrong
I put my thoughts in a letter, send it when I'm feeling strong
I heard it said
You had come back from the dead
And you were playing so fine
Scooping up the soul of the wine
Courage my boy, when you look them in the eye
Try not to look too scummy
If you want some money
If you need some money now, oh...
This ain't no happy place to be
There's nothin' nice around me
Nothin' nice about me almost everyone agrees
It's a hell of a year for you and me my friend
Oh promises, promises
I know you've heard them all before
Love is, love is, love is, love is, love is...
Oh well it's just around the corner
I heard it said
You had come back from the dead
Playing so fine
Even if you don't show up on time
Courage my boy
When you look them in the eye
Laugh if they try to be funny
If you need some money now, oh...
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Haven't you seen me sleepwalking?
'Cause I've been holding your hand
Haven't you noticed me drifting?
Oh let me tell you, I am
Tell me it's nothing
Try to convince me
That I'm not drowning
Oh let me tell you, I am
Please, please tell me you know
I've got to let you go
I can't help falling out of love with you
Why am I feeling so guilty?
Why am I holding my breath?
Worried about everyone but me
And I just keep losing myself
Tell me it's nothing
Try to convince me
That I'm not drowning
Oh let me tell you, I am
Please, please tell me you know
I've got to let you go
I can't help falling out of love with you
Won't, won't you read my mind?
Don't you make me lie here
And die here
Please, please tell me you know
I've got to let you go
I can't help falling out of love with you
With you
Haven't you noticed?
I'm sleepwalking
Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
And think of you
Turning in circles confusion--
Is nothing new
Flashback to warm nights--
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories,
Time after--
Sometimes you picture me--
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you have said--
And you say--go slow--
I've fall behind--
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look--and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you--I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
After your picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows--I'm wondering
If you're OK
You say--go slow--
I fall behind--
The drum beats out of time--
If you're lost you can look--and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you--I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
(Time after time)
Time after time
Time after time
(Time after time)
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
(Time after time)
Time after... time (time)
If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
Ba-ba-ba-bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
Bass, bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
It's like 1, 2, 3, fuck it
I'm about to take this drink and just stuff it
Fish tank this thang along with four more shots Potron
I don't give a fuck about goin' home
Straight buzzin', Robitussin
Wanna get your mitts in my oven?
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'?
G-g-g-get, get a lick of this lovin'
Yeah, I like it loud
And I'll make you shout
Give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that boom boom pow
If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
Bass, bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
Bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
Bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
It's like 1, 2, 3, okay
Can I get a little Goose in my O.J.?
E'rey day feel like my birthday
And we sip champagne when we thirsty
Quit fightin' while your husband
Tryin' to get his mitts in my oven
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'?
G-g-g-get, get a lick of this lovin'
Yeah, I like it loud
And I make you shout
Give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that boom boom pow
If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
Bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
Bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
I got a question for you
Do you like it when I flow?
I got a question for you, ooh, ooh
Do you like it when I flow?
With my bass down low
It's like la la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
(Drop it to the floor)
Bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
Ba-ba-bass down low
Ba-bass, bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
I, I, I like my beats fast
And my bass down low
I feel I know you
I don't know how
I don't know why
I see you feel for me
You cried with me
You would die for me
I know I need you
I want you
To be free of all the pain
You have inside
You cannot hide
I know you tried
To be who you couldn't be
You tried to see inside of me
And now I'm leaving you
I don't want to go
Away from you
Please try to understand
Take my hand
Be free of all the pain
You hold inside
You cannot hide
I know you tried
To feel
1, 2, 3, 4
From our lives
The land disappears
All that is left is a heart made of tears
From her smile the golden tooth is worn
Child your only hope has flown
Hold on to this house
All I have left is the only place I've been
It's all heart and lungs
It's not that much fun
It's hard, hard to run
It's not that much fun
It's all heart and lungs
It's all...
Heart 
Heart
Heart
Heart
Hush now, don't explain
You're the cause of all my trouble and pain
Unless you're mine
Don't explain
My love, my love, my love, don't explain
There is nothing within me now to gain
You know that I love you, but look at what lovin' has done
All my thoughts were real and so sincere
I was so completely yours
I know I hear folks ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chatter
And I know you cheat
Right or wrong, right now it doesn't matter
You're here with me, sit down, have a seat
It's your turn to feel the pain
It's your turn to weep
Don't explain
Hush now, don't explain
There is nothing within me now to gain
I'm gonna escape out your steel 
Don't explain
Don't explain
Don't blame your daughter
That's just sentimental
And don't blame your mom
For all that you've done wrong
Your dad is not guilty
You came out a little faulty
And the factory closed
So you can't hold them liable
You come from an island
You're cutting diamonds
With a rubber knife
Your autograph's worthless
So don't send me letters
And don't mail me cash
'Cause your money is no good
What's left in your mattress
Is holes and lack of love left
Some hair from a horse
And none of it is yours, man
You come from an island
You're cutting diamonds
With a rubber knife
And the song you sing today
Wasn't always in your head
The words you're trying to say
Are the ones you should've said
They're glistening like diamonds
Go out and find them
But don't blame your daughter
Read me your tombstone
Tell me you're sorry
Fax me your will
You owe me something still
Blood is like water
The bath that you poured me
Has drained and it's gone
Don't blame it on your son
And the song you sing today
Wasn't always in your head
The words you're trying to say
Are the ones you should've said
They're glistening like diamonds
Go out and find them, boy
The world is full of diamonds
Go out and find them
But don't blame your daughter
Caroline says
As she gets up off the floor
Why is it that you beat me
It isn't any fun
Caroline says
As she makes up her eyes
You ought to learn more about yourself
Think more than just I
But she's not afraid to die
All her friends call her "Alaska"
When she takes speed, they laugh and ask her
What is in her mind
What is in her mind
Caroline says
As she gets up from the floor
You can hit me all you want to
But I don't love you anymore
Caroline says
While biting her lip
Life is meant to be more than this
And this is a bum trip
But she's not afraid to die
All her friends call her "Alaska"
When she takes speed, they laugh and ask her
What is in her mind
What is in her mind
She put her fist through the window pane
It was such a funny feeling
It's so cold in Alaska
It's so cold in Alaska
It's so cold in Alaska
And I cry and no one can hear
In hell
The blinded eyes that see
The chaos
Bring the pitiful to me
Even though I'm wide awake, I will
And blackest night and I wait for you
It's cold in here there's no one left
And I wait for you
And nothing stops it happening
And I knew, I'd cherish all my misery alone
And I wait staring at the Northern Star
I'm afraid it won't lead me anywhere
He's so cold he will ruin the world tonight
All the angels kneeling to the Northern Lights
Kneel into the frozen lights
And they paid, I cry and cry for you
Ghosts that haunt you with their sorrow
I cried 'cause you were doomed
Praying to the wound that swallows
All that's cold and cruel
Can you see the trees
Charity and gratitude
They run to the pines
It's black in here blot out the sun
And run to the pines
Our misery runs wild and free
And I knew, the fire and the ashes of his grace
And I wait staring at the Northern Star
I'm afraid it won't lead you very far
He's so cold he will win the world tonight
All the angels kneeling to the frozen lights
Feel their hearts they're cold and white
And I want you
And blessed are the broken
And I beg you
No loneliness, no misery is worth you
Oh tear his heart out cold as ice it's mine
And I wait praying to the Northern Star
I'm afraid it won't lead you anywhere
He's so cold raining on the world tonight
All the angels kneeling to the Northern Lights
And I pray begging to the Northern Star
I'm afraid it won't lead you anywhere
He's so cold he will rule the world tonight
All the angles kneeling to the Northern Lights
Kneeling to the frozen lights
Feel their hearts they're cold as ice
Cyrus Jones, 1810 to 1913
Made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103
103 is forever when you're just a little kid
So, Cyrus Jones lived forever
Gravedigger, when you dig my grave,
Could you make it shallow,
So that I can feel the rain?
Gravedigger...
Muriel Stonewall, 1903 to 1954
She lost both of her babies in the second great war.
Now, you should never have to watch
As your own children are lowered in the ground, 
No, you should never have to bury your own babies
Gravedigger, when you dig my grave,
Could you make it shallow,
So that I can feel the rain?
Gravedigger...
Ring around the rosey
Pocket full of posey
Ashes to ashes
We all fall down
Gravedigger, when you dig my grave,
Could you make it shallow,
So that I can feel the rain?
Gravedigger...
Little Mikey Carson, '67 to '75
He rode his bike like the devil until the day he died
When he grows up he wants to be
Mr. Vertigo on the flying trapeze
Oh, 1940 to 1992
Gravedigger, when you dig my grave,
Could you make it shallow,
So that I can feel the rain?
Gravedigger, when you dig my grave,
Could you make it shallow,
So that I can feel the rain,
I can feel the rain, I can feel the rain?
Gravedigger, when you dig my grave,
Could you make it shallow,
So that I can feel the rain?
Gravedigger...
Gravedigger...
The winter here's cold, and bitter
It's chilled us to the bone
We haven't seen the sun for weeks
To long too far from home
I feel just like I'm sinking
And I claw for solid ground
I'm pulled down by the undertow
I never thought I could feel so low
Oh darkness I feel like letting go
If all of the strength
And all of the courage
Come and lift me from this place
I know I could love you much better than this
Full of grace
Full of grace
My love
It's better this way, I said
Having seen this place before
Where everything we say and do
Hurts us all the more
Its just that we stayed, too long
In the same old sickly skin
I'm pulled down by the undertow
I never thought I could feel so low
Oh darkness I feel like letting go
If all of the strength
And all of the courage
Come and lift me from this place
I know I could love you much better than this
Full of grace
Full of grace
My love
I know I could love you much better than this
It's better this way
Well it's good to hear your voice
I hope you're doing fine
And if you ever wonder
I'm lonely here tonight
I'm lost here in this moment
And time keeps slipping by
And if I could have just one wish
I'd have you by my side
Oh, I miss you
Oh, I need you
And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder everyday
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will stay
Well I tried to live without you
But tears fall from my eyes
I'm alone and I feel empty
God, I'm torn apart inside
I look up at the stars
Hoping you are doing the same
And somehow I feel closer
And I can hear you say
Oh, I miss you
Oh, I need you
I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder everyday
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will stay, always stay
I never want to lose you
And if I had to I would choose you
So stay
Please always stay
You're the one that I hold on to
'Cause my heart would stop without you
I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder everyday
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me I will stay
I will stay, I'll always stay
And I love you more than I did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask, I will stay
I will stay, I will stay
I might have been a singer
Who sailed around the world
A gambler who wins millions
And spent it all on girls
I might have been a poet
Who walked upon the moon
A scientist who'd tell the world
I'd discovered something new
I might have loved a king
And been the one to end a war
A criminal who drinks champagne
And never could be caught
But among your books, among your clothes
Among your noise and fuss, I've let it go
I can stop and catch my breath
