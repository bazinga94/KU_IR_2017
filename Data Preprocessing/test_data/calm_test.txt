God made us rational
Thought made you stereo
I think of you today
Boy, what an A-hole
You made me spare
Like used software
I will not join you
Friends made you sensitive
Loss made us idiots
Fear makes us critical
Knowledge is difficult
You made me spare
Like used software
It will not bring you
Fear makes us visual
Life made you beautiful
Hate makes us powerless
Turn on your radio
You made me spare
Like used software
I will not follow you
Sleep makes you possible
Doom made this laughable
Night made a day like this
Love made a festival.
It's the season of grace coming out of the void
Where a man is saved by a voice in the distance
It's the season of possible miracle cures
Where hope is currency and death is not the last unknown
Where time begins to fade
And age is welcome home
It's the season of eyes meeting over the noise
And holding fast with sharp realization
It's the season of cold making warmth a divine intervention
You are safe here you know now
Don't forget
Don't forget I love
I love
I love you
It's the season of scars and of wounds in the heart
Of feeling the full weight of our burdens
It's the season of bowing our heads in the wind
And knowing we are not alone in fear
Not alone in the dark
Don't forget
Don't forget I love
I love
I love you
Don't forget
Don't forget I love
I love
I love you
Don't forget
Don't forget I love
I love
I love you
Don't forget
Don't forget I love
I love
I love you
It's a jungle out there
Disorder and confusion everywhere
No one seems to care
Well, I do
Hey, who's in charge here?
It's a jungle out there
Poison in the very air we breathe
You know what's in the water that you drink?
Well, I do, and it's a-ma-zing
People think I'm crazy
'Cause I worry all the time
If you paid attention,
You'd be worried too
You'd better pay attention
Or this world we love so much
Might just kill you
I could be wrong now
But I don't think so
'Cause it's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there

In a green hollow
Where a river sings
Tiny valley
Blue bells rings
There's a young soldier
Under the clouds
His mouth is open
And the light rains down
And the light rains down
And the crows come 'round
To the two red holes
In his right side, oh
In his right side, oh
Sleeping in the sun
His hand on his breast
Nape of his neck
The blue watercress
He's just a kid
And he never knew
He would be
The sleeper in the valley so soon
So soon, so soon
And the crows, they swoon
At the two red holes
In his right side, oh
So soon, so soon
And the crows, they swoon
At the two red holes
In his right side, oh
In his right side
Third Day (1996) album version:
I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain
Just to be with the one he loves
How many times has he broken that promise
It has never been done
I've never climbed the highest mountain
But I walked the hill of Calvary
Just to be with you, I'd do anything
There's no price I would not pay, no
Just to be with you, I'd give anything
And I would give my life away, yeah
And I've heard it said that a man would swim the ocean
Just to be with the one he loves
All of those dreams are in empty motion
It can never be done
I've never swam the deepest ocean
But I walked upon the raging sea
Just to be with you, I'd do anything
There's no price I would not pay, no
Just to be with you, I'd give anything
And I would give my life away, yeah
And I know that you don't understand the fullness of My love
How I died upon the cross for your sins
And I know that you don't realize how much that I give you
And I promise, I would do it all again
Just to be with you, I've done everything
There's no price I did not pay, no
Just to be with you, I gave everything
Yes, I gave my life away, yeah
I gave my life away
Yeah, just to be with you
Oh, just to be with you
Oh, just to be with you
Oh, just to be with you
Offerings album version:
Spoken:
Oh, has anyone had a good time tonight?
Amen.  Amen.
We've had a good time tonight.  I'm tired there.  I'm tired.
I can't go home.  I can't go home.
Mark, can you go home?
Yeah.
All right, let's do this.
I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain
Just to be with the one he loves
How many times has he broken that promise
It has never been done
Well, I've never climbed the highest mountain
But I walked the hill of Calvary
Just to be with you, well I'd do anything
Where there's no price I would not pay, no
And just to be with you, I'd give anything
Oh yes, I would give my life away
Yes
And I've heard it said that a man would swim the oceans
Just to be with the one he loves
But all of those dreams are in empty motion
It can never be done
Well, I've never swam the deepest oceans
But I walked upon the raging sea
Just to be with you, well I'd do anything
Where there's no price I would not pay, no
And just to be with you, well, I'd give anything
Oh yes, I would give my life away
Yes
And I know that you don't understand the fullness of My love
How I died upon the cross for your sins
And I know that you don't realize how much that I give you
But I promise, I would do it all again
And just to be with you, I've done everything
Well, there's no price I did not pay, no
Just to be with you, I gave everything
Oh yes, I gave my life away
Yes, I gave my life away
Yeah, yes, just to be with you
All just to be with you
All just to be with you
All just to be with you
(empty space until  3:16)
Don't Let Me Go
Take my heart and help me feel
Take my faith and make it real
Take my eyes and help me see
All the love surrounding me
Don't let me go
Hold me close to where You are
Don't let me go
Take my heart, take all of me
Take my loss and take my gain
Take my trials and take my pain
Take my life and let it be
All that You would have for me
Don't let me go
Hold me close to where You are
Don't let me go
Take my heart, take all of me
Don't let me go
Hold me close to where You are
Don't let me go
Take my heart, take all of me
Don't let me go
Take my heart, take all of me
Skar the fire son, pet the smiling one
Woo the sleeping one, r' the crying one
H'-hviss my little one, r'-r' my crying one
Ligg-ligg my tired one, rura sleeping one
Touch a feal, you blind a must
Soft the skin of the warmest rust
Cause nothing blows in the faraway
I go away, go away past the hills, past the day
Touch a feal, you blind a must
Soft the skin of the warmest rust
Cause nothing blows in the faraway
I go away, go away past the hills, past the day
I have stood here in this garden
Where you placed me in the spring
I have held my arms gracefully from my side
A dog dish and an Afro pick
You laid beside me as a trick
Of compassion that comes through the night
In fields of green, in fields of straw
There ain't no telling what we saw
As we stand together on this hill
I used to be a part of a more complicated scheme
As furniture with glass upon my head
You paint me white, you clean me off
You say my name each time you cough
It's a pattern as old as it gets
I'll stay right here till you get back
You're concrete white, I'm plastic black
I'm the statue of the Virgin Mary
I am free from all decisions
I am free from all despair
You can see there's not a wrinkle on my face
Looks pretty good from where I stand
No crying fields, no sins of man
All for the love of Raymond
All for the love of Raymond
Speed along the highway,
Honey, I want it my way.
But listen to her daddy's song,
Don't stay out too long.
Ooh, we're just busy hiding,
Sitting in the back seat of my car.
Looking for a ride and all about,
Looking for a ride in and out of town,
Strolling around and all about,
Looking for a ride in and out of...
The laser lights are pretty,
We may end up in Mexico city.
But listen to her daddy's song,
Making love is wrong.
Ooh, we're just busy riding,
Sitting in the back seat of my car.
Oh, oh,...
Pah-pah-pah-pah-pah-pah,
Pah-pah-pah-pah-pah-pah-pah.
For we was only hiding,
Sitting in the back seat of my car.
Yeah
And when we finished driving,
We can say we were late in arriving.
And listen to her daddy's song,
We believe that we can't be wrong, yeah!
Oh-oh, we believe that we can't be wrong,
Oh-oh, we believe that we can't be wrong,
We can make it to Mexico city,
Sitting in the back seat of my car.
Oh, oh,...
Oh-oh, we believe that we can't be wrong,
Oh-oh, we believe that we can't be wrong,
Oh-oh, we believe that we can't be wrong,
Oh-oh, we believe that we can't be wrong,
Oh-oh, we believe that we can't be wrong,
Oh-oh, we believe that we can't be wrong,
No, no, no, ...
We believe we can't be wrong,
Yeah! yeah! yeah!
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Love me again
Be my friend
I need you now
I'll show you somehow
Lost highway, carry on
All the souls that I've known
I see flowers everywhere
But it's only cryings that come up in the air
So many lives around I guess that it was just your time
For every rose, one big stone
One phone call, my world alone
I miss you, sweet mother
I'll see you some other time
Some other grounds
Lost highway way too fast
Headlights burnin' all my laughs
Where was I when you screamed
Where was I when you lost all your dreams
People think,that it's alright
When your face got so much light
Did your blue eyes peacefully
Finally dived into the sea
I miss you sweet brother
I'll see you some other time
Some other grounds
Nothing could tell the power of your smell
How many hands on my head
You took the train with heavy tickets
It's not your fault
You couldn't make it
I know that the sun shines better
Now that you'll stay by his side
For ever
One phone call, my world alone
I miss you sweet sister
I'll see you some other time
Some other grounds
Let the drive sequence begin. Hit it, Pinback...
She lays among the flowers
And spreads among the sheets.
She counts the clouds for hours
And turns them into sheep.
They sleep along the rivers
And shower in the deep
And breath in all that's Autumn,
Till Winter stays.
They almost didn't find her,
A couple times she walked to the train tracks
Sometimes her forehead gets hot.
It comes and goes.
Sometimes the medicine can heal her kind.
It's like a hurricane inside her.
Inside the hurricane her mind gets blown.
It's like a hurricane inside her.
When it feels like you've been cancelled
Like someone took your breath away
To replace it with ether
And you stagger in headwind all day
It's too easy to go crazy
Way much harder to stay clear
Tough you're pleading (come save me)
No one or nothing comes near
Refrigerate your fire
The grim faces that you're passing
In your freefall from the ground
Won't remember, won't be asking
And they won't be making a sound
Hold your soldiers
And keep them in the woods
Until it's over, it will be
Wait see
The sun sets
And morning
Puts you back into place
The right place
Refrigerate your fire
Every time you look away
I see tomorrow morning
Breaking at the edge of day
On distant shores of night
Makes me feel so far away
You tune out without warning
Tell me what you see today
Show me that secret light
(Ba ba ba baaa...)
And make this evening bright
Show me that secret light
I know you fight against the shadows
You're looking for the light
But you can't find the window
Every time you say a word
Your eyes fall like plum flowers
So meaningless it seems absurd
It's all so very sweet
Everytime I hear the strum
Of tears across your fingers
Tell me what you can't decide so long
Where fingers cannot reach
(Ba ba ba baaa...)
And make this song complete
Where fingers cannot reach
I know you fight against the shadows
You're looking for the light
But you can't find the window
Let's make the music right
Show me that secret light
I know you fight against the shadows
You're looking for the light
But you can't find the window
I know it's been so long (x10)
Father your failures are so grave,
They have seeped to son.
No amount of wishing,
For grace to be regained or won.
10,000 pounds of hope,
On the shoulders of one.
It's clear to me,
How the son has gone to seed.
It's clear to me,
How the roots shape the tree.
If I found a penance to be paid,
If I found a payment to be made.
There's no real letter to write,
To no real father of mine.
With no real things,
It's hard not to think.
With no real things,
It's hard not to sing.
Father your failures are so grave,
They have seeped to son.
No amount of wishing,
For grace to be regained or won
You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive
Please just let us go insane
We're traveling with spiders legs
With our heads above the waves
The water broke our fall
You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive
You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive
I can't carry on for long
I start to feel the pain again
Now the days all look the same
I'm losing sight and hold of home
You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive
Cause there will come
A day when you'll silence
The crowds
And you and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive
It feels as black as the thoughts I had
When the road was as dark as my fears
Just take comfort in knowing that
All of this ends when I am done
Please just let us go insane
There's nothing to declare but us
You and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive
Cause there will come
A day when you silence
The crowds
Because you and I
Will never make it out of here
Alive

Let the night come
Dim the lights home
Whisky lemon
Let the time go
Way slow
Let the records play low
Like the sun goes way low
Lay me down
Now lay low, oh
Stay low
Stay low
Stay low
Stay low
Stay low
Slow day but I pass the time
Coffee and a half a pack
Said I'm thinking about you and I
Took a while but you hittin' me back
And you know
I get so sick of the telephone
I cry and you cry
And then I thank you
Tell me if your day was rough
And then you let me make it right
King size, passenger size
Let's ride
Stay low
Stay low
Stay low
Stay low
Let the night come
Dim the lights home
Whisky lemon
Let the time go
Way slow
Let the records lay low
Like the sun goes way low
Lay me down, now
Lay low
Stay low
Stay low
Stay low
Stay low
Stay low
Slow day but I pass the time
Coffee and a half a pack
Said I'm thinking about you and I
Took a while but you hittin' me back
And you know
And you know
And you know
Stay low
In some gone story of old 
My pulse is racing 
On boarders towers in flames 
My pulse is racing while 
New winds blow taste like the cold 
Blinded by the sun 
Facing the wall
Look at the skies up 
Through her eyes 
Can't tell what he's thinking of 
And put a pause to her smile 
Hand on flower dropped at 
Burial ground 
Hardened by church and law 
The spell that binds us all 
She's full of it all 
Somewhere, somewhere 
Out of reach of consolation 
Heard the echo of 
Never ending war 
Won't cut the weekend short 
Freedom won't answer your call
Hardened by church and law 
The spell that binds us all 
She's full of it all 
Somewhere, somewhere 
Out of reach of consolation 
Heard the echo of 
Never ending war 
Won't cut the weekend short 
Freedom won't answer your call
I'm writing the words to this song with a poison pen
I'm turning straw into gold and then back again
When you used to be my friend
Before you turned your back on me in the end
I'm building a box made of wood from a tree that I grew
I'm sewing the lining in silk that I spun just for you
And I lay you to rest
I pour flowers on your chest, on your chest
And it's happened again
Pull a fast one on me
And I've got to be dumb
If it's always in fun
I'm digging a hole with my hands six fee in the ground
I'm chiseling this epitaph on a stone that I found
Meet this friend indeed
May he rest in peace and get on with
I'm learning to live with the guilt of remembering
I'm willing to try to forgive and forget this thing
That's gone on too long
You were right, I was wrong, so wrong
And it's happened again
Pull a fast one on me
And I've got to be dumb
If it's always in fun
But enough's enough
Hold my breath while I pass
While I pass you by
And it's happened again
Pull a fast one on me
You can undo what you've done
And it's always in fun
If it happens again
Pull a fast one on me
Then I've got to be dumb
And in more ways in one
And it's always in fun
And in more ways in one
Stranded in a snowstorm in a town that you forgot
I take advantage of a warm car and I reassess my lot
So many years I have given up and now my youth seems shot
I take my place among the truckers and I show 'em what I've got.
I told the stripper at the bar that the shots we got were magic,
'Make a wish and they'll come true'...
As she smiled her golden tooth glinted in the light,
And I wonder what she wished for. I just wished for you.
They say everything is possible... but I know that it's not true.
Especially not when it comes to you
Dreamy colors gold and red, dreamy colors run right through
Oh, Caroline as my witness, I never meant to cause you pain...
And sweet sweet forgiveness; you can go back, but it's never the same.
Oh I don't know who I am and I don't know what I'll be
Feels like I'm strounded in an ocean of grave uncertainty
Wish I could conjure up the shoots and ladders to bring me back
To the place before I ran away and found... I'd lost my track.
Oh that magic curtained canyon where lovers dreams can lie
Is like a drive in movie screen that is pressed against the sky.
All those pictures float there happy just for a little while
Before they're swallowed up in the vastness of... the open night.
Dreamy colors gold and red, dreamy colors run right through
Oh, Caroline as my witness, I never meant to cause you pain...
And sweet sweet forgiveness; you can go back, but it's never the same.
Oh I'll give you all the colors that are left here in my box,
If you would draw a picture into which we could both drop.
And you would be the heron and I would be the fox,
And you would fly above me... Hoorah!
It don't matter to the sun
If you go or if you stay
No, the sun is gonna rise, gonna rise
Shine down on another day
There will be tomorrow
Even if you choose to leave
'Cause it don't matter to the sun no, no
It matters to me
It ain't gonna stop the world
If you walk out that door
This old world just keeps spinning round, spinning round
Like it did the day before
'Cause to them it makes no difference
It just keeps on keeping time
'Cause it ain't gonna stop the world no
But it'll be the end of mine
So what can I say?
What can I do?
I'm still in love.
Why aren't you?
'Cause it don't matter to the moon
If your not in my life
No the moon will just keep hanging round, hanging round
Like its just another night
Who find another place to shine
On some other lovers dreams
'Cause it don't matter to the moon no, no
It matters to me
'Cause it don't matter to the moon no, no
But it matters to me
And I love to tie you up
And you love to let me down
We both try to cover it up
With a sound
You ate my buttercup
You ate my dinner too
I know that ain't a part of the deal
We're through, let me tell ya
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
And I love to share the cost
Butterfly
Reason why i need to fly, hide away
Yeah
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
Before we're thrown back in the wheel
Before we're thrown back in the wheel
Maybe I'll be hard pressed
maybe be we're both simple too
Ain't a region on water
Before we get back in the wheel
Before we get back in the wheel
Before we get back in the wheel
Before we get back in the wheel
Stay for life, for life
All you discover
Stay for life, for life
This moment together
To heal yourself, love can heal
Can't watch you fall
Pain on pain
Don't come back here again
Shame on pain
Took the last breath away
Save yourself, yourself
Lost for a second
Save yourself, yourself
Bury the conscious
And heal yourself, you can heal
Can't watch you fall
Pain on pain
Don't come back here again
Shame on pain
Took the last breath away
Pain on pain
Pain (x4)
Yeah
Wait for love, for love
You know it can happen
Wait for love, for love
The touch of a hand, to heal yourself
You can heal, can't watch you fall
Pain on pain
Don't come back here again
Shame on pain
Took the last breath away
Pain on pain
Remember when we sang
We made echoes off the green house walls
The harmonies we made
Are ghosts a-wandering these halls
Who wants you
Who haunts you
We are surrounded by such history and change
And like the ancients we are spirited away
The ceiling is the sky
The day is night, departed alive
There's water and there's fire
There's trembling and there's desire
Who wants you
Who haunts you
Echoes dancing in my blood to some refrain
(Echoes dancing, how can we refrain)
Shadow take our places here in this ballet
(Shadows take us here in this ballet)
We are surrounded by such history and change
And like the ancients we are spirited away
Crazy people know a special place to go when the pressure's on
Neurons re-align till the feelin' is fine,
Or trouble is gone
They're in the business of inventing saviors
There's always trouble
So tell yourself again that help is on the way
And safety abounds
And safety abounds
When you need some kind of guarantee that you're protected
You start to trust the things that deeper comfort brings,
Before you've checked it
You might be waiting for a long time.
There's always trouble
So tell yourself again that help is on the way
And safety abounds
That safety abounds
That safety abounds
That safety abounds
Among the crumpled tissues white like daisies fell like soldiers dead determined
I surrender
CD cases broken in a desperate chance to find the perfect ballad
To move you
Fight with little purpose
Only meaning to scratch the surface
It's not pretty underneath
There among debris find casual in casualty
It's not pretty underneath
A bottle meant for two a glass that's full of legs but free of any fingerprints
From you
A neighbor one time pounding on the wall now lulled to sleep by lowered voices
Is waking
Fight with little purpose
Only meaning to scratch the surface
It's not pretty underneath
There among debris find casual in casualty
It's not pretty underneath
My eyes are on your hands I'm helpless when I'm looking at you
Be very, very careful not to
Crack the seals of last year's arguments they don't hold a candle to the one
This year
A disagreement used to be a speed bump on a highway going eighty
Fight with little purpose
Only meaning to scratch the surface
It's not pretty underneath
There among debris find casual in casualty
It's not pretty underneath
Fight with little purpose
Only meaning to scratch the surface
It's not pretty underneath
There among debris find casual in casualty
It's not pretty underneath
Who's going the right way down a wrong way street?
Who's making a mistake each time our mouths meet?
You're smart and kind and easy on my eyes.
I know it feels good, that's why we shouldn't tonight.
Who's waiting for answers from a boy who can't speak?
Will be holding their breath until their blue in the cheeks.
You're smart and kind and you're too easy on my eyes.
I know it feels good, so good, we should tonight.
Cause maybe my mom's right,
Good deeds won't save us, just true faith in Jesus.
So in the name of her lord let's do what we shouldn't some more.
Give a little time for the child within you,
Don't be afraid to be young and free.
Undo the locks and throw away the keys
And take off your shoes and socks, and run you.
La, la, la...
Give a little time for the child within you,
Don't be afraid to be young and free.
Undo the locks and throw away the keys
And take off your shoes and socks, and run you.
La, la, la...
Run through the meadow and scare up the milking cows
Run down the beach kicking clouds of sand
Walk a windy weather day, feel your face blow away
Stop and listen: Love you.
Roll like a circus clown, put away your circus frown
Ride on a roller coaster upside down
Waltzing Matilda, Carey loves a kinkatchoo
Joey catch a kangaroo, hug you.
Dandelion, milkweed, silky on a sunny sky
Reach out and hitch a ride and float on by
Balloons down below blooming colors of the rainbow
Red, blue and yellow-green: I love you.
Bicycles, tricycles, ice cream candy
Lollypops, popsicles, licorice sticks
Solomon Grundy, Raggedy Andy
Tweedledum and Tweedledee, home free.
Cowboys and Indians, puppydogs and sandpails
Beachballs and baseballs and basketballs, too.
I love forget-me-nots, fluffernutters, sugarpops
I'll hug you and kiss you and love you
La, la, la... Love you.
I heard that now you're callin'
Left it all behind this mornin'
With those blocks, the ones that you see through
Like all the times before
You made sure that they saw you
But now you're gonna see this through
When you look down
You know you'll see this glory verse
What you found
You'll tend to me as glory verse
This world could get you closer
To what you need the most
You'll find this chemistry could move
These sounds will never leave you
Will be there to receive you
These sounds, they seem to write themselves
When you look down
You know you'll see this glory verse
What you found
You'll tell to me is glory verse
Before you leave from here
Before you leave from here
Here is really just a matter of time
Before it happens, yeah
Darling now 
I'm gonna leave you 
One more time 
I shall deceive you 
The moon is round 
And the wolves are howling 
On hunting ground 
My pack is waiting 
We will never know why 
We were chosen by fate 
To perform all the rites 
That turned love into hate 
I'll see you grin when I pass you by 
I'll hear you curse my name 
I won't lower my eyes 
I won't cover my face 
You can call me a liar 
Try to put me to shame 
No, I have no desire 
To live my life in the shade 
You strut like a lion 
But you're a bird in a cage 
You set the rivers on fire 
But you got burned by the flames 
Forever now 
I'm gonna lose you 
These arms of mine 
Could never soothe you
I saw you sing out your praise 
Come on and lay 
The sunshine of my life's been burned 
And I didn't see the way 
Swallow down your pride 
It's wrong and I'll 
Help you hide 
I feel sincerely you're too much 
You're too much 
All at the same time 
Oh I 
Know much more 
Of what I can 
Than what I can't do 
If I should fail 
I'm gonna nail 
The blame on you 
All my blame on you 
Get it wrong and it makes you sore 
But you're 
Never right 
I see it clearly you're too much 
You're too much 
We're all on the same side 
There must be a time 
Between the well meaning 
When the good will come out 
And start the healing 
You won't know 
How well you've played 
Until you've won 
And if at first you find 
You can't imagine 
How good can heal 
When you've got nothing worth healing 
You won't know 
How well you're made 
Until you're down 
And all you have is gone. 
The good will come out 
The good will come out 
The good will come out
Hold your breath, dear 
This ship is going down 
We're all downhill 
Running with our timebombs 
These shins are cracked and splintered 
These lips are crusted shut 
These squinting eyes just sting me 
These veins are drying me up 
All my limbs 
They're just tools 
We're all stilted vechiles 
These joints rust 
These pores leak 
Time gets selfish 
Time is SPEED 
The sweetest dreams... have murdered me. They murdered me. They murdered me. 
Like the fear of unskilled labor in the nuclear family 
It's the nightmare of digression that engulfs a history 
All my limbs 
They're just tools 
Duplicated, mass produced 
Running down 
Losing speed 
Time escapes us 
Timing's everything. 
Everything. 
Everything... This is the tic in the heart 
Everything... This is the beating of the clock 
Everything... This is an absent blood clot 
Everything... These are the seconds that I've lost 
Everything... This is the slow-rush hour 
Everything's so rushed (This is the slow-rush... hour) 
Everything... This is the slow rush.
Look outside, and all I see
Line by line, a number of signs
Face by face, unwords behind
Focus on unbiased lines
Go ahead each day
Don't cover eyes
Try to stay entwined
And talk your line
(x2)
You're more alive than this
Line by line, and shade by shade
Go ahead each day
Don't cover eyes
Try to stay entwined
And work your line
(x3)
Pure (x8)
[Intro: Evidence] + (Iriscience)
The neighborhood watch (Is jewels and spots)
It's mine and yours (Let's guard the block)
This ain't the cops (It's the neighborhood watch)
It's mine and yours
(Verse 1: Evidence)
When I was young the neighborhood watched
Us get down on a cardboard box in vacant lots
Well down on Venice Beach, you had to jet before dark
The freaks come out at night to spark
Write with my right, bat with my left hand
Hearing of a blind cat, vision of a deaf man
Breath through my eyelids, my flow keeps my teeth white
Half B-boy, half Z-boy, the street lights watch
The neighborhood watch it is jewels and spots
It's mine and yours, Let's guard the block
This ain't the cops, It's the neighborhood watch
It's mine and yours, Let's guard the block
(Verse 2: Iriscience)
Watch your colours and watch your slang
Watch how your fingers twist and change
Alot of cats out here ain't playin'
Alot of cats here still can't bang
Me? I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminding me I should rhyme
And not floss but invest in mine
And hope it never comes to the best in nine
But hey, the neighborhood watch guard the block
Watch for criminals and watch for cops
It ain't gon' stop, it's the neighborhood watch
Watch for criminals and watch for cops
(Hook: scratched by DJ Babu)
Neighborhood watch (x4)
(Evidence)
Protect your own, protect your home
Respect the hustle and set the tone
Entertain but drop gems mostly
Like, don't covet your neighbour but watch him closely
(Iriscience)
Closed circuit, checking the street
Between blessing the beat and stressing to eat
Between my first breath and resting in peace
Between keeping the peace and arresting police
(Evidence)
The eyes have it, once again it's your Peoples
Blacked out your tinted windows, we still see you
The streets is breathing, the streets is watching
The streets start trends and end them - be cautious
(Iriscience)
Black Panthers, Brown Berets
We watched the watchers and found a way
I see it all like a fly on the wall
And that's real gay, so keep your eye on the ball
(Evidence)
The neighborhood watch is jewels and spots
It's mine and yours, let's guard the block
This ain't the cops, It's the neighborhood watch
It's mine and yours, let's guard the block
(Iriscience)
The neighborhood watch, guard the block
Watch for criminals and watch for cops
It ain't gon' stop, it's the neighborhood watch
Watch for criminals and watch for cops
(Outro: Scratched by DJ Babu)
Neighborhood watch (x 7)
I should be knocking on the door of the pearly gates
Why keep a poor man alive in a job he hates
I've heard that good things will come to he who waits
I should be riding on a float in the hit parade
Instead of standing on the curb behind the barricade
Another verse in the doormat serenade
Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top)
Won't you put me on top or change the odds
Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top)
Or at least put some hope in the bottom of the box
Oh, at least put some hope in the box for me
Cause it's only black and white and not a lot of each
There's a remote on the shelf, but it's out of reach
Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top)
Won't you put me on top or change the odds
Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top)
Or at least put some hope in the bottom of the box
Put some hope in the bottom of the box for me
I need it
(Oooh, put me on top)
Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top)
Won't you put me on top or change the odds
Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top)
Or at least put some hope in the bottom of the box
Put me on (oooh, put me on top)
Won't you put me on top again (change the odds)
Or at least put some hope (oooh, put me on top)
Put some home in the bottom of the box
Oh, at least put some hope in the bottom of the box
Please don't take me lightly.
I mean every word.
Whichever way you'd like to place them.
One day I'll be a better writer.
I'll make every face 
That I'll never perfectly phrase.
Ooh... that I'll never perfectly phrase.
You reached for my hand slowly.
I didn't pull away.
We did not have to be lips to face.
My toe hit your toe lightly.
You toe met my heel right back
And I don't think I need much more than that.
Ooh... and I don't think I need much more than that.
You look at me so slyly 
But only when I'm smiling.
Every other time your head looks down.
I sigh and then I frown.
I write this moment down, 
'Cause I cannot paint pictures with my tongue.
Ooh... no I cannot paint pictures with my tongue.
Wide awake
Breath taken
I'm shaken by my sight
Couldn't sleep
Couldn't keep
Quiet secrets on the wind I hear
There's somethin' grand coming
Cool lumming
Through my empty city
On a night breeze so free lovers must collide
And the morning sun must rise
All is forgiven
Cool your heads
Highway men
Come what name in
Who run and fight
Here's your drink
Time to think
Soon you'll wandering away your fears
There's somethin' grand coming
Cool strumming
Through my empty city
Till the morning breaks
And the weary eyes are clear
Let the dreams of sleep take troubles far away from me
There's somethin' grand coming
Cool strumming
Through my empty city
Till the new day breaks
And weary eyes are clear
Dream of sleep take troubles far away from me
All is forgiven
Instrumental
Slow down, you don't need to move
Fall down, you don't have to lose yourself over this
Head up in the clouds
Take in time to shout
Your words' a melody
Just take some time to breathe
Memories take the toll
Never growing old
But you should cut the thread
Remember when I said that
Bridges could burn for you
Wouldn't you like them to?
I've never seen you get so low
Bridges could burn for you
Wouldn't you like them to?
I've never seen you get so low
I've never seen you get so low
Slow down, darling you don't need to fake anymore, no
Come round, you know you can work it out again
The line you walk cause something's got to give
Head up in the clouds
Take in time to shout
Your words' a melody
Just take some time to breathe
Memories take the toll
Never growing old
But you should cut the thread
Remember when I said that
Bridges could burn for you
Wouldn't you like them to?
I've never seen you get so low
Bridges could burn for you
Wouldn't you like them to?
I've never seen you get so low
Bridges could burn for you
Wouldn't you like them to?
I've never seen you get so low
Bridges could burn for you
Wouldn't you like them to?
I've never seen you get so low
I've never seen you get so low
I've never seen you get so low
I've never seen you get so low
(Lowe/Morricone/Tennant)
--------------------------
Yesterday, remember how clear it seemed
In six inch heels, quoting magazines
Go all the way, you knew you could
So far, so good
Someone asked: Who do you think you are?
Who pays your bills? How come you came this far?
Shrugged him off, and locked the door
So good, this far
Now it almost seems impossible
We've drunk too much, and woke up everyone
I may be wrong, I thought we said
It couldn't happen here
I don't expect to talk in terms of sense
Our dignity and injured innocence
It contradicts your battle-scars
Still healed, so far
Now it almost seems incredible
We've laughed too loud, and woke up everyone
I may be wrong, but I thought we said
It couldn't happen here
Now it almost seems impossible
We've found ourselves back where we started from
I may be wrong, I thought we said
It couldn't happen here
I may be wrong, I thought we said
It couldn't happen here
There are bodies strewn all over my bedroom floor.
I don't know how they got there but I'm sure it's the fuckers in their ships.
Taunting everyone who walks by as they sail through my front lawn.
Through my bedroom window,
Not a window at all,
But a hole that peasant left with his cannonball fun.
They look so pretty,
Pretty weak to have let it go on this long.
There are still bodies thrown on my bedroom floor,
I don't know how they got there but I have a plan now.
So they say we aren't really here,
So don't just try to punish us,
You are the one who has lost his mind.
We didn't bring the bodies, we didn't throw them on your floor.
We didn't bring the bodies, we didn't throw them on your floor,
You are the one who has lost his mind.
They look so pretty,
Pretty weak to have let it go on this long.
So they say we aren't really here,
So don't just try to punish us,
You are the one who has lost his mind.
We didn't bring the bodies, we didn't throw them on your floor,
You are the one who has lost his mind.
They look so pretty,
Pretty weak to have let it go on this long.
We'll call it starfire
Who will know
I want a station of my own
I have the tools
I have my rule
I'll load the back and you can drive
Broken bodies all the time
Let's take a ride
Starfire tonight
Ten thousand miles away
Away
Al jorn del judici
Parra qui avra fet servici
Jesu crist rei universal
Home i ver deu eternal
Fel cel vindra per a jutjar
I a cada u lo just dara
Al jorn del judici
Parra qui avra fet servici
Vosaltres tots qui escoltau
Devotament a de'u pregau
De cor ab gran devocio
Que us porte a salvacio
Al jorn del judici
Parra qui avra fet servici
You've changed
That sparkle in your eyes has gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart, you've changed
You've changed
Your kisses are now so blase
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand you've changed
You've forgotten the word I love you
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realise you ever cared
You've changed
You're not the anges I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now, you've changed
You've forgotten the word I love you
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realise you ever cared
You've changed
You're not the anges I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now, you've changed
I miss you
Love Me, Love Me, Love Me, Love Me
Say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
Oh wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me
All things to me
Don't you know
You're life itself!
Like the leaf
Clings to the tree
Oh my darling cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me
All things to me
Don't you know
You're life itself!
Like the leaf
Clings to the tree
Oh my darling cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Instrumental
Lillian lies to avoid awkward questions
Looks to the sky for intervention
But she can't avoid judgemental
Compassion
In the void
She puts on her face, makes it a brave one
Gets herself a seat on an interstate greyhound
When everything's gone at least you've got nothing
That holds on
She curls herself up, rests her head on the window
Sees her face in the trees suspended in limbo
When everything's gone at least you've got nothing
That holds on
You're a stranger in a country town
The kids all stare, the cars slow down
You didn't think you'd be so dumb
To just grab a hold of whatever came along
Houses slip by, the cloud are so low
The sky doesn't cover, it swallows
You used to take me up I watched and learned
How to fly
No navigation system Beyond our eyes
Watching
I always went wrong in the same place
Where the river splits towards the sea
That couldn't possibly be
You and me
Sometimes you sleep while I take us home
That's when I know We really have a home
I never like to land
Getting back up seems impossibly grand
We do it with ease
Danger I never think of danger
I really am a lucky man
Flying this small plane
I like it when I take the controls from you
And when you take the controls from me
I really am a lucky man
Flying this small plane
Eyes scan the path ahead and all around
Power of love is a curious thing
Makes a one man weep, and another man sing
Change a heart to a little white dove
More than a feeling, it's the power of love
It's tougher than diamonds, and it whips like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love will keeps you home at night
Don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
It's the power of love
It's the power of love
First time you feel it - it might make you sad
Next time you feel it - it might make you mad
But you'll be glad when you've found
The power that makes the world go round
Don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
They say that all in love is fair
Yeah but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
The power of love
Don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's tougher than diamonds and it's stronger than steel
You won't feel nothing until you feel...
You feel the power of love
Voice of Regina Spektor: Jenny, um, I don't know if that's you, because that didn't sound like you, but you know, it's a funny world where machines could replace people. Whoever that was, tell Jenny that Regina called her. And P.S. I can't believe what he did
All the evidence points in one direction
Says I don't need you physically around
I've got your voice on tape
I've got your words in me
I don't want anything else
I don't want anyone else
Thing that I had but I dropped
All that I had but I dropped
I want you back and forth
I want you up and down
I want you inside out
Regina Spektor: I was hoping you could keep me company for the ride home, but it's okay if you're sleeping
I've got your voice on tape
I've got your words in me
I don't want anything else
I don't want anyone else
And you say that I don't have this down
I've been practicing out loud
Other Voice: [garbled] I just wanted to call to say hi, and um, I think I might bring Marissa and Tracy up to Topeka [garbled]
I want you back and forth
I want you up and down
I want you back and forth
(I've got your voice on tape)
I want you up and down
(I've got your words in me)
I want you back and forth
(Thing that I had but I dropped)
I don't want anyone
I don't need anyone else
(All that I had but I dropped)
I've got your voice on tape
I've got your words in me

All the evidence points in one direction
Says I don't need you physically around
Feelings come and go - I've never known
Something longs to grow - won't let go
Spirits 'round my head - are whispering
I turn inside instead - of wondering
Deep inside of me - I know there's got to be
A different kind of truth - that sets the spirit free
If I don't wanna know - what's written inside me
How could I see anything - how could I be anything?
Restless minds have searched - long before
The truth will be the same - for evermore
The mightiness of trees - that you can feel
Can give you all you need - just listen still
Here is love and there is pain
It's all around, it's all the same
There's nothing new that I could tell to you
But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts
We might not know the meaning yet, but I'm sure we can't reject
The truth that is in everything - that is and has been and will be
There is a long way to go - there is a high place to know
There is a world to go through - but there's so much more to do
Until we're home!
Deep inside of me - I know there's got to be
A different kind of truth - that sets the spirit free
If I don't wanna know - what's written inside me
How could I see anything - how could I be anything?
Feelings come and go - I've never known
Try to get the colours right
And I'll paint you face she said
'Cause life is on the outside babe
And you got to try and get it right
Buy a ten-dollar camera
Take a picture of everyone
'Cause people change
Yeah they change
Changing everyday
And I don't want to be the one that you don't recognise
I don't want to be the one that's left behind
Got a broken car yeah got a selfish heart
Running down the road
With a jukebox in my head
Funny how I got to here
I don't remember how
I just want to live somewhere where the air is sweet and clear
And I don't want to be the one that you don't recognise
I don't want to be the one that's left behind
Haven't felt me feel real in a long time
Why won't you touch me?
Everything is yours, nothing's mine
You don't owe me
Anything
Make mistakes like we know how
We're learning slowly
Still the same? I beg to differ
You hardly know me
All the things you say get back at you
Today I woke up hurting
Did I ever sleep?
Wake me up before California
Darling boy, I always adore ya
If this is what you want, then I'll leave
Baby
Maybe
Haven't felt so well for so well now
You can't slow me
Make mistakes like only I know how
I don't even know me
Anymore
All the things I say
Give 'em back to me
Today I woke up hurting
Did I ever sleep?
Wake me up before California
Darling boy I've never known ya
If this is what you need, then I'll leave
Baby
Baby
I'm sorry
Baby
All the things I say
I'll give 'em back to you
Always wake up hurting
Did I ever sleep?
Wake me up in time for California
And I'm the one to forget all about you
And then I'll leave
She's been dancing in a topless bar
And she's doing well so far
She is working to earn her own dollar
'Cause the fortune teller didn't talk about stars
She has black and white eyes
A mind full of vintage skies
She has black and white eyes
A mind full of cheering lies
She needs something
To keep her feet on the ground
'Cause when she's flying around
She never wants to come back down
She lost her smile in '95
When she woke up on the back seat of a studded car
'Think I lost her at 24
When she started to lock herself up behind the bathroom door
All along the white line
She can travel back in time
All along the white line
(X2)
I'm on my way looking up today
Never mind if it could be worthing
Tuesday flies away
Above the bar the TVs are showing the game
But we're not watching it, we're hardly focussing
Through the windows in the fading day
1st Avenue is turning grey
Do you ever look at me and see another man
Let's get two more beers and try to make a plan
Sometimes it feels as though I have a key
But every time I try it it won't turn for me
Seattle - you've got to love the rain
And we both love rain
We both love rain
We watched the city skyline from the ferry deck
And you put your arms around my neck
We talked of looking just out of town
Now it's looking like a dream shot down
I still believe that there's somewhere for us
But now it's something that we don't discuss
And you're the best thing I ever knew
Stay with me, baby, and we'll make it to
We'll make it to
Seattle - you've got to love the rain
And we both love rain
We both love rain
Seattle - I want you just the same
And we both love rain
We both love rain
I awoke Iapetus
Sing for a while
All the roads reach out to you
Stay for a while
Now I breathe on
Save the work for the afternoon
It's true,
I'll be there for the baby.
I am.
Now I have lost the appetite
Staying for a lie
All the roads that once were right
Stay the way,
They are.
Save the work till the afternoon
It's true...
I'll be there for the baby.
It's true...
It's you.
I'll always side with you.
Till I fall.
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
I awoke Iapetus
Saying you're alive
All the roads lead after you
Saying you're alive
Now I breathe on.
Save the work till the afternoon
It's true...
I'll be there for the baby.
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Eyes forward
Why aren't you kind to me?
You could so easily
Take me in your arms and see
A donkey, a beast for thee
If you had half a mind
Leave worldly things behind
Devote to being kind
You to me, a beast for thee
Love in some way you choose
God's plan can easy bruise
One bone and blood mass we fuse
And I can be a beast for thee
I will toil for years and years
Give you muscle, tone and tears
Overcome and flay all fears
Leaving me a beast for thee
And at home on Wednesday morn
Astride my horny horn
You'll be in glory born
And I will be a beast for thee
Happily a beast for thee
Quietly a beast for thee
Endlessly a beast for thee
Do you even know what goes on in a heart anymore?
Constellations turned into little polaroids in a cardboard box
And I wanted so desperately to prove
You were still breathing
But you wouldn't move
Okay
Okay 
What a thing to choose
This one's gonna bruise
You'll learn one day, won't you?
What you want's bad for the souls
Lost out in the rain
Afraid of the dark 
Still in pain
Still in pain
Did you even notice how the wind 
Didn't change that much?
Fluctuations on these sheets 
That you moved to be sure it was us
And I wanted so desperately to say
That you could trust me, but I was lying anyway
Okay
Okay
What a thing to lose
Left out in the rain
Misused
You'll learn one day, won't you?
You'll learn some day, won't you?
What you had 
Was good for a while 
Then it changed
Got too intense
And that is strange
And I feel bad for you 
I feel bad for you
And I don't know why
I don't know why
'Cause I'm as dead as you
When Joseph was an old man, an old man was he
He courted Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
He courted Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
When Joseph and Mary were walking one day
Here is apples and cherries so fair to behold
Here is apples and cherries so fair to behold
Then Mary spoke to Joseph so meek and so mild
"Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child"
"Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child"
Then Joseph flew in anger, in anger he flew
"Oh, let the father of the baby gather cherries for you"
"Oh, let the father of the baby gather cherries for you"
So the cherry tree bowed low down, low down to the ground
And Mary gathered cherries while Joseph stood down
And Mary gathered cherries while Joseph stood down
Then Joseph took Mary all on his right knee
Crying, "Lord, have mercy for what I have done"
Crying, "Lord, have mercy for what I have done"
When Joseph was an old man, an old man was he
He courted Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
He courted Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
Por que voce nao disse que viria?
Logo agora que eu tinha
Me curado das feridas
Que voce abriu quando se foi
Por que chegou sem avisar?
Eu queria tempo pra me preparar
Com a roupa limpa, a casa em ordem
E um sorriso falso pra enganar
Eu nao entendo a sua volta
Eu nao entendo a sua indecisao
Num dia sou o seu grande amor
No outro dia nao, nao, nao
Por que a surpresa da sua volta?
Justo quando eu tento vida nova
Voce vem pra perguntar
Se tudo que eu sentia acabou
Voce ate parece um vicio
Que largar e quase impossivel
Exige muito sacrificio
E quando eu me considerava limpo
Vem voce pra me oferecer mais
Vem voce pra me oferecer mais,mais, mais!
Eu nao entendo a sua volta
Eu nao entendo a sua indecisao
Num dia sou o seu grande amor
No outro dia nao
Well a train blows a whistle before it pulls away,
But no word or warning do you say.
One minute right beside me, another you're a thousand miles away.
Well I felt such a shaking and I heard such a whirr
And I swore we were moving fast enough to blur.
Then I opened up my eyes and found that we're right back where we were.
Baby you're no train, you're the track.
Always running away, always running back.
Baby you're no train, you're the steam blowing by.
How I longed for the journey, and those far distant lands,
I believed all your promises and plans.
Now I'm standing at the station with a lonely ticket in my hand.
Baby you're no train, you're the track.
Always running away and running back.
Baby you're no train, you're the silence behind.
So roll on.
Bless the beasts and the children
For in this world they have no voice
They have no choice
Bless the beasts and the children
For the world can never be
The world they see
Light their way
When the darkness surrounds them
Give them love
Let it shine all around them
Bless the beasts and the children
Give them shelter from the storm
Keep them safe, keep them warm
Light their way
When the darkness surrounds them
Give them love
Let it shine all around them
Bless the beasts and the children
Give them shelter from the storm
Keep them safe, keep them warm
The children
The children
The children
In the nursery
Where ocean meets the shore
In the place where we could meet
You will be all alone
So as we angle to the new
Tow on a thawing frontier
Never a woman on the shore
A witness or a love
I looked out for you
But looking never meant less
I could feel that you were gone
And I despondent turned and left
I reached out for you
But reaching never meant less
I could feel that you were gone
And I despondent turned and left
We looked out across the long horizon
We looked in each other's eyes 
And realized that we are only one
Through a moment we could glimpse an infinity
And through an infinity we could see
All in all is all we are

I wanna go home
Home to the home where we all sleep alone
I wanna be the first on the last

Somebody told me that Delta's brownskinned, AKAs' lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougious, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hypeman"
She let a nigga hit it, and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightnin'; but

The night fallin' over Brooklyn, where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drugdealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouth of babes
One for it, one for out the grave
Niggaz want they reperations, How you calculate the amount to be paid
You try to imagine America without the slaves (the slaves)
(Q-Tip)
Her tenament yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold bouillon 'cause she wouldn't protest it
Cause, her bestfriend's man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a glock
In the hood is a everday happenin'
A friend of the priest say she chewed out the captain
She yelled out "Why you do this to black men?"
(Common)
I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days
Whether climb or rhyme, I heard of rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
Music, rhymin' good like escalates
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggaz wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinkin' big like Little Wayne in the (?)
(Rhymefest)
C'mon; Tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
Partiot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnny Cochran dead, who gonna get us free now?
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now?
Who gon' make it better for the thugs and Ps now?
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile?
Oh, it's good music, yeah dog I see now
A bird you would've liked brought the sky down,
But it was useless to see it without you around.
And in the unstoppable camera of my mind's eye,
I saw you and some foreign guy.
And I could hear you voice ringing.
And I could hear you singing.
From all the way across the country in palm springs,
I can hear you now.
Your laughter tore through the new jersey night,
And I can't stand it, but I'm all right.
Stood out on the balcony and I took a look around
And a bird you would've loved the sight of
Brought the sky down.
And I can hear you voice ringing.
And I can hear you singing.
From all the way across the country in palm springs,
I can hear you now.
Stone go slow
Find the right moment to stop the show
The nighttime gets weary of implecations afterglow
Thinking: "Easy come, easy go"
You got here too late, it's often so
I guess that's why
I hope I get old before I die
Admit it turned out okay for someone who didn't try
Thinking it's time to get a hold
You got here too late, it's always so
It's always so, so
It's always so, so
It's always so, so
Go down the backroads 
Don't take it too slow 
You don't have the time for a long flirtation 
You don't have the time for the least hesitation 
Roses all are blooming 
Lilacs all aglow 
Honeysuckle vine shine shine 
Oh get out, get out of your house 
Springtime, springtime can kill you 
Just like it did poor me 
Don't you see we're all hurt the same way 
So get out, get out of your house 
High on the moonshine bodies entwine 
Don't you see it's better this way 
Don't you see it's better this way 
You can't be too shy 
You know the reason why 
If you don't go get what you need 
Something's going to break on the inside 
Springtime, springtime can kill you 
Just like it did poor me 
Don't you see we're all hurt the same way 
So get out, get out of your house
Por mais que eu pense
Que eu sinta, que eu fale
Tem sempre alguma coisa por dizer
Por mais que o mundo de voltas
Em torno do sol, vem a lua me
Enlouquecer
A noite passada
Voce veio me ver
A noite passada
Eu sonhei com voce
O lua de cosmo
No ceu estampada
Permita que eu possa adormecer
Can we walk in hope
Into another new year
Just to cast away the ghosts
Or to have the time again
You said "hold on to dreams", yeah
But I know you don't try
Because you're innocent, I know
That you won't survive
I heard the phone ring
So late at night that I
I thought someone had died
Someone had died
But your voice was full of hope
Like it was on better days
On clear mornings
When the rain had left the sky
I can't stand the thought of you alone
(I can't stand the thought of you alone)
I can't stand the thought of you alone
(I can't stand the thought of you alone)
Don't try to get close to
Us because there's nothing
But our souls lay bare
Will we survive?
I know we will
I've been there - believe me
Crimes committed are unintentional
After the party we all went home alone
All the industry boys were still laughing and drinking
When I tumbled out of the place
And up on the wall
The princess of Hollywood way
The wilton house is empty
Autumn came again and everyone scattered
Maybe it's better
If we don't have that last place to go
Well you said that you'd call
When you got your new number
I guess you've gone under again
There's room at the bar
For the princess of Hollywood way
Wine and forgiveness were all that we had
Wine and forgiveness are all that I need
"Go to bed" she said, "I can't stand you -
And that's the only thing that we have in common
If I had a nickel for every bridge that you've burned ...
You're just a single malt swamp clown preparing for splashdown
The accidents know you by name"
Afterall, I'm the princess of Hollywood
Afterall, I'm the princess of Hollywood
Afterall, I'm the princess of Hollywood way
The 1st time I saw you
I did try hard to burn my eyes
Life was but a sad dream
I was but a sad breath
But you were something like sand
When sunlight hits the sea
The 2nd time I saw you
I was about to take the road
I asked would you wait for me
You said life ain't a highway
Better if we'd been born
As siamese songbirds
The 3rd time I saw you
We went to the zoo
All steady hot beers, sorrowful monkeys
Big eyes laughing
Wish I had not held hands
The 4th time I saw you
It was like I was gonna die
I was waiting outside
You just had a new guy
Asked me why, I, I
Son, won't you come along?
We have no time for another song
Won't you sing along?
We have no sea, child
The 5th time I saw you
He was traveling abroad
And your eyes, they were not here
You just made new friends
While I tried to stop with cigarrettes
The 6th time I saw you
I was properly insane
For the whisky I had drunk
The drugs I'd taken
Gimme just one chance you will realise
The 7th time I saw you
You were married again
If I had just once kissed you
Things wouldn't be the same
Surely the sky'd be different
The 8th time I saw you
I was strummin' the guitar
& your ears were not for me
My ears were a-bleeding
The waiter was blind
Please someone blind my eyes
The last time I saw you
It was about six a.m.
You approached me in a strange car
Finally kissed me
Then did wave goodbye
Before you disappear
Sometimes I ache, babe
Or I ain't hard enough to stand
But the days they just drown me
Coming back from work
Having sour breakfast
Seasick from your chest
This is a story of a boy named Ted 
If his mother said Ted be good, he would 
She told him Ted about his soldier dad 
But it made her sad and she cry, oh my 
Ted used to tell her 
He could be twice as good 
And he new he could 
Cause in his head he said 
Mommy don't worry now Teddy boy's here 
Taking good care of you 
Mommy don't worry Teddy boy's here 
Teddy's gonna see you through 
Then came the day she found herself a man 
Teddy turned and ran 
Far away 
Ok 
He couldn't stand to see his mother in love 
With another man 
He didn't know 
Oh no 
He found a place where he could settle down 
And from time to time 
In his head, he said 
Mommy don't worry now Teddy boy's here 
Taking good care of you 
Mommy don't worry now Teddy boy's here 
Teddy's gonna see you through 
She said teddy don't worry now mommy is here 
Taking good care of you 
Teddy don't worry your mummy is here 
Mummy's gonna see you through 
This is a story of a boy named Ted 
If his mother said Ted be good, he would

Tourists wear their wallets in high places when abroad
So as not to be ripped off in ways to which they're not apprised
Lawyers write some goofy terms in letters to the future
So as not to get all screwed by methods here and after devised
So will I
And I guess I will protect myself from you
Sometimes I get so tickled I can't talk
And I will protect myself from you
I'll keep on reminding me
I'm always free to walk
You're not exactly what I'm looking for
You don't even know that when I've got it straight, now keep it in mind
No you're not what I was looking for
I just need a little more of what you've got a little bit
Don't make me laugh
And I guess I will protect myself from you
Sometimes I get so tickled I just can't talk
But I will protect myself from you
I'll keep on reminding me
I'm always free to walk
Always free
Free
To
Walk
(Hey)
Whatever happens between you and me today probably will be OK
But won't bother me
Anyway
And I guess I will protect myself from you
Sometimes I get so tickled I can't talk
But I will protect myself from you
And I'll keep on reminding me
I'm always free
To walk
Free
F-R-E-E
You can't, you can't hurt me causes I don't care about you
I don't give a shit
I don't give a shit
About you
Whoa
The pussy - ass
Sounds of white - people
Playing jazz
Shallow it seems but I need you here
From me to you, I know I can't feel a thing
Oh, sing me to sleep
I won't fight it when you leave
Oh, I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here, oh.
Desperate it seems but I can't breathe
Are you real?
Are you real?
I can't feel a thing
And this machine won't stop
Be here when I wake
Sing me to sleep
I won't fight it when you leave
Sing me to sleep
I won't fight it
Oh, I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here, oh.

You sure you want to be with me, I've nothing to give
Won't lie and say this lovin's best
Leave us in emotional peace, take a walk, taste the rest
Now take a rest
I see you digging a hole in your neighbourhood
You're crazy, but you're lazy
No need to live in a lean to your troubles must be seen to
See through money like it's paper with faces I remember
I drink on a daily basis though it's seldom, cools my temper
It never cools my temper
Walking through the suburbs, though not exactly lovers
You're a couple, especially when your body's doubled
Duplicate, and then you wait for the next Kuwait

Now take a walk, take a rest, taste the rest
You sure you want to be with me, I've nothing to give
Now take a walk, take a rest, taste the rest
Don't wanna be on top of your list, monopoly and properly kissed
We overcome in sixty seconds with the strength we have to together
But for now, emotional ties, they stay severed
When there's trust there'll be treats
And when we funk, we'll hear beats

Karmacoma, Jamaica and Roma

Deflowering my baby, are you my baby mate?
I must be crazy, see I'm swazy
You're digging a hole in your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy, must be lazy
Don't wanna be on top of your list, monopoly and properly kissed
Deflowering my baby, are you my baby mate, my baby
Delowering my baby, are you my baby mate?
I must be crazy, you must be lazy

Remember last Christmas Eve
When we sat next to our first tree
Ornaments reflected light
Of a candle in the night
And I gave you a music box
Back then that seemed like so much
We watched it go round and round
As the melodies unwound
But all these things are now long gone
And not to be wished upon again
But the musical box continues to turn
The candle in the window continues to burn
But I know they're just memories
Like Christmas past and you and me
Remember that old fireplace
That held the room in warm embrace
And as we watched for Christmas ghosts
The fire held the shadows close
But now upon that Christmas scene
The candle wax of melted dreams
And ornaments of shattered glass
Now belonging to the past
But all these things are now long gone
And not to be wished upon again
But the musical box continues to turn
The candle in the window continues to burn
But I know they're just memories
Like Christmas past and you and me
Crawling then walking
Then running and sweating
Forgetting
Lying and cheating
Aiding and abetting
Forgetting
Itching and scratching
Punching and hitting
Forgetting, Forgetting, Forgetting
Forgetting
Reminding rewinding
Removing regretting
Forgetting
Your smiles at the wake and
Your tears at the wedding
Forgetting, Forgetting, Forgetting
Forgetting
Forgetting, Forgetting, Forgetting
Forgetting
Spellbound and hellbound
And caught in the netting
Forgetting
A wiping it clean
A minute Armageddon
Forgetting, Forgetting, Forgetting
Forgetting
Forgetting, Forgetting, Forgetting
Forgetting
Forgetting, Forgetting, Forgetting
Forgetting
Wars and Famine, plagues and pestillence
There is an answer to be found
If all that's meant to be was meant to be
I know the world is upside down
I know the world is upside down, I know the world is upside down
A desert rose cascading waterfalls
The sands of time will blow my mind
The real wealth to hold is with your health
You were beside me all around
I know the world is upside down, I know the world is upside down
Seven percent own eighty four percent of all the wealth on earth
Oil is the spice to make a man, forget man's wealth
Right here on earth upon this turf, earth is spinning round
I know the world is upside down is upside down
Instrumental
Her moon
See them shine
Consoling my mind
Sit and whine

Hit my head, hug my heart (x2)
Did you know?
Did you?
Hit my head, hug my heart (x2)
Did you know?
Hit my head, hug my heart (x2)
Did you know?
Did you?
Hit my head, hug my heart (x2)
Did you know?
Did you?
Time stands too still
Left you there for the kill
But this hope that sorrow bleeds
Leaves a man with nothing
There's just no mercy in your eyes
There ain't no time to set things right
And I'm afraid I've lost the fight
I'm just a painful reminder
Another day you leave behind
Love grows a fear
Suites your taste of bitter ends
But this stake that holds you in
Leaves no place to begin
There's just no mercy in your eyes
There ain't no time for selling lies
And I'm afraid I've lost the fight
I'm just a painful reminder
Another day you leave behind
Words seem so blind
I've been pushed far aside
To my choice seems too small
Any move and I could fall
There's just no mercy in your eyes, child
There ain't no time to set things right
And I'm not preaching to the choir
I'm just a painful reminder
And you're a fool to satisfy
If what you believe in, is so sacred
That you can not love me anymore
Then I'm sorry, that your wisdom
Won't prepare you for what's in store
Because this bubble, that you call home
Will when the winds of change pick-up
Burst with a vengeance, and a fury
And disarray your every stone
You've got to tolerate
And not just annihilate
Facts of life and facts of fate
And I say this not from hate;
That your hour now is late
So shape up for you own sake!
That your hour now is late
So shape up for you own sake!
You own sake!
Your ideals, I find amusing
And on most I can agree
In fact we are closer to each other
But eye to eye we can not see
And I'm not perfect, I admit it
I can admit to being wrong
But as a friend, not as a brother
To you I dedicate this song
You've got to tolerate
And not just annihilate
Facts of life and facts of fate
I say this not from hate;
That your hour now is late
So shape up for your own sake!
That your hour now is late
So shape up for your own sake!
Your own sake!

Seven moons for seven seas
Won't let them get the better of me
They'll pass me by
Don't pass me by
My seven fears all fear of me
They'll take their leave eventually
Well they can try
They can try
My love was strong
For now it's gone
Eleven stories up
From the second floor
A love not warm
Is a love not done
Darling you let me know
Talk down the girl
Talk down the girl
So little knowledge known to me
So little colour left to see
But black and white
Black and white
A silhouette at seventeen
If they can find what's left of me
For the fire
Burn in the fire
My love was strong
For now it's gone
Eleven stories up
From the second floor
A love not warm
Is a love not done
Talk down the girl
Talk down the girl
There's little more for us to say
You've made your mind up anyway
Another world
Another world
I hate to leave you here this way
But I can't think where you should stay
I miss my girl
I miss my girl
My love was strong
For now it's gone
Eleven stories on
From the second floor
A love not warm
Is a love not done
Darling you let me know
Talk down the girl
Talk down the girl
Utsukushiki mononi tuite katarimasho

We're simple minds
Still we want it all
And things go fast
Make us miss the most
Of what life can bring to us
Of what life can mean to us
She left a scar
She was too well read
And I was the one who was so impressed
I never dared to speak from my heart
Seasons change
And I'm still the same
I never can tell what's inside me
And heaven knows it isn't that much
We'll travel far
Just to feel at all
When we're home
And we're on our own
We can't look after ourselves
Or anyone else
She left a scar
She was too well read
And I was the one who was so impressed
I never dared to speak from my heart
Seasons change
And I'm still the same
I never can tell what's inside me
And heaven knows it isn't that much
You still float
Slowly
Over us
You still land
Heavily
With us
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
La (x3)
So come closer
I'm still waiting
Can you explain us
And leave us standing (x2)
Behind the waterfall, that's where your lost loves have all gone.
They're bored and waiting for you, so put on your shoes and
Go, don't stay, you know, you know that it will be all right.
Just leave it all behind, 'cause it will be all right
In those abandoned towns, that's where your lost lives can be found.
All things you wished you had done, so put on your shoes and
Go, don't stay, you know, you know that it will be all right.
Just leave it all behind, 'cause it will be all right
Behind the waterfall, no one can name that thing they saw.
You know it's waiting for you, so put on your shoes and
Go, don't stay, you know, you know that it will be all right.
Just leave it all behind, 'cause it will be all right
I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love
Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh, is it any wonder?
I'm in the mood for love
Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
Let's put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud above
If it should rain, we'll let it
But for tonight forget it
I'm in the mood for love
Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
Let's put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud above
If it should rain, we'll let it
But, for tonight, forget it
I'm in the mood for love
Time is short now
We'll be here
Nowhere left to go
And if you'd miss me when I'm gone
Go when I go
Then maybe we can stay together
Hopes and dreams they won't last long now
We keep it all inside
Answers come when we don't want to hear
Time is short now
Quiet down
Everything is still
If you stay here close to home
Deeper we'll fall
And maybe we can stay together
I had a dream that we were robbed
They took the moldings off the walls
Erased our signatures from things
I heard them singing
Where's my bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
Where's my bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
Be my bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
And guard me
They stole the subjects from your paintings
But left the canvas on the frame
They went off with years of clothing
Stole your smell, stole your stain
Just like rain
Washed clean
Of your name
And our bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
Let down your bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
Where's my bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
To guard me
'Cause I saw a man
I saw a man (x17)
Where's my bodyguard
Please guard me (guard me) (x3)
Take, take, take, take my arms
Gone from the heart
Break, break my legs
There's nothing to stand on
Take, take, take my bones
There's nothing to fill me in
Just singing
Where you been
Bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
Where's my bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
Be my bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
And guard me
What, uh, yo
Just when things seemed the same, and the whole scene is lame
I come and reign with the unexplained for the brains till things change
They strain to slang sling, I'm trained to bring game
History that I arranged been regained by King James
Go to practice, with tactics, when the track hits, theatrics
Women that look like actress the status of Cleopatra's
Stacks of mathematics took the ?ego-a-geatics?
As I find out, what the facts is, for geographic
No time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is
I rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese, with soldiers
While you hit trees and coast I spit flows that be ferocious
And with these explosives, I split seas for Moses
Shine permanently only my mind's concernin me
Fire burns in me eternally time's eternity
Followers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary
Determinely advance technology better than Germany
Since the first days you know of, till the last days is over
I was always the flow-er, I made waves for Noah
From a compound, to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom
Some of my rap patterns, still surround Saturn
From the ancient Hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures
I study I know the scriptures but nowaday ain't it vicious
Date back I go beyond check the holy Qu'ran
To speeches at the altar on, now we get our party on
So being benificent, I bless 'em with dialogue
They expectin, the next testament by the God
I blow 'em through battlezones with chrome for chaperone
Blast beats with saxophones one of the baddest rapper's known
Every country city and borough, sidestreet and ghetto
Isle and alley and meadow theories ferile enough to echo
When it was one mass of land, with one nash' of man
And the whole mass was ran under one master plan
Since the world's metamorphis, and the plan is kept in orbit
Turntables we spin off but the needles never skip off it
Rhythms we expressin similar to our ancestors
It'll answer your questions if you understand the message
From the days of the slave choppers?, to the new age of prophets
As heavy as hip-hop is I'm always ready to drop it
From the mind which is one of Allah's best designs
And mines'll stand the test of time, when I rhyme
The 18th Letter, the prophesy professor
I stay clever, long as the planet stay together
Bring up praise from Mecca, make a phrase for the better
In new days to remember, always and forever
(Repeat 2X)
The R baby
I can't say if this feeling coming over me is real
But I know it's something you can't steal
So I'll buy another problem to approach
Sell a virgin lie that can't be touched
So I'll fall again
So I'll fall again
So I'll break through this rotten piece of wood again
I can't say if this fucking subject should be dropped
But I know it's something you can't stop
So I'll buy another pick-up line and sigh
And pretend that everything is all right
So I'll fall again
So I'll fall again
So I'll break through this rotten piece of wood again
So I'll break through this rotten piece of wood
So I'll break through this rotten piece of wood
So I'll break through this rotten piece of wood again
So I'll fall again
So I'll fall again
So I'll break through this rotten piece of wood again
You can stand at a show all night
Somewhere in the back just watching the bands
You can try to pretend nothing's wrong
And clap for the songs
Or drive all night for no reason
Just drive 'til the tape's done
And leave everything to the long, long road
To take you home
Or talk on the phone all night
And tell the whole story to an answering machine
Or put everything on a song
Just put everything on some song on the radio
At least a song won't cheat
At least a song won't leave
Just think of this and me
As just a few of the many things
To lie around
To clutter up your shelves
And I wish you weren't worth the wait
Because there's some thing's
I'd like to say to you...
And I don't think that
You know what
You've been missing
'Cause I don't think that
You know what
You've been missing
And I dare you to forget
The marks you left
Across my neck
From those nights when we were both
Found at our best
Now I could make this obvious,
And you, you could deny me
All in one breath
You could shrug me off
Your shoulders...
And I don't think that
You know what
You've been missing
'Cause I don't think that
You know what
You've been missing
And I don't think that you know
I said I don't think you know
I said I don't think you know what your missing
Hey, lush, have fun
It's the weekend
Hey, lush, have fun
Hey, lush, have fun
It's the weekend
Hey, lush, have fun
I don't think that
You know what
You've been missing
I don't think that
You know what
You've been missing
Just forget me
It's that simple
Just forget me
It's that simple
(Nothing's all right... without you, without you...)
Hey lush have fun
It's the weekend
Hey lush have fun
(We'll have to, we'll have to, I want to)
(We had to, we had to, I meant to)
Hey lush have fun
It's the weekend
Hey lush have fun (haven't you had enough?)
It's all I know
You're all I know
Don't bring that stuff to bed
I've gotta fall with a clear head
Don't tell me of those mirrors
I'll show you what you want to see
Pay no mind to those voices
I'll show you what you want to hear
Of course, it doesn't matter what you see
You're beautiful to me
It doesn't matter what they say
I want you anyway
So we live in the city come over here
No, leave on the light
Beautiful things get run down
There's no more to say to let you know it's alright
There's a fine door that you open
There's no door
There's no option
You knew this from the start
You made a fist around your heart
I don't need to know
But she must want to show me
It's just for yourself
I can't forgive you anything
It doesn't matter what you see
You're beautiful to me
It doesn't matter what they say
I want you anyway
Don't bring that stuff to bed I'll touch you here
Gotta fall with a clear head does it make you cry? 
Don't bring that stuff to bed don't hide those tears
Gotta fall with a clear head you know they're alright
all in all attendant memories
Crowd the day with unrelated histories
Each year leaves its unresolving fantasies
To hang around each corner
Hang around each street
Thick with ghosts, the wind whips round in circuitries
Carrying words as strangers exchange pleasantries
Do they intrude upon your private reveries?
As they meet you on every corner
Meet you in each street
Watch for daily braveries
Notice new found courtesies
Finger sudden legacies
As they clean up every corner
Wash down every street
Mark the month and all its anniversaries
Put away the drafts of all your eulogies
Clear the way for all your private memories
As they meet you on each corner
Meet you in each street
Make the time for all your possibilities
Live on every street
Slowly I stretch out my arms freely
Shadows of night disappear
Rise from the slough of despond, find the pathway
Guiding us forward through pastures of dream day
Days to enjoy, peace I knew once before me
Dawning to dusk on the hills until morning
Come see me take my hand
Come see me in my land
Flying invisibly high, watch me
All on a beautiful sky, I'll be
Clear and serene in the love I've discovered
Long search is over, the soul is uncovered
Resting on joy that abounds without ceasing
Bidding farewell to the fears now decreasing
Come see me take my hand
Come see me in my land
High on a golden crested wave she sits
The little nymphs dance in her hair
The trees all beckon to the sky to bless their empty lives
Horizons come to sip wine there
The veiled mist reveals the wandering ship upon the reef
The albatross flies to the stern
But only Jack Frost saw the kiss you gave him in return
Crossing the mountains of truth, see them
Soaring majestically high and then
Stop at the warning light, see it flash brightly
Thunder awakes me, the crashes beside me
Shatters the scene and brings chaos to beauty
Leading us forward where destiny may be
Come see me take my hand
View from another land
Come see me take my hand
View from another land
Come see me take my hand
View from another land
Come see me take my hand
Vielen Dank fur die wei��en Lilien und das gute Buch
Das ich nicht wage zu lesen
Du wei��t doch, dass ich es versuche
Das ist kein Ratsel
Das ist, was wir kennen
Sein Versagen nicht langer Uberzeugung zu nennen
Und die Zeit versucht zu trosten
Und die Liebe versucht zu bewahren
dass man wei��, dass man druber hinweg kommt
Wie man fruher einmal war
Schau ein einziges Mal nach oben
Schau ein einziges Mal nach vorn
Du wirst Dinge sehen, von denen du dachtest
Sie seien noch nicht geboren
Du wirst Tage verbringen, an denen Zahne nicht knirschen
Deine Scheine ausreichen
Deine Schulden zu begleichen
Deine Augen nicht feucht sind
Du bekommst was du brauchtest
Es wird passieren
Ich hoffe du wei��t es
Und die Zeit versucht zu trosten
Und die Liebe versucht zu bewahren
Dass man wei��, dass man druber hinweg kommt
Wie man fruher einmal war
Hinter all diesen Fenstern sitzen Menschen
Du hast es immer geahnt
Dass sie es wert sind zu bleiben
Du bist den ganzen Weg gerannt
Hinter all diesen Fenstern sitzen Menschen
Du hast es immer geahnt
Dass sie es wert sind zu bleiben
Du bist den ganzen Weg gerannt
Zeit versucht zu trosten
Und die Liebe versucht zu bewahren
Dass man wei��, dass man druber hinweg kommt
Wie man fruher einmal war
Und die Zeit versucht zu trosten
Und die Liebe versucht zu bewahren
Dass man wei��, dass man druber hinweg kommt
Wie man fruher einmal war
Wie man fruher einmal war
Wie man fruher einmal war
Wie man fruher einmal war
Trying to keep time
Closer than we like
Memories still lie
Tonight
Faces of the day
Pressed up to your spine
Blessings still to come
Tonight
Tonight
Precious things unsaid
As the night begins
Who will hang his head
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile
Through all fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find the sun comes shinin' through for you, ooh-hooh
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
'Cause that's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you, you just smile
Oh-ooh, ooh-hooh,
Although a tear is ever so near
'Cause that's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of you crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you, my darling, just, just smile
Smile, darling, baby,
Smile!
Magnolia, Magnolia,
I guess I never told you
You're smiling
I've been steady pulling for you
To make amends
With all the friends who told you
That selling out was wrong
Roberta, Roberta,
I didn't mean to hurt you
You're easy
If need be I'll send someone a-searching
Nevermind your heart
Nevermind your soul
You're a rainbow
The spaceman, spaceman
Spends his time a-racing
Chasing stardust
A million miles away
And when his air runs out
He'll have turn around
He'll fall all the way down
To the ground
You can leave me
In orbit
Till I'm nothing more than
The one the radars lost
The one the radars lost
The one the radars lost
On the ground
Together, together
We're so very clever
Flip nickels, the weather
It rains in the fountain
I guess you never knew
There's someone like you
Around every single corner
And I'm so fucking bored
You can leave me in orbit
Till I'm nothing more than
The one the radars lost
The one the radars lost
The one the radars lost
On the ground
Goodbye now, goodbye now
Go ahead and close your eyes now
You're frozen from skating too far out on the ice
When someone pushed you down
There was no one else around
No one to pick you up
From icy waters
Please bring me down
Please bring me down
Please
B4 we get started, r we all alone?
'Cause I'm about 2 get open-hearted
It's time 2 send your company home and turn off your cell phone
Baby, can't you see I just wanna getcha satisfied?
Satisfied
This is gonna be a long night (Long)
A little bit longer afternoon (Afternoon)
Girl if we get this thing right
Ooh, U gonna get satisfied real soon
Baby, can't you see (Can't you see I'm just tryin'?)
That I wanna get you satisfied, oh yeah? (Satisfied)
I ain't talkin' 'bout nothin' physical
'Cause 4play starts in the mind (In the mind)
I'm just tryin' 2 get U 2 think about doin' things
That U've always wanted, but could never find
I'm gonna seek this thing like a buried treasure (Seek and destroy)
Like Columbus sailing over the sea
Till I discover baby, the land beyond expertise and chastity
I'm just tryin', tryin', I'm just tryin' 2 get U
Satisfied (Satisfied, satisfied, satisfied)
I'm sure you had another lover (Another lover)
But let me tell you baby, all tricks aside
I can get you out of your body
Have you ever felt like you were dyin'
And felt satisfied?
Hurt like a bird on a wire
You got cursed
You got burnt
Something that no one deserves
Has broken your wings
You forgot how to sing
All the trouble it brings
Trouble that it brings
For the first time in your life you're coming home
You can feel the strength returning to your bones
Caught in a trap of desire
You got lost
You got shot with a bow
And arrow to the heart
Fashion your life like a battered wife
Got some wood and a knife
Wood and a knife
For the first time in your life you'd make a home
You'd work your fingers right down to the bone
Instrumental
We were married on a rainy day
The sky was yellow
And the grass was gray
We signed the papers
And we drove away
I do it for your love
The rooms were musty
And the pipes were old
All that winter we shared a cold
Drank all the orange juice
That we could hold
I do it for your love
Found a rug
In an old junk shop
And I brought it home to you
Along the way the colors ran
The orange bled the blue
The sting of reason
The splash of tears
The northern and the southern
Hemispheres
Love emerges
And it disappears
I do it for your love
I do it for your love
And she closed her eyes and said
No I'm not in love
I'm not in much
For real
And the hood fell off her head
And her face got wet
I held my part
Of the deal
I've been growing older he thought
And he smiled and said
You've got the saddest face
I've seen
And when she didn't seem to listen at all
He said I'm getting wet
You held your part
Of the deal
Closing folding like a star
Bring you back to see the lights
Bluest water falling down on your skin
On your skin
Keep you eyes locked away
In some lonely place
Don't stop, don't stop
When the music's over
Crosses made to bare the weight
You never bothered to explain
Questions swim around your head
Keep you eyes locked away
In some lonely place
Don't stop don't stop
When the music's over now
Closing folding like a star
Brings you back to see the lights
Bluest water falling down
On your skin, on your skin
Keep your eyes locked away
In some lonely place
Don't stop don't stop
When the music's over
Now It's over now
Anything can happen in life
Especially nothing, mainly nothing
Once you know that, you're fine
Once you know that, you can retire
Set your clock by your heart
Work's overrated and it will kill you
Finish nothing you start
And start nothing you think you'll continue
I'm disaffected now
I'm disaffected now
And to this model I've kept
I surface at 3 in the clothes that I slept in
And though I'm drowning in debt
I'm richer through all the things I'm rejecting
And in a rare, certain light
I have a strange charm, I think you'd like me
And the rain brings me out
The rain makes me happy
I'm disaffected now
I'm disaffected now
Set your clock by your heart
Work's overrated and it will kill you
When I first saw you
You had on blue jeans
Your eyes couldn't hide
Anything
I saw you
Breathing, oh
Saw you staring out in space
When I next saw you
You were at the party
Thought you was a queen
Oh, so flirty
I came against them
Didn't say excuse
Knew what I was doing
We looked very fine
As we were leaving
As we were making
What we were making
Saint John
You were a cool jerk
Oh, I want you
Like a kangaroo
At a tin mine we do stand,
And here I realise that it's all in my hands,
At the tips of our feet where the waves stun the rocks,
Where the sun steals the sand,
Here I do plot,
I bang my fists and I crush the cliffs,
I scream out into the mouth,
Of this cave, this fiery cave,
This fucking world we cannot save!
So I start again, turn the wheel,
I pierce my skin - I feel so real!
I'm a lovelorn shepherd - lightening skies!
The future blows into my eyes.
So with a sense of terror and bewilderment,
We damage our pasts with romance and hatred,
So burn all your books, your videos and CDs,
Forget all that has happened and wail down on your knees!
I take two steps back and tie my boots, 
I run and dive into the blue,
I can feel the air redesign my hair,
Redesign my life, and my cares,
The deeper I swim the more I know,
The more I love, the more I grow
Hey, I think you're cute
Would you like to be my new best friend?
We can talk for hours or just lay in bed
You're just the kind of kid I could grow old with
So won't you walk with me to the park up the road
I told you that I'd be right back
You said that "I'll be the judge of that
'Cause, see, boys they have a tendency of running from me
As fast as they can
I don't know why"
And I just laughed and asked if you'd like
A Coke or some sort of assorted beverage
From the diner up the road
If so, you should walk with me
Feel free to hold my hand
Feel free to kiss me on the cheek even though I'd
Even though I'd prefer the lips
Hey, I think you're groovy
Would you wanna see a movie with me?
We can sit in uncomfortable seats and eventually
I'll get the nerve up to put my arm around you
Can I put my arms around you?
'Cause I'd sure like to
It'll be like an episode of Boy Meets World
Except without the commercials
And I'm just fine with that
How about you?
How about you?
I like the way you talk
I like your dyed black hair
I love your half-ass accent you stole from the foreign movies
I like your pretty eyes, and how you're afraid of the dark
Well I am too
So would you like to take a walk with me?
Through a well-lit park
Just up the block
I'll be the bright side of your bad day
I'll be the bright side of your bad nights
I'll be the bright side of your bad day
If you'll be mine
It's always in the back of your mind
When everything is dark, still something shines
One chilly afternoon, you drew the blind
The earth was frozen
Ice upon the water
All at once you saw her
There in the winter light
Then the light came bouncin' up, from stony ground
And deep within the earth you heard the sound
Breakin' like a rock you grew profound
The earth was frozen
Ice upon the water
All at once you saw her
There in the winter light
There in the winter light
There in the winter light
Making everything look beautiful
Light, a child with his own fantasmagoria 
Light that spills from billions of excited atoms
Light that lingers in a quiet room
Reveal for me shine for me
There in the winter light
Shine for me, reveal for me
There in the winter light
There in the winter light
Ich bin auf der Flucht 
vor aufgebrachten Massen
quer durch die Wildnis
am Ende angekommen
warte lange schon am Eingang
stumm und ohne Plan
Zunachst ist da ein Sturm
du ziehst nicht damit vorbei
Dann ist da ein Beben
aber auch da bist du nicht involviert
Ich werde heftig von unten an den Wurzeln reissen
bis die obere Welt sich regt
Col de ma ma daqua
Ein leichtes leises Sauseln
Eine Stimme verschwebten Schweigens
Und gabe es ungeheure Wassermassen
ich weiss du nahmst an keiner Flut mehr teil
Selbst wenn es heute noch Meteore regnet
du bist ganz einfach nicht mehr dabei
Ich werde heftig an den zweiundzwanzig Wurzeln reissen
bis die obere Welt sich regt
Ich erhebe meine Gegenstimme
bis aus dem Sauseln die Antwort mir weht
I am P.O.S.
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes off this land corporation's rape
From that life I'm tryin' to separate
But I guess I'm livin' dreams
'Cause my rent's always a month late
Product of an East German black
Who kissed the neck of a pretty woman named Grace
But he left my life just a little too soon
Didn't see me catch the Doomtree fame
As we go a little somethin' like this
Look ma, no protection
Now I got a baby boy by the name of Jake
And I been tryin' to play the cowboy to rustle in the dough
And I think I been gettin' better every passin' day
I'm not an early bird, plus the feathers are black
So by the time I catch an apple, usually its rind
But its a must to decipher one's girl
From the round sweet apples that are rotten on the inside
I cherish my free time
But I maximize so my soul needs to unwind
I wanna see the stars and be the moon to my son
But I'm always on the run, run, run
I'm fake to all these hard-case kids
I raise a black fist but won't say (nigga) in the things I write
And I don't say (faggot) 'cause I don't think it's right
I know my boy struggled with that for over half his life
I guess we got our own lives to live
But I'm stretched too thin, tryin' to build a kingdom to rule
And I think to the past sometimes, an dag man, it's bad
See, I kinda acted like a fool
But I've apologized to the lives I touched wrong
Pride to the back move ahead strong
But I can safely say I ain't never played a woman
Without karma catchin' up later on
I tried to walk the right side of the tracks
But I hopped a couple trains, mom would cry if she knew the halfs
But I can stand who I am and face the day straight 
Knowin' not a thing can change with me, singin'
No one will ever be like me
No one will ever be like me
And I know I'm not a bad guy 
When I try and do what's right
Everyone who comes to me
Don't understand or see my plight
Everything I ever done
And all the plans I had inside
Always missed, gone wrong in a way
So I gave up and said alright
So now I do what I can, I'm alright
Stand up like mama raised me alright
I was dealt from the bottom and pulled a flush
I been livin' with my chips all in and I'm still in, see
No one will ever be like me
No one will ever be like me
From that life I'm tryin' to separate
But I guess I'm livin' dreams
'Cause my rent's always a month late
Lookin' back it seems I always been a step behind
A little off track, feelin' no one shared the frame of mind
Listen to records in my room to escape
Found some things I could relate with and wore out the tape
He said:
When I lose every time I win, 'cause
No one will ever be
Messin' up stuff and doin' things wrong
Quite like me
No one will ever be like me
No one will ever be like me 
No one will ever be like me
No one will ever be like me
My heart is on my sleeve, my head is in the sand
I said how did we end up here? you said happenstance
And I didn't understand, so I made other plans
I ran to the ocean, washed the blood off of my hands
I washed away my tears, washed away ten years
Washed away the empty space in-between my ears
And you said, all that I mean is that you and me
Didn't meet because of fate but rather probability
And you said the truth's like corn and lies are like weeds
You said the schroedinger equation collapsed perfectly
And I said mercy me be patient please
'Cause I don't know a goddamn thing about the birds and the bees
I just know what I'm like and I'm like what I see
Even though it's hard to see because you just blinded me
And if there's one thing I learned in chemistry
It's that the gain of electrons is reduction, obviously
But you can't see electrons without machines
And you can't tell from my inflection if I'm being mean
And I don't know if I can take you seriously
Sometimes elections depend on the absentees
And my family and my friends
And all the little kids that love me make me strong
And no matter how this ends
I know I'll never ever ever be alone
Some day I'll be an old lady
With a big dress and an apron
A babushka and bare feet
I'll be out in my garden
On my hands and knees
And I'll be singing a song
That is really sad and sweet
Mommy and daddy your baby is grown
And the smell of the cold, wet dirt reminds me of home
What's this odd game that's all over the airwaves?
It's their loose lips that laid me so sick with
An ear pinned down on your chest
And all I heard were sighs from that shotgun
That she hides so well, so well under that dress
My my what an awful mess
Does that dress fit all right?
I wanna know why it falls off and on
Are you ok baby?
Hopefully Mississippi will lynch you
Like it did me.
I'm a cabaret, a champaign cafe
Everyone uses to celebrate.
But I'm just not ready to rot and dance and laugh
To the sweetest death I ever had.
Oh my you look awful
With a mouthful of sex, like drugs
But I just can't seem to
Switch off this machine
That turns ivory into kerosene.
Does that dress fit all right?
I wanna know why it falls off and on.
Are you ok baby?
Hopefully new york city will lose you
Like it did me.
I've got glass eyes that have dined
So many times with thighs and sighs
That scream I got to get mine. (x2)

Right here what we gonna do is go back
Way back
Ooh...
Way back, yeah
I met him when I was a
A little girl, he gave
He gave me poetry
And he was my first
But in my heart I knew I
Wasn't the only one
'Cause when the tables turned
He had to break up
Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice
But that is all behind me
'Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the
Love of my life
You are my friend (yeah)
Love of my life
I can depend
Love of my life
Without you, baby
It feels like I sampled true love
But the shit didn't clear
Hot dam and I can't be stopped 'cause I'm lyte MC and I'm light as a rock
Well my name is Badu and I rock your world, I'm also known as the
Gucci girl. Well I'm super cute and play ain't bad
30 26 36 and 1/2.
Hope you realize
I got them hazel eyes that'll hypnotize
Knock you to yo knees
Make you eat cheese
You be so helpless you be beggin me please
A freak-freak, y'all, and ya don't stop
To the beat y'all and ya don't stop
A freak-freak
How could it be that it was
All just so simple then
A teen age lover who said
He's just a friend
He moved around and we kept
In touch through his friend Mike
The world was young and he knew
We couldn't rush but
Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice
But that is all behind me
'Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the
Love of my life
You are my friend
Love of my life
On you I can depend, yeah, yeah
Love of my life
Without you, baby
Feels like I sampled true love, yeah
But the shit didn't clear
Y'all know how I met her
We broke up and got back together
To get her back I had to sweat her
Thought she roll with bad boys forever in many ways
Them boys may be better, to grow I had to let her (Never)
She needed cheddar and I understood that
Lookin' for cheese, that don't make her a hood rat
(Rat)
In fact she's a queen to me, her light beams on me
I love it when she sings to me
It's like that now
Love of my life
You know you rock my world and
Love of my life
You be boy and I'll be girl and
Love of my life
We don't stop until the break of dawn, ooh...
Love of my life
Ooh, you know you rock my world and
Love of my life
You be boy and I'll be girl and
Love of my life
Yeah...
(Talking)
Yo, you know what we got to do, man, we need to get a whole CD.
Get a collection of all the music and everything we've ever done.
(Woman Singing)
Bringing back sweet memories
Bringing back sweet memories
Bringing back sweet memories
Life, living in Flatbush and going to house parties
Red lights, bumping, life is what you make it, then sorry
In my lifetime, ain't done too many things
Better than watching your first son put his sentences together
Yo, it kinda make me think of way back when
I was the portrait of the artist as a young man
All them teenage dreams of rapping
Writing rhymes on napkins
Was really visualization
Making this shit actually happen
It's like something come through me
That truly just consume me
Speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
I think back in the day, I absorbed everything like a sponge
Took a plunge into my past to share with my son
Bringing back sweet memories
Bringing back sweet memories
Bringing back sweet memories
Like thoughts out the back of my mind
Going back in some time
Like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
Look back and you find
Tracks that make you relax and recline
Now cats rap about packing a nine
When they lacking divine
Inspiration
Running out of topics of conversation
Well I drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
I do it remarkably, spark up a leaf
And possibly you could follow me
Tap into your chi
Utilize your memory
To help you see clearly, then get back to me
Actually, nothing's new under the sun
So when life be stressing me
My remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
Like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
>From cities where making 21's a big accomplishment
Like when my people understood their prominence
And my past life visions of the continent
Like the first time I saw KRS live, rockin' it
I heard Resurrection by Common Sense
Dominant in my psyche
I chose my direction like Spike Lee
To speak my life through mics, and I never take it lightly
It might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
But that karma's a bitch, you steady asking God why
Like when my parents first split up
Yo, I was illin'
Seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
And I love them for that
I don't know if they saw that
So I'ma say it, and convey it when the world play it (3x)
Bringing back sweet memories
Bringing back sweet memories
Bringing back sweet memories
Like black is beautiful, names from the seventies
Let me tap into your energy
Fields of dreams become my property
When I reach my destiny like a prophecy
Especially when I 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
I got deep into my mind, see I got a treasury
That float through my head like a sweet melody
What you telling me
Reflection is a collection of memories
Definitely this is how hiphop was meant to be
Eventually, I knew I'd run into Hi-Technology
It was only a matter of time like centuries
Check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
I freak with word power, my man speak with beats
If I could make it in New York, I figured anywhere I'd make it
Came to Cincinnati linked with Mood, and we did Sacred
Hi-Tek beats became my favorite
Hussle on the Side was the cut
We started to put songs together like 'What!'
Travelled the world, came back to the crib
And hit the motherland
Yeah, this year we put in work and got some other plans
In fact, that's where I'll take the fam
When the Reflection joint is done
By the time you hear this, I'll be basking in African sun
Like Wow!
We made it
We here
It could be ten but then again
I can't remember half an hour since a quarter to four
Throw all on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
And you leave me with my jaw on the floor, hey
Oh, just when you think that you're in control
Just when you think that you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll
Oh, here it goes
Here it goes
Here it goes again
Oh, here it goes again
I should have known
Should have known
Should have known again
But here it goes again
Oh oh, here it goes again
Starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy
Something inching past the edge of reserve
Now through the lines of the cheap Venetian blinds
Your car is pulling off of the curb, hey
Oh, just when you think that you're in control
Just when you think that you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll
Oh, here it goes
Here it goes
Here it goes again
Oh, here it goes again
I should have known
Should have known
Should have known again
But here it goes again
Oh, here it goes
Oh, here it goes
Oh, here it goes again
Oh oh, here it goes again
Oh, oh
Oh, here it goes
Yeah, oh, here it goes again
Hey, hey
Oh, here it goes
Alright
I guess there's got to be a break in the monotony
But Jesus, when it rains, how it pours
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
And you leave me
Yeah, you leave me
Ah, oh, here it goes
Here it goes
Here it goes again
Oh, here it goes again
I should have known
Should have known
Should have known again
But here it goes again
Oh, here it goes
Oh, here it goes
Oh, here it goes again
I should have known
I should have known
But here it goes again
Oh, here it
Oh, here it
Oh, here it
Oh, here it
Oh, here it goes again
I should have
I should have
I should have
I should have
I should have known
Oh, oh yeah
I should have known
Oh, here it goes it again
Oh oh, here it goes it again
I had a dream - of the wide open prairie 
I had a dream - of the pale morning sky 
I had a dream - that we flew on golden wings 
And we were the same - just the same - you and I 
Follow your heart - little child of the west wind 
Follow the voice - that's calling you home 
Follow your dreams - but always, remember me 
I am your brother - under the sun 
We are like birds of a feather 
We are two hearts joined together 
We will be forever as one 
My brother under the sun 
Wherever you hear - the wind in the canyon 
Wherever you see - the buffalo run 
Wherever you go - I'll be there beside you 
'Cause you are my brother - my brother under the sun
We are like birds of a feather 
We are two hearts joined together 
We will be forever as one 
My brother under the sun
What if I told you that it was all in vain?
Would it still hurt you?
Would you still feel the same?
Said it's impossible-possible
So impossible
But you're still waiting on the moment breath is bated
I wish I could hold you, I can't take it
Tell you all my secrets
I'm too faded
Praying that tomorrow I'll be braver
Maybe I can tell you, maybe we can do this
Kisses on my forehead we can fall into it
Love you like the rain, falls much faster
Living in a piece of ever after
Forever after
Living in the piece of ever after
Ever after, ever after
If will you have me
I'll make you happy
Need someone to whom I can belong
Here's my confession
Saving it special
Hoped it would be you all along
All along
All along
All along
But you're still waiting on the moment breath is bated
I wish I could hold you, I can't take it
Tell you all my secrets
I'm too faded
Praying that tomorrow I'll be braver
Maybe I can tell you, maybe we can do this
Kisses on my forehead we can fall into it
Love you like the rain, falls much faster
Living in a piece of ever after
Forever after
Living in the piece of ever after
Ever after, ever after
And I've paid
The price of solitude 
With wish to worry 
While you're away
With all grace
To allow my hand 
The travel and worth 
Here across your face
I love you more than you could know
Here in those eyes you hide it well
I think you do
I love you more than you could know
Here in those eyes you hide it well
I think you do
And I turn
The wheels that round the ground 
Across the never
Here against the grave
Now I've lost
The only thing that matters to my life
Is now the dream
I love you more than you could know
Here in those eyes you hide it well
I think you do
I love you more than you could know
Here in those eyes you hide it well
I think you do
Here I go
I'm on my way home now
To you
And it hurts to hear you feel
In the deepest ocean, the bottom of the sea
Your eyes, they turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes, they turn me
Turn me into phantoms
I follow to the edge of the earth and fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves if they get the chance
And this is my chance
I get eaten by the worms and weird fishes
Picked over by the worms and weird fishes
Weird fishes, weird fishes
Yeah, I hit the bottom, hit the bottom and escape, escape
I hit the bottom, hit the bottom and escape, escape
Seria mais facil fazer como todo mundo faz
O caminho mais curto, produto que rende mais
Seria mais facil fazer como todo mundo faz
Um tiro certeiro, modelo que vende mais
Mas nos dancamos no silencio
Choramos no carnaval
Nao vemos graca nas gracinhas da tv
Morremos de rir no horario eleitoral
Seria mais facil fazer como todo mundo faz
Sem sair do sofa, deixar a ferrari pra tras
Seria mais facil, como todo mundo faz
O milesimo gol sentado na mesa de um bar
Mas nos vibramos em outra frequencia
Sabemos que nao e bem assim
Se fosse facil achar o caminho das pedras
Tantas pedras no caminho nao seria ruim
Can you hear my voice break
Can you hear my heart bake
Let you know my hands shake
Love
I can hear you whisper
I can hear that it burns
And I know that this hurts
Love
Picture you kissing me as were falling asleep
Oh this feeling is marrow deep
You call and all I wanna do now
Is be there with you
You say that I'm your beautiful
I'm your beautiful love
Oh I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I don't wanna wait for
Us to be together
Everyday is torture
Love
You know that the one place
I can really feel safe
Is thinking of your face
Love
Picture you on the floor
Your watching the door
I know who you're waiting for
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
Promise that I will be
Seeing you in my dreams
Tell me that you love me
Love
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
Ooh
Ooh
Yeah yeah yeaa
Ooh
Ooh yeah
Now you and I
Can get together
Let us start a revolution
Change this world
To what it should be
And forget all this confusion

For the sake of love
What are we fighting for
Ooh now

If we can just learn to give
Give a lil' love

Ah

Ah
Ooh
Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we leaving life
Or moving in
Exploding out
Imploding in
Ingrained in good
Or stained in sin
Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we leaving life
Or moving in
Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we breathing in
We are a billion fragments
Exploding outward
Like broken glass, we damage
Even in defeat
We are tiny pieces
Falling now and settling
Like snowflake crystal
Building on the city street
Snowflakes falling
Snowflakes falling
Snowflakes falling
Snowflakes falling
Are we the parts
Are we the whole
Are we the thoughts
Are we the soul
The parts of me
And this is true
The parts of me
Belong to you
Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we leaving life
Or moving in
Exploding out
Imploding in
Ingrained in good
Or stained in sin
Are we the parts
Are we the whole
Are we the thoughts
Are we the soul
The parts of me
And this is true
The parts of me
The parts of you
Belong to you
And you
And you
And you...
The phone rings, it's early, it's seven o'clock
He says "sorry I woke you but I just had to talk
You know last night, remember when I tried to choke you
I didn't mean it, I was drunk, it was only a joke"
You should know that by now
When the checkered flag comes down
No one, no one, no one has won the race
The next night he's over and over and under
And after he's finished, she lies there and wonders
Just why does she need him, and why does she stay here
And then in the darkness she'll quietly say "Dear
You've never really known
That when the white flag is flown
No one, no one, no one has won the war"
They're complicated people leading complicated lives
And he complicates their problems telling complicated lies
He tells her he's sorry, she tells him it's over
He tells her he's sorry, she says over and over
"You've never really known
That when the white flag is flown
No one, no one, no one has, won the war"
There goes a forest and there goes a bluebird
There goes a partridge and there goes a Go train
There goes an angel and there goes a steeple
There goes a cop car and there goes an eagle
There goes a raven and there go the ribbons
There goes a raven and there go the ribbons
There goes a raven and there go...
The ribbons, the ribbons, the ribbons
The ribbons of the flag
Of the flag, of the flag
Of the flag, of the flag
Of the flag, of the flag
Momma stayed home with me
By the time I was half alive
I knew what I was gonna be
I left school, I grew my hair
They didn't understand
They wanted me to be respected as
A doctor or a lawyer man
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
As I grew up I worked real hard
So I could buy a guitar
I wanted to be on the top one day
I wanted to be a star
I could see my name in lights
And I could can see the queue
I had the devil in my blood
Tellin' me what to do
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Life can be hard, but it can be good to you
Saving all your money like a fool
But your know better
It can be cruel
Listen awhile, and I will sing to you
Pull apart my body and you'll see
My heart is beating
And so I'm free
I've been good to you, I've been good to you
What have I put you through? No, I've been good to you.
Oh, haven't I been good to you?
Take up your hands
Lift them off your eyes
Wouldn't it be wrong to think you're mad?
With such a face now
How long and sad.
I learned a way, I learned away from you.
From walking on a line, I keep some poise
But I'm all wrong now,
I make no noise?
I've been good to you, I've been good to you
What have I put you through? No, I've been good to you.
Haven't I been good to you?
Friday, Saturday, Sunday too
There must be things to do if I wanted to
Must be things to do if I knew how to
But now I can't work out what I'm supposed to do
If I can't go out and I can't stay in
I can't go out and I can't stay in
(Repeat)
Goodbye yesterday and goodbye me
So it's goodbye Saturday and hello week
Goodbye Saturday and hello week
Now I can't work out what I'm supposed to do
If I can't go out and I can't stay in
I can't go out and I can't stay in
(Repeat)
Instrumental
What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning 
I don't know where to go from here
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
There's something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
And me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
Close your eyes
Fly away to a land
Where dreams are true
It ain't so easy to love you true account of all the rattlesnakes and all that makes you blue
But it's worth it I love the thrill
Come come come
C'mon through c'mon you come dig right into my heart
C'mon through c'mon you come dig right into my heart
What is the body if not a place were you store all anger and happiness and pain
But it s worth it I love the thrill
Come come come
C'mon through c'mon you come dig right into my heart
C'mon through c'mon you come dig right into my heart
One, two, three, yeah!
I'm in love with everything I see
Today
Well, it's bright and new
Some waves have borrowed all of my pain
For the next few hours
I can sway
I can sway
Oh, where I lay
I can sway
The water's rising
Life is ending
Oh, I've lived on top of my own words
Simplified
I'm not shaking
Speed is the only factor
A kitten on a patio
A kitten on a patio is looking for me
A kitten on a patio
That kitten on the patio can't get to me
Where I lay
Where I lay
I can sway
Where I lay
I can sway
The water's rising
Life is ending
Oh, I've lived on top of my own words...
Have it all
We'll have it all
We
We can... one, two, three, yeah!
I'm in love with everything I see
Today
Well, it's bright and new
Some waves have borrowed all of my pain
For the next few hours
I can sway

Melody day what have I done (ah)
Now our hearts are locked up tight again
And when I pray it's all begun
Then your smile it melts away again
Melody day where have you gone
And the hope I had is dying
And what we had has come undone
Then your smile it melts away again
Easy! Easy! Easy! Easy!
Melody day what have I done
Now our hearts are locked up tight again
And when I pray it's all begun
Then your smile it melts away again
Tell them, tell them I always knew why
So long, so I would like to say goodbye
Easy! Easy! Easy! Easy!
If I didn't know
I couldn't want you
If I didn't know
I couldn't want you
If I didn't know
I couldn't want you more
Monday morning
Back to work, just like you said
If I keep moving
Then I won't be counted, dead, dead
Grease the hinges
But they still refuse to budge
Ceiling changes
If I wait for long enough
Something's lost when I translate you
Think I have it, then it slips through
Decoding you has proved the hardest thing
I know you love me, if it starts to sting
If I didn't know
I couldn't want you
If I didn't know
I couldn't want you
If I didn't know
I couldn't want you more
Friday evening and the drinks we pass around
You said 'jenny, you look better on the ground'
My name spells emergency
Quick darling make me hurt
I'm begging you on scabbed knees
And swallowing your dirt
Dirt
Something's lost when I translate you
Think I have it, then it slips through
Decoding you has proved the hardest thing
I know you love me, if it starts to sting
If I didn't know
I couldn't want you
If I didn't know
I couldn't want you
If I didn't know
I couldn't want you more
If I didn't know
(If I didn't know)
I couldn't want you
If I didn't know
(If I didn't know)
I couldn't want you
If I didn't know
(If I didn't know)
I couldn't want you more
If I didn't know
I couldn't want you more
We fall
Through water
Unsung unseen
And days
Thought endless
Lose more
Light and heat
So let the dead bury the dead
I should leave
For I am
For I am overhtrown
Confess to me now
Confess to me now
Half in sunlight
And half in shade
Words in collision
I bend to your shape
I see the skull beneath the skin
I see it all
For I am
For I am overhtrown
Confess to me now
Confess to me now
For I am
For I am overhtrown
Confess to me now
Confess to me now
Confess to me now
The wind that will bring me
Out to you
Is a wind that gets singing
Whipping at the tune
The same wind comes rushing
That later lays low
And it pulls at my edges
Then continues to blow
Just keep on the horizon
It brings hail from old water
And a storm on its knees
And flags from a revolution
That brought us some peace
And the trees for their hundred years
Lean north like calligraphy
And I'm shaped by my storming
Like they're shaped by their storming
Keep at the horizon
You found you, I mean you
Deep on the horizon
Keep on the horizon
As strong as that wind
That blew us round the island
Is a wind that has lasted
Longer than the past has
It's a wind that will keep on
Lasting beyond ever after
It's a wind that will keep on lasting
Longer than the past has
Come inside
We've been expecting you
Been such a long time
Thought you might never show
Been living my life
From day to day
Been hoping that you
Would never come my way
Come inside
I've been expecting you
Been such a long time
Thought you might never show
I've been living my life
From day to day
Hoping that you
Would never come my way
Come inside
Come inside
Come inside
Come
Come inside
We've been expecting you
Been such a long time
Thought you might never show
Been living my life
From day to day
Been hoping that you
Would never come my way
Papapapa...
Don't say a word, don't say anything
Don't say a word, I'm not even listening
I read in the papers about their escape
They're just two bitter kids from a bunch of sour grapes
You better watch your step
Watch who's knocking on your front door
Now you know that they're watching
What are you waiting for?
Think you're young and original
Get out before
They get to watch your step
Every day is full of fun and family spies
They're making heroes out of fall guys
They say it's good for business
From Singapore to Widnes
You better watch your step
Broken noses hung up on the wall
Back slapping drinkers cheer the heavyweight brawl
So punch drunk they don't understand at all
You better watch your step
Every night go out full of carnival desires
End up in the closing time choirs
When you're kicking in the courtroom
And you're drinking down the Eau de Cologne
And you're spitting out the Kodachrome
You better watch your step
Bye, I send you all my regards
You're so tough, you're so hard
Listen to the hammers falling in the breaker's yard
You better watch your step
You better watch your step
Ooh, watch your step
Wild, embroiled, young hearts depend on me.
While in style in darkened limousines
Young hearts remain unseen.
While you write your hiel of light,
(Do you need some company?)
Why do we need someone, really need someone?
Lifeline
Why do we need someone, really need someone?
Lifeline
Cardinal, you royal!
Young Gods remain unclean.
Royal is royal in thy xeno-scene
...Young hearts will still be clean.
While you write you trials of life,
(Do you need some company?)
Why do we need someone, really need someone?
Lifeline
Why do we need someone, really need someone?
Lifeline
Die, die, die on a Spanish coast
Die like a clown with no friend around
This used to be a Spanish town
Die, die, die on a Spanish coast
Die like a fly with no lover to sigh
On a high white box in a pile of rocks
You'll go crazy by the hazy sea
Die, die, die on a Spanish coast
Die like a love when you killed a dove
If you don't believe
Then your angels leave and you lose it
You can't use it, life
But it just looks so cold there from the bottle
Another part of another ritual
Standing in the kitchen
Arms are braced against the counter
Swallowing like mercury down the drain
And the neighbors have been drinking
And they are raising quite a stink
Pretty soon they will be fighting
It can get pretty ugly
The city makes a hooting sound tonight
The owl on the roof has got it right
If it's left up to him
He'll take that stupid grin
And decapitate a rodent or a mouse
Take the b train or the shuttle
At the exit have a smoke
Try to spit onto the sidewalk
Instead you wipe it off your chest
I don't wanna freak but the tongue erodes
Each time we start to speak
On a timely mission
Oh you look pretty swell in your new position
Fiberglass funny face up on the wall
It's funny when it's not funny at all
And if it's up to him
We will take the ways of sin
And smash them like glass against the wall
But it's nothing to pathetic
Full of rhetoric and doubt
Carry on like little creature
In the fields of our love
Today I saw the strangest thing on the evening news
A man who wasn't sad at all about what's going on
And even though I'm trying to smile
With everything I see it could take a while
I've been looking everywhere I go
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?
I've been looking all around to know
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone?
Yesterday I heard you say you never close your eyes
Sometimes the world's a scary ride, it's hard to hang on
Along the way we got off track
And if we turn around can we ever get back?
I know it was there when we were young
Today I saw a flag roll by on a wooden box
And if it's true we lost our way
Then what have we got?
Today I saw the strangest thing
In my mind
I still need a quiet place to go
Oh I really know
That some of you don't understand
And I wish, I could live
In the dream, oh yes I do
I wanna be as big
As a mountain
I sing this song
Because I love a man
Tell me is it strange
That I do not hope to turn again
And I wish, I could live
In the dream, oh yes I do
I wanna be as big
As a mountain
Flowers are nice, flowers are pretty
So I took a ride away from the city
Stories I'd heard of mystery and magic
Traveling caravans left me enchanted
With rivers of sun glow just beyond the plateau
I followed them down to the well
There are your wishes there are your dreams
In shimmering fields of gold
A mystical mistress in the forest of night
Knew that I'd come from city lights
Shimmering fields but of course my dear
Shimmering fields of gold
Many have followed the footsteps you're on
Good to know I'm not alone
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
Shimmering straight ahead I see
Shimmering fields of gold
All you could wish for and all you could dream
Shimmering fields of gold
How many roads you've traveled
How many dreams you've chased
Across sand and sky and gravel
Looking for one safe place
Will you make a smoother landing
When you break your fall from grace
Into the arms of understanding
Looking for one safe place
Life is trial by fire
And love's the sweetest taste
And I pray it lifts us higher
To one safe place
How many roads we've traveled
How many dreams we've chased
Across sand and sky and gravel
Looking for one safe place
Away to the westward
I'm longing to be,
Where the beauties of heaven
Unfold by the sea;
Where the sweet purple heather blooms
Fragrant and free
On a hilltop high above
The Dark Island
So gentle the sea breeze,
That ripples the bay,
Where the stream joins the ocean,
And young children play;
On the strand of pure silver,
I'll welcome each day,
And I'll roam for every more,
The Dark Island
True gem of the Herbrides,
Bathed in the light,
Of the mid-summer dawning,
That follows the night;
How I yearn for the cries,
Of the seagulls in flight,
As they circle above
The Dark Island
Flying crow
Fly alone
A careless soul
That sings for everyone
When the world closes
A steady blade
Tears the seal
A fallen angel
Selling secrets
We can steal
While brushing off the rust
We'll go insane
A beaten dog in anguish
Counts his days
So, come down with me
It's time to leave
Come down with me
I think we outta go
It's time to leave
You hoped that if you'd forget your memories
That they'd forget you too
You put a bandage on your aching spot
And that will make you feel good
I think someone should have told you that
This ain't the way it works
And that you have to work it out some day
You will, yeah
It takes you further every time
It will make you sweat like hell
You just can't keep gnashing your teeth forever
Won't cry, why wouldn't you
No, won't let them get to you
Won't cry
And if anyone will try to tell you that
This ain't, no no
This ain't, no
It ain't the way it works
They're wrong, they're wrong, so wrong
Well you've done enough to prove us all
Won't let them get you down
But now I think the moment's there
To show yourself your weaknesses
I see you've figured out by now
This ain't the way that things go
And the time has come to work it out
You will, yeah
It takes you further every time
It will make you sweat like hell
You just can't keep gnashing your teeth forever
Won't cry, why wouldn't you
No, won't let them get to you
Won't cry
And if anyone will try to tell you that
This ain't, no no
This ain't, no
It ain't the way it works
They're wrong, they're wrong, so wrong (no, no, no, no)
You won't cry, won't cry, I know
You won't cry, won't cry, won't let them get to you
Won't cry, won't cry, ooh no
You won't cry, yeah
You won't cry, why wouldn't you
No, won't let them get to you
Won't cry
And if anyone will try to tell you that
This ain't, no no
This ain't, no
This ain't the way it works
They're wrong, they're wrong, so wrong (no, no, no, no)
Save me from the movies and someone else's dreams
While angels make their music and give my spirit wings
I just concertina and wrap around the world
Staying out 'til 6 o'clock and singing like a fool
I've only got this morning to live
Look at all the colours at my fingertips
I don't want to stand still
I just want to freewheel
I don't want to lose this
Save my feet from dancing with anyone at all
Worn out shoes because lotus blue is hanging in the hall
You're a face in the distance I hope to recognise
It's like running through deep water trying to look into your eyes
I've only got this morning to live
Look at all the colours at my fingertips
I don't want to stand still
I just want to freewheel
I don't want to lose this
Is there something I should know?
Something you won't tell me?
I can see, it in your eyes,
There's nothing left for you to hide, my love.
Is there somewhere we can go?
Somewhere that we could speak?
If there is time, could we still find,
Piece of mind, some kind of love, my love?
But if you stay,
I know I'd throw it all away,
And if you go, (and if you go)
I know I'll find my way, back home.
You say I give it all away,
Leave nothing to imagination,
Well it's all I know, although I know,
You don't want, everything, my love.
But if you stay,
I know I'd throw it all away,
And if you go,
I know I'd find my way, back home.
Stay.
Stay.
If you go.
If you go.
Is there something I should know?
Is there something I should know?
Is there something I should know, my love?
There is not a river wide
Not a mountain high
And neither sin nor evil
Could change how I feel inside
Could change how I feel inside
Not all the strength of the ocean
Not all the heat from the sun
(From the sun)
Though others I've tried I just can't deny
For me you are the one
For me you are the one
But true love is priceless
For true love we pay the price
But there's nothing can keep me from lovin' you
Not fire no not ice
Not fire no not ice
Like a hero or a champion
You are the best (your the best)
Like religion or superstition
With you I am blessed
With you I am blessed
Now the river may grow wider
The mountains may reach past the sky
And whether or not you feel the same
My love shall never die
My love shall never die
But true love is give and take
True love is sacrifice
But there's nothing can keep me from loving you
Not fire no not ice
Not fire no not ice
Not fire no not ice
Mom I'm dying
I'm dizzy and frying
My throat hurts, I think I should stay in bed
'Cause I've got some kind of disease
And there are no remedies
Think I should stay in bed today
Maybe tomorrow go out and play
It's Saturday
With ginseng and fresh squeezed juice
Of wheat grass oh and some hot chicken soup
It just might keep me alive a couple days
'Cause I've got some kind of disease
And there are no remedies
Think I'll join Timothy Leary
In a cryogenic freeze
Next Saturday
'Cause I've got some kind of disease
And there are no remedies
Should've listened when you said beware
Of horny girls with New Jersey hair
Last Saturday
Like the whispering wind you sent to me
Like the hopeless time you gave to me
I watched your dreams all slip away
I watched your dreams all slip away
There's a hopeless place inside my heart
When I look inside I see where we are
Like the whispering wind in the top of the trees
I will watch the sky come following me
Like the rain on my windows late every night
Like the hope I have for us every time
It's like the whispering wind in the top of the trees
I see it sway as you come for me
There's a whispering wind, I feel it inside
Like a place I can feel but never will see
Let a whisper come touch you, come touch every thing
I stand in the way of the things I can be
Let the whispering wind come lift us away
Let it push us apart if we wish to stay
You're my sweetness, my baby, my love for all time
Like the whispering wind it makes you all mine
Like the whispering wind you stand here with me
Like the whispering wind you stand here with me
I see your dreams all slip away
Hang me, oh hand me
I'll be dead and gone
Hang me, oh hang me
I'll be dead and gone
Wouldn't mind the hanging
But the layin' in a grave so long, poor boy
I been all around this world
I been all 'round cape Gigardeau
Parts of Arkansas
All around cape Giradeau
Parts of Arkansas
Got so god damn hungry
I could hide behind a straw, poor boy
I been all around this world
Went up on a mountain
There I made my stand
Went up on a mountain
There I made my stand
Rifle on my shoulder
And a dagger in my hand, poor boy
I been all around this world
So hang me, oh hang me
I'll be dead and gone
Hang me, oh hang me
And I'll be dead and gone
I wouldn't mind the hanging
But the layin' in a grave so long, poor boy
I been all around this world
Put the rope around my neck
And hung me up so high
Put the rope around my neck
Hung me up so high
Last words I heard 'em say
Won't be long now for you die, poor boy
I been all around this world
So hang me, oh hang men
I'll be dead and gone
Hang me, oh hang me
I'll be dead and gone
I wouldn't mind the hanging
But the layin' in a grave, poor boy
I been all around this world
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing all the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
Is there anything I can do for you, dear?
Is there anyone I could call?
No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering
'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
'Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
'Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah
Broken windows and empty hallways
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to chase love away
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today
Lonely, lonely
Tin can at my feet
Think I'll kick it down the street
That's the way to treat a friend
Bright before me the signs implore me
Help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today
Take me down to where you think I belong.
You can't rescue me, you ain't that strong.
You don't know no better,
I'm not gonna tell you any better.
Can you turn this pale water to wine?
If you can do that, I think we'll be fine.
But you can raise a sinner.
And it's not me, but honesty, that's died.
Blurry lines between love and sin.
Can't tell me to stop when I begin.
Your body's sending questions to answers
You can't give or cannot get.
If you throw me a line, I'll only drag you in,
This is New York City and the ice is thin.
Keep your eyes open up all night,
I'll be gone by the morning, it strikes daylight.
You believe in faith and now you think their lies.
I never meant to hurt a soul alive.
I'm still searching for what you can give,
The further I wander, the less I know what it is.
Blurry lines between love and sin.
Can't tell me to stop when I begin.
My body's sending promises that I cannot keep.
Well we are blurry lines between love and sin.
Can't tell me to stop when I begin.
Your body's sending questions to answers,
You can't give or cannot get.
Blurry lines between love and sin.
Can't tell me to stop when I begin.
My body's sending promises that I cannot keep.
Well we are blurry lines between love and sin.
Can't tell me to stop when I begin.
Your body's sending questions to answers,
You can't give or cannot get.
Blurry lines between love and sin.
Can't tell me to stop when I begin.
My body's sending promises that I cannot keep.
Well we are blurry lines between love and sin.
Can't tell me to stop when I begin.
Your body's sending questions to answers,
You can't give or cannot get.
Last night we went out to the orchard in the snow
There in the constellations, a big dipper far below
We walked through the blackness, felt the endless space around
And you bent down on your knee and picked an apple from the ground
Out past the forest where the Saint Lawrence lies
We heard the cargo ships go pushing through the ice
You turned when we heard them, your breath hung in the air 
And you said, "Just 'cause we can't see them doesn't mean that they're not there
But I'm not afraid of what I can't see
Don't need a reason, don't need to believe"
We climbed up a latter that leaned against the hay
And out in the distance saw the highway far away
The headlights all sparkled, blending into the sky above
Where the moon was coming up, and I knew that's all there was
But I'm not afraid of all that space
'Cause everything I need is written on your face
Over by the barn in the dark, we heard the geese
They carried our boots past the naked little trees
We smelled the cold bark in the air and the sweetness of 
The fruit on the ground, and the wood smoke above
We sail
Through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The moon
In silver trees
Falls down in tears
Light of the night
The Earth
A purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always
While down
Below the trees
Bathed in a cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks down the night
And so
We pass on by
The crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel
The universe
What are you about
Say something secret
In an old order hush
Trouble and suffering in a lovely rhythm
A homespun clapboard blackstrap thrush
Devoted loyal
Undertake the toil
Beware of what come natural
Undertake the spoil
In a fist
It was cruel
And it came all too natural
As a younger child
A headstrong folklore strawrifle crutch
Thresh a crop defiles
In a fist full of sand
It came natural in a fist
Full of land

That's all we know
On hands and knees
Towards the shore
That's all we know
That's all we know
That's all
That's all we know
That's all
And he crawls
To the door
In the warm nurse
Where he walks
For the first time
Surrounded by dry clouds
He is leaving a trail
That's all we know
That's all
That's all we know
That's all
He climbs out of sleep
Holding on to the lamp
By his bedside table
The sunlight feeds
Of his radio
That's all we know
That's all
That's all we know
That's all
That's all we know
That's all
That's all we know
That's all
That's all we know
That's
All
She was just 19 years old
When she left her home
The morning desert sun was at her back
She knew right then
There would be no truning back
Leaving home was the best thought that she had
But now in a parking lot in Washington
She asked to herself what had she done
Earth Mother Bear and Eagle was on the run
Two more nights till Colorado
And the scene was done
And if flying back home
Was as easy as the run
She realized the there'd be no turning back
Where will you take me?
What will we do?
Where will you take me?
What will we do?
Then a man drove off in a bright white Cadillac
She got in that ride and she never came back
She knows what she needs
She said it feels so good to me
She knows what she needs
She said it feels so good to me
Ain't no turning back

I remember you
You're the one who made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago
I remember you
You're the one who said I love you too
Didn't you know
I remember too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain out of the blue
When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all
Then I will tell them I remember you
I remember you
You're the one who made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago
I remember you
You're the one who said I love you too
Didn't you know
I remember too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain out of the blue
I miss you darling
When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all
Then I will tell them I remember you
I was 22, alone with nothing to do and I couldn't sleep
'Cause all those cold days returned with their old ways of causing
New apathy
I live alone, I live alone
She was 21, wishing she lived by the sun, the sand and the sea
So I suggested she move out fast and not be the last
To leave and be free
I live alone, I live alone
I live alone, I live alone
Sweet summer day
I'm so afraid
So take me away
We were 17, longing to live in between
The earth and the stars
So I suggested we grow up fast and not be the last
But look where we are
With no connection I saw your reflection at home
In my bedroom mirror
And I felt young again when I saw what we could've been
In all of those years
I live alone, I live alone
I live alone, I live alone
Instrumental
You must be god embodied, stand tall.
Stand tall.
Nobody ever warns you
Or tells you what to do
She walks away
You're left to stay
Alone
Forever blue
The stars have all stopped shining
The sun just wont break through
Each day's the same
More clouds, more rain
You're left forever blue
Forever blue 'cause you love her
But she doesn't love you
You did your best
Life did the rest
You're left forever blue
No reason left for living
Still, there's a lot to do
Old songs to sing
New tears to cry
And feel forever blue
And be forever...
Blue
The first thing that happened was the river overflowed
The water running through the streets and was sweet and cold
I knelt by the water like a doe by a stream
Punch-drunk, snowblind, as though the whole thing were a bad dream
And then love pulled out the heavy artillery
Kypris took the horses by the bit for the morning ride
I count my blessings, but you can only be expected to count so high
When love cuts the strings
I smeared myself with pennyroyal to keep the hounds at bay
You poked your head out of an alley half a block away
And I recognized you, though I'm not sure how
And the air turned red around you
As a dull chill came down over me
And then love summoned up the infantry
And the green-eyed goddess got ready for all out war
And I'd count my blessings,
But I don't even know what the word blessing means
When love cuts the strings
Yeah!
Let me sail, let me sail, let the Orinoco flow
Let me reach, let me beach on the shores of Tripoli
Let me sail, let me sail, let me crash upon your shore
Let me reach, let me beach far beyond the Yellow Sea
(Sail away, sail away, sail away)
(Sail away, sail away, sail away)
(Sail away, sail away, sail away)
(Sail away, sail away, sail away)
From Bissau to Palau in the shade of Avalon
From Fiji to Tiree and the Isles of Ebony
From Peru to Cebu, feel the power of Babylon
From Bali to Cali, far beneath the Coral Sea
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieu, ooh
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieu, ooh
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieu, ah
(Sail away, sail away, sail away)
(Sail away, sail away, sail away)
(Sail away, sail away, sail away)
(Sail away, sail away, sail away)
From the North to the South, Ebud�� on to Khartoum
From the deep sea of Clouds to the island of the moon
Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never been
Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never seen
We can sail, we can sail with the Orinoco flow
We can sail, we can sail (sail away, sail away, sail away)
We can steer, we can near with Rob Dickins at the wheel
We can sigh, say goodbye, Ross and his dependencies
We can sail, we can sail (sail away, sail away, sail away)
We can reach, we can beach on the shores of Tripoli
We can sail, we can sail (sail away, sail away, sail away)
From Bali to Cali, far beneath the Coral Sea
We can sail, we can sail (sail away, sail away, sail away)
From Bissau to Palau in the shade of Avalon
We can sail, we can sail (sail away, sail away, sail away)
We can reach, we can beach far beyond the Yellow Sea
We can sail, we can sail (sail away, sail away, sail away)
From Peru to Cebu, feel the power of Babylon
We can sail, we can sail (sail away, sail away, sail away)
We can sail, we can sail (sail away, sail away, sail away)

She says, "Wake up, it's no use pretending"
I'll keep stealing, breathing her
Birds are leaving over autumn's ending
One of us will die inside these arms
Eyes wide open
Naked as we came
One will spread our
Ashes 'round the yard
She says, "If I leave before you, darling
Don't you waste me in the ground"
I lay smiling like our sleeping children
One of us will die inside these arms
Eyes wide open
Naked as we came
One will spread our
Ashes 'round the yard
How can I hope to reach your love
Help me to discover what it is you're thinking of
'Cause when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity inside your lovin' flame
What am I to do
If I don't have you?
I'll be feeling blue
Just sitting here without you
You could be the one to chase my blues away
Away
So tell me how, how to reach your love
Help me to discover what it is you're thinking of
'Cause when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity inside your lovin' flame
But what am I to do
If I don't have you
I'll be feeling blue
Just sitting here without you
You could be the one to chase my blues away
Away
'Cause when we kiss nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity inside your loving flame
So tell me how (tell me how)
How to reach your love (ooh yeah)
Help me to discover what it is you're thinking of, ooh
How can I hope to reach your love?
Here forever in your loving flame
If God don't make mistakes
Pulling the weeds from the ground
As they're growing up
And over the streets of the city
And I can't play it straight
'Cause I don't know if it matters
You try to stay calm
As they break your head all is silent
All the rain coming down
Little iron will
Pushing against the world
What you hope to gain
Is the same as what you're losing
Like a parasite
Living off somebody's life
All you take from someone else
Gives yourself away
You know it's taken a long time to realize
How much I love to be with you
Times are hard, spirits weak
Everything seems to be going wrong
Outlook's bleak
You know I fooled around playing the field
That's when I found that your love was real
No I haven't treated you so right
But I won't lose your love without a fight
I'm gonna hold on to the love we have togther
Hold on don't you say good-bye
Tell me now before we lose forever
Girl I don't want lose
Gotta have your sweet loving
'Cause without it girl I'll just lost my mind
The way you hold me
Comforts me and shows me
That a love like yours is hard to find
I need your loving every day and night
You're kinda lovin' makes me feel all right
I'm gonna hold on to the love we have togther
Hold on don't you say good-bye
Tell me now before we lose forever
Girl I don't want lose
Gotta have your sweet loving
'Cause without it girl I'll just lost my mind
The way you hold me
Comforts me and shows me
That a love like yours is hard to find
I need your loving every day and night
You're kinda lovin' makes me feel all right
Baby don't go
Baby don' go, not now
Baby don't go
I need you by my side girl
Baby don't go
I love you so
I don't want to lose you
You know it took me a long time
T finally realize
That a good thing is hard to find
That's why I'm standing right here
With you doday girl
I want to keep you
I've come to my senses
I don't wanna go anywhere
I'm coming home
I'm gonna hold on to the love we have togther
Hold on don't you say good-bye
Tell me now before we lose forever
Girl I don't want lose
Gotta have your sweet loving
'Cause without it girl I'll just lost my mind
The way you hold me
Comforts me and shows me
That a love like yours is hard to find
I need your loving every day and night
You're kinda lovin' makes me feel all right
It was all fake
A long and steep mistake
Like a dream from which we wake
With nothing in our plate
And no words while our worlds quake
Why do you come around my door?
I do not love you anymore
And all the rings, the wedding bells
I gave them all to someone else
It was all you
I never had a clue
Until you drifted from my view
Our happy storm is through
What's left rusts it's broke bust and bruised
Why do you leave notes at my door?
I do not love you anymore
The things you said I did so well
I did them all to someone else
And I know grace
I've seen it's ugly face
Hidden in a lonely place
With lonely gauze and lace
The old joy, the old coy embrace
Why do you dress up like a whore?
I do not love you anymore
And all the lies you said I told
I have none left to ease your load
You know damn well what is in store
I do not love you anymore
The world is growing loud
It's time for us to fade
To grey
I wish they'll let us stay
The lights are going out
We knew we had to go
One day
I wish they'll take us in
The skies are falling down
Too late for us to change
Our minds
I wish they'll keep us safe
The times are changing fast
We knew we wouldn't last
This long
I hope they'll keep the pace
The world is growing loud
It's time for us to fade
Away
I wish they'll let us stay
I remember when mom and dad named you Claire
Before you were born, before you had hair
You don't remember but I was there
I remember when you broke your arm
I know how you tell it
You get it all wrong
I loved you then and from now on
That was a long time ago
That was a long time ago
I remember when mom and dad brought you home
I was so used to bein' alone
And then I wasn't alone
There must be some reason for flesh and blood
Some other purpose for stayin' in touch
Oh we shared so much
I remember when mom and dad named you Claire
Before you were born, before you had hair
You don't remember but I was there
That was a long time ago
That was a long time ago
Instrumental
Wake Up
Instrumental
You've stolen my heart and I want you to remember
Now what'll I do? living alone
You've stolen my heart and it hurts me to remember
Now where'll I go to? living alone
And a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
It's dumb - I know what I want to say
But I can't even take one breath
As night falls I hear voices on the radio
(Ooh) I'll follow their dreams
And wake up alone
And a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
It's dumb - I know what I want to say
But I can't even take one breath
So now still burning silently away
A storm without the thunder
Times when I just can't
Bring myself to say it loud
'Fraid that what I'll say comes out somehow awry
That is when it seems
We move in circles day to day
Twist the drama of the play to get us by
And it feels like fear
Like I'll disappear
Gets so hard to steer
Yet I go on
Do we need debate
When it seems too late
Like I bleed but wait
Like nothing's wrong
You lift my spirit, take me higher, make me fly,
Touch the moon up in the sky, when you are mine
You lift me higher, take my spirit, make it fly,
Where all new wonders will appear
Like the other day
I thought you won't be coming back
I came to realize my lackluster dreams
And among the schemes
And all the tricks we try to play
Only dreams will hold their sway and defy
When it feels like fear
Like I'll disappear
Gets so hard to steer
Yet I go on
Do we need debate
When it seems too late
Like I bleed but wait
Like nothing's wrong
You lift my spirit, take me higher, make me fly,
Touch the moon up in the sky, when you are mine
You lift me higher, take my spirit, make it fly,
Where all new wonders will appear
You lift my spirit, take me higher, make me fly,
Touch the moon up in the sky, when you are mine
You lift me higher, take my spirit, make it fly,
Where all new wonders will appear
An hour ago I felt so low I almost drowned
Driving around this messed up town
It's pretty, it's only
I felt so lonely
And I knew all night
I'd never find a face 
That could understand
How much I miss you now
So I arrive at the conclusion
Love isn't made
Love doesn't sell or pay
But we buy and sell our love away
Escape to the water
And stare up at the stars and moon and sky
I was lying on my back with my fingers in the sand
Alone in Miami
It sounds so funny
And yet here I am
It's funny how life is seldom what you plan
And so I arrive at the conclusion
Love isn't made
Love doesn't sell or pay
But we buy and sell our love away
Don't let the panic bring you down!
Don't let the panic bring you down!
Don't let the panic bring you down!
Love isn't made
How could we have let this go?
How could we have almost lost it all?
Don't let the panic bring you down!
How had we forgotten...
Love isn't made
She took herself out in the car
She drove herself around the block
She said she's leaving me again
Then she got lost
I look for her out on the porch
I want to see her face once more
She said she's leaving me again
Then she got lost
She took the midnight train to nowhere
She said that she was leaving home
Yeah, she's leaving me tomorrow
But tomorrow never came for Jayne
I wait for her now and then
I hope to see her round the bend
She said she's leaving me again
Then she got lost
She took the midnight train to nowhere
She said that she was leaving home
Yeah, she's leaving me tomorrow
But tomorrow never came for Jayne
On my heart
The nights are drawing in
Above, the stars are spiralling
And Heaven, Earth are roaming in a spin
Memories of light and laughter
Hope and peace from far here after
Oh in heaven, wings of angels from a dream
On my heart
The nights are drawing in
Above, the stars are spiralling
And Heaven, Earth are roaming in a spin
Propeller seeds, corridor scene
Talk on, walk out
It took me a minute,
My mind was on other things
Oh, but you got me at "Paris"
I must be coming down with
Something to be thinking this
What's happening here?
I'm growing roots through my toes!
And leaves from my fingertips, unfurl.
Where does this story go?
(Queue, food, drink up, continue)
We float in tandem,
Past name tags and shaking hands
Immune to the hubbub of others.
We're deep in discussion
The party's on mute.
Our bubble's got it covered.
You want me? Well, you've got me.
It doesn't have to be today.
I can't believe I said that out loud.
What's happening here?
I'm growing roots through my toes
And there are leaves from my fingertips, unfurling.
What does this story know?
Wedding rings and children
Are all the good ones taken?
Rickshaw, disco, goodnight kiss
Oh, cold shower
Calm me for sweet dreams of him
Where does this story go?
What does this story know?
What does this story hold
...For us?
She's a secretary in the daytime
A modern Venus on the 8th floor
She's a secretary in the daytime
A bright young thing
With a promising career
She's got the abilities
She's got the facilities
She's got the abilities
She's got the facilities
She's a secretary in the daytime
A model beauty
At the typewriter
She's a secretary in the daytime
A smile for boss
And she's doing fine
She's got the abilities
She's got the facilities
She's got the abilities
She's got the facilities
She's a secretary in the daytime
She's a secretary in the daytime
She makes herself a drink and she climbs into bed,
The sheets so clean and cool,
It's so nice to rest her aching head,
She thinks back on her working day,
Her boss; the silly things he says,
She smiles, she shuts her eyes,
And she's dreaming of Terry, a mechanic,
Sometimes working 8 till 10,
It's so rare she ever sees him,
And she wants so much to see him again,
He bought her a ring and the flowers on her bedside table,
And she knows that she loves him, but does he love her?
She kisses the photo on the wall beside her bed,
And tries to hold back a silly tear.
She's a working girl now, and Mummy lives so far away,
So She bites her lip,
She knows that Terry will be calling soon one day.
I look at the clock and I'm feeling the rhythm of love
(It's going through me)
I look at the light and it sends a lonely shiver down my spine
(It gets right to me)
I'm thinking of you in some-one else's arms,
I'm thinking of you in some-one else's eyes,
You're everything I like and everything I despise.
(Why don't you leave me?)
Running my fingers through your hair,
Running your fingers down the back of my neck.
Playing your games with your innocent eyes,
I try hard to smile through all of your lies,
That start to hurt me, hurt me

It said that she was just a normal girl, (It's like a dream)
They also felt she was a human being (like a dream)

Shhhhhhh, Goodnight
There's something everybody knows
There's one place everybody goes
I've got this notion that it isn't what it seems
That I've been living in a dream
Draw me a picture
Draw it in color
'Cause I wanna see my life
Through someone else's eyes
Beautiful shadows in my mind
They're all that's left of your design
Scattered all over like the sun in our room
Crawling all over like June bugs in June
Draw me a picture
Draw it in color
'Cause I wanna see my life
Through someone else's eyes
I'll find my way again I guess
I never thought that I could make such a mess
I got this feeling that it's gonna be alright
And I'll begin again tonight
Draw me a picture
'Cause I wanna see my life
Through someone else's eyes
Draw me a picture
Draw it in color
'Cause I wanna see my life
Through someone else's eyes
You're no poem, 
Once you open your mouth.
I never like what you say. 
A carnation, 
To cover your lips. 
When you speak I fall away. 
The exceptions, 
Are few in between.
I spend time just trying to forget, 
Away, away, will you fall away. 
Let's pretend that we never met. 
Keep yourself within yourself. 
For all that you say it never gets better. 
In yourself within yourself. 
If I was you I wouldn't talk, I'd just keep dancing.
If all your moves were words, 
And backsteps were things you've denied, 
You've said, that's right, your dead. 
I'm dumb, but not deaf and blind. 
Keep yourself within yourself, 
For all that you say it never gets better. 
In yourself within yourself, 
If I was you I wouldn't talk, I'd just keep dancing.
Keep yourself within yourself, 
For all that you say it never gets better. 
In yourself within yourself, 
If I was you I wouldn't talk, I'd just keep dancing.
Keep dancing ...
In order to see it
You've got to believe it
I do.
You said to try patience
I know that I'm ready
I'm waiting for you
You're with them
Can't you tell?
You're like me
I'm too late
You've got her
It's not enough. It's not enough
I'm not enough I'm not enough
In order to see it
You've got to believe it
I want this
You've got to have no credit cards
To know how good it feels
The howling of the bridges
The sidewalks bound with steel
Sitting on the sidewalk
With a party to arrange
May you never change
I stay out when I want to
Still she takes me back
Don't know another girl
Would cut me so much slack
Every wounded soldier
Needs a lady with a light
To help him through the night
So blow a kiss to Radio City
My forever silhouette
Oh, you are so pretty
My beautiful Rockette
You've got my arms
And the crosstown horns
Going on - we've got it going on
Have I got you a river view
This one tops the list
Got a head full of you
And Irish Mist
I know I owe it
To the lady by the sea
Who still looks out for me
So blow a kiss to Radio City
My forever silhouette
Oh, you are so pretty
My beautiful Rockette
You've got my arms
And the crosstown horns
Going on - we've got it going on
You've got my arms
And the crosstown horns
Going on - we've got it going on
We've got it going on
Belinda was mine till the time that I found her
Holding Jim
Loving him
Sue came along loved me strong that what I thought
Me and Sue
That died too
Don't know if I will but until I can find me
Girl who will stay and won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
Solitary man
Solitary man
I had it to here being where love's a small word
Paper ring
Part-time thing
I know it's been done having one girl who loves you
Right or wrong
Weak or strong
Don't know if I will but until I can find me
Girl who will stay and won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
Solitary man
Solitary man
Don't know if I will but until I can find me
Girl who will stay and won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
Solitary man
Solitary man
Solitary man
I know it doesn't seem that way
But maybe it's the perfect day
Even though the bills are piling
Maybe Lady Luck ain't smiling
But if we only open our eyes
We'd see the blessings in disguise
That all the rain clouds are fountains
Though our troubles seem like mountains
There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start
Every now and then life says:
Where do you think you're going so fast?
We're apt to think it's cruel, but sometimes
It's a case of cruel to be kind
And if we get up off our knees
Why then we'd see the forest for the trees
And we'd see the new sun rising
Over the hills and horizon
There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose faith
Give the world a chance to say:
A word or two, my friend
There's no telling how the day might end
We'll never know until we see
That there's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to start
There's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills

Soon, love, soon
Soon, love, soon
Soon, love, soon
There'll be a fire burning in the temple of our peace
Soon, love, soon
There'll be a soaring voice for our silent pleas
Soon, love, soon
We will hold our broken circle and begin to pray
Soon, love, soon
We will find a black and white in the gray
And we will be as one god
And we will be as one people
(x3)
Soon, love, soon
We will find illumination in unnatural light
Soon, love, soon
You will travel a thousand miles without leaving my sight
Soon, love, soon
We will find we never knew hatred ran so deep
Soon, love, soon
Such a wide, wide chasm of faith to leap
But we will be as one god
And we will be as one people
(x3)
Soon, love, soon
There will be an evolution of the human soul
Soon, love, soon
We will know that be a part is to be truly whole
Soon, love, soon
We will know the pattern of centuries rise and fall
Soon, love, soon
We will know that the fate of one is the fate of all
And we will be as one god
And we will be as one people

All that's real to me, 
Is Marilyn and Jesus. 
Jumping off'a bridges, 
Sparklers and streamers.
Honey, I wanna fly, 
I wanna fly, I wanna fly. 
All that's real to me, 
Is Halloween and Jesus, 
Coney Island beaches, 
Chandeliers and seizures.
Honey, I wanna fly, 
I wanna fly, I wanna fly. 
I can't be with the man I love, 
I can't be if he treats me rough. 
I can't see him, I can't call him up. 
All that's real to me, 
Is trailer parks and beaches, 
Alabama freezes, 
Platinum impeaches.
Honey, I wanna fly, 
I wanna fly, I wanna fly. 
All that's real to me, 
Is Halloween and Jesus, 
Coney Island beaches, 
Chandeliers and seizures.
Honey, I wanna fly, 
I wanna fly, I wanna fly.
I can't be with the man I love, 
I can't be if he treats me rough. 
I can't see him, I can't call him up.
All that's real to me, 
Is Marilyn and Jesus. 
Jumping off'a bridges, 
Sparklers and streamers.
I can't be with the man I love, 
I can't be if he treats me rough. 
I can't see him, I can't call him up.
Cool water washing over land
Wash away, wash away
Clues of fingerprints, forensic traces
Footsteps on the ocean bed
Walk away, walk way
Sky scraping on backs of mantaray
There are more stars in the sky,
Than grains of sand
Oh cool water washing over me
Wash away, wash away
Clues of fingerprints, forensic traces
Footsteps on the ocean bed
Walk away
There are more stars in the sky,
Than grains of sand
A ghost of a roar, from the dry floor
A ghost of a roar, from the sea shore
From the sea, the sea of tranquility
From the sea, from the sea
Walk away, walk away
From the sea, from the sea
I started up my hollow
Piece of wood to follow
A day that doesn't come to the lucky
And I realize there's tomorrow
But I would rather wallow
In the rain than moods that seem so potlucky
Well I'm cruisin' El Paseo
In my off-white coupe back '65
Oh I'm cruisin' down my own street
And my hoopty says to me
"You better hang on to your benchseat
I'm gonna take you for a ride."
And I'll let you know
When it comes, when it comes
I'll let you know
But don't stay up for me
Don't wait up for me if I'm not home, yeah
So wait for fate to find me
A ball of string unwind me
Uncomfortable as a centerfold, yeah
And I realize you're behind me
To help and humankind me
To see my songs can be retold
Well, I'll be gone tomorrow
Yes, I'm on the road tomorrow
So, next time that I see you in school
It won't be for too long
And I'll let you know
When it comes, when it comes
I'll let you know
But don't stay up for me
Don't wait up for me if I'm not home, yeah
And I want a leather jacket
But only if I have the time
Well I'll comb my hair like Elvis
And grab an Old Crash '59
And you'd hardly recognize me
If you saw me from behind
And I'll let you know
When it comes, when it comes
I'll let you know (I'll let you know)
And I'll let you know, yeah
When it comes, just when it comes
I'll let you know (I'll let you know)
But don't stay up for me
Don't wait up for me if I'm not home, yeah
And I'll let you know, yeah
I'll let you know, yeah
But I'll let you know
I see raincoats and newspapers
Cowboy boots
And reflected
In a window on a train
I see you
Again
Very brief in the night
Between the stations
A passing town
Was illuminating a face
I saw you
Again
I met him at a party and he told me how to drive him home
He said he liked to do it backwards and I said that's just fine with me
That way we can fuck and watch TV
It was 4 am and the light was grey like it always is in paperbacks
He asked if I liked playing jacks
I told him that I was good to sixes but all hell brook loose after that
I told him that I knew Julia Roberts when I was 12 at summer camp
We didn't say anything after that
I dropped him off and drove on home 
'Cause secretly I'm timid
Yeah, it's gettin wild out here
It makes me wonder how a black man could ever raise a child out here
You know we all crumb snatchers in this land of big cake
So why we killin for the crumbs when there's so much at stake?
We no longer supposed to be slaves
I bet Harriet Tubman would be turnin in her grave
Like remind my soul (remind my soul)
Of the time we were great before the self hate
My elders all feel the same, there's no bravery
You supposed to fight for freedom not just the end of slavery
Are we too selfish to even bless the kids with jewels?
So our youth don't get played out for fools
Or will they get programmed how to behave?
Malcolm X must be turnin in his grave
Like remind my soul (remind my soul)
Of the time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great
Wait, we still great but
Yeah
I met up with this dread, said "Peace, respect"
He said, "respect me, not seen that around here yet,
black man kill himself for limited amount of wealth
and him disrespectin women so him disrespect himself"
I agree with what the dread had to get off of his chest
Bob Marley would be disturbed from his rest
Like remind my soul
Of the time we were great before the self hate
Can't work a dead end nine-to-five, for what?
To be another victim of social security cuts?
I gotta cut myself from the chains and run free (yeah)
Empower myself and be my own authority
People die so I don't have to be a runaway slave
Nat Turner must be turnin in his grave
Like remind my soul (remind my soul, yeah)
Of the time we were great before the self hate (yeah)
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great
Wait, we still great but, but
The time we were great before the self hate
We're taught to worship these rappers and athletes and actors
Many who think they better and they'll walk right past ya
It's what you do off camera and off the court
That really makes you worthy of the peoples support
But some brothers get those millions and forget how to behave
Arther Ashe must be turnin in his grave
Like remind my soul (remind my soul)
Of the time we were great before the self hate
We crabs in a barrel, you ain't gettin out until I do first
And that's why the guns burst
Whatever happened to strength in numbers? (uh)
Some of the greatest minds on the planet are among us
But so many start off strugglin and never get saved
Man, Martin must be turnin in his grave
Like remind my soul (remind my soul)
Of the time we were great before the self hate (yeah)
The time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate (let's bring it back, y'all)
The time we were great before the self hate (let's bring it back)
The time we were great
Remind my soul (uh)
We were great before the self hate
Yo, yeah
Yeah, c'mon
The time we were great before the self hate
Anna Rose sleep well tonight
The stars are dancing on the carpet of the sky
Time to close your wondering eyes
Where I see the sleepiness creeping
Anna Rose it makes my heart smile
To know you give love so freely
Anna Rose it makes it worthwhile
Your love makes me see things so clearly
How it grows heaven knows
Anna Rose sleep well tonight
Anna Rose it's time to dream
I see that your imagination knows no bounds
There it flows like some magical stream
And carries you on its journey
Anna Rose it makes my heart smile
To know you give love so freely
Anna Rose it makes it worthwhile
Your love makes me see things so clearly
How it grows heaven knows
Anna Rose dream well tonight
Broke the ring around it
I can't think about it
I can barely start to even wrap my head around it
Waters rise around us
Sinking ships around us
I can't believe she even found a way inside to drown us
I'm not so sure anymore what's next
Or if there's anything left for us
What will we find inside of the wreck
Yeah we both know it's all just washed away
Where do you go and what do you do
All you have left is hanging on you
Where do you go and what do you do
When you lose everything you ever knew
Shine a light into it
Shoot a canon through it
Spill it all and hope you find a way to make it through it
'Cause down is up and up is down
And love lies dying all on the ground
You find a line that's in the sand and figure out who drew it
I'm not so sure anymore what's next
Or if there's anything left for us
What will we find inside of the wreck
Yeah we both know it's all just washed away
Where do you go and what do you do
All you have left is hanging on you
Where do you go and what do you do
When you lose everything you ever knew
Broke the ring around it
I can't think about it
I can barely start to even wrap my head around it
'Cause down is up and up is down
And love lies dying all on the ground
You find a line that's in the sand and figure out who drew it
Where do you go and what do you do
All you have left is hanging on you
Where do you go and what do you do
When you lose everything you ever knew
Where do you go and what do you do
All you have left is hanging on you
Where do you go and what do you do
When you lose everything
As you walked away
A strand of hair came undone
And was reflected in the sun
And everything was orange
As you disappeared
The shadow of death came undone
And was reflected in the sun
And everything was orange
They have begun to celebrate
The tidal wave they think is great
The ever-beating heart that it wasn't
They have begun
They have begun
They have begun
To assassinate the sun
As you died in the night
A million stars formed into one
And became another sun
And everything was orange
And now this horrible machine
Churns out pain instead of love
And looks just like the sun
And everything was orange
They have begun
They have begun
They have begun
To assassinate the sun
What did you think I'd find?
I'll keep on trying to change your mind.
Hug, hug, hug me and kiss, kiss, kiss me.
Tell me, tell me, tell me you'll miss, miss, miss me.
What did you think I'd do?
The ch-ch-changes you put me through.
The sun shines brightly every day I'm without you but I love, love, love you like the way that I used to do.
I remember all the summer days
Drinking wine in the sunshine
I hope it never leaves
And I remember all the summer nights
Staring at you in the moonlight
I hope you never leave
Cause baby you're so good to me
You have all that I ever need
It's easy to love you
So easy to love you
You know it's true
The best part of being with you
To know you're with me
It's not so hard to say
It's easy to love you
I remember all those winter days
Frozen in the cold tryin' to get you home
Should I be moving in?
We can be together then
Remember spending all those winter nights
Stayin' inside by the warm fire
Ya you gotta know, I can never let you go
You and I have the rest of our lives to see
It's easy to love you
So easy to love you
You know it's true
The best part of being with you
To know you're with me
It's not so hard to say
It's easy to love you
Can anybody else see it?
Oh, can anybody else see what I do?
Can anybody else feel it?
Oh, can anybody else feel the way I do?
When I'm with you
Hard to forget all the moments when
We'd be sitting there hoping it would never end
Cause this is meant to be
So baby, will you marry me?
It's easy to love you
So easy to love you
You know it's true
The best part of being with you
To know you're with me
It's not so hard to say
It's easy to love you
You and me will be together
I know our love will last forever
(So easy to love you)
You and me will be together
I know our love will last forever
You know it's true
The best part of being with you
You're easy to love

Ihmisella koti
Talossa ovi
Pihassa tie,
Kauas se vie
Kylassa katu
Kadulla suunta
Maailmalla raja
Rajalla reuna.
Kohta on hyvin, kohta on hyvin.
Ovi on raskas avata
Suljen sen, suljen sen
Tiedan mita on oven takana,
Sen lukitsen,
Pois kuljen.
Merella ranta
Maalla pinta

Muistojen hinta
Tahdilla maara
Avaruudella aika
Minulla paikka, jossain muualla.
Kohta on hyvin, kohta on hyvin.
Nyt ovi on raskas avata
Suljen sen, suljen sen
Tiedan mita on oven takana,
Sen lukitsen,
Pois kuljen.
Olenko kotona
Olenko kotona
Olenko kotona
Vai oven takanako vain?
You were born with a heart that can never be filled
And a head like snow that can never be still
There are streets paved in gold that shine so bright
But you force yourself to look away
If we can't see now we might never see
We only kill ourselves more slowly
If you can't find love then you will finally see
How we kill ourselves slowly
The words that fall from your mouth
They crystallize and break on the ground
And everything you want you don't have
But you force yourself to look away
If we can't see now we might never see
We only kill ourselves more slowly
If you can't find love then you will finally see
How we kill ourselves... slowly
If you can't find me
Then you can't find love
If you close your eyes
Then you will finally see
That you're already here with me
We run along easy at periscope depth
Sun dappling through clear water
So went the dream of the drowned submariner
Far away from the slaughter
Your hair is a strawflower that sings in the sun
My darling, my beautiful daughter
So went the dream of the drowned submariner
Cast away on the water
From down in the vault, down in the grave
Reaching up to the light on the waves
So she did run to him over the grass
She fell in his arms and he caught her
So went the dream of the drowned submariner
Far away on the water
Far away on the water
Honestly, can I say what I mean
Don't you play with me
'Cause I'm a lady
When I look in your eyes
I can see through your charm
You're constantly twisted
I'm angry, alarmed
Your poison has taken control of my soul
But I'm onto you, boy
And I won't take no more
Sometimes I wonder where this feeling began
Deep in my heart right from the start
Tired and lonely I moved on from this pain
I'm starting again,
I'm breaking the chain
Emotionally, it takes all of me
Apologies, but you don't really have a hold on me
There's a distance between us
And you take the blame
I know that you try but
At the stage of the game
I've started a new life
There's no turning back
With you now, don't you know, can't you see I got over *you...*
Sometimes I wonder where this feeling began
Deep in my heart right from the start *right from the start*
Tired and lonely I'll move on from this pain
I'm starting again I'm breaking the chain
Had to take matters into my own hands
Falling this deep wasn't part of my plans
If turning this around is what I have to do
To get through to you
My fire's burnt out it's true
Sometimes I wonder where this feeling began
Deep in my heart right from the start
Tired and lonely I'll move on from this pain
I'm starting again I'm breaking the chain
On and on, I walk along
I wait for you at the end
I say what's wrong and all along
I wait for you at the end
I don't really mind
All of this wasted time
I don't really mind
All of this wasted time
Just wish that I had something to show for it
On my mind, all of the time
I wait for you at the end
I don't have a real reason why
I wait for you at the end
I don't really mind
All of this wasted time
I don't really mind
All of this wasted time
Just wish that I had something to show for it
Just wish that I had something to show for it
I don't really mind
All of this wasted time
I don't really mind
All of this wasted time
Just wish that I had something to show for it
Just wish that I had something to show for it
Just wish that I had something to show for it
Just wish that I had something to show for it
Here come the darkest birds
To burst the bubble
End of a perfect day
Head full of trouble
Here come the darkest birds
All tar and feathers
Why did none of them dream of trying
To make things better?
Those are the mimicking kind
They are, they are
I number myself among them
The furthest star
And this is the road I walked on
When I shot you down
All words of forgiveness useless
They won't help me now
And I should've been there for you
When you called my name
I promise to tread more lightly
Though what's gone is gone
It's such a shame
Here come the darkest birds
They've got their reasons
All their pretty colours are gone
Washed out of season
Those are the soaring kind
They are, they are
I number yourself among them
The brightest star
And this is the road I walked on
When I shot you down
All words of forgiveness useless
They won't serve me now
And I should've been there for you
When you called my name
I promise to tread more lightly
Though what's done is done
It's such a shame
Viewed from the spire
It looks more like a coincidence to me
Another bomb in the harbour
But you were there
The place was all crowded but
No one crosses the street that way
It was such a lunatic thing to do
Broken glass was all over
I heard the sirens
Her name on the radio
Should have known there was no escape
They haven't found him
They say it wasn't professional this time
Just a bomb in the harbour
A love affair
Her room mate won't listen but I -
No one crosses the street that way
She says
No, no. How would I know?
Cause you didn't know her
I heard the sirens
And just suddenly I thought
No one's gonna say it did not take place
I've got my things
I'm good to go
You met me at the terminal
Just one more plane ride and it's done
We stood like statues at the gate
Vacation's come and gone too late
There's so much sun where I'm from
I had to give it away
Had to give you away
And we spent four days on an island
At your family's old hotel
Sometimes perfection can be
It can be perfect hell, perfect...
Hours pass and she still counts the minutes
That I am not there
I swear I didn't mean for it to feel like this
Like every inch of me is bruised, bruised
And don't fly fast
Oh pilot, can you help me?
Can you make this last?
This plane is all I got so keep it steady now
Cause every inch you see is bruised
I lace my chucks, I walk the aisle
I take my pills, the babies cry
All I hear is what's playing through the in flight radio
Now every word of every song
I ever heard that made me want to stay
It's what's playing through the in flight radio
And I, And I am finally waking up
Hours pass and she still counts the minutes
That I am not there
I swear I didn't mean for it to feel like this
Like every inch of me is bruised, bruised
Don't fly fast
Oh pilot, can you help me?
Can you make this last?
This plane is all I got so keep it steady now
Cause every inch you see is bruised, yeah
So read your books and stay out late some nights, some nights
And don't think that you can't stop by the bar
You haven't shown your face here since the bad news
Well I'm here till close with fingers crossed
Each night cause your place isn't far
And hours pass, hours pass, yeah, yeah
She still counts the minutes that I am not there
I swear I didn't mean for it to feel like this
Like every inch of me is bruised, bruised
And don't fly fast
Oh pilot, can you help me?
Can you make this last?
This plane is all I got so keep it steady now
Cause every inch you see is bruised, is bruised...
Oven avaimenreiasta
naen huoneeseeni, seinalla on hakki
Samettikankaan alle jatetty mustalle linnulle
hakki, se tyhja on, vartijaton
Minako siella?
Usko, toivo, kuolema
vahvin loytyi lopulta
musta lintu on vapaana
vapaana kuin vartija
Joku taloon kadonnut on joka ikkunan lukinnut
Vain laudalla siivekas siluetti
Ja kun se siipiaan levittaa, kohti
minua kaantaa paan
noudatan suurta varoa tai hamarassa
huoneessa on pian kaksi lintua
Minako siella?
Usko, toivo, kuolema
vahvin loytyi lopulta
musta lintu on vapaana
vapaana kuin vartija
Myos unen ja rakkauden,
vahvan viiden veljeksen,
mustan linnun luokse jaan
huoneeseeni lentamaan
Ovi on parempi avata jotta karkaa vartija
Maailmassa on lukossa aivan liikaa ovia
Enempaa ei kaivata, vain ne jotka ovat lopulta
siina viimeisessa muurissa,
siina viimeisessa lukossa
Usko, toivo, kuolema
vahvin loytyi lopulta
musta lintu on vapaana
vapaana kuin vartija
Myos unen ja rakkauden,
vahvan viiden veljeksen,
mustan linnun luokse jaan
huoneeseeni lentamaan
Autumn leaves
Beauty's got a hold on me
Autumn leaves
Pretty as can be
Everybody knows this time
Shadows are drifting in silence
Where lost can't be found
Everybody knows this time
You'll get by
Move it on and let fate decide
And those water-coloured memories
Soft as a summer's breeze
You're as pretty as can be
Knowing now you'll never fake it
Whether my oceans divide
I'll try to understand this
But everybody knows this time
Autumn leaves
Beauty's got a hold on me
Autumn leaves
Pretty as can be
Everyone can see
Everyone except me
Autumn leaves
Beauty's got a hold on me
Autumn leaves
Pretty as can be
Pretty as can be
I don't want to change your mind
I don't want to think about your mind
They say love is blind
I don't think you're blind
You don't want to understand
I don't want to shake your father's hand
And walk in the sand
And act like a man
I get on the bus
Ride past our stop
And though I'm late
I can't get off
I just can't bare to tell you some lies
So narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
We'll take back everything we've said
Spilt up all the things and move ahead
Forgot how you said
We'll split the side off the bed
I get on my bike
Ride down our block
Ride through the world
Through the green lights
But when I think of all your advice
I narrow my eyes
Narrow my eyes
I don't want to change your mind
I don't want to think about your mind
They say love is blind
I don't think you're blind
I get on the bus
Ride past our stop
And though I'm late
I can't get off
I just can't bare to tell you some lies
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Now let's toast the sad cold fact
Our love's never coming back
And we'll race to the bottom of the glass
So narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
I don't know why this took so long. It wasn't hard for me to see. It wasn't that I dind't notice. It was just hard to believe
But this is what you did. What you did to me
You put resin on my heartstrings. You make 'em sing. You put resin on my heartstrings. Make 'em sing
And it's about time that I told you everything. You put resin on my heartstrings. You make 'em sing
I guess all good things have to end. All things will never be the same. I just wanted you to know. To know that doesn't change a thing.
This is what you did. What you did to me
You put resin on my heartstrings. You make 'em sing. You put resin on my heartstrings. Make 'em sing
And it's about time that I told you everything. You put resin on my heartstrings. You make 'em sing
There's nothing left to say. Our skies began to fade. This is what you did. What you did to me
You put resin on my heartstrings. You make 'em sing. You put resin on my heartstrings. Make 'em sing
And it's about time that I told you everything. You put resin on my heartstrings. You make 'em sing
Text me but you need a call
I text you back but what is that?
You text me back but hold on
I'm about to relay what's going on
Text me but you missed the call
I call you back but why is that?
You call me back but hold on
I had a bud of mine, I say what's going on
The volume's turned up too loud but we don't cover our ears
Because they're already numb from damage already done
And then the temperature goes from unbelievably high
To let the temperature from the very heart of the sun
The volume's turned up too loud but we don't cover our ears
Because they're already numb from damage already done
And then the temperature goes from unbelievably high
To let the temperature from the very heart of the sun
You call me to play me the sound
I text you back but where is that?
You call me back but hold on
I'll put the phone right up to the PA
The speaker's distorted through the phone
You call me back but why is that?
I call you back but what's that?
I can't hear a single word you say
The day is turning to night
I'll never forget what you said
I text you again, again
You need to send it to me again
The volume's turned up too loud but we don't cover our ears
Because they're already numb from damage already done
And then the temperature goes from unbelievably high
To let the temperature from the very heart of the sun
The volume's turned up too loud but we don't cover our ears
Because they're already numb from damage already done
And then the temperature goes from unbelievably high
To let the temperature from the very heart of the sun
Text me but you need a call
The volume's turned up too loud but we don't cover our ears
Because they're already numb from damage already done

To let the temperature from the very heart of the sun
The volume's turned up too loud but we don't cover our ears
Because they're already numb from damage already done
And then the temperature goes from unbelievably high
To let the temperature from the very heart of the sun

No good man
Loving on a no good plan never treats me as he should
And that ain't good he's always bringing me down
He's no saint Heaven knows that's what he ain't
Spends his money foolishly and not on me
I'm the one who gets the run around
I ought to hate him but still I love him so
'Cause I require love that's made of fire
And in his arms I find always get that kind
No good man
Ever since the world began tere's been other folks like me
Born to be in love with a no good man
I ought to hate him but still I love him so
'Cause you see I require love that's made of fire
And in his arms I find always get that kind
No good man
Ever since the world began tere's been other folks like me
Born to be in love with a no good man
Cover your mouth
The wolves at the door can hear you now
And I think I see eyes beneath your couch
So
There's knives in the kitchen
They're stuck in the walls, go pull them down
We can still close our eyes if this goes south
Go say your prayers now
There's cracks in the mirrors
Your secrets are spilling from your mouth
But there's no going back from this point now
So
The wallpaper's peeling
I see your breath in the air, it's shaped like words
And the blood in your eyes is shining
Your fingernails drag across the walls as you unlock the door
And now the wolves are shaped like people
Their eyelids are all fluttering
Their hands are never steady
And the rainclouds leak in through the chimney
They're crawling up my back
I can't stop laughing, can't stop laughing
The wolves all dance across the ceiling
But the rhythm of their steps is like a heartbeat
Like a drumbeat
And I'm backing through the open doorway
This place is not for me
It's not my hell
I didn't paint it
So
It's written on the back of your hand
You know, you know
You've gotta pay for all the things you've ever thought
These bones are all you own
You've gotta pay for all the things you've ever lost
And then some
Now my head's come off
And all I know is spilling out into the ground
I'm watching it grow
All these vines will choke me
But I have to grin
It's a fitting end for where this began
I woke through clouds of syrup
And the world looked fine
Bad dreams are nothing special
They happen all the time
At least I think so
Instrumental
This old mountain side
Where we used to reside
Is slowly recalling
The things we discovered inside
Oh the crystal caves
We shed both our jackets
And I hammered brackets
From old metal chairs
To the walls, a crude set of stairs
To lead us down
And you tied a rope
To the steepening slope
A jerry rigged harness
So we could descend in the dark
But the tide came in
And we found ourselves in the sea
Deep under water
We both found that we could still breathe
So we spent the day submerged
And we swam the evening away
The water was clear
Like the pure atmosphere
As we kicked and fluttered
Through caverns all cluttered with age
In the afterglow
We swim hand and hand
Over white satin sand
And you left a ribbon
To honor the pale gibbon moon
But that was years ago
And we never came up for air
Down there
We can go anywhere
The old world was dying
While we took our flying
Like peregrine falcons
Beneath the transparent blue waves
Far below the surf
And we spent the hours
With submarine flowers
I knew I'd remember
That day in November
As we
Felt alive again
'Cause we found ourselves in the sea
Deep underwater
We both found that we could still breathe
So we spent the day submerged
And we swam the evening away
We swam the evening away
We lived our little drama
We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night
I can't forget the glamour
Your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night
I never planned in my imagination
A situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me
My heart beat like a hammer
My Arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night
Catch your breath,
Paddle to the shore,
Let the sun set,
She won't see him no more,
Asleep in the archways,
With wise men and tramps,
Thinking about letters, lights and lamps.
If you turn back the clocks, 
You'll fall asleep in the oceans.
Catch your breath,
Paddle to the shore,
Let the sun set,
She won't see him no more,
Asleep in the archways,
With wise men and tramps,
Thinking about letters, lights and lamps.
And turn back the clocks, 
Before this sleep in the oceans.
But it's gone just for a minute,
And I was away just for a minute,
The stars exploded,
Man you should've seen it.
Mrs. Collins wept
Mrs. Collins moaned
To see her son Louis leaving home
The angels laid him away
The angels laid him away
Laid him six feet under the clay
The angels laid him away
Mrs. Collins wept
Mrs. Collins moaned
To see her son louis leaving home
The angels laid him away
The angels laid him away
Laid him six feet under the clay
The angels laid him away
Oh Bob shot once
Louis shot two
Shot poor Collins
Shot him through and through
The angels laid him away
The angels laid him away
Laid him six feet under the clay
The angels laid him away
Oh kind friends
Oh ain't it hard
To see poor Louis in a new graveyard
The angels laid him away
The angels laid him away
Laid him six feet under the clay
The angels laid him away
Mrs. Collins wept
Mrs. Collins moaned
To see her son louis leaving home
The angels laid him away
The angels laid him away
Laid him six feet under the clay
The angels laid him away
The empty streets
The songs of twilight
The clouds at rest
The churchbells chiming
A scarecrow shudders
And some birds tremble
I looked at you and saw it's time
The faded flowers
The faded pictures
Of faded lives
Your body waiting
And unfulfilled
With no regrets
And empty heart
And head in hands
I heard them say today it's time
The sunset heavy
On mother mountain
The cattle lowing
The cattle dreaming
The endless rain
In haunted airs
Your loss of hope
We were shown
We were shown it's only time
The smell of rain
The twilight leaning
Against your lips
Waterwheels turning
The forests brooding
You took my hand
And pointed full of pain
That fishes dying
You see the sign that this was time
I waited years for you
Or so it seemed
And stumbled through your world
Praying for just one kiss
To stop my fall from grace
And shelter in your palm
You gave me everything
Both lock and key
The oilclouds see it's only time
If I could have one wish
As in the fairytales
I would unmake my past
And rise like Lazarus
And stand in sunlight
And banish all the dark
That locked my face away
And say to you again
Oh that
That was only time
So willow weep not for me
And oak bend not for me
Though others died for us
And in our place
Though in the secret heart
Raw wound, raw source of all
I heard the news today
Whispered in the dark
At last
At last we know it's time
I knew at last it's only time
I'll come in glory
End of story
It's time to follow the black path
And come tomorrow you won't laugh alone
Faced down you can see the ground turn
From green and red, black to grey
Where everyone becomes afraid of you
To find your journey on the black path
The darkest Sunday from your own past
Right now, I can see the ground turn
From green and red, black to grey
Where everyone becomes afraid of you
If you're the one
If you're the one
If you're the one
If you're the one
If you're the one
If you're the one
If you're the one
See how lifeless life can be
See how lifeless life can be
See how lifeless life can be
See how lifeless life can be
Instrumental
To the bar where I wish
That I could end this
Start
Here with all my vices I
Fall in the jar and it
Seems I am in this
Path
In between disguises I
To the bar and I lose
Me in my pictures
Half
Head in two devices I
Pause when they come in a
Million different pieces
Darts
Wearing different sizes
2x
I dreamt I was a letter
Telling stories from the bar
Sailing a canoe to where
The wild things are
To the start where I know
I'll never end this
Path
Here with all my vices I
Laugh as they drum to the
Sound of monkey voices
Past
Where I left my toysingers
Climb the mast, 'cause I know
That I can win this
Blast
Almost scratching heaven I
2x
I dreamt I was a letter
Telling stories from the bar
Sailing a canoe to where
The wild things are
4x
I dreamt I was a letter
Telling stories from the bar
Sailing a canoe to where
The wild things are
2x
To the barge that is waiting
For my choices
Fast
Run to kubla promises
Wear feline masks, we'll go
Sailing through the moons eye
Glass
Love will rule my left hand sky
Let's all just relax
And get into this groove
The room's starting to move
Now turn the red lights on
You know the kind that I like
Deep blues and reds
With purple highlights
But don't forget my Oohhs
And fade in my Ahhs
Fade out the parades
And the charades
Making music like love is made
And lovers wait patiently
And with joy
For the right moment
To explor in passion
Why everlasting love is everlasting
But don't forget my Oohhs
And fade in my Ahhs
Ther's no need to argue for better position
Realize the moment that you're in is magic
Stellare regions cry everything has its season
Everything happens for a reason
So who are we to worry at any rate
The plane that crashed
We missed 'cause we were running late
And if success eludes you
Then you must choose to do
What other people wouldn't do
But don't forget my Oohhs
And fade in my Ahhs
So as cold night fades into darkness
Harken to the fire
Where you may find some peace
As many people pass
Some good and some bad
But this fire glows stronger yet
And burning bright reminds us
To ever be reborn
The sun sets soon
Uprises the moon
The sun sets soon
Uprises the moon
A girl came in the night
She brought me a fever
She laid her hands upon my head
Till I was burning up
I woke alone
I was still burning
The fire was all that was left
All that's left of you
It was always you x 4
I cut through the brush
I followed your scent
To find the way to you
To find the way to you
I traveled through floods
Through valley and glade
To find my way to you
To find my way to you
It was always you x 4
I followed a sound
That runs in the deep
I woke and I found
The voice from my sleep
The girl waited for me
Young and pretty
She gave me something cool to drink
And that was it for me
It was always you x 12
(It was always you) x 3
Instrumental
Up with the sunrise you'll be staring
Out through the window of the day
I'll be another waking shadow
Cast on the covers of your bed
Give me another waking moment
Shine against the solemn grate
Tell me the seasons is almost over
I can wait
So goes another winter slowly
Hands in the pockets of my coat
You'll be first to spin your story
I'll be the last to let you go
Tell me you always go before me
Out along the solemn grate
Tell me the season is almost over
I can wait
When in day light leaves you staring
Out in another under tow
I'll be tired conversation
I'll be waiting, get home
Tell me you always go before me
Out along the solemn grate
Tell me the season is almost over
I can wait I can wait I can wait
White telephone
Pick up the receiver
Wait for the tone
Wait for the tone
It's droning
There's no one on the line
It's droning
There's no one on the line
The rotary
Finger into the hole
Pull back, let go
Pull back, let go
It's ringing
No one answering
It's ringing
There's no one answering
All our words go into the wire
Just like a ghost
Just like a ghost
It's fleeting like light from a room
Into darkness from an empty room
I'm fleeting like light in a room
Into darkness crawling after you
(Pressure and Suffa)
Oi P it's your round
Na it's your round
Oi it's your fucking round man I got the last fucking round!
Hey you still owe me five anyway bro! You get the round!
Fuck It's your round dude
(Pressure and Suffa)
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop we've been down since
Back in the days, I'm the clown prince
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
So just bounce, like you're banging in the back of your car
We turn it out; Hilltop we've been down since
Back in the days when I was a teenager
(Suffa)
First up, on the dolcet tones of the Gravy Bone Project
Suffa MC came to take you home
I drip lyrics like spits, spit lyrics like drips
In the arms I'll lick ya spirit with my miracle whip
Whip, 'cause what I'm hearing's all shit on the lyrical tip
Na, I ain't feeling ya kid, we gave you
Something to jock, but it wasn't no thing
Like bobby gave Whitney a rock but it wasn't no ring (drinks party)
And I'm a keep at 'em, crossing my fingers that eve
Says keep Adam, I'm going down on Louise
And I'm a wreak havoc, little man with a big pen
I got dirty habits like a nun in a pig pen
Like drinking, smoking, cursing, sucking
Titties representing the city that I grew up in
We laid the path so you got a way in
It's Hilltop; we're three stars like a Holiday Inn
(Pressure)
Next up, when I get loose with no fail
Appealing like the naked truth and the truth is for sale
So when I leave yo, you're fucking with my pride I don't see though
Typical MC, my nuts don't match the size of my ego
I seize an opportunity 'cause they don't linger
The glass ain't half empty it's half full that's why I'm a table drinker
Think your on Pressure's level? Only thing tight bro
That you might show is dressed in several of your wife's clothes
An arrogant fucker damaging suckers masterfully
If I married your mother you still wouldn't be half of me
You should run from me, fuck battling, ain't nothing sweet
'Cause I won't beat you to the punch I'll punch you to the beat
Don't get offended by the rubbish that we pump in the street
My foots always in my mouth I just can't stomach defeat
I'm a master these until it's hard to breath
It's Hilltop we're the first to come last to leave
(Suffa and Pressure)
Man I'm smooth like Marlon Brando at thirty
At my peak like Marlon Brando at fifty
And I'm fat like Marlon Brando at seventy
Fuck it; no MC can ever better me (no one man)
And half the time half my crew could drink the bar
And half these cats ain't half of what they think they are
We independent, I'd sign on the line
The day me giving you the finger is a sign of the times
Their rhymes are designed to dis us, but why dis us?
I don't rewind to try to find disses
Man, I just recline and mind my business
And I think in lines in rhymes, the rhyme stitches
Up the minds of the lines of dimes and fine...
I pen letters that kill
They stab ya neck with a feather until you've bled in my quill
This veteren's ill, thinking you can better my skill
You need medicine chill a Pressure vendettas for real
She wandered through the garden fence
And said, 'I've brought at great expense
A potion guaranteed to bring
Relief from all your suffering.'
And though I said, 'You don't exist,'
She grasped me firmly by the wrist
And threw me down upon my back
And strapped me to her torture rack
And, without further argument
I found my mind was also bent
Upon a course so devious
It only made my torment worse
She said, "I see you cannot speak
Is it your voice that is too weak?
Is it your tongue that is to blame?
Maybe you cannot speak for shame.
Or has your brain been idle too
And now it will not think for you?'
I hastened to make my reply
But found that I could only lie
And like a fool I believed myself
And thought I was somebody else
But she could see what I was then
And left me on my own again
spoken:
When the white eagle of the North is flying overhead
And the browns, reds and golds of autumn lie in the gutter, dead
Remember then, the summer birds with wings of fire flaying
Come to witness spring's new hope, born of leaves decaying
As new life will come from death, love will come at leisure
Love of love, love of life and giving without measure
Gives in return a wondrous yearn of a promise almost seen
Live hand-in-hand and together we'll stand on the threshold of a dream
Well I feel like I'm lost in time,
Watching the world go by.
Everything looks the same.
Tired of playing games.
Oh, It's been getting me down.
Oh, and now what I need, what I need
California Sun (x3)
Is calling
Is calling me
Now I don't know what I'll find,
Just wanna get in a car and drive.
It's time to escape the shame,
Mean-laughing too long this way.
No, it's getting me down.
Oh, now what I need, what I need
California Sun (x3)
Is calling
Is calling me
Leave my worries behind.
Oh, start a new life.
Now, when no one knows me,
Ah, is just what I need.
California Sun
Nobody sees her here, her eyes are slowly closing.
If she should want some peace she sits there, without moving,
And puts a pillow over the phone.
And if she feels like dancing, no one will know it.
Giving herself a chance there's no need to show her how it should be.
She can't remember now when she was all in pieces,
She's quite content to sit there listening to what he says,
How he didn't like to be alone.
And if he feels like crying she's there to hear him,
No reason to complain and nothing to fear, they always will be.
She can't change, she don't wanna
It's not like when she was young
She'd change for anyone
I can't change, I don't wanna change
Not like when I was young
I'd change for anyone
We don't wanna face it
We don't wanna face it
We don't wanna face it
Broke a promise I had saved up for you
It's not like when you were young
I won't tell anyone
She don't like me 'cause I can't speak
Not like when I was young
I spoke for everyone
If it's too hard, be honest
If it's too hard, be honest
If it's too hard, be honest
(We don't wanna face it)
The crickets cry tonight
Here comes your girl
The showers fall tonight
It's a rainy world
The shivers on the spine
Could be what we had in mind
Remember all the times we said
We could be we should be in love
On a windy porch tonight
Here comes your girl
Beneath the dull porch light
Your thoughts will curl
Past the women and the men
To where the story ends
The voice from up above says
We could be we should be in love
My disgusting habits end
It's a crazy world
Neither real nor pretend
And there's your girl
My eyes fall from my head
With all the pages read
And I'm so glad you said
We could be we should be in love
If the waters cool I might just swim,
If the sun shines right I might be here all day.
I drift away, in a sunken state
I'm busy lappin' it up, I might be here all day.
With the tides, and their little secrets,
Whispering me to sleep.
Would you take away my weakness,
Drift on, drift on.
If the waters cool, I might just swim
If the sun shines right I might be here all day
I drift away, in a sunken state
I'm busy lappin' it up, I might be here all day
With the ripples and their stories
Cooking up a storm
Will you carry all my weakness,
Drift on, drift on.
If the waters cool, I might just swim
I drift away in a sunken state
I'm busy lappin' it up, I might be here all day.
With the under current lurking,
Watching sideways from afar,
Could you take away my weakness
I'm not that strong.
You see I feel so heavy without you
And you say;
Drift on, drift on, drift on.
Drift on, mm hmm stay strong,
Drift on.
If the waters cool I might just swim,
Instrumental
Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Just you forget about me
Be happy my love
Just say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day, the sensible way
And we'll remain friends
Look out for yourself
Should be the rule
Just give your heart and your love, to whom ever you love
Don't you be a fool
Baby why stop and cling, to some fading thing 
That used to be
So if you can't forget
Don't you worry 'bout me
Who's next?
Who's next?
Always the ones the ones
That you least expect
They seem so strong
It turned out she wanted more all along
And each time I hear who's to part
I examine my heart
See how it stands
Wonder if it's still in safe hands
Who's fled?
Who's fled?
Who's been caught
Out in somebody's bed?
I should have guessed
That day that his phone
Wouldn't take your text
He was a charmer
I wish him bad karma
Oh, I know we shouldn't take sides
But that one was his fault
This one is her fault
No one gets off without paying the ride
And, oh, the divorces
And, oh, oh, oh
The honeymoon, the wedding ring
Oh, oh, oh
The afternoon handovers by the swings
Oh Jens, oh Jens
Your song seemed to look
Through a different lens
You're still so young
Love ends just as easy as it's begun
Now there's kids to tend
The legal bills
And custody
And, oh, the divorces
And this one is different
And each one of course is
And always the same
Oh, the divorces
Who's next?
Who's next?
You'll take it back
Glory and failure
You'll take it back
Pure and unpunctured
Standby
You'll take it back
You'll bring home the frame
You'll take it back
And weed through the black
Standby
Take back
Remember our first love? 
We will always have Zack Rice 
We would both lift up our shirts 
Kissed him once you kissed him twice 
Tell me stories of myself 
That I don't remember 
I was too drunk or too young 
Of that I can be sure 
And when you come to see me, 
You will ride the lights alone 
And you'll turn with every change 
And I can't wake you up 
Due to your prescriptions 
Tell them all you were on track 
To distract your addictions 
And when you come to see me, 
You will ride the lights alone 
And you'll turn with every change 
When you burn all your bridges, 
You will have to fight alone 
It's a good thing you can swim 
And when you come to see me, 
You will ride the lights alone 
And you'll turn with every change 
When you burn all your bridges, 
You will have to fight alone 
It's a good thing you can swim 
And when you come to see me, 
You will ride the lights alone 
And you'll turn with every change

She's my oblivion - it's to her I run 
Out on the balcony - she waits for me 
Out on the boundary - she smiles 
She's my oblivion 
Which way to turn? 
The edges of our love are in the stars 
And on the balcony 
She waits for me 
Out on the boundary 
She smiles 
Make this alive 
Good days are back 
Open your eyes when it falls 
Come back to the air 
I can't tell you what you already know 
I can't make you feel what you already feel 
I can't show you what's in front of you 
I can't heal those scars 
She's my oblivion 
And my skin burns 
Her hands all over me 
She whispers: 
"The edges of our love are in the stars" (choir) 
Good days are alive 
Good days are back 
Open your eyes when it falls 
Come back to the air 
So look down to the street below 
Don't look up to the stars above 
You look around 
See what's in front of you 
Don't look down, don't look down 
Can you see the light? 
It shines onto us tonight 
Can you see the light? 
It's all around you
We'll do it all
Everything 
On our own
We don't need
Anything 
Or anyone
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads
I need your grace 
To remind me
To find my own
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

If love is a danger, should we avoid it?
If love is a danger, should we avoid it?
It was a rainy day today
Sky stayed grey
A lonely day, lonely day
It will be a lovely night
Sunshine in my heart
Even when we are apart
(The danger of love) Drive me crazy
(The danger of love) Drives me easy
(The danger of love) Makes the power of your day
(The danger of love) Makes the power of your way
The danger of love...
Your love bring the sun in me
I could smell your essence
With or without your presence
It was a lovely day
A lovely day
A lovely day
A lovely day eh
(The danger of love)
Drive crazy (the danger of love)
Drive me insane (the danger of love)
Makes the power (the danger of love)
Power of our day (the danger of love)
Makes the power (the danger of love)
Power of your way (the danger of love)
(The danger of love)
(The danger of love)
Lovely day
Lovely day
It was a rainy day
Sky stayed grey
They don't know nothing about love
Sunshine in me to stay
Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love)
See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love)
Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love)
See you in my dreeeeeeeam (the danger of love)
The danger of love
The danger of love
The danger of love
The danger of love
The danger of love
The danger of love
The danger of love
The danger of love
Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love)
See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love)
Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love)

See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love)
Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love)
See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love)

Tonight
Tonight see you in my dream
See you in my dream
There was a time
She could never see him
And her fault
Was to always need him
They became their only rescue
They connect
They connect
And he says, 'I know about your son.'
That he feels so much older than he was
When she only talks about her son
So much work
There was a time
When I thought I knew you
So much for that afternoon
They became their only rescue
They connect in the afternoon
And he says 'I know about your man'
...And their hearts will broken if you can't decide between them
So much longer wind on the phone
You don't have to answer, have to walk alone
So much work
And it's the same sad song coming back again
The same old song, flows back again
And you don't have to live on your own
It's a lie in the end, you only satisfy your friends
And you don't heal if you won't (don't) bring it home
You don't have to settle
(Don't) have to say you won't
You can stay
You don't have to walk alone.

I don't wanna rush you now
If you need sometime to think
I can wait another year
But I can't promise anything
I guess you have a reason girl
Let me try to understand
Maybe I'm not good enough
But I will do the best I can
I don't wanna rush you now
I don't wanna rush you now
Everybody's telling me
I should take a good advice
But I better let you know
It doesn't come as a surprise
I'm tryin' to get through to you
A conversation on the phone
I know it might sound silly but
After all I wish I'd known
I'm tryin' to get through to you
I'm tryin' to get through to you
Oh honey I just wanna let you know
That I, that I never, never gonna let you go
Honey come a little closer now
Come on, don't stop
Well I guess you feel the same way too
I know you're still in love with me
I can see it in your eyes
You say you have forgotten me
But I'm sure it's only lies
I don't wanna rush you now
If you need sometime to think
I can wait another year
But I can't promise anything
I don't wanna rush you now
I don't wanna rush you now
I'm not a sailor
I'm not so strong out of my shoes
Dragging like anchors
Over the ocean
Pearls in the sky are strung round the moon
Pointing to you
And I'll sail till morning
Or I'll sail till I
Am carried to you tonight
I'm not a sailor
But I'll spend the night out on the sea
Out on the sea
And I'll sail till morning
Or I'll sail till I
Am carried to you tonight
Are you of muscle or of love?
Give me an answer you are sure of!
Are you rich or are you rough?
Is your giving gift enough?
Are you an eagle or a dove?
Are you blind to god above?
Ahlay-looyah
Ahlay-looyah
Ahlay-looyah
Speed kills, but beauty lives forever
Speed thrills, but beauty knows your name
I fell ill inside eternal winter, winter
And stood still beside eternal flame
And when I ride
With you tonight
We can move
At the speed of light
With all I'd asked
And all I'd pray
The last rose of summer would stay
First time that I ever saw you
Crashing hard through days of pain
You were one of god's children
Left to cry out in the rain
Waiting to be saved again
'Cause when I ride
With you tonight
We can move
At the speed of light
And all I'd ask
And all I pray
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer is gone
Long gone, gone
The last rose of summer is gone
When I ride
With you tonight
We can move
At the speed of light
Forever young
Forever blind
Into the stars
We rock tonight
Last rose of summer is gone
The last rose of summer is gone
The last rose of summer is gone
The last rose of summer is gone
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer
The last rose of summer is gone
I've 
Seen you hanging from blistering skies
Holding yourself with a grace that defies
Law after 
Law as well spit in the eye
Fall on me when you come down
You've seen me panic 
And
Kick without sight
Of any danger except what I might
Know of myself and
See in you 
Tonight
Fall on me when you come down
The air is thin and hard to breath,
With 
Sweetness that you lost to me
Despite this noose around our kiss,
I try to tell myself 
This is
No ending
Seeing you buzzing from flickering signs
Bringing on warnings of 
Incoming fire
Blood on your hands
From the tongue of a liar
Fall on me when you come 
Down
The air is thin and hard to breath,
With sweetness that you lost to me
Despite 
This noose around our kiss,
I try to tell myself this is
No ending
No ending
Leaving 
Alone and
I see you're still breathing
Head out of sight
But the neon's 
Deceiving,
There is no danger of you
Getting anywhere here
I know I'm prone to rushing 
In with
No pretence of listening
Despite this noose around our kiss,
I try to tell myself 
This is
No ending. No ending
Fall on me when you come down

Sarah:
Tu cosa fai stasera?
Rimani ancora un po
sara quest' atmosfera
ma non mi dire di no
Per farti prigioniero
qualcosa inventero
ma che bisogno c'era
di amarti subito un po
Jose:
Questo giorno e una pazzia
ma la luna e amica mia
se ti resta un sogno da buttare via
soli in mezzo a una citta
Solo amici e poi chissa
Poi non basta mai
tante cose da dirsi
e baciarsi e capirsi e stringersi
poi non basta mai
si fa tardi ma dai
dove corri a quest'ora?
Both:
Just show me how to love you
Io non ti lascio piu
gabbiano di scogliera,
io sto, una favola, e tu?
Just show me how to love you
Sarah:
Fame o febbre o quel che sia
mi ci sento a casa mia
dentro questo sogno da buttare via
non mi sembra vero ma
sembra un'altra la citta
Jose:
E non basta mai
tante cose da dirsi
e baciarsi e capirsi e stringersi
e non basta mai
e gia tardi ma dai
dove torni a quest'ora?
Both:
Just show me how to love you
E ci ridiamo su
gabbiano di scogliera
ma dov'eri nascosto'
dov'eri finora?
Sarah:
Tu cosa fai stasera?
Ci ridiamo su
magari un'altra sera
ed e gia domattina
e la luna la spegni tu!
My eyes are smaller than my stomach is.
That is quite a meal for me.
I have lost my appetite lately.
The basement is where we wait
For the storm to break.
Someone is lost outside,
Through the rain we hear them cry.
Deafened by the sound
Of the apples falling down.
They were rotting on the ground
When the winter came around.
My bedroom feels just like a parking lot
That's been closed up for the night
Asleep beneath the buzzing light.
Shining light
You always show me
You always guide me
I don't know where I'm going
Show me now
I'm waiting to see
I'm waiting to feel
Around me again
Show me your love
Show me your kind love
Share your compassion
Let me feel mine
Share your light
All around
Now that you've found me
And I've found you
Shining light
What will you show me now?
What can bring to you
To stand in your glory?
Shining light
When will you show your love?
When can I see you
And stand in your glory?
Shed your light
Show your love
Shed your light
Show your love
Shed your light
Show your love
Shining light
What will you show me now?
What can I bring to you
To stand in your glory?
Shining light
When will you show your love?
When can I see you
To stand in your glory?
Shed your light
Show your love
Shed your light
Show your love
Shed your light
Show your love
Shed your light
Show your love
Shed your light
Shed your light
King of kings you may decide,
Right upon our lives.
And we'll do as you command,
Even risking our hearts.
And we'll do as you command,
Fighting with our hands.
When the enemy walks in your land,
We'll go and fight them back.
And we'll do as you command,
Fighting with our hands.
When the enemy is strong and fast,
We'll go and fight them back.
The Queen:
"Your Majesty, the enemy is here,
The best is being done, but they're stronger and faster than we are,
And they are arriving in vast numbers.
We cannot tell for how long we'll be able to stand this vicious fight."
The King:
"Go, my golden Queen, the light is within you and your men,
You'll never be defeated if you fight with might and hope."
And we'll do as you command,
Fighting with our hands.
When the enemy walks in your land,
We'll go and fight them back.
And we'll do as you command,
Fighting with our hands.
When the enemy is strong and fast,
We'll go and fight them back.
The Queen:
"The king was right. We fought with hope and might.
And faced the enemy with open hearts.
None of my men were down in the fight.
God bless the king, for being our guide".
King of kings you may decide,
Right upon our lives.
And we'll do as you command,
Even risking our hearts.
No somos mas
Que una gota de luz
Una estrella fugaz
Una chispa tan solo en la edad del cielo
No somos lo que quisieramos ser
Solo un breve latir
En un silencio antiguo con la edad del cielo
Coro:
Calma, todo esta en calma
Deja que el beso dure
Deja que el tiempo cure
Deja que el alma
Tenga la misma edad
Que la edad del cielo
No somos mas
Que un punado de mar
Una broma de Dios
Un capricho del sol
Del jardin del cielo
No damos pie entre tanto tic tac
Entre tanto big bang
Solo un grano de sal
En el mar del cielo
Coro
Crush my bones tonight
So thin that they might
Slide under his door
And leave my heart for the world
To see... (Leave this to me...)
He think's he's FRAMED...
So clueless as to the situation
He's got himself in...
Buried beneath his haunted memories...
So cough, cough, cough it up...
Have you lost your breath
Or maybe that's me
Tearing out your lungs...
Tell me how it feels...
To know that this is
Just my dream...
And it's your reality...
A scream pulls me
In the direction
Of my living room...
A body laying on the floor
Looking at me
With a blank, blank stare...
On his face...
Does this seem familiar...
Does this seem familiar?...
So cough, cough, cough it up...
Have you lost your breath
Or maybe that's me
Tearing out your lungs...
Tell me how it feels...
To know that this is
Just my dream...
And it's your reality...
So cough, cough, cough it up...
Have you lost your breath
Or maybe that's me
Tearing out your lungs...
So tell me how it feels...
To know that this is
Just my DREAM...
AND it's YOUR reality...
And it's your reality...
And it's your...
Calalily, can you hear me?
Cross-eyed again?
Cursing the wealthy?
In all the things they have that we don't.
I'll shut up and let you rest.
But if I were raised to fight, that would be me,
Standing up against the light on the TV
That I die in front of each night
My tail between my knees
Well I know that you want more from me,
I'm too scared to move.
Calalily, would you make room for me in this bed?
So I can kick my feet and bang my head silently.
I swear I won't ask again.
Well I know how you need your sleep,
But my skin's crawlin
Well put that book down
About the end of the world.
And let your hair down
Like it's the end of the world and we'll make love.
Calalily, will you still love me come tomorrow knowing that I've done nothing
But put sorrow to a soft melody
Things that happen
Just once
If she'd looked she would have seen it
He was standing
All night
Cross the street very still
And they go out so easily
The street lamps
The cars come and go
But I see you
Too clearly
I don't trust myself anymore
If it's all true
Just say it
I may already know
That sound when
It's over
The sidewalks will carry you home
And the evening so easily
Agnus, Agnus
Dei
Agnus, Agnus
Qui tollis peccata mundi
Agnus, Agnus
Oh how the times have changed us 
Sure and now uncertain 
Men not devils have claimed us 
Purity deserting 
God's one miracle 
Lost in circles 
All my all my life 
Revolves around 
Laughter and crying 
As my life turns 
Round and round 
Cannon fire burning 
On the hillside 
You and I are side by side 
Listen 
Tin soldiers playing our tune 
All my all my life 
Revolves around 
Laughter and crying 
As my life turns 
Round and round and round 
Songs for life's lost lovers 
Bitter sweet their healing 
Their prayers prayed under covers 
Need not kneeling 
God's one miracle 
Moves in circles 
All my all my life 
Revolves around 
Laughter and crying 
As my life turns 
Round and round 
All my all my life 
Revolves around 
Laughter and crying 
As my life turns 
Round and round 
And round 
And round
Se meg  
Som jeg er
Ta det som kommer
Viser meg hvor jeg er
Hvor jeg skal
Og hvem du er
*vocal interlude*
Se meg  (se meg)
Som jeg er (som jeg er)
Ta det (ta det) som kommer
It's all over now, baby blue eyes
All the wasted tears forgotten
And I know that you lied
But all your lies were sweet like a child's.
And you know there was nothing I wouldn't have done for you
Goodbye Johnny, I won't forget you
But I do regret all your sadness
But this world was too much for you
For me too, there was nothing I could do.
It's all over now, baby blue eyes
All the wasted years forgotten
And I know that you lied, but
All your lies were sweet like a child?s.
Goodbye Johnny, I won't forget you
But I do regret all the madness
But this world was too much for you
For me too, there was nothing I could do.
Time you start to grab your pride
Before you know you loose your dignity
You were always on the outside looking far beyond your destiny
Goodbye Johnny.
Instrumental
Three in the morning closing in
Living in pain, living in sin
Keep it simple man you're gonna make it out
Keep it simple man you're gonna make it out
Red walls looking for distraction
Red walls looking for distraction
Keep it simple man you're gonna make it out
Simple simple man you're gonna make it out
Two Seabee, cigarette smoke
Sunday night is long and cold
Keep it simple man you're gonna make it out
It's all over man, you're gonna make it out
Broken hand, a broken wall
Broken love, crash and fall
Simple simple man you're gonna make it out
Keep it simple man you're gonna make it out
Get up girl, heard you sing
Get up girl, sing for me
Keep it simple now you're gonna make it out
It's all over man, you're gonna make it out
Fire is burning me inside out
Fire is burning me inside out...
It's all over, just like that
A fire comes and you can't strike back
It's all over, just like that
A fire comes and you can't strike back
It's all over, just like that
When the fire comes you can't strike back now
It's all over, just like that
A fire comes and you can't strike back
Desire is burning me inside out
Desire is burning me inside out...

Our curse has spread
The fault to each our families
And so we've left
Yeah we tried to understand it
So who I
Put our book back off the shelf
We still have a while to go
If you'd ever unwind
And relax then maybe
We can have a good time
This would help
If you'd ever unwind
And relax then maybe
We can have a good time
This would help (I know)
Our curse can spread
We said to us from our families
But years brought tears
The hurt was so demanding
But I don't mind
This book will take a lifetime
We still have a while to go
If you'd ever unwind
And relax then maybe
We can have a good time
This would help
If you'd ever unwind
And relax then maybe
We can have a good time
And this would help
Repeated:
If you'd ever unwind
Ich sah eure Blicke, voll Begierde, voller Lust.
Ich sah die Gesten, ich fand die Briefe, sah den Kuss.
Ich sah euch tanzen, ihren Blick wenn sie dich sieht
ich spur' ihr Zaudern, und sie des Nachts sich mir entzieht.
Ich werd's nicht lassen, nie will ich sie vermissen!
Nie Sie dein, nun wirst du kampfen mussen.
Wahle einen Ort, wahle eine Zeit und auch die Waffen -
lauf' nicht fort! Ich werd' nicht kommen, dich zu schonen -
wirst dein Leben lassen!
(Refrain:)
Als der neue Tag erwacht, die Klingen kreuzen!
Kontrahenten schlagen sich, mit Worten sie sich reizen.
Schaulust zieht die Leute an, durch die Menge geht ein Beben.
Sto��, Parade, Gegensto�� und es erlischt ein Leben.
"Deinen Sohn getotet hast du, wie geblendet kann man sein?
Glaubst du Tor, dass du linderst deine Pein?"
"Ich nicht dein Eigen, denn noch immer bin ich frei!
Du bringst Verderben, fur eine kleine Liebelei!"
"Glaubst du denn wirklich, fur solchen Frevel ich der Lohn?
Du mich verloren und auf immerdar den Sohn!"
Wahle einen Ort, wahl' eine Zeit und auch die Waffen -
lauf' nicht fort! Ich werde nicht kommen, dich zu schonen -
wirst dein Leben lassen!
(Refrain)

Through the essence of your smile
Makes this fight all worthwhile
Oh, the perseverance of your life
There you were, by my side
Giving me strength through your love and pride
She says carry on, carry on
Oh, the stars, they shine so bright
Are they there for you and I?
I know you see the light
Carry on, be strong my son
This is the end of innocence
Carry on, when I'm gone
This is the end of innocence
This is the end, my friend
Sacrifice is all we have
Finding solace in your laugh
The freedom will ease your pain
Watching tides and season change
Things will never be the same
Oh, she says carry on, carry on
Carry on, be strong my son
This is the end of innocence
Carry on, when I'm gone
This is the end of innocence
This is the end
Carry on, be strong my son
This is the end of innocence
Carry on, when I'm gone
This is the end of innocence
This is the end
Carry on, be strong my son
This is the end of innocence
Carry on, when I'm gone
This is the end of innocence
When I left you alone to fight your battles
Of long winters and motels what went through your mind?
How is it that you made it? 
How is it that you noticed?
It wasn't me who was looking at you
Through foggy glass or windows, it was them
I was out in Coolidge with my head on a counter
Drinking down my chances to ever return to anyone
No I wasn't faking it, the hurt I felt was real
And all that was holy just slowly disappeared
Or just appeared in parking lots of truck stops
The blinking lights, and now all I'm thinking is
"How the hell did I get here?"
Does your husband know I call you sweetheart?
Does he know that I call you at all?
It's not like you are cheating we're only meeting
In hotels and not your home
Would you change your last name to mine?
I think my kids would mind
I think my kids would mind
I was in the desert waving planes and burning phone books
To a tune that was famous the year I was born
Do not leave me dancing alone
Pick up the phone and call me lover
Say come and get me I am home
Please pick up the phone
Please pick up the phone
She's a flower she's a rose
Wonderful when she's close
But you'll see, don't say I didn't warn you
Every rose has its thorn
She poisoned me like a virus
Her love is running through my veins
She is extremely contagious
All boys will get the same
Blood red lips, lovely smile
But behind something hides
You will feel, late at night
Razorteeth take a bite
Memories bother me
She comes back haunting me
If I could meet her once again
I'd do it all 'til the end
Ga nu, du ska inte vara har
Ga nu, glom bort det som sagts ikvall
Glom allt, lamna kvar det du minns som bra
Ga nu, jag vill att du ger dig av
Jag vill att du gar nu
Jag vill att du gar nu
Jag vill att du ger dig av
Fa mig, fa mig att andra mig
Forsta mig, det ar klart att du angrar dig
Jag vet nog, jag vet nog vad du tanker pa
Men tro mig, vad som an vantar, ga
Jag vill att du gar nu
Jag vill att du gar nu
Jag vill att du gar nu
Jag vill att du gar nu
Jag vill att du ger dig av
Jag vill att du
Jag vill att du (gar nu)
Jag vill att du gar nu
Jag vill att du ger dig av
Jag vill att du gar nu
Jag vill att du gar
Jag vill att du gar nu
Jag vill att du ger dig av
Jag vill att du gar nu
Vander dig om och gar nu
Jag gar nu
Jag gar nu
I know these dreams seem make believe
But I don't think we should let 'em go
Can't promise you Rome or St. Tropez
But one day we might make it to Mexico
(Verse 1: Natti)
Baby doll can I call in a favor
If you trust me, I trust you
We must to
Get past times we cuss through
While we stand swearin like we in front of judge who
Evers on TV, you know what I mean
'Cause whatever you seen be it debit or green
Natti came up on from chasin a dream
But yet, like a lil free Red Corevette
Sweet on the streets, worth less when it's wrecked
Work, stress, and sweat, this life is a test but
Believe it's gonna be all gravy
We be runnin' in the sun to lay where it's shady
But not fast, fun filled with laughs
Can't take a trip to fall runnin' to first class
How I wish the woods would up and disperse cash
Till they do it's me and you and where I'm taking you last
Lil' bathin suit, me grabbin yo ass
Past borders with waters as clear as your glass, so
Let's go down Mexico, where the
Reefer is cheaper and the sex is slow, c'mon
(Verse 2: Deacon)
How about sex on the beach? Right
Dos Equis? Right, under red light
Special, sidewinder track through sand
Swim a lil' bit, dance when we back on land
Darlin', whatever floats your boat
From Kentucky well water to whale watchin off a back porch
Smoked out rotisserie turning
A lil tequila, some kissin' and burnin
But anyway, That's after words are said
The ring bearers, the flower girls, the I Thee Weds
But that's miles away like your smile today
I'm feeling lower than the Nile in May
Cause all I know is I don't know and you don't either
All I know is that we need us
And plus we know, that I ain't paid
Yet all we think is I'm gone lead us
Together, Forever
Girl that's a pressure unmeasured
No lesser your treasure
Cause even the Reverend would tell ya
That heaven's no better
Heaven's no better, than you
(Bridge: Know)
Let me get my David Bowie on real quick, check it
Take a chance or let me go
Cross the lines down shifting lights,
Catch it's breath a stream of life,
The tallest trees stretch to the sea,
And to the edge where shadows meet.
A quiet place and nature's way,
A season comes and whispers life,
Still born again into golden dreams,
A Hiding place beneath blue skies.
Cross the lines down shifting lights,
Catch it's breath a stream of life,
The tallest trees stretch to the sea,
And to the edge where shadows meet.
Leaving for work Monday morning
It is time for a new dawning
Sitting around every day
Amounts to nothing and there's no way
I'm doing this for another ten years
That's one of my worst fears
Oh sam
Turn of your phone and bring some sheets
This is a place where young lovers meet
This is all all we need
Bring us some food and some bullshit TV
We'll bunker up for days and days
Call in sick we're never leaving this place
Oh sam
So come inside my room tonight
I'll let you win I won't even put up a fight
We'll have a marathon of your choice
Anything you want
Movies, TV, magazines
Music, sex or something inbetween
Oh sam
Instrumental
Wenn Dich alles verlassen hat, 
kommt das allein sein. 
Wenn Du alles verlassen hast, 
kommt die Einsamkeit
Soon this space will be too small
And I'll go oustide
To the huge illside
Where the wild winds blow
And the cold stars shine
I'll put my foot
On the living road
And be carried from here
To the heart of the world
I'll be strong as a ship
And wise as a wale
And I'll say the three words
That will save us all
And I'll say the three words
That will save us all
Soon this space will be too small
And I'll laugh so hard
That the walls cave in
The I'll die three times
And be born again
In a little box
With a golden key
And a flying fish
Will set me free
Soon this space will be too small
All my veins and bones
Will be burned to dust
You can throw me into
A black iron pot
And my dust will tell
What my flesh would not
Soon this space will be too small
And I'll go oustide
And I'll go oustide
And I'll go oustide
Just wanna know ya
Just wanna talk to ya
I wanna hear about your day
I'd never leave ya
Never be mean to ya
I'd always let you get your way
Something good will come our way
And maybe this good thing's gonna happen today
If I were honest
I'd tell you everything
But it keeps coming out as lies
It's not a promise
In case your wondering
It's not some blessing in disguise
I know romance is not in fashion
And my heart is on the line
If you would be so kind
To help me kill some time
Then something good just might come crashing
From the stars that light the sky
If you would be so kind
To help me kill some time
Just wanna know ya
Just wanna talk to ya
I wanna hear about your day
I'd never leave ya
Never be mean to ya
I'd always let you get your way
Broken sky, heartaches that flowers won't mend
Say goodbye knowing that this is the end
Tender dreams, shadows fall
Love too sweet to recall
Dry your eyes, face the dawn
Life will go on
Life will go on
All along, thought that we still had a chance
Letting go, this is the end of romance
Broken heart find your way
Make it through just this day
Face the world on your own
Life will go on
Life will go on
There'll be blue skies, there'll be true love
Someday I'll hold you again
They'll be blue skies in a better world, darlin'
Tender dreams, shadows fall
Love too sweet to recall
Dry your eyes, Face the dawn
Life will go on
Life will go on
Broken heart find your way
Make it through just this day
Face the world on your own
Life will go on
Life will go on
Life will go on
Life will go on
Chorus:
Ich hab den "Mir geht's viel zu gut-Blues", den "Mir geht's viel zu gut-Blues." Seid ihr down mit uns, seid ihr down mit uns? Seid ihr down?
Manche ham'n Problem mit mir, erzahlen mir ich rede Stuss, der politisch mal so korrekt ist wie ein Negerkuss. Aber hey, da schei��' ich drauf, denn ich strotz vor Lebenslust und kenn' nur Schmerzen, weil ich mir fast nie die Zahne putz. Ich fuhr' jetzt schon 'ne Weile ein Leben auf der Sonnenseite, denn auf meinem Weg nach oben nahm ich die Stolpersteine. Jetzt seh ich die gro��en Scheine fur meine Bombenreime und kauf' mir mein hei��geliebtes Gras nur noch tonnenweise. Wenn die Socken schmutzig sind, geht's barfu�� und im Drogenrausch mir einfach ein paar neue kaufen in das feinste Modehaus. - Oh der Herr sieht aber komisch aus! - Ja ich hau' die Kohle raus und gibt's mal was zu tun, steck' ich den Kopf in den Sand wie Vogel Strau��. Denn ich schwimm' oben auf, ganz genau wie Fettaugen, die hubschen Madchen stehen auf mich, Dir bleiben blo�� die Schreckschrauben, doch wenn ich jetzt mal ehrlich bin, wurd' ich am liebsten weglaufen, denn ich hab echt genug vom nichts tun und Sekt saufen
Chorus
Ja ich hab' alles, was ich brauch', was ich nicht hab', hab' ich auch. ich hab' 'ne scharfe Braut, immer Gras zuhaus' und morgens schlaf' ich aus. DJs legen unsere Platten auf, und in Magazinen steht meistens sowas wie: "Der Topf, der hat es drauf!" Und wenn's um Burner geht, ich nehm' gerade ein' auf. Und wenn's mir dreckig geht - nehm' ich 'n Bad im Applaus. Und wenn's nicht besser wird, bin ich oft tagelang blau, high wie'n Astronaut und's stort gar keine Sau. Ich dachte, mein Job am Mikrofon bleibt kohlema��ig fur'n Arsch, vom Geld her wird's sich niemals lohn'. Ich dacht' nur Schrott wie Dieter Bohlen geht in Deutschland in die Charts, doch heute sind wir large. Wir haben Freigetranke bis zur Invasion, Videobeamer, Studio und Spielkonsolen, immer'n Auge auf die Anderen wie beim Turspion und machen weiter wie gewohnt. Nehmen Beats und flown bis der Schei�� hei�� ist wie gluhende Kohlen. Und weil's zur Zeit so geil ist, fuhl' ich mich wohl!
Cuts:
Groove zu dem Beat bis in die tiefste Nacht. (2x)
Groove zu dem Beat, den Sepalot gemacht hat
Ich hab' doch auch meine Sorgen, doch gerade sind keine in Sicht. Ich hab' zuviel Zeit fur Stress, darum beneidet man mich. Hab' ein Dach uber'm Kopf und mein Madchen im Herz und bin echt alles andere als von meinem Leben entnervt. Ich mein' meine Gesundheit ist doch im grunen Bereich, bisschen Husten und Kopfweh, naja der ubliche Schei��. Nicht dank Gemuse und Reis, oder dank Kuhmilch und Saft, sondern dank genugend Schlaf, denn in der Ruhe liegt die Kraft. Wenn das Wetter mich langweilt bleib ich im Bett einfach liegen, hab' noch nie 'ne Bewerbung, sondern nur Texte geschrieben. Jetzt hab' ich keinen Abeits-, sondern einen Plattenvertrag, und wenn ich die Burner bring' genugend Asche am Start. ich mein' es reicht fur mein Leben, bin noch nie pleite gewesen und hab' eh nicht vor, den ganzen Tag nur Scheine zu zahlen. Hab' ein gutes Publikum und dafur danke ich Euch, weil ich sagen muss, dass ohne Euch das Ganze nicht lauft
Chorus
Interesting and sophisticated
Refusing to be celebrated
It's a monumental big screen kiss
It's so deep it's meaningless
One day you'll just up and quit
And that'll be it
Just then the stripper stopped in a coughing fit
She said, "Sorry, I can't go on with this"
Yeah, that's awful close but that's not why
I'm so hard done by
It was true cinema-a-clef
You should see it before there's nothing left
In an epic too small to be tragic
You'll have to wait a minute 'cause it's an instamatic
Yeah, that's awful close but that's not why
I'm so hard done by
Just then the room became more dimly lit
As the MC carried on with it
And now that I've got you all strangely compelled
I'm afraid Candy's not feeling well
Close but that's not why
I'm so hard done by

I couldn't catch my breath laying there.
Fading in and out and I can remember mother telling me,
"Home is where the heart is," but my heart has long been black.
Coming to the end of my road, but I never wanted it like this, not like this.
Looking over there lay mother and louder and louder I screamed her name,
But she wouldn't say anything.
This was all too familiar, but I've never been on this side of things.
Memories of my brothers racing through my mind, and soon I know we'll all be together again.
The sound of gun fire so loud and rapid, but it seems to be so quiet around me.
And out of nowhere I feel peace cover me.
I reach down and reload my ticket home.
The taste of cold steel on my lips, and a second later silence fills the January air.
They carried us off and laid us in the city to let the public see of our defeat
But we still live on, we live on.
Years may pass but the story will be told of Mother Maylene and us her sons of disaster.
We're at the top of the world
You and I
We've got a lot of time
And it sure feels right
Cause you reached in your pocket
And pulled out a pass
That says you can take me anywhere
We're on the top of the world
Here tonight
We've got a lot of time
And it sure feels right
'Cause I'm up here running behind you
I'm up here running in repeat
We're at the top of the world
You and I
We've got a lot of time
And it sure feels right
Cause you reached in your pocket
And pulled out a pass
You can take me anywhere
You can take me anywhere
You can take me anywhere
You can take me anywhere
You can take me anywhere
Instrumental
Suck it up, we're going down
30 seconds till we smash into the ground
The passengers have lost their smiles
Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles.
I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train
Another day, another flight
There's not a chance of going down, but then we just might
So this is it, this is goodbye
And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind.
I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train
Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same
But I'm going nowhere.
Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way
And I really don't care.
I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train
We're going down, we're out of sky
It sure helps if you can see the funny side
So this is over and out, this is goodbye
And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind.
I try to reach her, but she's not there
But back home I hope she knows how much I care
I ease the seat back and start to pray
To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays.
una verdad se inventa con suma precision
y la labor inmensa de la imaginacion.
yo no quiero desganos, ni falta de pasion
no quiero estar en manos, de un gran simulador
no me digas nada, o dame una razon
la menos pensada, es la que creere yo
que no tenes ganas, o que todo cambio
o que no pasa nada, hoy ya entre los dos
Tracey Gold - where have you gone girl?
Tracey Gold - where in the world? 
Tracey Gold - what have you done girl? 
Tracey Gold - my heart's in a whirl over you
My brain's in a swirl over you
My hair's in a twirl over you
I want to touch your permed hair
Tell boner life just ain't fair
Stare at you without a care 
Now you are mine, now I am yours 
Love receiver - where did you go? 
My dream weaver - nobody knows
Lust deceiver - one that I chose 
Carol Seaver - take off your clothes 
Tracey Gold - where have you gone girl?
Tracey Gold - where in the world? 
Tracey Gold - what have you done girl? 
Tracey Gold - my heart's in a whirl over you
My brain's in a swirl over you
My hair's in a twirl over you
Love receiver - where did you go? 
My dream weaver - nobody knows
Lust deceiver - one that I chose 
Carol Seaver - take off your clothes 
Tracey Gold - where have you gone girl?
Tracey Gold - where in the world? 
Tracey Gold - what have you done girl? 
Tracey Gold - my heart's in a whirl over you
My brain's in a swirl over you 
My hair's in a twirl over you
She builds her own satellite
From an old rusted chair
She leaves this old world behind
And the things that she cares
Maybe she's gone
But it won't be for long
What do I know?
Maybe she's found
What we all dream about
What do I know? Oh
She's beautiful
And wild
Well I can't compare
And wild
But it's just not there, fair
She builds a strong alibi
From the future that's here
She needs to know I'm alive
But I'm flesh and I tear
Maybe she's wrong
But I wouldn't mind my own
What do I know?
I'm best to let go
With a touch of her soul
What do I know? Oh
She's beautiful
And wild
And I can't compare
And wild
And it's just not fair
And wild
And I can't compare
And wild
Oh it's just not fair
And wild, oh no,
And wild, oh it's wild
And it's just not fair
Check out the girl in the Harbor Tunnel
Crawling to work six feet under
And the day has barely begun
They're all chewing gum
And laughing at the voice on the crackling radio station
Lead us not into Penn Station
Cause the best part's just begun
We're all becoming one again
And she's making the scene
With the coffee and cream
And the copy machine's not working
She's a hell of a girl
She's alone in the world
And she likes to say hey good lookin'
She's on her way
She's taking a sick day soon
And here is the man pushing paper past her
Thinks up ways to make the day go faster
But the day goes on and on
He dreams of his lawn
And all about the pretty careerist the next cube over
The fat secretary, the lunchtime lover
Till the PATH train finally comes
The platform's full of bums again
And she's making the scene
With the coffee and cream
And the copy machine's not working
She's a hell of a girl
She's alone in the world
And she likes to say hey good lookin'
She's on her way
She's taking a sick day soon
And she's taking her time
As she's tossing a dime
At the man in the cardboard coffin
It doesn't have to be fine
She's ahead of the line
And doesn't have to be here too often
She's making a play
She's taking a sick day soon
Life is good
Sometimes it's bad
It has its ups
It has its downs
Just sing a song and feel all right
Cause that's just life
And if you're lost
Don't be sad
There are good times to be had
Just sing a song and let love shine
Cause that's just life
That's just life
That's just life
So darling don't cry
And when your hour
It is near
And your friends
They all are here
To share their love and to be kind
It's just life
Oh and when you're gone
You won't be back
I'll remember those
Special times we had
I'll sing this song and feel all right
Cause that's just life
That's just life
That's just life
So darling don't cry
I turn around to talk
I face your eyes
Pride replaces fright
To my surprise...
I feel as I'm falling, and I see
Your soul in your eyes
As I die...
I try to stand tall
You roll your eyes
You feel the same way I do
To my surprise...
I feel as we're drowning in the deepest sea
You die, you're gone just like me
Her eyes are staring at me
Empty as the sky
In this moment of tranquility
I realize
This is goodbye...
I'm in a state of mind
I'm in my private desert
I'm in a passionate study
Waiting for Mars to come out
All the lights in Paris
All the songs of Belfast
Every detail in my head is
Waiting for Mars to come out
My skin shrinks against my body bones
I'm lost into the weight of gravity
I'm at my best with my astronomy
Pyramids and starlight
Orchestrated midnight
The math of infinity and reason
Waiting for Mars to come out
Oh, the sisters of mercy
They are not departed or gone
They were waiting for me
When I thought that I just can't go on
And they brought me their comfort
And later they brought me this song
Oh, I hope you run into them
You, who've been traveling so long
Yes, you who must leave everything
That you cannot control
It begins with your family
But soon it comes around to your soul
Well, I've been where you're hanging
And I think, I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy
Your loneliness says, that you've sinned
Well, they lay down beside me
I made my confessions to them
They touched both my eyes
And I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf
That the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love
That is graceful and green as a stem
When I left they were sleeping
And I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights
You can read their address by the moon
And you won't make me jealous
If I find that they've sweetened your night
We weren't lovers like that
And besides it would still be all right
We weren't lovers like that
And besides it would still be all right
A cidade levemente flutuou
Ondas amarelas no contorno cheia
A cidade simplesmente me odeia
A cidade sutilmente estremeceu
Bestas e janelas, extase no breu
A cidade nos meus dentes, tu e eu
Mesmo sabendo que a vida nos engana
Mesmo sabendo que a Opala nao e plana
Mesmo sabendo que a dor cartesiana
Mesmo sabendo que so musica baiana
I was just, thinking about you, thought I could call you, see if, I should tell you
That I've never, had such a feeling, there's this, how much better can all this get?
I'm ten feet off off the ground and still looking down
And I've waited, forever, to know
How deep down, my love will go
And no matter, how long I try to get it
It's the one thing that I'll never finish
Today is just another day, take another breath in, hold it forever
I'm digging holes, into my heart, trying to find the very end
But I'm lost, way down inside, so tell me again
'Cause I've waited, forever, to know
How deep down, my love will go
And no matter, how long I try to get it
It's the one thing that I'll never finish
You want me, all to yourself; you've got me now
I've got a thing, to myself; where do you end?
And where do, do you begin?
'Cause I've waited, forever, to know
How deep down, my love will go
And no matter, how long I try to get it
It's the one thing that I'll never finish
'Cause I've waited, forever, to know
How deep down, my love will go
And no matter, how long I try to get it
It's the one thing that I'll never finish.
I've been loving you a long time
Down all the years, down all the days
And I've cried for all your troubles
Smiled at your funny little ways
We watched our friends grow up together
And we saw them as they fell
Some of them fell into Heaven
Some of them fell into Hell
I took shelter from a shower
And I stepped into your arms
On a rainy night in Soho
The wind was whistling all its charms
I sang you all my sorrows
You told me all your joys
Whatever happened to that old song
To all those little girls and boys
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
The gingerlady by my bed
Covered in a cloak of silence
I hear you talking in my head
I'm not singing for the future
I'm not dreaming of the past
I'm not talking of the fist time
I never think about the last
Now the song is nearly over
We may never find out what it means
Still there's a light I hold before me
You're the measure of my dreams
The measure of my dreams

Big B.
Raisin' hustlers, thieves, and prostitutes
Young homie think before you shoot, murderer-ah
Where will our children go
When there no (nowhere, no!) place anywhere they can go
Bizzy
And trouble may come and some time
You'll get pulled over by one-time
And when in 1999 rewinds didn't even make any strides
Murder all around the whole world is nauseatin'
Everybody hatin' everybody over-rated
Why everybody actin' agitated
I thought we graduated back in the saddle
Waitin' (board) aboard the battle station
Hation is a birth defect, and you know ain't nobody perfect
And when the curtains close, open up the door
No more, no more
Big B.
See we're losing this world we love
And it looks like the sinnin' won't end
So I'm reachin' high up above
Lord let Your blessings begin

And let's change the world
And let's change the world
Let's change the world

Flesh
It got me ready to set off the riot
Ridin' with my trues, humbly united gathering souls
Here we go, roll up some more Phillies
My nigga let me hit it, niggas we thuggin' immortalized, let's get high
It's them niggas you most desire
I could remember from way back in the day
Comin' up out of the ghetto was a hell of a struggle, for selling the fiends ya-yo
But it was my dream to kick flows to put my people on another level
Like it'll be for the lust (lust), or could it be for the rush (rush)
My niggas love when they bust (bust), they steady buck and you duck (duck)
They'll put you deep in the dust (dust), my niggas creepin' on ah come up (come up)
Black nigga killa (killa), thuggish ruggish nigga
Nigga pin it, nigga fi'in' to descend into a dawn of a new millennium
Anticipatin', life without Satan
Hatin', and our enemies to hell I'm sendin' 'em

Everyday the devil at me
And I wish the Lord threw a hummer at me, I ain't happy
Me and Eazy-E in a B-E-N-Z
With my niggas right next to me
It's my legacy, we can't let it stop us (uh-uh) not now
The whole world endin' up the buck buck, pow
Corruption, destruction, disaster
Everybody tryin' to rap faster than the master
Oh Lord, could you save my soul
Nigga tryin' to go platinum around 40 years old
The Lord knows, we can do this shit
It ain't no stoppin' us now, 'cause we can prove this shit
Nigga me, Stew, D's P.D., Freaky-G
The whole world wanna be rappin' with me
I'm in the flesh, let's talk, about sex
Babies havin' babies, generation X
With the AIDS epidemic we ain't pure no more
And I know they got a cure for this shit, we ain't rich
First we lost Eazy, then we lost Pac
Biggie got killed, when this shit gonna stop
Everybody wanna know what's goin' on with the Thuggish Ruggish
Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone
Tryin' to be prepared for the Y2K
And if I don't die today
I'm tryin' to change the world
Bizzy & Big B.
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
Let's change the world
Let's change the world
Wish
You need a message, you could love our rappin'
But they tryin' to ban it, realize it ain't gonna happen
We done changed the world (world), ghetto voices bein' heard and felt
You know it's funny, got my guns better arm yourself
Most don't have a clue if it goes down what to do
Don't you know this government ain't vote for me and you
I have a dream, no I have a wish
If we can't save ourselves, then let's save the kids
Let the world go on (go on)
Let these babies have somethin'
Let the world go on (go on)
Just don't blow this motherfucker up
You kill him, he'll kill you
Some say it's stupid but violence really lives where I come from (come from)
Hungry little kids where I come from (come from)
Thugs like me where I come from (come from, come from, come from)

There's something that I wanna say
Feel a little outta place
But I need you to make that change
You promised to keep me out of the rain
I love the cars and everything, the diamond rings
But I loved you much more, baby
You said that you were gonna stop
When you had enough
Do what you had to do
Now you like the profession
You made it for yourself
You said forget about me and you
Now all you wanna do is hustle
You gotta choose what you gonna do
When am I worth it to you baby
1- Never thought I'd be afraid to trust
Somebody that I loved so much
If I can get him outta the streets
Then he can come back to me
Now I see that it ain't no us
Baby to me that's a definite plus
If I can't get you outta the streets
Then you don't need to be with me
Do you love me like you say?
Maybe you could getaway
From the life of doing wrong things
You promised
Don't make me read about it babe
Think of me before I'm gone
'Cause when I'm gone it will be too late
You said that you was gonna stop
And you had enough
Do what you had to do
Now you like the profession
You made it for yourself
You said forget about me and you
Now all you wanna do is hustle
You gotta choose what you gonna do
When am I worth it to you baby
(Repeat 1 3x)
I said man you better watch this
She's gonna make a take down
She gonna make you do right
She gonna make youy stay 'round
I said man you better watch this
She's gonna make you do right
She's gonna keep you inside
Make you stay around all night
When you wanna be free
As free as a bird in the breeze
And you wanna be free
As free as you wanna be
I said man you better watch this
She's gonna make you do right,
She's gonna keep you inside
Make you stay around all night
When you wanna be free
As free as a bird in the trees
And you wanna be free
As free as you wanna be
Now a bee in a birds nest never made no honey
And a bird in a hive sang no song
God makes the man
Man makes the money
So who am i, and who am I to judge
Now I cry but I can't complain
I supply my own ball and chain
And now I'm tied tighter than the races
So who am i, who am I to judge
Water was running, children were running
You were running out of time
Under the mountain, a golden fountain
Were you praying at the Lares shrine?
But oh your city lies in dust, my friend
We found you hiding we found you lying
Choking on the dirt and sand
Your former glories and all the stories
Dragged and washed with eager hands
But oh your city lies in dust, my friend
Hot and burning in your nostrils
Pouring down your gaping mouth
Your molten bodies blanket of cinders
Caught in the throes ...
And your city lies in dust
Uch a night, it's such a night
Sweet confusion under the moonlight
Such a night, such a night
To steal away, the time is right
Your eyes caught mine, and at a glance
You let me know that this was my chance
But you came here with my best friend Jim
And here I am, tryin' to steal you away from him
