Can cut you from their bloated budgets
Like sharpened knives to chicken McNuggets
Shut the fuck ah
No shut the fuck up
Right, right
Learn to buck up
Right
Shut the fuck up
Now now learn to buck up
Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers
We'll eat your children and steal your thunder
While heavy torsos that heave and hurl
Will crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels

And burn like candles in smokey spires
Do more to turn my joy to sadness than
Somber thoughts of burning planets

Brother, Friend, it's not like I want this to end.
Sister, Companion, it's not like I planned to abandon,
But I have been here before.
Your pages get flipped.
I can tell by the weight in your face that you can't be trusted.
Well, I have been here before
(There's nothing behind it).
You can't tell us that we're all together.
Like a sea of presidential timber
We are filed up one by one.
I like you! I like you!
We see our heads collapsing until we find some kind of space,
It comes on slow and then it takes over.
Let's be passionate.
It's not like we'll get another chance to do this.
Don't be embarrassed.
Go over the top but come up from the bottom.
Let's be passionate - it's not like we'll get another chance to do this,
Don't be embarrassed.
Your heart, your lips,
The parts of your being that I miss:
They have seasoned me over the last year,
But haven't we been here before?
We've got something against the words
(When there's nothing behind it).
I want to take these little minutes and try to find myself some space.
I wanna relive little minutes and try to keep the dream awake.
I want to relive little minutes, but they just keep stacking up on themselves.
You can't make it fit when it works like this if it becomes a job.
Let's be passionate.
It's not like we'll get another chance to do this.
Don't be embarrassed.
Go over the top but come up from the bottom.
Let's be passionate - it's not like we'll get another chance to do this,
Don't be embarrassed.
We could go dancing if you want to, but I'd rather take you home.
We could go dancing if you'd rather be a bore.
Oh fancy-unamazing-type in Square Park.
You cheeky devil you, it's not even dark.
Oh my, you are obscene just for enquiring.
And so we found your car, in seconds flat.
Take me somewhere far, in your piece of trash.
Ha, I'm sorry, but you were quite that offer to no secret.
And yes, this city is filled with people and I might just be one too.
It's so hip and it's so tragic if you're fortunate enough to be confused.
We could go dancing if you want to, but I'd rather take you home.
We could go dancing if you'd rather be a bore.
Into the floor we'd sink, with another drink.
We could go dancing if you want to, but I'd rather take you home.
We could go dancing if you'd rather be a bore.
Oh how the seasons change, and your mind will do the same.
And I too was on my knees at the foot of my bed.
Repented all my sins to scientists that came in a dream,
And said "My boy you're just protoplasm."
And yes, for those that love I would rip the seams.
But not for something that I have never seen.
And all your jeans, how I would love to rip out those seams.
And yes, this city is filled with people and I might just be one too.
It's so hip and it's so tragic if you're fortunate enough to be confused.
We could go dancing if you want to, but I'd rather take you home.
We could go dancing if you'd rather be a bore.
Into the floor we'd sink, with another drink.
We could go dancing if you want to, but I'd rather take you home.
We could go dancing if you'd rather be a bore.
Oh how the seasons change, and your mind will do the same.
We could go dancing if you want to.
We could go dancing if you want to.
We could go dancing if you want to.
We could go dancing if you want to, 
But you know that I would rather take you home.
I think I'm crazy
I think I'm going out of my mind
You call me crazy
I thought I saw you touching my guy
Are you crazy?
Maybe I should take you outside
And show you crazy
Ooh, I got your crazy
A little hazy
Maybe I'm just losing my mind
I think you're shady
I know that you've been calling my guy
Are you crazy?
Now I'm gonna take you outside
And show you crazy
Ooh, I got your crazy
Call my man again and I'm a fuck you up
And I'm a fuck you up, and I'm a fuck you up
Touch my man again and I'm a fuck you up
And I'm a fuck you up
And then you call me your best friend
And then you call me your best friend
Call me crazy
Every time that I turn around
You're on my baby
Ooh, but I'm his lady
Am I possessive?
Just because I'm claiming what's mine
You're crossing the line
Why are you constantly calling him up
To pick him up, let me know now
You call me your best friend
Then turn around and secretly text him
You call me crazy, ooh I got your crazy
Call my man again and I'm a fuck you up
And I'm a fuck you up, and I'm a fuck you up
Touch my man again and I'm a fuck you up
And I'm a fuck you up
And then you call me your best friend
And then you call me your best friend
They call me crazy, they say I'm crazy
I know you are but what am I?
I know you are but what am I?
They call me crazy, I think I'm crazy
I know you are but what am I?
Ooh, I got your crazy
Call my man again and I'm a fuck you up
And I'm a fuck you up, and I'm a fuck you up
Touch my man again and I'm a fuck you up
And I'm a fuck you up, ooh I got your crazy
Call my man again and I'm a fuck you up
And I'm a fuck you up, and I'm a fuck you up
Touch my man again and I'm a fuck you up
And I'm a fuck you up
And then you call me your best friend
And then you call me your best friend
I hope I'm crazy
You gotta be careful
You never know who's around
Look over your shoulder
I'm right behind you
I see you watchin
Two steps behind me, stalkin
Knock me, tryin' to stop me from my monopoly
Wait, stop and see what I do next
If you win then ... you be scared and stressed
I've seen your type, all hype
And no substance
We bang hard like snares in percussion
You can't intimidate men like me
You bring a knife to a gunfight
Winning's unlikely
Follow me, go ahead, I'm watching your shadow
The snakes in the grass get caught by the rattles
Skadattle, slam, you been defeated
You're messing with a guerilla
Who told you to beat it
Bleed it, Beep it, whatever you want
Make a million dollars
Go ahead and punt
You still get no respect
It just don't matter
Rat-ta-tat-tat and all the punks scatter
I'm
Right
Behind you
So you better (uh)
Watch your back
(Watch your watch your watch your back
(Watch your watch your watch your back)
(Watch your watch your watch your back)
(Watch your back watch your back)
(Watch your watch your watch your back)
(Watch your watch your watch your back)
(Watch your watch your watch your back)
(Watch your back watch your back)
Once in a while
Things can get drastic
Classic, cases of fools made from plastic
Livin' in the city
Oppression is king
Survival of the fittest
Is a real thing
One second you're breathing
The next second you're not
One minute you're standing
The next minute you're dropped
357's or AK-47's
All tools that create 187's
A learning departure
To hell in a heaven
No matter if you're rich
Or live like a peasant
The nicest guy
Or The finest girl
Or the toughest gangster
With an O.G. curl
I live in peace
But folks still be testing me
Your best friend today
Tomorrow, your worst enemy
You never know who's planning to jack
That's why I'm trying to warn you people
Watch your back
I'm
Right
Behind you
So you better (uh)
Watch your back
(Watch your watch your watch your back

Watch Your Back!
Turning star projections
Voices from the deep
Throbbing of the engines
You exit from the heat
Paper on the pavement
Cars crawling in the road
Emotions of the city
You ease your heavy load
A Motorway City
Well it ain't the same
Lighting up the night sky
With an orange flame
A Motorway City
Well you exit on the right
Cruising on the highway
When you're driving through the night
A Motorway City
Well it ain't the same
Lighting up the night sky
With an orange flame
Motorway City
A Motorway City
A Motorway City
A Motorway City
Motorway City
A Motorway City
A Motorway City
A Motorway City
A revolution never come with a warning
A revolution never sends you an omen
A revolution just arrived like the morning
Ring the alarm we come to wake up the snoring
They tellin' you to worry about the future
They tellin' you to never worry about the torture
They tellin' you that you'll never see the horror
Spend it all today and we will bill you tomorrow
Three piece suits and bank accounts in Bahamas
Wall street crime will never send you to the slammer
Tell all the children in the arms of their mummas
The F-15 is a homocide bomber
TV commercials for a popping pill culture
Drug companies circling like a vulture
An Iraqi babies with a G.I. Joe father
Ten years from now is anybody gonna bother?
Yell Fire, yo, yo, yo
Here we come here we come
Fire, yo, yo, yo, yo
Revolution a comin'
Fire, yo, yo, yo, yo
Fire, yo, yo, yo, yo
Everyone addicted to the same nicotine
Everyone addicted to the same gasoline
Everyone addicted to a technicolour screen
Everybody tryin' to get their hands on the same green
From the banks of the river to the banks of the greedy
All the riches taken back by needy
We come from the country and we come from the city
You play us on the record, you can play us on the CD
All the shit you've given us is fertilizer
The seeds that we planted you can never brutalize them
Tell the corporation they can never globalize it
Like Peter Tosh said Legalize it
Girls and boys hear the bass and treble
Rumble in the speakers and it make you wanna rebel
Throw your hands up, take it to another level
And you can never, ever, ever make a deal with the devil
Yell Fire, yo, yo, yo
Here we come here we come
Fire, yo, yo, yo, yo
Revolution a comin'
Fire, yo, yo, yo, yo
Fire, yo, yo, yo, yo
You thought you had it all
Until you found all you'd lost.
You thought you knew it all.
Then you learned something new.
You once stood tall.
You once stood proud.
Look at you now;
Another face in the crowd.
I didn't ruin you.
Your own arrogance was your downfall.
I'll shed no tears for you.
I'm glad to see you crawl.
I knew what you would say about me,
So I grew a thick skin that you couldn't see right through.
Yours aren't words to extol,
So fuck you.
I'm not yours to control.
When you have to face me, you're never as bold.
Now you berate me.
Now I can be controlled.
Have you been told
The moon is just a stone
The universe is so cold
Have you ever had
The moonwind blow your hair
Have you lost your head
Or have you been told
The moon is just a stone
The universe is cold
Plunge into the realm that lies
Beneath those deep black pools
My eyes
Enter the treasury
Here's where you will find
The most precious gems
Mining redefined
So call me a bitch in heat and
I call you a liar
And we'll throw stones until we're dead
There you go again you cut me off from talkin'
You bask in the glory
The center of the circle
All the friends think you're a fuckin' comedian
So kind and generous
But I am suffering
Away from here
I wanna be
Away from here
Away from here
Away from every little thing I have
Every little thing
I used to love your every little every little thing
Now you call me a bitch in heat and
I call you a liar
And we'll throw stones until we're dead
You're the puppeteer and I'm the puppet
You manipulate me with your real catholic shit
Everytime I try to talk it through
You turn it around and make us out like david and goliath
Away from here
I wanna be
Away from here
Away from here
Away from every little thing I have
Every little thing
I used to love your every little every little thing
Now you call me a bitch in heat and
I call you a liar
And we'll throw stones until we're dead
Your arms beneath me
You're lying inside me
I used to love your every little every little thing
Your eyes grews stars
Your hand in my purse
And now I hate your every little everything
Oh mama
I didn't know life was this hard
Oh mama
My innocence has been tarred
My inner vision, dulled and darkened
I give myself away to you
I felt my sorrow humble me
And throw my crown upon the ground
It's you I hope for
And us I pray for
And me that I believed that was wrong
And now my anger is my best friend
Be careful I may bite your head off
Liar
So call me a bitch in heat and
I'll call you a liar
And we'll throw stones until we're dead
So call me a bitch in heat and
I'll call you a mother fucker
And we'll throw stones until we're dead
Uh
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack, uh
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
It goes a-one, two, three
And it's just another bombtrack
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'mma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down
Hand out some beatdowns
Cold run a train on punk hos that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
So recall our downfall
And the businesses that burned us all
See through the news and views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff for manifest destiny
Landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite and then watch 'em burn
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite and then watch 'em burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Yes, you're gonna burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Goes a-one, two, three
Another funky radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts you hear and you begin to fear (Fear)
That your card will get pulled if you interfere (Interfere)
With the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite and the watch 'em burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Yes, you're gonna burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

I woke up in the darkness and I tried to see the clock; it was 4AM
I was curled up in a foetus and my muscles were stretched taut; I was shaking
I couldn't face the burdens of another week of worry; I was broken
I took a green and yellow pill, washed down with filter coffee 'til it kicked in 
Get me out
Keep me up
Level me out
Keep me up
I was isolated by the way I thought and felt; they saw my mood swings
I traveled down the longitude of opposite emotions; I bipolar 
In the north they saw my upside, my excitable and optimistic spirit 
In the south they saw my anger and my tears and my despair; they saw my mood swings
Get me out
Keep me up 
Level me out
Keep me up
I was one of the Prozac people
I was one of the Prozac people
Don't monitor this guinea pig for research any more; I will try again
Pharmaceutical conglomerates just count me as a unit for their product
Identify the enemy, remove the source of fear. Start to change my life
It's a false state of elation, you can join the Prozac nation if you want to
Get me out
Keep me up 
Level me out
Keep me up
I was one of the Prozac people 
I was one of the Prozac people
I was one of the Prozac people
I was one of the Prozac people

Here alone in this place, here alone in my bed
I feel your warmth on my face and these thoughts in my head
Everything I say to you feels stupid now
Feelings that I shared with you are over now
Haven't I been enough of a fool for you?

More will my friends stand for
My drunken belligerence
Girls won't put up with my
Stubborn ignorance
Things used to be simple
I wish I was still five
Now drugs and booze keep my alive
Hate, it's more than a word
A way of life
You're on your own
Nobody gives a fuck about you, or me
Loving couples, smiling children anger me
Fills me with hostility
The way you live, can't seem to find
What it's about
Arbor hospital, you never should've let me out
Hate, it's more than a word
A way of life
You're on your own
Nobody gives a fuck about you I'm ruined
You fuckers never should've let me out
I'm ruined
Chili di silenzio per inaugurare un nuovo gioco
(solo agli sguardi e' concesso di sperdersi nell'aria)
perche' un sospiro puo' affilare il taglio del rasoio
e di nuove lacerazioni non c'e' voglia
Nessuna possibilita' di condividere sfiducia
costretti a un'immobilita' colpevole
Il buio e' un peso, e' un imbroglio e brucia come il fuoco
Le cose opache li' intorno si muovono:
detta il ritmo lo smacco di ogni preghiera
e non c'e' pace latente da cogliere
Nessuna possibilita' di condividere sfiducia
costretti all'immobilita', noi carne esanime e sfinita
Nostri i corpi arresi al gelo dell'apnea!
Patiranno il giro di vite ineluttabile
Chili di silenzio sulla nostra pena
gran regina dell'incubo che verra'
Come girano i colori ed i sapori nella vita vera?
Qui per ora e' nero come Angoscia e amaro come Fiele
E li'?
The chaos that surrounds you
The facts that astound you
At last your number has found you
Your number is one
I'm looking high
I'm looking low
I want to know therefore I go
Your number is one
See them pull into the slow lane
The no go lane
Watch them take the poison that drives them all insane
Your number is one
Your number is one
Your mind decided
Your number is one
You are undivided
For you there is but one direction
Your number is one
I am looking high
I'm looking low
I want to know therefore I go
Your number is one
I am looking high
I'm looking low
I want to know therefore I go
Your number is one
That number is one

The only one
That number is one

Keep the ? intact
Keep the ? at the top of the stack
When you get to all the other stacks
Take the stack down off the rack
Your number is one
Your mind has decided
Your number is one
You are undivided
For you there is but one direction
Your number is one
I'm looking high

I cannot sit back, shed my broken skin.
Curse my pride, I react. Play yourself again.
Up down, and down again.
You live in a computer, you're an instant man.
Judged and told I can't cut your shallow hands.
How can I please all of your needs?
What do you see when you see me?
I can't reach you.
Step back, heard your point of view.
Stand up, lay down for no one.
Take a piece of me with you.
Step back, now that I know you.
I know, you're down for no one.
I bow down to no one, you like the faith.
Stand behind me, find your way.
You know you will decide
To move on with me or step aside.
I could have lost my life
And I'm ready to risk it one more time.
How can I please all of your needs?
What do you see when you see me?
I can't reach you.
Step back, heard your point of view.
Stand up, lay down for no one.
Take a piece of me with you.
Step back, now that I know you.
I know, you're down for no one.
I can't reach you.
Step back, heard your point of view.
Stand up, lay down for no one.
Take a piece of me with you.
Step back, now that I know you.
I know, you're down for no one.
I can't reach you.
Step back, heard your point of view.
Stand up, lay down for no one.
Take a piece of me
Take a piece of me
Take a piece of me with you.
You pick me up, to put me down
Your only joy, is when I'm gagged and bound
A subtle prick, a blatant lie, your denial
Your denial.
No one's gonna save my life when I'm drowning
No one's gonna give a shit when I die
All my friends try to tell me I'm the greatest
And my friends all tell me but my friends all lie
No one's gonna save my life when I'm drowning
No one's gonna give a shit when I die
All my friends try to tell me I'm the greatest
And my friends all tell me but my friends all lie
My friends all lie.
Lost my faith, forgiveness too
My kindness destroyed all because of you
The futures stopped, do you like the view?
No really its nothing.
No one's gonna save my life when I'm drowning
No one's gonna give a fuck when I die
All my friends try to tell me I'm the greatest
Yeah my friends all tell me but my friends all lie
No one's gonna save my life when I'm drowning
No one's gonna give a fuck when I die
All my friends try to tell me I'm the greatest
Yeah my friends all tell me but my friends all lie.
When I was a child the innocence was deafening
Then something happened that took a bite
And left a sting!
No one's gonna save my life when I'm drowning
No one's gonna give a fuck when I die
All my friends try to tell me I'm the greatest
Yeah my friends all tell me but my friends all lie.

Elamasta katoaa

Antaa vituttaa vaan
Siis, riko lupaukset

It is returning through the dark
Doctor, you have met your mark
Your song is ending, so don't cry
When you hear him knock four times
You're going to regenerate
Some new man saunters away
No time for games, tonight we fight
For the fate of all mankind
I could do so much more
The Time Lords returning
The Earth will be burning
The last white point star is a trap for the Master
The Doctor is dying
The Doctor is dying
The Doctor is dying
The Doctor is dying
I don't want to go
I don't want to go
Wilfred will be by your side
You will always save his life
Hold on now, not long to wait
'Til they bring back Gallifrey
I'll sing you to your sleep
The Time Lords returning
The Earth will be burning
The last white point star is a trap for the Master
The Doctor is dying
The Doctor is dying
The Doctor is dying
The Doctor is dying
I don't want to go
I don't want to go
Just one more thing before you fall
You'll be getting your reward
Back in time for those you know
Martha, Donna, Jack and Rose
The Time Lords returning
The Earth will be burning
The last white point star is a trap for the Master
The Time Lords returning
The Earth will be burning
The last white point star is a trap for the Master
The Doctor is dying
The Doctor is dying
The Doctor is dying
The Doctor is dying
I don't want to go
I don't want to go (Regenerate!)
I imitate my shadow
It wears me as skin
It walks the earth
And I am its stain
I stare into heaven while I'm dying in hell
Plastic and translucent like the lies that I tell
Razors cut away the pain of this life
One stroke of the brush paints my macabre delight
All that I touch is tragedy
See the blood on my hands
All that I feel is agony
Peel away all the scabs
My soul is the grounds
Where the insects breed
The pain has gone numb
Although I still bleed
Hey girl, you know you drive me crazy
One look puts the rhythm in my head
Still, I'll never understand why you hang around
I see what's going down
Cover up with makeup in the mirror
Tell yourself it's never gonna happen again
You cry alone and then he swears he loves you
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well I'll tell you, my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
Every action in this world will bear a consequence
If you wade around forever you will surely drown
I see what's going down
I see the way you go and say you're right again
Say you're right again
Heed my lecture
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well I'll tell you, my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
Face down in the dirt
She said this doesn't hurt
She said I've finally had enough
Face down in the dirt
She said this doesn't hurt
She said I've finally had enough
One day she will tell you that she has had enough!
It's coming round again
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well I'll tell you, my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well I'll tell you, my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
Face down in the dirt
She said this doesn't hurt
She said I've finally had enough
Another group of monster teenagers shot up their school today. What makes them do it? Video games? Marilyn Manson? Oh, it can't be the parents, or the fact that school sucks, or that the jocks do get patted on the head every time they beat up the weirdos and the jobs you get once you graduate from school are stupid, boring, meaningless, and a dead-end to insanity!
I can't deny it's killing me
No one loses on TV
I can't deny it's killing me
No one loses on TV

When Sport Utility Vehicles are no longer enough... you need The Terminator. Stuck in traffic in Lost Angeles? Drive over the tops of everybody else. You'll crush 'em before the cops can catch up with you. Your precious artefact child needs to be safe. They're talking to a kid whose skin is a different colour? Grab the kid and mow 'em down!
I can't deny it's killing me
No one loses on TV
I can't deny it's killing me
No one loses on TV
On TV

Each new, hot generation has a statement they wanna call their own. Tattoos? Piercings? That's for Moms and Dads. What you wanna do is spend your allowance on devil horn implant, Elephant Man head, designer tails, third leg, fourth leg - everyone a hermaphradite!
No one loses on TV
On TV
On TV
On TV
No one loses on TV
On TV
On TV
On TV
No one loses on TV
And on a lighter note...
Oh, Another face joins the crowd
It's time to impress; time to prove yourself
You don't realize that in a year's time you'll be over this
Moved on to the next trend
Moved on to the next catchy melody
Moved on to the next trend
Here's your next catchy melody
So say what you will
Do what you feel you must
Your words just fuel my rage
And fill my heart with disgust
I know what really matters
I know who will be there
The rest of you could wither away and not a piece of me would care
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Goddamn thing...
You're spread so thin
We see right through your display
A procession of smoke and mirrors
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing to me
In time everything grows stale and old
I'll hold on to what I have and never let go
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing

Da's al tien jaar da'k in 't vak zit
'k Heb gezongen in Aalst, Peutie, Zwevezele en Genoelselderen
'k Heb zalen doen vollopen, 'k heb ook zalen doen leeglopen
'k Heb succes gekend, 'k heb ellende gekend
'k Heb toejuichingen gehad, bloemekes, verzoeknummers
AC/DC, Cherie, Een bakske vol stro
Ik weet niet waarom, ik weet niet hoe 't komt
Maar artiesten hebben meestal maar ???n verzoeknummer
J'veux de l'amour, j'veux de l'amour
Waar ik ga, waar ik sta
Voor ik sterf, voor ik verga, j'veux de l'amour
'k Heb een syndicaat, 'k heb een agent
d'een werkt per tarief, de ander op percent
Degenen die, zoals ik, werken op 't sentiment
Worden door 't leven niet lang verwend
Ze worden zot
Je veux de l'amour
In een kano, op het strand, in de lift, op de tram, op de vloer
Ik babbel met de gast die mij een glas aanbiedt
Tot ik genoeg op heb voor een volgende stap
Ik babbel met het meisje dat er tof uitziet
Ik sloof me uit, compliment en een grap
Maar ik wil geen grap meneer, ik wil geen grap
J'veux de l'amour
Ik wil geen geld terug van de telefoniste
Ik wil dat ze van me houdt, pour toujours
Wanneer een artiest succesvol is
Dan heeft ie talent, fans, wordt ge??erd als een vorst
Wanneer het minder goed gaat, wat heeft ie dan nog
Paranoia en twijfels en vooral veel dorst
J'veux de l'amour, j'veux de l'amour, in die hel
Als ik kots in de goot, onder 't kwijl, hallef dood
J'veux de l'amour
Liefde voor mij en voor mijn hond
Die heel de nacht in de auto op me wacht
Ik wil er zelfs voor de premier
Al heeft ie zijn smoeltje niet mee
Je veux de l'amour, je veux de l'amour
Voor mijn slapeloze vrouw, van tranen nat
Als ik thuiskom, strontzat, om vier uur 's ochtes
Je veux de l'amour
Voor m'n vrienden, die ook vanavond weer de weg
Naar mijn optreden niet vinden
Je-je-je-je veux de l'amour
Voor mijn verstrooide madam
Die haar pil vergat, voor abortus, op weg naar Amsterdam
Je veux de l'amour
Nu, niet seffes, niet direkt, niet sebiet, niet weldra, maar nu
Maintenant, tout de suite, heute, gvd
Je veux de l'amour, en ook geld, geld
Om kadootjes te kopen en aan iedereen te geven
Opdat ze van me houden
Well good morning baby, hmm welcome back to town.
Well good morning baby, welcome back to town.
You doing so much travellin', never know when you'll be round
Yes you a fine mella' fella, but you stubbord as a mule.

Hmm and if you can't play it my way, well now baby get lost

'Cause any time I'm ready, I can tell you baby get lost
Well, I been havin' a little trouble lord
But I'm keepin' it together yeah
My baby just walked out the doors
She said this time forever

Baby it won't be the last

And do some drinkin' fast
'Cause she's gone, gone, gone
I don't know if I'm happy
I don't know if I'm sad
She's gone gone gone
I don't know if I'll cry
I don't know if I'll die laughin'
Well I'm gonna miss your lovin'
And your perfume and your smile
I'm gonna miss your stealin all my booze
And talkin' all the while
I'm gonna miss you cleanin' round the home
And helpin' with my blues
You know I think I'll get myself a maid
And take her on a cruise
It ain't the first time baby
Baby it won't be the last
I'd better get the boys round
And do some drinkin' fast
'Cause she's gone gone gone
AI don't know if I'm happy
I don't know if I'm sad
She's gone gone gone
I don't know if I'll cry
I don't know if I'll die laughin'
It ain't the first time baby
Baby it won't be the last
I'd better get the boys round
And do some drinkin' fast
'Cause she's gone gone gone
I don't know if I'm happy
I don't know if I'm sad
She's gone gone gone
I don't know if I'll cry
I don't know if I'll die laughin'
Pumpkin
You're hollow within
More how I'm to slowly
Let their harm
Give us some
Sad until
Like flowers untamed
Shine out ends
I find what'll make him
Love me
Life is our find
Hollow he
I can't breathe
And I can't see
MTV moves too fast, I refuse to understand
You go your way and I'll see mine
Feels like wasted time
And it feels like I must be blind
How'd you like yourself?
You don't know yourself
To a hollow kind, don't mind
Love is some of you
Dabble in fall of failure
How, how bad
I smell of she
And I fail to be
Well anyway
Well anyway
Well anyway
See how high
Go on
I can't see
And I can't breathe
I can't see
And I can't breathe
I can't see
And I can't breathe
I can't see
And I can't breathe
Well anyway
Well anyway
Well anyway
The backbone of this country is the independent truck
The power of the trucker comes from his truck
Mm mm mm mm cab overhead
That's where those truckers generate their
Backbone, backbone, backbone, backbone
Mm mm mm mm mm mm fist in my face
Backbone, backbone, backbone, backbone
Move you move like an animal
Making a noise like an animal

Sing a song about fornicate
Sing a song about fornicate
Fornicate and fornicate
Sing a song about fornicate
Backbone
I don't know the face
When I look in the mirror
You're the only one
That can make things clearer
I've got a chemical infatuation
A chemical addiction to you
You're the only one
That gets me through
I'm a slave to you
Hooked on the taste
Of you beautiful pill
(Lost my soul, lost my soul)
There's an emptiness
That only you can fill
I've got a chemical infatuation
A chemical addiction to you
You're the only one
That gets me through
I'm a slave to you
(I'm a slave to you)
All alone, I fade to nothing
All alone, I fell in you
All alone, I hear you calling
All along, I've needed you
I've got a chemical infatuation
A chemical addiction to you
Adrenaline intoxication
I've lost myself in you
Chemical infatuation
I've given everything to you
You're the only one
That gets me, the only one
That gets me
You're the only one
That gets me through
I'm a slave to you
All alone, I fade to nothing

Assassinate your best friend now I hurt you par
Run up on your block wit dough and I curse you all

Kidnap your baby's mom straight earth the whore

If you ain't in it for that what the purpose for
Act like you don't give a fuck though
Good so I buck fo' shots from the roof
And my man Rock catch you up close
Never give a fuck about niggas y'all not Nutso
Hype off of carbonated water then some fructose
Straight buck foes when the nigga Ruck pull the snub nose
Wait Ruck chill, what the deal it's all love though
Look into my eyes and you can see there's something changed
Runnin' gunnin things knockin' niggas out like Clubber Lang
With the gun I bring its straight for beatin' you down
Heatin you down leavin' you six feet deep in the ground
(Vinnie Paz aka Ikon the Verbal Hologram)
It's some real motherfuckers goin' rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin' got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin' shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight
(Jus Allah)
I'm the motherfucking ungrateful
My heart is hateful, my tongue ripped
Lickin' on the blade that slayed you
You faggots act as bitch as Rupaul
Ya niggas share one milkshake wit two straws
Scrap wit no doors, four walls tighten
Seein the roof fall, feelin' the floors heighten
Crushed and shit your bones and blood siphon
And put it to the jug we sip before fightin
I'm raw lightning my power extends
In the planet and out through the opposite ends
Black man travel through the universe and back
While cavemen still though that the earth was flat
But we kept the sacred plans, now we carry
Throughout the ancient lands
Before the separating of the sands
Of course all the power I create in my hand
He bare my G strength in replicating in man
(Vinnie Paz aka Ikon the Verbal Hologram)
It's some real motherfuckers goin' rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin' got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin' shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight
(Vinnie Paz aka Ikon the Verbal Hologram)
I'm tasteless, there's beauty in strange places
I find beauty in razors
I find beauty in blood drippin from ya faces
I find beauty in the Qua'ron and all of its Aramaic equations
I find beauty in twelve gauges
I find beauty in teaching you what the definition of pain is
I find beauty stainless steel
That can kill and reveal the front of your grill
Your brainless, y'all don't wanna test Vinnie Paz patience
I crack jaws and swing swords of the ancients
Y'all pretended to understand the matrix
Without attempting to overstand its basics
We dedicated to cats that's been thuggin'
Vinnie Paz got more hoes then Jim Duggin
Y'all been duckin for quite some time now
Vinnie bout to teach you how to write some rhymes now
We aim beams in between your eye brows
Jedi Mind Sean P combine now
Scratching x's 2
I rap like no one out there can fuck wit me (Prodigy)
Poison thoughts in my mind
Got to free myself from this bind
I know I'm a reasoning guy
In an act like Jesus Christ
Stare into the sun
You don't see eye to eye with anyone
I throw it all away (Don't talk to me no more)
The more I think, the less I've got to say (I don't remember you no more)
About these poison years
It's just a memory
It's just a memory
And every time you knock me down
It's all that I can do to get up off the ground
Pull myself apart again
At the end of this rope
Rope at the end of the line
I see you swing by your neck on a vine
Treason is the reason for my poison years
Leaves are changing seasons of my poison years
Poison years in my mind
Got to free myself from this bind
I know I'm a reasoning guy
Every time you knock me down
It's all that I can do to get up
To get up off the ground
Treason is the reason for my poison years
Leaves are changing seasons of my poison years
Leaves are changing seasons of my
This is the coolest party
That I've been to
Shake your hand and kiss your ass
We'll join the other fools
Another night, another life
I can't take this anymore
Another life, another night
Drunk and passed out on the floor
Hey punk! In a year's time we will see
Hey punk! Another rock star wanna be
I smell the arrogance
From across the room
Pasty skin and heroin
Our host will be here soon
Another night, another life!
I can't take this anymore!
Another life, another night!
Drunk and passed out on the floor
You're no one 'til some one
No one 'til somebody hates you
Hey chump! How charmed can one's life be?
Hey chump! You're better off, don't fuck with me!
It's no coincidence bitch!
I thought you knew!
Go back to your rock punk
And suffer with your fools
Another night, another life!
I can't take this anymore!
Another life, another night!
Drunk and passed out on the floor
You're no one 'til someone
No one 'til somebody hates you

Es hat noch nie so weh getan.
Ich hab nichts gesagt beim ersten mal.
Hast du je gefragt wie schwer es war?
Wir waren beide jung, ich hab dir verziehen.
Ein Seitensprung, das kann passieren.
Das ist vergangen, und bevor ich mich versah warns schon zwei Affaren.
Und ich kann nicht mehr, und du flehst mich an.
Wie lang ist das her, ist schon die nachste dran.
Du spielst dein Spiel, doch drei war eins zu viel, eins zu viel.
Es ist vorbei,geschafft und du wei��t genau du hast schei�� gebaut und keine Frau wird dich so lieben wie ich.
Hey Baby, machs nicht noch schlimmer. Oho.

Enough's enough's enough's enough
This year's been really really rough
Hey Dad... What'd you do with mother
Hey Dad... Why'd you hide your brother
I just want to tell you that I'm really feeling bad
I tell you
Enough enough's enough's enough
Enough enough's enough's enough
I'm up to here with all your stuff
Hey Dad... What'll happen now sir?
Hey Dad... Can we live without her?
I don't need your money, your position or your caddy, Daddy
Enough enough's enough's enough
When my mother died, she laid in bed and cried:
"I'm going to miss you, my brave little cowboy"
I saw my father smile (a smile he tried to hide)
He told me "Son, I've really got you now, boy."
So, come on, little cowboy
Go buck and fuck and make a buck
Gonna show me how, boy?
I wish you lots and lots of luck
Are you leavin' now, boy?
Hey, Dad... try and keep this sacred
Hey, Dad... how'd you hide the hatred
I just want to tell you you're a lousy Dad to hell with you
Enough's enough's enough's enough

Oh enough!
As you enter your realm of incorruption,
The values of morality in their pristine state.
The walls that surround you in a gentle caress,
Protect you from a world of hate.
And the Earth is full of lurid madmen,
Misogynists abound waiting to produce your fall.
But the being you should most fear when you turn out the lights,
Is in no way human at all.
A puritan soul, distanced from sin,
A libertine's ways never for you.
But now you've no choice in this carnival game,
A toy to be done with what I choose.
As you struggle to break this invisible grip,
Your consternation growing into fright.
Awake but entranced by a force that's unknown,
But very real on this night.
No one answers!
To the cries in the middle of your dreams.
No one answers!
To the cries rapidly becoming screams.
No one answers!
Though you're forced to perform against your will.
No one answers!
So shut up and accept your fate!
You recoil in revulsion, but that will soon pass,
As you rebel to my sensual skill.
Non-compliance won't do, you will truly serve me well,
Or I'll have no choice but to kill.
It's the way that I work, it's the way that I am,
I'm selfish, my needs are quite great.
Exhibiting my power over the weaker, fairer sex,
My leviathan desires to satiate.
Aha what is this? you're beginning to relent?
As I have said, none resist my charm.
Your confession of faith is far behind you now,
And to think at the start you were alarmed!
I am your savior, you await my return,
Your libidinous urges long repressed.
What I do to you is unhumanly possible,
I've now introduced you to your future ways...
My systems down
Got an overload of hate
Got a bad attitude
With no intent to change
I've had my fill
I put my cards on the table
Won't take it back
'Cause today I hate everything Buy
I hate it all, I hate my friends
I hate this song
I hate this bad attitude, I'm sure you hate me too
But I don't care, you know why
When it's over then you die
No making friends today
'Cause I hate everything
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate the trees
Hate the birds and the bees
Got a sick fucking mind
And no time for your kind
I'll say again, must I still question my friends
I'll smile tomorrow
'Cause today I hate everything
I've got a chip on my shoulder
Got a monkey on my back
Got a lot of things to say
And I think I'm gonna crack
Can't buy a smile off the world's happiest man
No huggin' trees today
'Cause I hate everything
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
Fuck, I hate it all
I hate the winter, summer, spring, I hate the fall
I hate the world, the birds, the flowers and the squirrels
I said before that today I hate everything
I got an itch I can't scratch
All these people on my back
Make me sick, they're all pricks
And your mother turns tricks
Don't bother me either way
And I don't care what you say
Don't need a hug
'Cause today I hate everything
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you... Fuck you
Mein starres Herz,
es schlagt mich weiter durch die Nacht
Und kalte Traume weisen mir den Weg
Vergangenheit und Zukunft halten mich wach
Tranen sterben in den Augen, vom Eis besiegt
Gebrochenes Herz, 
wann zeigst du mir den Weg
Die Frage hallt im trockenen Mund
Und ungebrochener Schmerz mir eisig an den Adern sagt
Sie liegen blank, gefroren, wund
Wann wird's geschehen 
??dass ich mich rachen kann
Wann wird's geschehen?
Du wirst es sehen 
??und wirst zerbrechen dran
Du wirst es sehen!
Mein kaltes Herz, 
es jagt dich weiter durch die Nacht
Bis ich gewarmt an deinem hei��en Blut
Denn ich erfror, als du so kalt gelacht
Um soviel hei��er trifft dich meine Wut
Wann wird's geschehen 
??dass ich mich rachen kann
Wann wird's geschehen?
Du wirst es sehen 
??und wirst zerbrechen dran
Du wirst es sehen!
Wann wird's geschehen 
??dass ich mich rachen kann
Du wirst es sehen
Du wirst es sehen 
??und wirst zerbrechen dran
Du wirst es sehen!

You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today

'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway
Undead, you better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway
Look up and see that motherfuckin' writin' on the wall
When you see J3T thirty deep, he's down to brawl
Fuck all haters I see 'cause I hate that you breathe
I see you duck, you little punk, you little fuckin' disease
I got HU tatted on the front of my arms
Boulevard brass knuckles in the back of the car
'Cause we drunk drive Cadillacs, we never go far
But when you see us motherfuckers, better know who we are
I got one thing to say to punk asses who hate
Motherfuckers don't know but you better watch what you say
From these industry fucks to these faggot-ass punks
You don't know what it takes to get this motherfucking drunk
I'm already ridin' baby, it's a little too late
Johnny's takin' heads off of all faggots who hate
'Cause I'm like God, motherfucker, there's a price to pay
Yeah, I'm a God, motherfucker and it's Judgement Day
Undead, you better get up out the way

I'm getting used to this nuisance of fags who bad mouth this music
How fuckin' stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this?
You cowards can't, you never will, don't even try to pursue it
I took the chance, I paid the bill, I nearly died for this music
You make me wanna run around, pullin' my guns out and shit
You're temptin' me to run my mouth and call you out on this, bitch
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this?
You need to slit your wrist, get pissed and go jump off a bridge
What, you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What, you think I just got lucky and didn't work for this shit?
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
I've played a million empty shows to only family and friends
What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big?
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kids lips
That shit's as worse as it gets, this verse is over, I quit
Signed "Charlie Scene" on your girlfriend's tits
Undead, you better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll ridse, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway

You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway
White boys with tattoos, pointing right at you
We're breaking everything, r-rowdy like a classroom
Pack of wolves 'cause we don't follow the rules
And when you're runnin' your mouth, our razorblades come out
B-but you always press and you know I never stress
With Loki DMS, J-Johnny to my left
Got Phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west
I grew up on by drive by's and LA gang signs
So what the fuck you know about being a gangsta?
And what the fuck you know about being in danger?
You ain't doin' this so you know you just talking shit
Mad at all of us 'cause every song is a fucking hit

Resurrection
Of my nemesis
The new form
Stigmatized and marked
Black painted scars
Deep burned scars
I am chaos
I am destruction
The light is fading from my room
As night time comes around too soon
I'm so afraid.
Swollen eyes portray my pain
As tears fall like the summer rain
I'm so alone
Son of a bitch you broke my heart
I need a little loving
To take away the pain
How could you let me down
When I'm in your care.
I pull the covers to myself
Drink and smoke upon his breath
I close my eyes.
Again I pray to God above
What have I done to lose his love?
Am I to blame?
Son of a bitch you broke my heart
I need a little loving
To take away the pain
How could you let me down
When I'm in your care?
When I am dreaming
I can call out
No one hears
Father
I am falling
From your heart in tears
Son of a bitch you broke my heart
I need a little loving
To take away the pain
How could you let me down
When I'm in your care.
Hush little baby don't you cry
Daddys gunna sing you a lullaby
To show he cares.
But you must keep our secret safe
Is this love or is this hate?
I feel so scared.
Son of a bitch you broke my heart
I need a little loving
To take away the pain
How could you let me down
When I'm in your care?
Someone say surrender so I sulk.
Someone say sequester so I sink
Into little cubes that chill my drink.
'Cause I've been eyeing you ever since...
Adam saw the garden and jumped the fence.
But little did he know he'd lose a rib.
But staring at you now I'm glad he did.
'Cause it's been on my mind,
Forever it will stay throughout all time.
How did me become man,
Become men and then
Become man again,
Become me?
How did me become man,
Become men again,
Become man and then
Become me?
Four score and oratorical hyperbole.
Mouths move to fistfights to wage wars.
To lost limbs, backstabbed two-faced turncoats.
And then you clench-fist, beat chest.
Clench-fist, beat chest.
How did me become man,
Become men and then
Become man again,
Become me?
How did me become man,
Become men again,
Become man and then
Become me?
Become me
Become me
Become me

What do you want them all to see?
A blind man with blind faith is he your fuckin' enemy?
All he wants to do is survive this painful cancer.
You should be looking for the answer now.
And as the silence breaks.
Give him what he can take.
And he finds it hard to be alone.
And as the silence breaks give him what he can take: a way out.
Why don't you set it aside 'cause he's got nothing to hide you just put him down.
And as the silence breaks give him what he can take: no way out.
He hides behind the door.
You've got it locked and bolted down.
Can't see behind the door.
Come out. Come out. Come out.
It's time to show the world.
God gave you wings to fly.
So fly the fuck away.
Come out. Come out. Come out.
And Jesus saves.
God gave you wings to fly.
And as the silence breaks.
Give him what he can take: a way out.
Why don't you set it aside
'Cause he's got nothing to hid you just put him down Go!
What do you want them all to see?
A blind man with blind faith is he your fuckin' enemy?
Come out. Come out. Come out.
(You make me sick)
You make me sick
(You make me sick)
You make me sick
Leave me alone
Take off your hands
Or you'll be through
I'm with my friends
Your eyes fill with greed
Your breath, so thick
I'll take the lead
You screwup, you make me sick
I hit you once more
You [stick?] around
You're a fucking prick
That's what you're about
Heart full of hate
Sucker in my hand
Almost feeling [safe?]
You just go ahead
Teeth are rotten
Like the pain inside
Teeth are rotten
It's me
Teeth are rotten
Like the pain inside
Teeth are rotten
It's me
It's me
You make me sick
My knees are weak
You act like you're possessed
The fable you speak
You're not the one impressed
I look for power within me
I call it my own [?]
It's growing inside me
And I'm not alone
You make me sick
You make me sick
(You make me sick)
You make me sick
Teeth are rotten
Like the pain inside
Teeth are rotten
It's me
Teeth are rotten
Like the pain inside
Teeth are rotten
It's me
It's me
Teeth are rotten
It's me
It's me
It's me
It's me
A restless reaction to what I witness.
Taught to believe that ignorance is strength.
A dystopic creation dividing a nation.
Theocratic agendas breeding fear from hate.
A last chance to rectify.
A fading hope now lost in time.
To retain control of an open mind.
To recoup the losses and fall in line.
Waiting in worry for the confirmation of information
Which proves to be a case of history repeating.
This is a call to arms.
This is a call to war.
This is a call instilling fear in all.
This is a rallying cry.
This is a reason to die.
Divided we stand and united we fall.
Tension mounting with every moment.
Ascending faster than the speed of sound.
Suffice to say we succumb to combat.
Sending our successors to the battleground.
A sole voice to justify a reason for so many to decry.
Intolerance and faith confides that death is product of peace in time.
I'm bad
I'm bad
Like Jesse James, uh-huh
I had a friend one time
Least I thought I did
He come to me
Said, 'Johnny?'
Said, 'What man?'
'I'm outdoor'
I say, 'Yeah?'
I taken the cat in
Get him a place to stay
And I found out
He goin' 'round town
Tellin' ev'rybody that he
He got my wife
Then I gets mad
I goes to the cat
Like a good guy should
I said, 'Look man
'I'm gonna warn, you just one time'
Next time I warn you'
'I'm gonna use my gun'
'Cause I'm mad, I'm bad, like Jesse James
I'm so mad, I'm so mad.
I'm gonna ruin you this mornin'.
I've got three boys
Do my dirty work
Now, you don't see me
I'm the big boss
I do the payin' off
After they take care of you
In their on way
They may shoot you
They may cut you.
They may drown you
I just don't know
I don't care
Long as they take care of you
In their on way
I'm so mad, I'm bad this mornin', like Jesse James.
They gon' take you right down
By the riverside
Now four is goin' down
Ain't but three comin' back
You read between the line
We're gonna have a deal
'Cause I'm mad, I'm bad, like Jesse James.
They gonna tie yo' hands
They gonna tie yo' feet
They gonna gag your throat
Where you can't holler none
An cryin' won't help you none
Set you in the water
Yeah, the bubbles comin' up.
Whoa
Rrrrrrr
Rrrrrrr
Oh yeah, I'm so mad!
Maybe I'm insane walking on a wire 
Maybe I'm the same, nothing to take me higher 
Tell me where to start, think I'm at the end 
Right now feeling pain, make it go away 
Maybe I'm to blame, maybe I'm a liar 
Maybe we're the same, nothing can stop the fire 
I can't feel my heart, but I feel the shame 
Nothing left to say, soon I'll fade away 
These places all I ever think about is lost in time 
These faces haunting me, I'm looking back and they are mine 
I'm hiding from the things they say
Doing time, been led astray 
Thinking back to times of yesterday, I could die 
I'm trying to find a better way, but I'm trapped, can't get away 
All I think is about yesterday, I could die
Maybe I'm insane, walking on a wire 
Maybe I'm the same, nothing to take me higher 
I can't feel my heart, but I feel the shame 
Nothing left to say, soon I'll fade away 
These places all I ever think about is lost in time 
These faces haunting me, I'm looking back and they are mine 
I'm hiding from the things they say
Doing time, been led astray 
Thinking back to times of yesterday, I could die 
I'm trying to find a better way, but I'm trapped, can't get away 
All I think is about yesterday, I could die
I'll never forget you,
But your time to leave is way past due,
I have this overwhelming urge,
To suck in one good breath and scream,
There is no love left inside of me...
This isn't the first time,
That I've fallen apart infront of an audience,
(Though) the words have changed,
The message stays the same,
I tried reason
It was all in vain,
I wish it didn't have to be, but this song is for you
Now that's entertainment,
To watch me fall apart at the knees,
And grovel like a slave who,
Is begging for a little sympathy,
And you danced around on my broken dreams,
Celebrated when I made mistakes,
This song was written about how much I hate you...
And through all the worst of time,
I sat and took it almost every time,
I tried to scream but it didn't work,
I tried to leave but it didn't work,
I wish it didn't have to be but this song is for you...
Now that's entertainment,
To watch me fall apart at the knees,
And grovel like a slave who,
Is begging for a little sympathy,
And you danced around on my broken dreams,
Celebrated when I made mistakes,
This song was written about how much I hate you...
I tried to scream but it didn't work,
I tried to leave but it didn't work,
I tried, I tried to...
Now that's entertainment,
To watch me fall apart at the knees,
And grovel like a slave who,
Is begging for a little sympathy,
And you danced around on my broken dreams,
Celebrated when I made mistakes,
I hate you,
I hate you,
I hate you,
I hate you,
This must be love
Detox, Detox where are you?
You coulda saved me from a disaster
What with all these cell phone numbers
It's gonna be weeks cleaning off my dresser
I love it, I hate it
I can't live without
I love it, I hate it, baby
The first time's the worst time
Then you become so uncomfortably numb
That you can't hide the fake smile
Stare into space with a look on your face
That says: gotta get outta Los Angeles
So blind I can't see
Gotta get outta Los Angeles
Gotta get Los Angeles
Outta me
Sober, sober, send yourself over
I did it again last night
I wasted a good conversation
'Bout music and God
On an outta work coked up, A&R guy
I love it, I hate it
I can't live without
I love it, I hate it, baby
The first time's the worst time
Then you become so uncomfortably numb
That you can't hide the fake smile
Stare into space with a look on your face
That says: gotta get outta Los Angeles
So blind I can't see

WAR!
Our government is fucked
Sure to bring us down
The media incites civil unrest
Hatred can bring you down
WAR!
I don't want your war
WAR!
We don't need your war
We don't need your war
WAR!
Military beasts starvin countries
Drama brings you to your knees
Spill your blood to save humanity
Dyin' for the food we feed
Our government is fucked
Sure to bring us down
The media incites civil unrest
Hatred can bring you down
Injustice drives you crazy
It drive L.A. insane
In this generation
Hatred is the name
WAR!
L.A. '92
Bastard magic should make you cry
The answer to the question is we ain't gonna die
L.A. '92
Police can make me under stress
While all L.A.'s a fuckin' mess
Don't patronise my fuckin' ass
Some heads will get crashed
L.A. '92
Bush has got his upper cut
He's goin' to fuckin' war
He won't revert to sticks and stones
Just bullet holes and broken bones
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Don't give a fuck!
Everybody knock ya down
No weight support so taken down
The juk-jock, ??? ??? ???
We ain't got shit, now had enough
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Don't give a fuck!
Disorder! (x8)
You knocked me out
You bit my lip
You held me down and kept me sober
Through all this time
No regret
I guess that's just the way I liked it
Maybe, when I'm free
I'll realize all he really wanted
To share all the peace
Something I never wanted
So wait, don't go
Seems as though it's getting scary
So please, don't you go
Wait, don't you go
You knocked me out
I could never feel the same
I pushed you over
And here we will remain
Confusion who do you
And nothing's right
Nobody but you has to, hold onto the fight
Just before you cry
Won't change you
It won't change me
And I don't even wonder why
Want, touch, feel so much
In life, yeah we cry
I know, baby I know
But see I'm waking
I feel, I touch, I breathe, I cry
I know this
So wait, wait
I said please, smile just before you cry
Don't you go
You knocked me out
I could never be the same
I pushed you over
But here we still remain
You knocked me out
I could never be the same
I can take the fight
But don't
Don't you turn away
You knocked me out
You bit my lip
You held me down and kept me sober
We've been climbing uphill together
For three years and counting
Life kicks us when we're down but we
(We just keep trying!)
What else can we do?
Dwell on the past and it will bury you
But it's getting harder to look ahead
With all these conflicting thoughts in my head
The days are too dark
And they last too fucking long
That's why we made a promise
That's why we carved it in stone
And where it was written
Is where it will fucking stay
It's the sword that we live by
Even if it means we have to die this way
(Destination: death or better days!) (x3)
When we've had enough
We've had enough
There's something inside of us that can't be touched
We are! We are! We are unbreakable!
(We are! We are!) We are unbreakable! (x4)
This is where it ends
Guess I'm putting my foot down
I'm sick of second guessing and I'm 
Fucking sick of falling down!
Rock bottom is a beautiful start
We're rising up to show the world our scars
From a former life that we'd rather not hide
(This is our time!)
(Destination: death or better days!) (x3)
Destination!
Civilized
I've got quite a mouthful going here
Maybe I should spit it in your face
I been back and forth and up and down again
Maybe you should stay below the waist
You said nothing's to negotiate
But you could still appreciate my point
I'm rolling up beginnings
And you've been smoking up the ends 'til you explode
Come on now, explode
Why can't we keep this civilized?
Why can't the girl just shut her mouth?
Expose the nature of this crime
In digging up our ground
Why can't we keep this civilized?
You'll pick a fight with anyone
Not saying you deserve to die
Just saying you deserve yourself
Put your claws around me baby
And squeeze a little harder with your arms
When I met you I was weaker
And I'm coming out a man, set your alarm
Don't worry about your reputation
I won't say a word - except right now
Emotional, emotional
Well you got some devotional for pain
And me
Why can't we keep this civilized?
Why can't the girl just shut her mouth?
Expose the nature of this crime
In digging up our ground
Why can't we keep this civilized?
You'll pick a fight with anyone
Not saying you deserve to die
Just saying you deserve yourself
Can't we keep this civilized?
Can't the girl just shut her mouth?
Not saying you deserve to die
Just saying you deserve yourself
Can't we keep this civilized?
Can't the girl just shut her mouth?
Not saying you deserve to die
Just saying you deserve yourself
Can't we keep this civilized?
Can't the girl just shut her mouth?
Not saying you deserve to die
Just saying you deserve yourself
You follow me on the fucking street
You make me feel like a piece of meat
You think I don't know what war means
Now I'm the terrorist see how it feels
I'm going to kill you
I'll cut you up, gouge out your eyes
I'm going to kill you
I'm not your prey, I'll make you die
On my mouth, there is a gag
Everything I say is wrong
You laugh at me and knock me down
Now your turn is coming around
I'm going to kill you
I'll cut you up, gouge out your eyes
I'm going to kill you
I'm not your prey, I'll make you die
I'm not kidding
And I've had it just about to here
And I'm not kidding 
I threaten everything you hold dear
You follow me on the fucking street
You make me feel like a piece of meat
You think I don't know what war means
Now I'm the terrorist see how it feels
I'm going to kill you
I'll cut you up, gouge out your eyes
I'm going to kill you
I'm not your prey, I'll make you die
To you it's another day
To me it's a grim reaping
Just another shooting star
Strung out on your wire
Prick my finger
On his virgin silver
He took me raw, ginger
Caramelize me
Tombigbee, Tombigbee, help me hang these bones
Got to hang these bones out to dry
He loved me, he loved me, ravishingly low
Gonna hang these bones out to dry
Dry, dry, dry
Got a blackberry stain
And they're not even in season
If you're not yet a woman
You got no business playing this
Tombigbee, Tombigbee, help me hang these bones
Got to hang these bones out to dry
He loved me, he loved me, ravishingly low
Got to hang these bones out to dry
Dry, dry, dry
So you get done then you get some
Sure enough it won't hold you for long
Then you say, "Right. This is all mine."
But hasn't your donor card expired?
From Blueridge to Cattail on the prairie 
From fly over country, back through Mississippi
I said, "Go." Man you go
But you raise me twenty, I'm raising you five-
Hundred treaties signed by your fathers' lies
Go, man, you go
'Cause I'm trailing her tears
The ones you won't hold
You roll me a carpet, roll me a carpet, boy
Roll me a carpet from here to Oklahoma
Tombigbee, Tombigbee, help me hang these bones
Got to hang these bones out to dry
He loved me, he loved me, ravishingly low
Got to hang these bones out to dry
Dry, dry, dry
I'll do it again
Dry, dry, dry, dry
There was life here once
The tension, the harshness of life
Lost in the flow of time
Now comes crumbling down
The land will be covered in darkness
Premonitions of sorrow and anger, even so
Things rush on, fleeing, changing
Never facing it, straight on
To all things under creation...
Never facing it, straight on
Day the Earth caught fire
People wander aimlessly
The great spring of life runs dry
Come face to face with a world of darkness
Now comes crumbling down
The land will be covered in darkness
You may high hat me all the time
You may never go my way
Mother Earth is waitin' for you
That's the debt you got to pay
I don't care how great you are
Or what you're worth
When it all comes down
You got to go back to Mother Earth
You may own half a city
Diamonds and pearls
You may have your own airplane
You may fly all over this world
Don't give a damn what you 're worth
When it all comes down
You got to go back to Mother Earth
Play the horses, baby
You may own the race track
You may have enough money
To buy anything you lack
Don't care how great you are
Don't give a damn what you 're worth
'Cause when it all comes down
You got to go back to Mother Earth
You may high hat me all the time
You may never go my way
Mother Earth is waitin' for you
That's the debt you got to pay
I don't care how great you are
Or what you're worth
When it all comes down
You got to go back to Mother Earth
Yeah I'm running hot
I'm running hot
I'm running hotter and hotter and hotter
As the years go by I can't deny the flame that burns inside me
Many times I wonder why I still act the same way
Something burning inside, I get hotter and hotter
Got green lights standing in my way
Hotter and hotter, hotter and hotter, hotter and hotter, oh Yeah I refuse, I refuse
To standing around being abused
I'm already gone when you turn your head
Don't point your finger of blame
You see me burning like the sun in your eyes
And you want to slow down but I just have to fly
I'm hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter as the days go on, man
Hotter and hotter
As the days go on
Year after year after year after year
I'm on fire
You can't stop me
No need, no need to ever burn out. I'm scorching and torching no time for front porching.
Hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter... and hotter
Hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter
The days go on and the years go by and I'm hotter and hotter and flying on by
Better looking less of same I'm on my way to up the road to the next thing
You see me burning hotter and hotter and the years go by
You wonder to yourself how come that man hasn't burned out
Don't ask me why
Got green lights in front of me
Getting hotter and hotter you see
Hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter... oh yeah
Hotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter you see
Hotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter you see
Gasoline for breakfast, Napalm for lunch
Hotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter... yeah ... yeah ... yeah
I don't need no fortune
I don't need no fame
That's all just an illusion
To me it don't mean a thing
You can try and deceive me
But I see right through your skin
And what you're trying to tell me
Is something I don't believe in
Don't tell me how to live my life
Don't tell me how to pray
Don't tell me how to sing my song
Don't tell me what to say
'Cause I believe that miracles
Happen every day
I don't care what you say,
I'm gonna do it my way
You say you have all the answers
And I should do it your way
How many times do I have to tell you
I ain't no puppet on a string
Listen to me...
Don't tell me how to live my life
Don't tell me how to pray
Don't tell me how to sing my song
Don't tell me what to say
'Cause I believe that miracles
Happen every day
I don't care what you say,
I'm gonna do it my way
I'm gonna do it my way
What'd you say
Oh
Oh
Oh
Don't tell me how to live my life
Don't tell me how to pray
Don't tell me how to sing my song
Don't tell me what to say
Don't tell me how to live my life
Don't tell me how to pray
Don't tell me how to sing my song
Don't tell me what to say
'Cause I believe that miracles
Happen every day
I don't care what you say
I'm gonna do it my way
I'm gonna do it my way
Oh I'm gonna do it my way
Olet niin kaunis
Pala Jumalaa
Rakkauden meri
Tehty tulesta
Olet niin kaunis
Ja tahtoisin loytaa sen kaiken
Minka kadotin
Olet niin kaunis
Ei ketaan toista oo
Ei ole aikaa juosta pakoon
Turvallista matkaa helvetiin
Turvallista matkaa helvetiin
En tahdo menna takaisin
Olet niin kaunis
Mutta nukahtanut
Niinkuin Atlantis kerran
Niin vajonnut
Turvallista matkaa helvetiin
Turvallista matkaa helvetiin
En tahdo menna takaisin
Turvallista matkaa helvetiin
Turvallista matkaa helvetiin
En tahdo menna takaisin
My friends call me enemy 'cause they're a fucking joke
They'd better get their shit together it's time that they awoke
I'm cast out by my relatives 'cause they don't want me around
I just sit in a corner and I don't make a sound - Not one word
The walls are closing in on me
I don't know what to do
Tell me who is who
Tell me who is who
Tell me who is who
Policemen are my friends so why do they always stare
Raid our clubs bust out parties condemned for short hair
Teachers are my friends so why do they make me stand
In front of a class of gawking fools who'll never understand - They never understand
The world around me falls apart
I don't know what to do
Please tell me who is who
Tell me who is who
Tell me who is who
The world around me falls apart
I don't know what to do
Please tell me who is who
Tell me who is who
Tell me who is who
Tell me who is who
Tell me who is who
Tell me who is who
Don't thank me for what you've got
I've given you love
I've given you too much thought
Don't blame me for sinking the ship
You're a hopeless liar and a hypocrite
Only you know, only you know
Only you know, only you know
Don't thank me for what you've got
I've given you love
I've given you too much thought
Don't shame me for calling it quits
You're a hopeless cynic I'm an optimist
Only you know, only you know
Only you know, only you know
Ha!
Don't hate me for what you've got
I've given you drugs
I've given you too much thought
Don't blame me for flunking the test
I would rather think that you were honest
Don't blame me cause you got caught
You've given me up you've taken everything I got
Those lies came straight from your mouth
I never dreamed that you would be a sellout
Only you know, only you know
Only you know, only you know
Don't use me as your last crutch
I've taken you in, I've trusted you way too much
Don't wear me around your wrist
You should have thought it through before you blew it
Same day... same life
Different person
Your ghost... my pride
Perfect union
Same day... same life
Different person
Your ghost... my pride
Perfect union
Don't hate me for what you've got, I've given you love
I've given you too much thought
Don't shame me, for sinking the ship
You're a hopeless liar and a hypocrite
Don't hate me for what you're not
I'm aiming your gun
I'm lining up the perfect shot
Don't waste me on something stupid like this
I would rather die than take your bullet
I would rather die than take your bullet
I would rather die than take your bullet
I would rather die than take your bullet
Than take your bullet
Than take your bullet
Than take your bullet
Only you know, only you know (different person)
Only you know, only you know (different person)
While he was schemin'
I was leanin' in the Beamer just beamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman Marcus on a shoppin' spree, ah
And on the way I grabbed Sole and Mia
And as the cash box rang, I thought everything away 
Oops, there goes the dreams we used to say
Oops, there goes the time we spent away
Oops, there goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for it that now
Oops, there goes the house we made a home
Oops, there goes you'll never leave me alone
Oops, for all the lies you told
This is what you owe
Hey, ladies, when your man wanna get buckwild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get ya hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
While he was braggin'
I was comin' down the hill just a-draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
And I paid all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fade away, away
Oops, there goes the dreams we used to say
Oops, there goes the time we spent away
Oops, there goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for it that now
Oops, there goes the house we made a home
Oops, there goes you'll never leave me alone
Oops, for all the lies you told
This is what you owe
Hey, ladies, when your man wanna get buckwild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get ya hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes

Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days
When we used to trust each other?
And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get 'em back without me
'Cause revenge is better than money, you see
Hey, ladies, when your man wanna get buckwild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get ya hands on his cash and
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
(Hey, ladies)
Hey, ladies
Hey, ladies
Hey, ladies, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa
(Oh)
Oh, no
Oh, no, yeah

Hit 'em up

Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get ya hands on his cash and
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
Once, once is really something twice
It's just a tease for a little more
One more time I've gotta ask you
Come over here 'cause I got something I'd like to say
Once, once is real easy then
Twice, your just begging for a little more
One more time I've gotta ask you, come over here
'Cause I've got something I've gotta say
It may seem easy for you to penetrate what you
Intend to deny, but when it comes back around
Is death the only way to get attention?
Once, once is real early but twice came back
And it got a little rough,
And there I stand in the middle, and I was
By myself like before,
Yeah once, once is real conniving, it's easy now,
When your conniving with me.
You step in my way, well now I have a little more to say.
It may seem easy for you to recognize
What you intend to ignore, but when it cuts back round,
Well death is a sick way for attention
I think there's a little more to be said.
They cut the cord, it cuts everything that's living in me,
Well it all dies anyway
I thought that that might disappear but you penetrate
The will to deny and I'm standing in the dark all over again,
Oh lie on me, that's all I want is you to lie on me,
Why did I see the birds an the sidewalk today,
Split open inside and why do I hear the birds when they're
Squawking over my head, don't let me down
Don't come down on me,
'Cause I just want to know, I need just a little
More time to explain myself.
Once, once is real easy, then twice,
*
Just ??? for a little more.
*
One more time I've gotta ask you,
Come over here, sit down, I've got somethin'
That's just begging to get out
Once, once is real conniving,
And twice, you're just begging for a little more
One more time, I'm gonna need you, I can tell
It may seem easy for you to penetrate
Your will to ignore, but when it cuts back round
Death is the sickest way for attention.
Here we are back to play the same old games
As if things never changed
The blood still tastes the same
Ash to ash, back to back, and dusk to dusk
You look so upper-crust
So rich with broken trust
Can you hear your conscience's crying
Wash the fields of dead and dying
Ex-acquaintances
Jogging over skulls and leg bones
Drown the crunch out with your headphones
If you're so rich then pay for what you've done
Under the influence
Under the influence
Keep me off the road when you're around me
Under the influence
Under the influence
My love, you make me sick
There you are a tool of their firmiliar game
Your lies still smell the same
Your kind are still to blame
Upper class
This machine you built to last
You'd better spend it fast
I'm about to break the spell you cast
I'll bury you next to your ego
And mark the grave to burn when we go
Up in flames again
Now I'm not afraid to kill this
You are but a fleeting illness
The emptier, the easier to break
Let the clock spin sweetly on it's way
And your face will blur and fade away
Wash your hands, they reek of what you've done
Just a fraud, just having fun
Under the influence
Under the influence
Keep me off the road when you're around me
Under the influence
So insignificant
My love you make me
Oh, now dance for me you fucking puppet
Ora che sono Ora che sono qui
In questo stupido stupido hotel
E non sei qui con me.
Tutto mi sembra inutile
tutto mi sembra com'e
Farmi la barba o uccidere
Che differenza c'e?
Hai gia pronto il piano di recupero
Io vado preso, vado preso e hai
sempre ragione tu
Per il mio limite
Io non so stare solo
Vivere insieme a me
Basta aspettarmi uscire...
E prendermi con se
Credi che sia facile
Credi che sia semplice
Vai a farti fottere
Credi che sia
Una storia semplice
Cielo senza nuvole
Un amore utile
Sempre alla ricerca DOV'E??
Uhu dov'e? Fin li!!
Dov'e?...uh! dov'e...
Questa felicita!

DOV'E??
Well I'm as old as the hills
And young as the day
Nobody sees things, in quite the same way
Computers and shovels, churches and brothels
Mannequins and skeletons, cities and dustbowls
Here we go here we go again
Hear the clamour of the feeding pen
New day new way all my friends can say
Cyclone fences in the cybernetic orchard
Miracle drugs, discount bulk purchase
Sacred in the forest, fast food in the kiosk
Cardboard dinners and the saints and the sinners
I don't want to run and hide
I've seen it all from either side
Truth and fiction must collide someday
God knows, God knows, God knows it's been fun
Ah, sweet sensation, the oldest temptation
Now throughout the ages, we've been a' turning all those pages
Now each generation you've got to choose a new location
Got to reach out, got to sync up, build up, get up, to a stronger foundation
God knows, God knows, God knows it's been fun
(Garrett/Moginie)
If you want the big one
You'll have to queue nd if you do, you're gonna get some
If you want the big one
You'll have to queue and if you do, you're gonna get some
This is, this is, this is Cape Connection
This is, this is, this is Cape Connection
Deep south, way down and out, where heads hang from the trees
Sleepy from the poison, bitten by a snake tracking her so cruelly
She calls my name, but she's just one of millions
If you want the big one
You'll have to queue and if you do, you're gonna get some
Yeah, you want the big one
You'll have to queue and if you do, you're gonna get some
Flowers are for romance, here the fun begins
Pennies for your thoughts and dollars for your sins
Standing to attention, waiting for the call
Treat yourself at leisure, relax and have a ball
Yeah, you want the big one
You'll have to queue and if you do, you're gonna get some
This is, this is, this is Cape Connection
London town is traffic hell, it's freezeframed in 3-D
Drunken and pedestrian, taken from behind
Welcomes me so willingly
She calls my name - coming, baby, coming
If you want the big one
You'll have to queue and if you do, you're gonna get some
Yeah, you want the big one
You'll have to queue and if you do, you're gonna get some
This is, this is, this is Cape Connection
This is, this is, this is Cape Connection
This is, this is, this is Cape Connection
This is, this is, this is Cape Connection
Blood in face
Pain causing fear
Blood, entrails
Dead, scaring real
The blood on your face
Disgrace
Wrong time, wrong place
A gun to your head
Bloodshed
Wrong time, wrong place
Am I treading in your flow
Well maybe I don't wanna know
That we are gone before we go
And you are upside down
Waiting in the sweet debris
To shock you into loving me
I'm not the way I used to be
And I am still alive
And I am still alive
I am not your pretty thing
I am not your pretty thing
I am not your pretty thing
Your seventeen or prom queen anymore
I might be too good for you
And maybe you could get a clue
I'll let you salt my wounds
So tell me who's pretty now
I don't know how a creep can sleep
And why your talk is always cheap
And what you're sowing you will reap
You sure get around
And you sure get around
I am not your pretty thing
I am not your pretty thing
I am not your pretty thing
Your seventeen or prom queen anymore
And you can't have the sun at the same time as the rain
And you can't be wild and then be tame
'Cause I just found out you were caught bein' nasty
With a whole lot to say, a whole lot to say
That's insane
I am sane, I am sane
I am sane, I am sane
I am not your pretty thing
I am not your pretty thing
I am not your pretty thing
Your seventeen or prom queen anymore
I am not your pretty thing
I am not your pretty thing
I am not your pretty thing
Your seventeen or prom queen anymore
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before, couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?
Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could, I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'
It comes alive
It comes alive
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
Been here before
Been here before
I'm frantic in your soothing arms 
I cannot sleep in this down-filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore
Cross my heart hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon
It comes alive
It comes alive
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
Get the fuck out of here
I just wanna get the fuck away from me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I hate it all, why? Why? Why me?
I cannot sleep with a head like this
I wanna cry, I wanna scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I wanna hate it all away
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
Yeah, takes me away
Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Tomorrow I'll be back home
"We are now approaching lunar sunrise, and, uh, for all the people back on Earth, the crew of Apollo 8 has a message that we would like to send to you.
God created the heaven and the earth.
And God said,
And God said, Let there be light.
God saw the light, that it was good.
God saw the light, that it was good.
And God said, Let there be light."
Breathing an air
Permeated, soaked in darkness
Emanating from within
Resonating like a scream no one can hear
I wear this chaos well
Though none should save me
Desperation keeps me here
My need for innocence
The place where I began
The abyss becomes me
I wear this chaos well
Are these not words of heresy,
A venom on my lips, a poison?
My spirit impurified
In everything I choose to say
"And God said, Let there be light."
With you, I stand in hope
That God will save us from ourselves
Every cry a wasted moment
Until another day is lost
Even lands we once called home
Lie undiscovered and unknown
Only Heaven's silence for an answer
And did our laughter, did our tears
Have some purpose after all?
Did we toil in vain, in hope
That wisdom came from what we'd done?
Even lands we once called home
Lie undiscovered and unknown
Only Heaven's silence for an answer
(Undiscovered and unknown)
"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
And God saw the light, that it was good:
And God divided the light from the darkness.
God created the heaven and the earth.
And God saw the light, that it was good:
And God said, Let there be light."
Are these not words of heresy,
A venom on my lips, a poison?
My spirit impurified
In everything I choose to say
If I would shed my skin, the layers left
But not the lessons learned
It would not undo what I have done
Or grant forgiveness in some better days
With you, I stand in hope
That God will save us from ourselves
Every cry a wasted moment
Until another day is lost
Even lands we once called home
Lie undiscovered and unknown
Only Heaven's silence for an answer
And did our laughter, did our tears
Have some purpose after all?
Did we toil in vain, in hope
That wisdom came from what we'd done?
Even lands we once called home
Lie undiscovered and unknown
Only Heaven's silence for an answer
Doubt stripping the soul
 Unending questions driving me into insanity
 Time took its toll,
 Enough to ensure,
 The mind cannot mirror the soul
 With each tide,
 The will corrodes further
 Relentless grip,
 Squeezing out the life,
 Of this shipwrecked body,
 Lost in the gallows of hopes and dreams...
 Reality crumbles,
 Shivering, as truth lay bare
 And roads of nonchalance grew upon...
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment...
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
(Yo) His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope
 
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's
Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)
No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)
You can do anything you set your mind to, man.
The landlady's husband came up to town today
Since he left them both ten years ago to serve the ministry
The dark down road of his approach in constant rain was drenched
The tenant's boy said "How d'ya do" then swore in French
Did you teach this little child these curses on my soul
You should both be shut down in the coal-hole
That's the way to treat a child who cries out in the night
And a woman who teaches wrong from right
He's a Battered Old Bird
And he's living up there
There's a place where time stands still
If you keep taking those little pink pills
"Hush your mouth you hypocrite"
His humour cut her deep
The tight lipped leer of judgement
That had seen her love desert her just like sleep
"Filthy words on children's lips are better, my dear spouse
Then if I were to speak my mind about this house"
He's a Battered Old Bird
And he's living up there
There's a place where time stands still
If you keep taking those little pink pills
On the first floor there are two old maids
Each one wishing that the other was afraid
And next door to them is a man so mild
'Til he chopped off the head of a visitor's child
He danced upon the bonfire
Swallowed sleeping pills like dreams
With a bottle of sweet sherry that everything redeems
He's a Battered Old Bird
And he's living up there
There's a place where time stands still
If you keep taking those little pink pills
And on the second floor is the Macintosh Man
He's in his overcoats more than out of them
And the typewriter's rattling all through the night
He's burgundy for breakfast tight
He says "One day I'll throw away all of my cares
And it is always Christmas in a cupboard at the top of the stairs"
He's a Battered Old Bird
And he's living up there
There's a place where time stands still
If you keep taking those little pink pills
"Well here's a boy if ever there was
Who's going to do big things
That's what they all say and that's how the trouble begins
I've seen them rise and fall
Been through their big deals and smalls
He'd better have a dream that goes beyond four walls"
You think he should be sent outside playing with the traffic
When pieces of him are already scattered in the attic
DJ Khaled:

Turn on the lights, paint me a tapestry
Go start a fire, get close to the gasoline
I followed you to the deep end
I was helpless but still you pulled me in
Now I'm caught in the tide
Lost in the eyes of envy
For whom it concerns
Some never learn
She lacerated me, exposing me piece by piece
She saw a weakness in me, and used it against me
She lacerated me
Turn out the lights, make me a porcelain doll
Whisper your secrets, can't get to the truth at all
I reached out again and again
I could never believe you'd do me in
Now I'm caught in the tide
Lost in the eyes of envy
For whom it concerns
Some never learn
She lacerated me, exposing me piece by piece
She saw a weakness in me, and used it against me
She lacerated me, and now I have nowhere to go
She lacerated me
She lacerated me, and now I have nowhere to go
She lacerated me, release me from all I see
She lacerated me
She lacerated me
As you're walkin' down the street
Might wanna skip a beat
And think it over
Walkin' to the corner store
But it ain't there no more
If you wanna loaf of bread
You try a pharmacy instead
Another chain will set you free
When you go to pay the rent
You see it's all been spent
The purse is empty
Money money make a buck
But you're all outta luck
This town ain't friendly now
A thousand faces stare you down
Each one's afraid of what you seek
Slither in your suit, can't deny it
Hide behind a view, gentrify it
Take a life or two, the revolution's comin' round
Clingin' to the door, quiver, cower
Profit off the poor, fight the power
Hurt 'em even more, that's why they took Bruce Bailey down
Took Bruce Bailey down
Lookin' like the jack is back
But he ain't gonna attack
His hands are flippin
Druggies dyin' in the halls
They're bangin' on the walls
Your ma ain't trippin' now
It ain't a home if you ain't allowed
What time's the ceasefire
Where's the heat
Spittin' on the old, sister, brother
Shittin on your soul, welfare mother
Profit is the goal, the revolution's comin' round
Payin' off a loan, mass eviction
Elevate the zone, ain't no fiction
Breakin up a home, that's why they took Bruce Bailey down
Took Bruce Bailey down
No more tokens, take a train
You swipe a piece of plastic paper
No more smokin' on the plane
You gripe, they'll take you to the jailer
Bide your time, it's all in vain
They tell you, as you meet your maker
Grief's the mother of invention
Pain's the midwife to your labor
Turn it, burn it, cure it, endure it
If you are able, sucker
People standin in the park
It's gettin' mighty dark
The kids are scowlin
Shutter up the windows tight
This is an evil night
The wind is howlin fast
Another tragedy has passed
Another stain on you and me
Slither in your suit, can't deny it
Hide behind a view, gentrify it
Take a life or two, the revolution's comin' round
Clingin to the door, quiver, cower
Profit off the poor, fight the power
Hurt 'em even more, that's why they took Bruce Bailey down
Took Bruce Bailey down
Spittin' on the old, sister, brother
Shittin on your soul, welfare mother
Profit is the goal, the revolution's comin' round
Payin' off a loan, mass eviction
Elevate the zone, ain't no fiction
Breakin up a home, that's why they took Bruce Bailey down
Took Bruce Bailey down
It's just been too long
Is what they're sayin'
I show them my mask
And they don't know
How it's stuck in my head
And it just won't go away
I miss it so much
How did it come to be?
I'm livin' with remains of me
In this loneliness I'll see
I could leave you alone
Now what they say
Is just stay away
Mask in my hands
Now they all know
The closer I get
The more I'm pushed away
I want it so much
How did it come to be?
I'm livin' with remains of me
And in this lonliness
I'm gonna show you
How I could leave you
To love you
To need you
To take you down
I love you
Now that it's all been seen
There's no one left for me to be
And in this honesty you'll see
I won't leave you
To love you
To need you
To take you down
I love you
I fuckin' love you
I love you
I'll never, never, never leave you
Like a shadow in the night
Swallows up that city light
Like fire in the rain
Gets put out again
Like a weapon kept concealed
Explosive elements reveal
A criminal inside of you
No ground to stand, nothing to lose
The distribution of wealth
What a fucking scam
That's why its hard to survive in this so called promise land
You gotta do what you gotta do to get by
Facilitate that permanent high
Smoke filled lungs inside of you
It's hard to dream of glory when you got something to prove
Sometimes we're all victims of depression and unrest
Some people got no heart, that's just the way it's always been
Some never find what their looking for
Few get what they want, and fewer get more
Sometimes you gotta cross that line
When you ain't got enough to get by
Like an angel lost in hell
I walk a path I know so well
I feel lost in a familiar way, another memory I can't explain
'Cause it's the bottle that seems to flow
Through another day of the drunk unknown
I'm looking for a fight, at 11.15 on a Saturday night
Wake up on Sunday morning
To the sound of breaking glass and sirens calling
Bricks and bottles in the street
Alert the police, 'cause it's a state of emergency
And the traffic lights all go blinking red
And a voice on the radio says 'get out while you can'
And in the gridlock panic sets in
And there ain't no engine built fast enough
To outride the Armageddon
And if you don't give it up I'm gonna take it
And if you don't give it up I'm gonna take it
And if you don't give it up I'm gonna take it
And how long did you think you could keep me tricked?
I'll be cold walking through the backbay flinging bricks
Like a shadow in the night
Swallows up that city light
Like fire in the rain
Gets put out again
Like a weapon kept concealed
Explosive elements reveal
A criminal inside of you
No ground to stand, nothing to lose
So hungry for what I seek
I, I, I strive for the best
My struggle is all I see
I, I, I'll never forget
You've seen it hurts me not to fight
But in the world it is right
Follow what you're told to be truthful
And hold on for a rough ride
So hungry for what I seek
I, I, I strive for the best
My struggle is all I see
I, I, I'll never forget
You've seen it hurts me not to fight
But in the world it is right
Follow what you're told to be truthful
And hold on for a rough ride
You've seen it hurts me not to fight
But in the world it is right
Follow what you're told to be truthful
And hold on for a rough ride
Solace redefined, 
And I can't even bring myself to try and figure, 
(Who I am) 
Rosaries and wine, 
Trying not to see exactly when and where you failed. 
Stare into the eyes of blood, 
They say that we chase dreams that don't exist, 
But you have tried so hard to find what's better than this. 
Running from myself, 
I'm running from the maladjusted boy I used to be, 
In sickness and in health, 
I would even be here if the walls were caving in. 
Stare into the eyes of blood,
They say that we chase dreams that don't exist, 
But you have tried so hard to find what's better than this.

Is it me? Is it really me? I cannot stand myself
Sometimes I hate myself for what I've done
Sometimes I hate myself for who I am
Sometimes I hate myself for what I've lost
Sometimes I hate myself for what went wrong
(x2)
Misguided by myself - full of fatal pride
Always gone too far - always over the edge
So full of arrogance - too blind to see the outside world
Running in circles - so bored of life
Is it me? Is it really me? I cannot stand myself
I against me, me against myself
I have become my enemy number one
I against me, me against myself
I have become my enemy number one
(x2)
I'm feeling so useless - I'm raping my mind
Sometimes I hate myself for being blind
Fighting myself - what will it be?
Sometimes I hate myself for hating me
Sometimes I hate myself for thinking twice
Sometimes I hate myself without compromise
Full of broken dreams - always on the run
Crushed by myself - I come undone
I against me, me against myself
I have become my enemy number one
I against me, me against myself
I have become my enemy number one
Absolution!
Tumour growing, filling life with deceit
Poisoned blood, your mothers worthless breed
Your vicious infestation of the weaker mind
The belief of higher purpose is yours not mine
Words of wisdom nowhere to be found
I spit on your thoughts of hallowed ground
Spreading your venom polluting the will
Brings out in me the scent for the kill
Damned be those stepping out of line
The toxins you spill are forced to decline
The lust of men is bound to win
Evil are those who call it sin
Venom
No absolution for those who think for themselves
Put in boxes, placed on the wicked shelf
Converting the world claiming your word is law
In the name of god you fight the unholy war
Words of wisdom nowhere to be found
I spit on your thoughts of hallowed ground
Spreading your venom polluting the will
Brings out in me the scent for the kill
Damned be those stepping out of line
The toxins you spill are forced to decline
The lust of men is bound to win
(Evil is not the lust of men)
Evil are those who call it sin
You're all liars, inside you are dead
To kill the snake you cut off the head
Living existences with no chance of scar
I'll take the Morningstar
(Solo: Heinz)
Can you hear them?
They're coming
They're in the signal
They're in my head
Is it only me?
Am the only one to be called?
This pounding in my ears
Is calling me to rule the world
Rule the universe
As the Master of your fate
Can you hear the drums?
Don't try to fight them, it's too late
Each time lord child
Approaches the eye
Forced to behold the vortex
To be inspired or run
But as I gazed into the vastness of time
I heard the sound of drums
Can you hear them?
They're coming
They're in the signal
They're in my head
Can you hear them?
They're coming
They're in the signal
They're in my head
In professor's guise
Oh, Doctor, Doctor
You have healed me
You are not alone
It took you far too long to see me
Now I lay in your arms
Mortally wounded in your care
I'll leave you here forever
Last of the timelords once again
(Don't leave me now 
Think of all we've done together
Think of all the vanquished foes
Think of all that we could be)
It would be hell for me
Imprisoned here forever
With you
(No, please! You've got to, please!
We're the only ones left!
Please just... Regenerate!)
Can you hear them?
(In my dreams they're calling)
They're coming
(And every waking moment)
They're in the signal
(I hear the vortex calling)
They're in my head
Can you hear them?
(I hear the sound)
They're coming
(The sound of drums)
They're in the signal
They're in my head
If they would tell you toll part
Will you intervene
Music is a weapon sounds like a threat
Let the bass paralaze

My kind we fight in the club

I dream I work I bleed
I say things that I don't really mean
I'm not into Jail-bait but my girlfriends only seventeen
Can I hit that can I rip that can I lick that Can I get that from behind
I'm murdering and stabbing so much vag I'm wanted for vagaside
I'm living a life of sin, no I don't have any friends
Now the rain is coming and I'm running from myself again

By the time the sun goes down
Now nigga you can rest in pieces
Lets ride yeah everybody gonna die
Fuck the world nigga ain't nobody getting out alive
Lets ride motherfucker we all gonna die

I paint a picture that's perfect so you can see what I'm saying
I state it perfectly clearly so that you know I ain't playing
'Cause I don't give a fuck about you or that shit that you're saying
Because you caught up in the matrix you blind you sleeping homie
I dream I work I bleed I say things that I don't really mean
But mostly when I drink too much and I'm smoking too much coush and
I'm under too much pressure I think I think too much
I can't find my piece of mind I feel like I'm losing touch
I feel this darkness coming over me
I can't take it I can't escape all this hating
It's my turn I'm retaliating now
By the time the sun goes down

No I won't stop I just rock and I battle your whole clique
You a homo you a trick silly faggot ass bitch
I expose that dirty bitch for the ho that she is;
Make her cry make her thighs twitch then cum on her tits
I'm a rock I'm a roll I'm a shock to your soul
When I flow niggas know I'm like malcolm on dope
Every note that I wrote will make you choke like joe smoke
On that hydro so high so I don't know where the time goes
I try to do right and I can't figure out
Why I get schizo and psycho I go Jeckle to Hyde
It's these voices inside it's that darkness above me
Makes me turn away from good to bad then to ugly
That's why drugs seem so lovely like a way to escape
All this ugliness above me how much more can we take
Till we break and we take back the world from these fake motherfuckers
I hate big brother uh do you think it's too late
I want to tell you all a story about a Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter that attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, "Mama, I got a note here, from the Harper Valley PTA"
Well, the note says, "Mrs. Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's been reported you've been drinking and running around with men and going wild
Now, we don't believe you should be bringing up your little girl this way" 
And it was signed by the Secretary of the Harper Valley PTA
Well, it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy, were they surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard, I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, "I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA"
"Now, there's Bobby Taylor sitting there, and seven times he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker, can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades off or completely down?"
"Now, Mr. Harper couldn't be here because he stayed too long at Kelley's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath, you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And you have the nerve to tell me that, as a mother, you think that I ain't fit?
Well, this is just a little patent place and you're all Harper Valley Hypocrites"
Now, I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way
That day my momma socked it to 'em, at the Harper Valley PTA
That day my momma socked it to 'em, at the Harper Valley PTA
Padded with power here they come
International loan sharks backed by the guns
Of market hungry military profiteers
Whose word is a swamp and whose brow is smeared
With the blood of the poor
Who rob life of its quality
Who render rage a necessity
By turning countries into labour camps
Modern slavers in drag as champions of freedom
Sinister cynical instrument
Who makes the gun into a sacrament -
The only response to the deification
Of tyranny by so-called "developed" nations'
Idolatry of ideology
North south east west
Kill the best and buy the rest
It's just spend a buck to make a buck
You don't really give a flying fuck
About the people in misery
IMF dirty MF
Takes away everything it can get
Always making certain that there's one thing left
Keep them on the hook with insupportable debt
See the paid-off local bottom feeders
Passing themselves off as leaders
Kiss the ladies shake hands with the fellows
Open for business like a cheap bordello
And they call it democracy
And they call it democracy
And they call it democracy
And they call it democracy
See the loaded eyes of the children too
Trying to make the best of it the way kids do
One day you're going to rise from your habitual feast
To find yourself staring down the throat of the beast
They call the revolution
IMF dirty MF
Takes away everything it can get
Always making certain that there's one thing left
Keep them on the hook with insupportable debt
Quando tu    metti in moto come me      senza te
quando tu    spacchi il vetro come me      senza te
quando stai     in agguato come me      senza te
quando sei     disperato       come me      senza te.
E quando torno a lei mi faccio quasi pena
e piu che non ci sei e piu che voglio te
voglio ancora le tue dita     che graffiano la schiena
lei non e una via d'uscita e forse non ce n'e...
E quando sei     disperato come me      senza te
quando sai     di essere sbagliato       come me
che muoio senza te...
E    me ne frego della liberta
stanotte vado e spacco la citta
con questo ago disperato in me...      senza te.
E allora annaffio il muro con il mio veleno
amore a muso duro accidenti a te!
Accidenti a questa vita che corre come un treno
no non c'e una via d'uscita lo so che non ce n'e!
Quando sei   disperato come me senza te disperato
quando sei   disperato     come me         che muoio senza te.
We write songs like letters
I've saved shining scars
I've saved your drawings of moons and space-ships and stars
It's time to try out health
I'm gonna try and be okay for you
Now there's no providence
Or a rainy Arabic wine
Floating tense in Paris
Insomnia and dreams
Down filled pillows
No constants
Numbers 13, 11, 407
You can accept celestial facts about short attention spans
Or swallow potential heart attacks
I'll still open your letters
And sing your songs
It's confusing to wake up
Cliche
And go to sleep alone
I want to hear your voice
Even if it's only through the phone
This thing between us is scientific
But I'd like to practice it to get it straight
I'll talk to you soon
Like a wisdom tooth extraction
Oh, you know it had to happen
Sometimes I feel like a socio-genetic experiment
A petri-dish community's token of infection
You see I'm African native American
Irish and German
I was adopted by parents who loved me
They were the same color
As the kids who called me nigger
On the walk home from school
I cried until I found out what it meant
Then I got me some equipment
My fists, man
I was a hitman with no friends
But who the hell am I cursing those whose skin
Is half my DNA
Why am I
And why shouldn't I
Be ashamed of this fact
After all the feces they dumped on me
And my species
Sometimes I feel like a socio-genetic experiment
A petri-dish community's token of infection
Those filthy mother...
Shut 'cho mouth
There I go again with those high and mighty speeches
When they are in fact part of my species
Or is it the other way around
Did I piss in their gene pool
If I did it wouldn't matter
They kept me in the deep end
'Cause the slightest dilution
In their solution
Was perceived as pollution
Sometimes I feel like a socio-genetic experiment
A petri-dish community's token of infection
But I am not solely race, nor environment, nor destiny
I am the human scientific process
Over and over and over again
The dirt that I shovel to uncover the truth
Often buries something else growing
Acceptance of my own
Weakness and my own intolerance
Is seldom
But that is in fact my identity
Uncluttered by the maskings of consumer addiction
Ethno-centricity
In the light of miscegenation
This fable of elements
Which classify order species, subspecies
Genus phyla
Animal vegetable illegal chemical
Socialist democrat republican
Yuppy-buppy-guppy
Proud racist
Black white African American Irish and German
Sometimes I feel like a socio-genetic experiment
A petri-dish community's token of infection
And I'm proud
I would take every single man that isn't in his country that's in a uniform in another country where he doesn't belong and bring him back home and take him out of his uniform and put him back in the world;
I would take every single prisoner out of their cages and put them back in the world;
I would take every single hungry person and feed him;
I would take every single rich person and take away their money;
I would take every single person that's sick and tired of working jobs like on the auto lines and things like that, who's worked for years and years for nothing and never getting ahead;
Or people in college, because I had to quit school, because I got so fucking paranoid, because after Kent State, after Kent State, I realized that I could put on a cheerleader sweater with a "I love America" pin and the people that were shooting wouldn't even aim and it wouldn't do me any good.
I could walk out of a classroom and be on my way to lunch and be killed just as easily as I would on the front line of a barricade in a demonstration.
It's important to learn to laugh at ourselves,
Don't take life too seriously
You're in a bubble
The money's just doubled
So call the police
'Cause your karma's in trouble
You're in a bubble
Give baby a cuddle
You're losing control
And you're sellin' your soul
Big mouth, big money
You bitch, you ain't that funny
Got somethin' to burn, and love to waste
It's a social climb, to big bad taste
Rich bitch, sugar daddy, whizz kids, city boy
Jet setting, Go getting, grown-up toys
Heart breakin', money makin', earth-quaking, love fakin'
Where's your heart, did you sell that too
You're in a bubble
The money's just doubled
So call the police
'Cause your karma's in trouble
You're in a bubble
Give baby a cuddle
You're losing control
And you're sellin' your soul
Paranoid, star lover
You talk rich, and that's your cover
The more you get, the more you chase
Wipe that prada smile from that rada face
Dressed up, messed up, green-eyed sycophant
Pushy mother, lost brother in real hot pants
Heart breakin', money makin' hot-head fool
To get your own way, divide and rule
You're in a bubble
The money's just doubled
So call the police
'Cause your karma's in trouble
You're in a bubble
Give baby a cuddle
You're losing control
And you're sellin' your soul
You talk rich, you bitch
And that's your cover, star lover
You're in a bubble
The money's just doubled
So call the police
'Cause your karma's in trouble
You're in a bubble
Give baby a cuddle
You're losing control
And you're sellin' your soul
(I'm only joking!)
You're in a bubble (narcissistic, narcissistic)
The money's just doubled (narcissistic, narcissistic)
So call the police (narcissistic, narcissistic)
'Cause your karma's in trouble (narcissistic, narcissistic)
You're in a bubble (narcissistic, narcissistic)
Give baby a cuddle (narcissistic, narcissistic)
You're losing control (narcissistic, narcissistic)
And you're sellin' your soul (narcissistic, narcissistic)
(Repeat to Fade)
I haven't been loved by a man in quite a while
You know it ain't easy making me smile
Friends have their lovers
Men on a string
There must be something terribly wrong with me
Sometimes I feel like I haven't learned anything
How do you do?
Would you like to be friends?
No, I just want a bed for the night
Someone to tell me they care
You can fake it, that's all right
In the morning I won't be here
It's a sacrificial altar
And I'm laying down my head
And I'm telling you up front --
I haven't much to give
Is that how it's done,
Or shall I sing and dance?
Give me a chance
How do you do?
Do you want to be friends?
Yes, that might be very nice
Maybe we'll fall in love
Every body has its price
Mine is yours for free
If you'll be in love with me
I haven't been loved by a man in quite a while
You know it ain't easy making me smile
Friends have their lovers
Men on a string
There must be something terribly wrong with me
Verse One: Ice Cube
Peace - don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' sucotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger
How the fuck do you figure?
That I can say peace and the gunshots will cease?!
Every cop killer goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck
'Cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And 'Fuck tha Police' in the tape deck
You should listen to me 'cause there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto 'cause it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside...
Verse Two:
You wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh
'Cause we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine
It was plain and simple
The 9mm went <pop> to the temple
<Pop pop pop> was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin' critical - I stole a 5.0
I let it go - drive real slow
I yelled out 'Ice Cube sucka'
The shot-gun kicked - and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
When I got a sawed off, bodies are hauled off
It's a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the darkside...
Verse Three: Chuck D
Standing in the middle of war
In the middle we flex
When we die, we won't make +Jet+
+Ebony+ can't see to the lightside
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, 'cause I'm comin' from the coroner
Sayin' my rhymes with a Ph.D.
Who's black - don't wanna role - sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin'
Who the fuck are they foolin?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder what's under my waist
[Standin on the verge] of them gettin' brown
That's a fact got a fear on their bozack
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide
Yet Cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!
It's a revolution, brothers and sisters
There ain't a fight and it doesn't mean a goddamn thing
Well you believe what you want, but I think you don't know
That if you want to get down now
Smash your radio
Smash your radio
Smash your radio
Smash your radio
Smash your radio
Kids don't win 'cause they want to go mainstream
But I think that I am just a little pissed off now
I don't know what I get but I'm willing to bet
If you want to get down now
Smash your radio
Smash your radio
Smash your radio
Smash your radio
Smash your radio
It's a revolution (Baby, you're a smash)

Marchin' down O'Connell Street with the Starry Plough on high
There goes the Citizen Army with their fists raised in the sky
Leading them is a mighty man with a mad rage in his eye
"My name is James Connolly - I didn't come here to die
But to fight for the rights of the working man
And the small farmer too
Protect the proletariat from the bosses and their screws
So hold on to your rifles, boys, and don't give up your dream
Of a Republic for the workin' class, economic liberty"
Then Jem yelled out "Oh Citizens, this system is a curse
An English boss is a monster, an Irish one even worse
They'll never lock us out again and here's the reason why
My name is James Connolly, I didn't come here to die..."
And now we're in the GPO with the bullets whizzin' by
With Pearse and Sean McDermott biddin' each other goodbye
Up steps our citizen leader and roars out to the sky
"My name is James Connolly, I didn't come here to die...
Oh Lily, I don't want to die, we've got so much to live for
And I know we're all goin' out to get slaughtered, but I just can't take any more
Just the sight of one more child screamin' from hunger in a Dublin slum
Or his mother slavin' 14 hours a day for the scum
Who exploit her and take her youth and throw it on a factory floor
Oh Lily, I just can't take any more
They've locked us out, they've banned our unions, they even treat their animals better than us
No! It's far better to die like a man on your feet than to live forever like some slave on your knees, Lilly
But don't let them wrap any green flag around me
And for God's sake, don't let them bury me in some field full of harps and shamrocks
And whatever you do, don't let them make a martyr out of me
No! Rather raise the Starry Plough on high, sing a song of freedom
Here's to you, Lily, the rights of man and international revolution"
We fought them to a standstill while the flames lit up the sky
Till a bullet pierced our leader and we gave up the fight
They shot him in Kilmainham jail but they'll never stop his cry
My name is James Connolly, I didn't come here to die..."
I'm taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
He knows where he's taking me, taking me where I want to be
I'm taking a ride with my best friend
We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
I'm taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
Promises me I'm as safe as houses as long as I remember who's wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again
We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
Never let me down
Never let me down
Never let me down
Never let me down (see the stars, they're shining bright)
Never let me down (everything's alright tonight)
Never let me down (see the stars, they're shining bright)
Never let me down (everything's alright tonight)
Never let me down (see the stars, they're shining bright)
Never let me down (everything's alright tonight)
Never let me down (see the stars, they're shining bright)
Never let me down (everything's alright tonight)
Hunt them out
Drag them into the streets
Humiliate them
Baseball bats
Spinning out of control
In the city's belly
Running wild
Throughout the veins of the night 
Mangle ripped clothing 
"Open wide" 
Nothing you can do 
Abduction 
"He's so cute" 
Daddy's little boy 
Getting all amped up to split this toy 
Ugly joy ride 
Gang rape 
Revving engines 
Overheating 
Boiling up 
Exposed and bleeding 
Little boy 
Tossed from fist to fist 
Don't make a sound 
Watch him squirm and twist 
Gasoline 
Sweat gleams 
Screams 
They don't care 
Spinning out of control 
Drunk on the violence 
Ugly joy ride 
Gang rape
To the outside of town 
Force his face down 
Watch the scene 
Distorted focus 
Ugly and mean 
Going to tear him up 
Amped up for a nasty joy ride 
Spinning out of control 
Going on an ugly joy ride 
Spinning wheels
Clenched teeth 
Split lip 
"Bad trip" 
Gang raped 
Bang bang 
He's so cute 
Daddy's little angel 
Like a sponge 
To soak up all the fluid 
Breaking off inside
I keep my head in tune with my thoughts - are always clear
How can you think straight when you've had to much - in excess
You don't know what that shit does to you
How can you say that it's safe in small amounts
Until it's to late and the damage has been done
Straight-edge - in you face
Straight-edge - in you face
Straight-edge - in you face
Straight-edge - in you face
Clubs all night is your life
Drink to much, passing out
One day you get to much - then you go out
You are dead and nobody cares about you
Nobody's learned anything, 'cause they all do what you do
Everybody does it, why shouldn't I?
'Cause it's sick!
Get your booze away from me
Keep your pills out of sight
Don't get smoke in my face
Or you'll get the straight-edge in your face
Straight-edge - in your face
Straight-edge - in your face
Straight-edge - in your face
Straight-edge - in your face
I keep my head in tune with my thoughts - are always clear
How can you think straight when you've had to much - in excess
You don't know what that shit does to you
How can you say that it's safe in small amounts
Until it's to late and the damage has been done
I've got a bone to pick
Maybe it's yours
Someone said
If you worked hard enough
Ran fast enough
Learned enough
You would amount to something
Fail
Trying is not enough
I'll hold you way too long
It's cold when I touch you
A release
And everything you are is on the ground
Broken open and spilling
Leaves soak they drink
You are blood
That's all
Fail
Trying is not enough
I'll hold you way too long
It's cold when I'm near you
A release
And everything you are is on the ground
You are blood
That's all
Blood
Fail
Trying is not enough
I'll hold you way too long
It's cold when you're down
Release
And everything you are is on the ground
Broken, opened and spilling
Leaves soak they drink
You are blood
That's all
Fail
Trying is not enough
I dragged you too far down
It's cold when I release blood
A release
And everything you are is on the ground
Broken open and spilling
Leaves soak they drink
Blood
Fail
Trying is not enough
I held you way too long
It's cold when I'm near you
A release
And everything you are is on the ground
And everything you are is broken
Opened and spoiled the body
Fail
Trying is not enough
And there I am above you
I won't let go
It's cold when you are down
It's cold when I touch you
And there I am above you
Opened and spoiled
You were blood nothing more
Leaves were soaked
You were blood that's all
Opened and spoiled the body
You are blood nothing more
It's cold when I release blood
It's cold when you're down
I'll hold you way too long
I won't let go
It's cold when birds fall from the sky
It's cold when I'm near you
Fail
Trying is not enough
You're keeping in step and in line
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine
'Cause you do what you're told
But inside your heart it is black, it is hollow and it's cold
Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you wanna change it?
What if this whole crusade's a charade
And behind it all there's a price to be paid
For the blood which we dine
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine
Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you wanna change it?
So naive
I keep holding on to what I wanna believe
I can see
But I keep holding on and on and on and on
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
All around you slow decay
Wanna feel the sun of the new day
Forget the chances that you lost
Shedding innocence like falling dust
All the things you learned too young
The songs you knew but you never sung
You Waited a long time, you wasted more
Forgotten what you waited for
Excuse me ma'am for being so rude
Feels like 100 years of solitude
But my mind is numb and my mouth's okay
And you can listen or just walk away
No solutions built to last
Just your petty scores to settle fast
The N.M.E meant nothing to you
And the maker, well the maker of who
Your walkman generation
In search of sweet sedation
While forests choke under a 'lever sky
And the Exxon birds will never fly
Excuse me ma'am for being so rude
Feels like 100 years of solitude
But my mind is numb and my mouth's okay
And you can listen or just walk away
We tried, we cried, we fell, we lied
This life's like one white knuckle ride
Crack babies born too young
And L.A. kids who will dance to the gun
So forget this so called dirt of mine
It's just the dust and diesel of the passing time
It's all around you it's a tragedy, look
So forget the cover just read the book
Excuse me ma'am for being so rude
Feels like 100 years of solitude
But my mind is numb and my mouth's okay
And you can listen or just walk away
Lil Wayne
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's Fuck the world, get a child out her
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothin' bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles, uh
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire, expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin', problems on the triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you nigga's skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put the dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
Eminem
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
Lil Wayne
Yeah
Eminem
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't
(Don't hurt me)
Lil Wayne
That's right (Don't hurt me)
I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you (No more)
Huh
Eminem
Bitch you get no (No love)
You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
Lil Wayne
That's right (You don't hurt me) And I don't need you (No more) Don't want to see you (No more)
Eminem
Hah, bitch you get
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
Hah, bitch you get
(No love, no love, no love)
Lil Wayne
And I don't need you (No more)
Get 'em
Eminem
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fi'in to get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never givin' in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em?
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap is tight but I'm
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time, so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit, and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference, when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush, you feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
Till I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, till my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin' the flow, slow venom any opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep giving 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love
Eminem
It's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now
Lil Wayne
(Yeah)
Eminem
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't
(Don't hurt me)
Lil Wayne
That's right (Don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you (No more)
Huh
Eminem
Bitch you get no (No love)
You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
Lil Wayne
That's right (You don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you (No more)
Eminem
Hah, bitch you get
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
Hah, bitch you get
(No love, no love, no love)
Lil Wayne
And I don't need you (No more)
Eminem
Bitch you get no (Love, love)
Sometimes I wish I could start over
Another chance
Not just a drug abusing lonely alcoholic
But most of the time I really
Don't give a fuck
I used to be happy
I used to have friends
Now all I have are these three fucking assholes
And I'm getting sick of their shit too
He scares easily
It makes him so angry
At me
And his head it spins around
Just like the Exorcist and I
Find it ever so
Hard to resist his cries
But there's nothing more sadistic than an infant
Waving his pistol in my face
He wants me right down on my knees
Crumbling in disgrace
But he underestimates my mind
I know he's messing with my head
My only weakness is
I can't believe the guy could be entirely dead
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Trigger Happy Jack
You're gonna blow
But I'm gonna get off
Before you go
My Trigger Happy Jack is just a
Drive by a go-go
And after awhile he calms down
And he looks at me like a prince
But I know I better bite the bullet
'Cause it's just another one of his
Jedi mind tricks
But this ain't no headtrip honey
This is a collision on the road
And you've got me feeling oh just like a roadkill
And you know deep down I know
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Trigger Happy Jack
You're gonna blow
But I'm gonna get off
Before you go
My Trigger Happy Jack is just a
Drive by a go-go
Why do you make me feel like this? (1-2-3-4)
Why do you gotta be such a dick? (1-2-3-4)
Why do you make me feeling like this? (1-2-3-4)
Why do you gotta be such a dick? (1-2-3-4)
Go-go
And I hate myself
Just enough to want him
But I hate him just enough to get off
But I understand him
Maybe I'm just crazy enough
To love him
Why not? (Why not?)
You can't to a psycho like a normal human being...
When I stole a twig from our little nest
And gave it to a bird with nothing in her beak
I had my balls and my brains put into a vice
And twisted around for a whole fucking week
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you let that trash
Get a hold of your cock, get stoned on my hash?
Why'd ya do it she said, why'd you let her suck your cock?
Oh, do me a favour, don't put me in the dark
Why'd ya do it, she said, they're mine all your jewels
You just tied me to the mast of the ship of fools
Why'd ya do it, she said, when you know it makes me sore
'Cause she had cobwebs up her fanny and I believe in giving to the poor
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you spit on my snatch?
Are we out of love now, is this just a bad patch?
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did?
You drove my ego to a really bad skid
Why'd you do it, she said, ain't nothing to laugh
You just tore all our kisses right in half!
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did?
You drove my ego to a really bad skid
Why'd ya do it, she screamed, after all we've said
Every time I see your dick I see her cunt in my bed
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd ya do what you did?
Betray my little oyster for such a low bid
The whole room was swirling
Her lips were still curling
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did?
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did?
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd ya do it, she said
Why'd you do what you did?
Oh, big grey mother, I love you forever
With your barbed wire pussy and your good and bad weather
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did ...
Ah, I feel better now.
We don't really care if you say we're too young
We don't waste our time tanning in the sun
We don't even care what you know or think
Spoiled rich brat, you ain't so neat
L.A. girl, L.A. world
Don't tell us how to act, don't tell us what to wear
L.A. girl, L.A. world
You didn't create our scene
We don't care
We can't see why
We don't live our lives
To keep you satisfied
Stuck in your world of dreams again
My life starts where your life ends
You've burned out, your battery has died
If it wasn't for O.C. your scene wouldn't be alive
L.A. girl, L.A. world
Don't tell us how to act, don't tell us what to wear
L.A. girl, L.A. world
You didn't create our scene
We don't really care if you say we're too young
We don't waste our time tanning in the sun
We don't even care what you know or think
Spoiled rich brat, you ain't so neat
L.A. girl, L.A. world
Don't tell us how to act, don't tell us what to wear
L.A. girl, L.A. world
You didn't create our scene
I'm bored of the sleazy makeup
You'd fuck any guy in town
Your life's a total mess up, why the hell do you hang around?
L.A. girl, you bring me down
L.A. girl, L.A. world
Don't tell us how to act, don't tell us what to wear
L.A. girl, L.A. world
We don't mind
See we've been doin' it all the time
But if you want us to you sacrifice
You will not get it without a price
We don't mind
See we've been doin' it all the time
But if you want us to you sacrifice
You gotta give something back to life
You think I'm vulnerable to your pressure tactics
Because I shed a tear, 'cause I shed a tear
You think I'm vulnerable to your violence
Just 'cause I'm sittin' here
But my babies came into this world
Without a single fear, say they has no fear
'Cause the seven generations before me
They all fought to get us here
You can't just come in here like that no more
And snatch up our childhood
You just can't walk on up
And replace it yo, with your Hollywood
But I see now
How all of the words I say you'll take and misconstrue
And I'm prepared now
To suffer the penalties for speakin' the truth
And I speak the truth when I say
People if you hear me now I wantcha to say
Naa, na-naa, na-naa, nah
People if you hear me now I wantcha to say
Naa, na-naa, na-naa, nah
Michael Franti And Spearhead Lyrics
Je vois que je ne suis pas
Celle dont on ne parle que du corps
Celle qu'on traine chez soi
Et qu'on exhibe dehors
Je ne fais pas que passer
Je reste encore ouh, ouh
On ne peut pas me toucher
Sans que je sois d'accord ouh, ouh
Je vois que l'on se rappelle
De moi, pas de celle
Que l'on traine chez soi
Que l'on appelle ma belle
Je ne fais pas que passer
Je reste encore ouh, ouh
On ne peut pas me toucher
Sans que je sois d'accord ouh, ouh
Rosette and campaign trails 
False gestures. too much make-up 
Elected to serve the public 
How did you make your fortune? 
I love your cheesey smile 
Please will you kiss my baby 
More cars and endless car parks 
Planning permission granted 
Another bloody election 
Another bloody election 
Cover-ups. official statements 
Digest my gospel headlines 
Marilyn committed suicide 
Some nut blew jfk away 
Mr. Murdoch cares for orphans 
McDonalds goes eco-friendly 
I'm cynical of you 
There's millions like me too 
Another bloody election 
Another bloody election 
Another bloody election 
Another bloody election
It's the darkest place like beneath the stairs
The IT it comes and it takes me there
We took everything in sight, all through the night
Leaving scars and crashing cars
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
It's my life for everyone to see
For you a charade, for me a disease
Everything in sight, all through the night
Leaving scars and fucking stars
Still reasoning my life
Still reasoning my life
Still reasoning my life
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Still reasoning my life
Still reasoning my life
Still reasoning my life
Do or die, it's do or die
It's do or die, it's do or die
It's do or die, it's do or die
Not for me
Still reasoning my life
Still reasoning my life
Still reasoning my life
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
Still reasoning my life
Still reasoning my life
Still reasoning my life
Fucker
I need you like a hole in the head
When you're near, my blood runs wild, and I see red
Ongoing situations start to grip
And all my life, you won 't stop giving me your Jipp
Jipp, oh Jipp
Up my street, I see your regulations stick
I see the people as they tick
They just try to live from a day to day
And all their lives, you won't stop giving them your Jipp
Jipp, oh Jipp
SICK...
Sick with disease
Deny addiction
Down on my knees
Feed my affliction
Scared to believe
My own decisions
Eager to please
Distorted visions
Breathe life
Need life
Breath life
Keep life
Lie and deceive
With no emotion
False promises
Loss of devotion
Scarred by deceit
My self destruction
Love obsolete
Live in disfunction
Breathe life
Need life
Breathe life
Keep life
Bleed life
Heal life
Feel life the sweet life is all I want...
Can I bleed for the ritual?
Bleed for it
Got a need for the ritual
Can I breathe for the ritual?
Breathe for it.
Got a need for the ritual?
Got a need for the ritual
Can I breathe for the ritual?
Breathe for it.
Got a need for the ritual?
Sick with it.
Sick with it.
Sick with it.
Sick with it.
Sick with it.
Sick with it
Sick With It!
It's inside me I feel it growing nowhere to hide my anger's showing
Breathe life
Need life
Breathe life
Keep life
Bleed life
Heal life
Feel life the sweet life
And on this dark night of my soul ...
I will continue to pray for us and try to remember only the good things...
The sweet life
The sweet life
I am a sniper
Always hit the mark
Paid assassin
Working after dark
Looking through the night
Using infra-red
My target on you
Aimed at your head
Ten thousand dollars up front
Ten thousand dollars when I'm through
And I know just what to do
And ya know I'll do it too
Then I'm coming back for you
Back for you!
I do the "getting rid of"
Don't tell me why
Don't need to hear the truth
Don't need the lies
Now pay me quickly
And now we're through
It brings me great pleasure
To say my next job is you
Don't you know that, killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
You'd better believe it
We are the new ones
We are a people state
Who's got the future
Who's got the name of change
We got a reason
Just another pierced goon of little faith
Your time is over
Obey or not: you fail
No time for reasons
No time for all these games
Not just a nuance
Another question you won't like to see
A trade of bottle dreams
Your time is over. Time is over
No rage or battlefields
We are breaking through without a warning
We are the new ones
We're the hope
We are the spring
We are just a new round
Around the world
You have to see
A bleeding romance
Over the top
Not just a dream
And what is over
Oh, what is gone
Oh, what is gone, yeah
Was just a dream
There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part; you can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!
Well did you hear, there's a natural order
Those most deserving will end up with the most
That the cream cannot help but always rise up to the top
Well I say: Shit floats
If you thought things had changed
Friend you'd better think again
Bluntly put in the fewest of words
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world
Now the working classes are obsolete
They are surplus to societies needs
So let 'em all kill each other
And get it made overseas
That's the word don't you know
From the guys that's running the show
Lets be perfectly clear boys and girls
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world
Oh feed your children on Cray fish and Lobster tails
Find a school near the top of the league
In theory I respect your right to exist
I will kill ya if you move in next to me
Ah it stinks, it sucks, its anthropologically unjust
But the takings are up by a third, Oh So
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world
Your free market is perfectly natural
Or do you think that I'm some kind of dummy
It's the ideal way to order the world
Fuck the morals, does it make any money?
And if you don't like it? Then leave
Or use your right to protest on the street
Yeah, use your rights but don't imagine that its heard, Oh no no
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world
We've got one chance to break out
And we need it now
'Cause I'm sick and tired of waiting
Sick of this fucking apartment
Love me, or leave me
Or rip me apart
This is the voice that I was given and
If you don't like it take a long walk
Off of the shortest pier you can find
And I'll be singing it out
I'll be singing
Mr. Magazine
I never wrote one single thing for you
Or your so-called music scene
You don't mean a thing to me
Pick it up
It's what you wanted
Pick it up
And you need it too
Pick it up
It's what you wanted
Pick it up
When they review the debut
What if the critics hate you
Don't worry 'cause we
Might just catch somebody off their feet
Well they can love it or leave it
Or rip it apart
We're living what we're singing
So I guess that's a step in the right direction
Clever composition and the honesty
Mr. Magazine
I never wrote one single thing for you
Or your so-called music scene
You both mean shit to me
Pick it up
It's what you wanted
Pick it up
And you need it too
Pick it up
It's what you wanted
Pick it up
So save your breath and the money you spent
Go work in retail and spare the suspense
Just don't take chances on anything at all
Anything at all
So afraid of anything that may not come that easy
Too afraid of anything you may not have seen before
So afraid of anything that may not come that easy
Too afraid of anything that may not...
Pick it up
It's what you wanted
Pick it up
And you need it too
Pick it up
It's what you wanted
Pick it up
So save your breath and the money you spent
Go work in retail and spare the suspense
Just don't take chances on anything at all
Anything at all
So save your breath and the money you spent
Go work in retail and spare the suspense
Just don't take chances on anything at all
Anything at all
"We'd like to help you." the consul said
"But there's nothing we can do
Well, you knew the risks when you took the job
After all you're not a fool
So, don't call me, don't call me
I just can't bend the rules
Keep your chin up, I know it's tough
Somehow you'll get through."
It seems the Americans bargain and rescue
But if you get caught you're left to rot
Under a Beirut, under a Beirut Moon
Under a Beirut Moon
Sorry son, there's nothing we can do
Under a Beirut Moon
Different rules, we haven't got a clue
"We can't be seen to be giving in
To these terrorists you see
If we talk with them it would mean the end
Of all that we hold dear
So don't call me, don't call me
I'm doing all I can
Although it seems from where you sit
I don't give a damn."
Back home they'll remember you in papers, on TV
Because when you're caught you're left to rot
Under a Beirut, under a Beirut Moon
And though you dream of being free
There's not much hope that I can see
Under a Beirut, under a Beirut Moon
Now just today on the news I saw
A hostage walking free
He talked of how it came about
He gained his liberty
He said, don't give up, don't give up
Argue, beg and plead
Keep the pressure up, don't let it drop
Somehow you'll get free
He said the Americans would bargain and rescue
But when Brits get caught they're left to rot
Under a Beirut, under the Beirut Moon
I pray, beg
Every ounce of faith
I bleed, I burn
Ritualize, please help me
I'm careful not to break
Tripped out of my mind
It's come to the point where you've lost me
I've got no more inside
It's come to the point where you've lost me
I've got no more inside
You're better off without me
One simple thing is all I ask
Stop this, why won't you sympathize?
Southern trees bear strange fruit
Blood on the leaves, blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Pastoral scene of the gallant south
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
The scent of magnolia sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh
Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop
I hate my generation
I offer no apologies
I hate my generation yeah
I hate my generation
I picked it up and threw it away
I hate my generation now
It's all right
All right
All right
All right
It's all right
All right
All right
All right
I hate my generation
Now that I said it I feel liberated
I hate my generation yeah
I hate my generation
I offer no apologies
I hate my generation yeah
It's all right
All right
All right
All right
It's all right
All right
All right
I hate my
I hate my
I hate my
I hate my
I hate my
I hate my
I hate my
I hate my generation
Sun, throw shadows cross the floor
That leak into my soul
Blackness tossed against the wall
The room feels so cold
 
The alibis you gave
Were promises in vain
Echoes of impermanence
Voices from the grave
 
Tell me what it's for
All this emotion
When you walk out the door
Why should I follow?
 
You've been playing games
With my emotions
Turn and walk away
You leave me hollow
 
Warmth, cascading over me
A puppet for your strings
A mound of flesh on which you feed
Satiated
I took the low road I took the slow road
I've seen enough to know that I can't see at all
There's only static on my receiver
You've got my frequency but I don't hear you call
Get away get away get away now
No sense in wishing no transmissions ever come this way
Get away get away get away now
Just premonitions that I can't explain
I know I want you to know who I am now
I want you to know me
I meditated I medicated
I made a promise but I broke it every day
Annihilated I violated
All that was given me I choked it all away
Get away get away get away now
No sense in wishing no transmissions ever come this way
Get away get away get away now
Just premonitions that I can't explain
I know I want you to know who I am now
I want you to know me
How can I hear (what I don't hear)
How can I see (what I don't see)
How can I know (what I don't know)
How can I be this impossibility
I want you to know who I am
I know I want you to know who I am now
I want you to know me
It's growing colder I'm growing older
My summer's over and it's time to face the fall
There's only static on my receiver
I've got your frequency but I won't make the call
Lost in the depths of your hapless facade
Your pious contempt brings you closer to God
Judgement and sentence the company you keep
Bitter resentment that rocks you to sleep
 
Life is a game that you know you can't win
Envy and hate feed the demons within
Try to deny what you don't want to hear
The truth isn't easy when you live in fear
 
I am the guilt living deep in your soul
I am the voice that you hear in your head
I am the weakness you cannot control
I am the reason you wish you were dead
 
Is it so simple to deny yourself these things?
How does it feel to be slipping away?
Warm in the comfort that darkness will bring
Where you dream for tomorrow what you lost today
 
Intense isolation is all that you know
Sorrow and sickness, you reap what you sow
Alone with your demons you pray for the end
Dreams of tomorrow as darkness descends
Hello, hello, hello
Hello darkness
Hello pain
Welcome back my friends
So good to see you again
Why did you leave me
All by myself?
Without you what would I do?
How would it feel to have to be real?
Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a coma
But then I realize
I'm just lonely
I'm just lonely
I'm just lonely
Hello, hello
Hello darkness
Pain, memories, shame
All the time wasted
Self pity and blame
There you'll go now you know
Been so long down below yeah
And sometimes I'd like to start all over
But then I realize
I'm just lonely
I'm just lonely
I'm just lonely
Hello, hello
Hello memories return
Bridges I've burned
The lessons I've taught weren't the lessons I learned
And somehow I got this far
But I don't, I don't, I don't know how man
And sometimes I don't even want to be alive
But then I realize
I'm just lonely
I'm just lonely
I'm just lonely
I wanna live in THE PRETTY SUN
But DAYLIGHT just makes me NUMB
So I COVER UP my SCARS
With VELVET DRAPES that KILL ROCK STARS
Change my mood
Lick my wounds
TRUST will lead us to the TRUTH
DROWN myself in MISERY
Sleep with my enemy
DESTROY my DESTINY
Erase the MEMORY... of you
Open myself to reveal my wounds
And I find the memory of you
I wanna DIE on the DARKEST NIGHT
When there's no one left to FIGHT
Fill my bed with LEOPARD FUR
THINK OF YOU INSIDE of HER
SUFFER for my latest SIN
Until I'm HAPPY in my SKIN
Open myself to reveal my wounds
And I find the memory of you
I ache for you... I ACHE FOR US
I pray for you... I PRAY FOR US
I wait for you... I WAIT
DENY thy LOVER and REFUSE thy NAME
FIRST, LAST and ALWAYS
DENY thy LOVER and REFUSE thy NAME
FIRST LAST and ALWAYS
When will YOU tell ME the TRUTH?
When will YOU tell YOU the TRUTH?
When will YOU tell ME the TRUTH?
When will YOU tell YOU...
My revenge on you will not kill you
It will make you want to KILL YOURSELF
(Canibus)
Jedi Mind Tricks... Canibus
Yo
I grab Mics bust the raw
Take flight adjust the Yaw
Break your bicuspid with your own jaw
Metaphors started menopause in your moms before you were born
Technically you don't even exist, God
A flick of the wrist, you'll be gone
Lost in limbo like pink shit camouflaged in a pig farm
I'm an enigma I rip bars
Or burn your star with 5 points
Plus the mic I ripped thus far
I stomp on ya forehead
Peel the top of your fucking face off like an orange
And eat the carnage
My God that sounds horrid, eating MC's
Is like eating garbage they make me vomit
Discombobulate prostates re-hydrate dry lakes
Wipe Ammonium Nitrate across the side of ya face
Anthropomorph, illogically speaking I'm out of ya league
Who can match the Bident with my top speed
Scourge of the earth, verses are merged into dirt
Heart line is flat lined through the therapy era
Sentences go through re-synthesis
I leave 'em looking bleaker than Memphis
Without Rockefeller membership
Don't be an optimist and try to rock with Bis
You end up in an iced-out sarcophagus
(Vinnie Paz)
Every rapper better fear me
'Cause Vinnie Paz is a beast
And y'all steady screaming for war but want peace
You trying ta walk through the fog where sun leaks
Ya trying to walk two dogs with one leash
You can't overstand the mathematics
How rip I bars, walk through walls perform magic
Tibetan Black Magic, I'm a warlord
I'll stab you through your fucking temple with a floorboard
I'm a born lord, I was baptised
To see the universal through a cats eyes
Here come the black skies;
It's all darkness
I breathe life into Jesus Christ's carcass!
(Samples)
(Canibus)
Once I duct tape ya to the front of a Mack trucks, face ya
Drive through a brick wall, pull the parkin' brake up
Ask you for you proof of registration, say what?
I can't understand a word you saying, you fuck!
Peel you off till you drop on the floor
Drag you to the manifold,
Make you put your mouth around the exhaust
Squeeze your neck harder when you start to cough
I bet you never thought this could happen just for pissing me off
I'm in for hardcore Hiphop, the surrogate father
Protecting rap like the exoskeleton of a Lobster
I'll moonwalk on water, harpoon jackers
And drag 'em back to the harbour for the local photographers
Now point four fingers and watch through binoculars
Look what Harry Potter did to Andrew Galotti, Kid
Whether enemies exchange negative energy
But you can't forgive and forget with an elephant memory
'Cause You-Know-Who snatched the mic from You-Know-Who
But lets keep that between me and you!
Me and JMT,
Rippers that'll rip your ass
I got an empty mag- Get 'em Vinnie Paz!
(Vinnie Paz)
I get a bloodlust when I see a slug bust
Hit your mug with a .38 snub and watch the blood rush
Nothings above us, y'all better back off
'Cause you a devil like the Canaanite in Sackcloth
We busting Gats off
It's a clean kill
It doesn't seem real when your spleen spill
So listen to what I'm spittin' at y'all
La illaha, il Allah il Allah
Come on y'all your getting hit in the chest
'Cause Vinnie Pazienz and Canibus is the best
Ripping the rest
And all y'all seek is ashes
I love reading Koran in pitch blackness
I love reading the psalms to bitch actors
I love reading the palms of bitch rappers!>
An abomination
The last of a family of filth
Procreator should have pulled out
A fucking waste of sperm
Family scorned abhorrance
Would've done the world a favor
So much aggravation alleviated
If you were aborted
How pathetic can one be?
Always sinking to new levels
Years ago written off
Cast out for nefarious ways
But had no life, no purpose
So jealous festers within
Feculence excrement
An utmost compliment
Walking pile of shit
With empty words
No decency rectitude
Or credibility
Forthrightness lost
A shallow form of life
A disgrace without integrity
Karma has come to claim
The walking dead
Eradicate, ravage your being
Revulsion intensifies
Persevere until I spill blood
Jubilate as you die
Doors opened wide
The pulse of death has arrived
The sum of all your fears
Exposing all your fucking lies
Limbs crack and split
Raining teeth, blood and spit
Choked screams appear
Yet your begging falls upon deaf ears
In the trenches we meet again
I will reign supreme
Destroy all adversaries
Fuck your enemies
Time and time you fucked me over
You are dead to me
In the trenches we meet again
I will reign supreme
Reign supreme!
Fucking die now
Eat my fucking shit
Annihilation
I will conquer
To the end I will not stop
Until you reach your timely demise
Lacerate, rip out your throat
Decapitate and shit down your neck
I blackout in extreme pleasure from watching you writhe in pain
Your parasitic existence terminated, piss on your remains
Take your things please leave me you better do it soon 
Something gets to me over and over again 
I don't mind if it is your day that I spoil 
Caffeine addiction it feels so good 
No more love yous
No more broken bones 
Take your things please leave me you better do it soon 
Something gets to me over and over again 
I don't mind if it was your day that I spoilt 
Cocaine addiction it felt so good 
No more love yous 
No more broken bones 
Heroine just loves her 
Heroine just loves her 
I don't wanna love you, love you
When our love is gone, we will be calm
We will be calm
And when the feelings come, I will fight them off
We will fight them off
In the evening blooms, I still think of you
I'm thinking only of you
But when temptation starts, I will fight it off
We will fight it off
Fire, all our guns and arrows
Fire, all our guns
The bells and bombs, we'll fight them off
The fireworks say it's over
Now the fall begins, and our failing hearts
May come apart
But I will be on guard, I will fight it off
We will fight it off
Fire, all our guns and arrows
Fire, all our guns
The bells and bombs, we'll fight them off
The fireworks say it's over
Some day, in some other life
We'll let this battle pass us by
Some day, in some other time
We will be the ones who are left alive
In my weakened state, I could fall for you
Like I fell for you
But lord, when it grows late, I will fight it off
I will fight it off
Fire! All our guns and arrows
Fire! All our guns
Fire! All our guns and arrows
Fire! All our guns
The bells and bombs, we'll fight them off
The fireworks say it's over
The bells and bombs, we'll fight them off
The fireworks say it's over
It's over
Swirling all around you
Are the rumors people spread
Vicious lies that terrorize
And fill their swollen heads
 
They hide behind computer screens
Planning their attack
Smiling eyes disguise their lies
To stab you in the back
 
Don't back down
This is everything you've waited for
Stand your ground
And take what you deserve from life
 
Don't back down
This could be your last chance
Stand your ground
You gotta get up and fight
 
They'll tear you down to elevate
Themselves at any cost
Criticize, jeopardize
And celebrate your loss
 
When someone disrespects you
You don't have to turn away
A loaded fist, a rusty blade
Can help you dull the pain
As a child
Monsters always haunted your panicked dreams
This time you're the vampire
And though it's cruel reality
You're still trapped in a suffocating fantasy
Living out your most gruesome reverie
When will you let me wake you
From this painful dreaming
Don't you realize you're killing in your sleep
With claws of carelessness and fangs of apathy
Ripping holes in the flesh
Of the people you once esteemed
Just to smell the freshness
Of their final breaths and their blood
Yours went stale a long time ago
You'll change your addiction
To appease your conviction
You've built quite the tolerance
For your previous obsession
But your new devotion
Requires some compassion
In the face of diversity
Your tolerance is lacking
Now you've indulged
Your feral temptations
You've awakened
And you say that you've had a vision of enlightenment
That you wish to be cleansed and saved
Wash yourself clean in a blessed stream
But there's no such thing
And it's never that easy
Innocence can't be bought with a confession
You can't just empty your sins into a pit of salvation
The guilt eats you just as you devoured your family
Why do you need a savior
When you could rescue yourself from the fear that drives your hate
You'll change your addiction
To appease your conviction
You've built quite the tolerance
For your previous obsession
But your new devotion
Requires some compassion
In the face of diversity
Your tolerance is lacking
What did I do to deserve such silence
Such violence on your quest for self-destruction
You destroy us all as you feast on the last of your own blood
And taste the venom left behind
You consume my desiccated heart
And drain the consciousness from my mind
Take pity on me
Your devoted victim
Take pity on me
This sacrifice won't set you free
Beware of the soul-saver
He's not your friend
Why do you ask His forgiveness
I'm the one you've mistreated
Now ask yourself
Are you truly born again
Your pedestal reeks of death
A thick film of denial now coats your veins
There are hardly any left to penetrate
You had a life that refused to wait
For you to make another mistake
You're bound to make another mistake
You're dying inside
Every heartbeat closer to the last
Immortality, a fallacy
A perverted pipe dream of the past
The tomb, it needs
It's hunger, an unforgiving force
Your blown mind reels in torture
True doom locked on it's course
Your blood it flows in torment
A testament to weakness
Your death-day clock is ticking
You'll surrender to your creatures
The tomb, it needs
It's hunger, an unforgiving force
Your blown mind reels in torture
True doom locked on it's course
Your graveyard eyes unseeing
Your mind drowns in the crypt
Construction of the perfect beast
Your senses have been stripped
Look over your shoulder
Damnation's waiting there
Your run slows to a crawl
The casket calls to your despair
Abyssal hopelessness
Down on bloody knees
There's madness in your soul
A swarming of disease
Cemetery visions
Eyes peeled red and open
Curled up in a coffin
Mind and soul are broken
The tomb, it needs
It's hunger, an unforgiving force
Your blown mind reels in torture
True doom locked on it's course
Merging with the void
While uncloaked by total doom
Feel the reaper's breath
As you slip inside the tomb
Wake up dead and mourning
With a knife tight in your fist
Thank the blood red skies
For with death you have been kissed
Gotta work every day
I thought I saw what Malcolm Little saw
Ah-ha, thought I saw it
I thought I saw what Malcolm Little saw
I thought I saw what Malcolm Little saw inside the game
That made him wanna draw an X across his last name
Dig inside himself and make a change
The turnin' point from which things could never be the same
I'm talkin liberation, it seems no matter how far you make it
Somebody's out to sabotage what you hold sacred
It doesn't mean as much to them as it means to you
They only do it 'cause it's the cool thing to do
But they don't understand the things you do
They don't understand what it means to you to see your dreams come true
They wasn't up late night losin' sleep wit'chu
They wasn't practicin' the same routine all week as you
They didn't have to earn respect in the same scene as you
On tour wearin' the same thing for a week or two
At first them chicks didn't want to speak to you
But now they tryin' to get backstage to sneak a peek at you
I try to tell myself, don't let it define you
Don't let the limelight you're standin' in blind you
Don't internalize it, don't let it get inside you
Appreciate the love you get but don't let it guide you
Don't let those other people make your life a mess
Way too many artists build their self-esteem around the press
'Cause when the press loves you and the people don't respond
You feel like the fans owe you somethin' and you're gettin robbed
My man Lo said it's best to do it for the people
'Cause there's no hidden agends when they speak to you
But think about what MC's do
They say things to you, because they want things from you
Now right or wrong I gotta think about what I say
'Cause people overanalyze my words because I got a name
Like my opinion means more because I got some fame
But in God's eyes we're all the same
I'm liberated ("People in this country, are confused")
I'm liberated ("They are fed lies, from the highest level")
Yo, you know we had the baddest motherfuckin unit back in the days son
Inkwell, Plead the 5th and Logic
{?} Shabazz, Greenhouse, Soul Position
Who's Who, The Orphange, The Minor League, Greenhouse
And if you've ever heard me talk about it you can tell
Greenhouse Effect ain't the same without Inkwell
Me and Fest don't know if we should write more songs
Or leave well enough alone and let bygones be bygones
And that'll leave you brokenhearted
And have you feelin like you can't finish what you started
Sometimes I feel like I can't lead my team well enough
And say the right things to keep 'em all inspired, it's ill
I guess that's just how it is
I've seen women kill more careers than any whack album did
When she met you, she loved your songs
But later on she made you feel like what you do is wrong
Now she tellin' you you're not givin your heart
Because you can't find a way to put her before your art
They used to be attracted to rock stars
Now all the sudden, she wants you to get a desk job
Even if you don't, she she treats you funny
Even though you're the one that's bringin' in the money
Ha, but God don't like ugly
And you wouldn't act that way if you really loved me
I feel it in my heart and I know I'm not wrong
You don't love me, you just hate bein' alone
Your life lacks meaning when I'm gone
You can't do anything on your own but I'm gone now and
I'm liberated ("So do we say that it's time to begin anew?")
I'm liberated ("That it's time to stop goin along
with rhethoric and bullshit that you cannot endurse")
I'm liberated ("So we say that we recognize that freedom is indivisible")
I'm liberated ("A republic for people to have in them self respect")
("Because, that's all it's about, that's all human dignity is about")
("It's about individuals, it's about all of us")
("But it's also about, one's own self-respect")
My clothes don't fit me, and my friends don't like me and the furniture is giving me a rash
I've thrown half credit, and I know I'll never get it and I'm pretty sure I'll end up all alone
I'm gonna be drunk, and slight broke
I'm gonna be tired old and bitter, and really messed up
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere, but straight to hell
Oh yeah, straight to hell
The girls won't ride me, and the boys won't fight me, so my self esteem has hit an all time low
The drugs don't thrill me, and my life's about to kill me and I'm pretty sure I'll end up all alone
I'm gonna be drunk, and slight broke
I'm gonna be tired old and bitter, and really messed up
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere, but straight to hell
Oh yeah, straight to hell
Oh yeah, straight to hell
The cops won't arrest me, and the hookers won't undress me and my manager is tired of my voice
The servants won't serve me and the doctors won't
Cure me and my producer calls my music a bunch of noise
I'm gonna be drunk, and slight broke
I'm gonna be tired old and bitter, and really messed up
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere, but straight to hell
Oh yeah, straight to hell
Oh yeah, straight to hell
Oh yeah, straight to hell
Straight to hell
My friends call me enemy 'cause they're a fucking joke
They'd better get their act together it's time that they awoke
I'm cast out by my relatives 'cause they don't want me around
I just sit in a corner and I don't make a sound - Not one word
The walls are closing in on me
I don't know what to do
Please tell me who is who - Tell me who is who - Tell me who is who
Policemen are my friends so why do they always stare
Raid our clubs bust out parties condemned for short hair
Teachers are my friends so why do they make me stand
In front of a class of gawking fools who'll never understand - They'll never understand
The world around me falls apart
I don't know what to do
Please tell me who is who - Tell me who is who - Tell me who is who
Uh, hit me
Don't explain, you never change
Same old thing, same old game
Say ya want to be wit' me
But show me my ring, baby, let me think
I been in the cold
The story untold, about to unfold
How do you expect me
To ever believe you want be wit' me
Why you all in my grill
(Why you all in)
Can you pay my bills
(Can you pay my bills)
Let me know if you will
(Let me know, know)
'Cause a chick gotta live
(A chick like me, I got to live)
Talk is talk, and talk is cheap
Tell it to her, don't say it to me
'Cause I know I'm in control
See Trix are for kids, and boo I'm too old
Go 'head, with your games
Don't ever come back to me again
Where you go, remember me
I'm the best thing in history
Why you all in my grill
(Why, why, why)
Can you pay my bills
(Can you pay my bills)
Let me know if you will
(Let me know boy, boy)
'Cause a chick gotta live
(A chick got to live, ooh yeah)
Third time
(Third time)
I moved you in, took you back
In my life
(I was a fool)
I don't know what's wrong with me
Third time
(Third time)
I moved you in
Took you back in my life
(Oh yeah, yeah)
Why you all in my grill
(All in my grill)
Can you pay my bills
(Can you pay my bills, yeah)
Let me know if you will
(Let me know if you will)
'Cause a chick gotta live
(Oh, yeah)
Why you all in my grill
Can you pay my bills
(Ooh, pay my bills)
Let me know if you will
(Let me know, let me know baby, baby)
'Cause a chick gotta live
(A chick like me, I got to live)
If you want me, where's my dough?
Give me money, buy me clothes
No need for talking, have my dough
Where's my money? Where's my clothes?
If you want me, where's my dough?
Give me money, buy me clothes
No need for talking, have my dough?
Where's my money? Where's my clothes?
Aight, uh
Why you all in my grill?
I'm thinkin' it's time to chill
Yeah, but you on a drill, though
I couldn't even step out the baby blue Bonneville
'Cause you be tryin' to kill my hoe, my girlfriend
And people around me is tellin' me that you's a stalker
Like Darth Vader takes a Sky walker
I told you, I was the street talker
It ain't my fault you dirty your Victoria's Secretes
And your Frederick's
You wanted the Waldorf Astoria
But instead I took you to Cedric's, to entertain you
To give you to the G, and never claim you
Me and Missy, we get it straight pissin'
Oh yeah, we puffin' on one of them thangs too
You blamin' who? You namin' who?
I know you ain't bringin' that lame crew
Big Boi, they the phat sacks
She pretty D, all they same, boo
But I'm backed by the Dungeon Family
So you can go 'head wit' all that stabbin' me
'Cause I will jab thee, and slam thee
And Bobby Boochet yo' ass, G, yeah, yeah
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer
Preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed
Like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
Reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
You know what they say about bein' nice to the right people on the way up
Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down
Oh, there ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
Ain't no comin' back
Oh, no, comin' back when your foot of pride come down
Ain't no comin' back
They got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed
Sing me one more song, ha, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion
Say, one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in
Oh, there ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, baby, ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ain't no comin' back
There's a retired businessman named Red...
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
Not somebody that you play around with much Miss Delilah is his
A Philistine is what she is, She'll do wondrous works with your fate
Ah, Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed
If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave
Oh, there ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
Baby, hey, hey, hey, hey, ain't no comin' back, oh, oh
There, hey, hey, ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
Oh, oh, ain't no comin' back
Oh, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say
Hey, hey, hey, thanks
They like to take all this money from sin
Build big universities to study in
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks
Oh, there ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
Hey, hey, hey, ain't no comin' back, baby, ain't no comin' back
Oh, foot of pride come down, ain't no comin' back, ah, ha, ha
Ain't no comin' back
They got some beautiful people out there, man
They can be a terror to your mind
And show you how to hold your tongue
They got mystery written all over their forehead
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They don't believe in mercy, ah, judgment on them
Is something, something that, something that, you'll never see
Ah, They can exalt you up or bring you down main route
Turn you into anything that they want you to be
Ooh, ooh, ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride
Ain't no comin' back
Hey, no comin' back when your foot of pride
Ain't, ain't no comin' back
Yes, I guess I loved him too
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill
Ah, did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
Struck down by the strength of the will
Ah, ain't nothin' left here partner
Just the dust of a plague, left that whole, left that whole
Town afraid from now on, this'll be where you're from
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade
Oh, baby, baby, ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ain't no comin' back
Oh, oh, oh, ain't no comin' back, you know that
Foot, foot, foot, foot of pride come down
Oh, ain't no comin' back, ain't no comin' back
Oh, ain't no comin' back, baby, oh, no, no, ain't no comin' back
I heard your name the other day
And it cut me like a blade
I guess that time cannot heal every wound
Some memories never fade
 
I wish that we could just get back in line
And pick up where we left off
But once you lose your grip on time
You blink, and then it's gone
 
I thought these tears were gone
Now look what you have done
A moment out of time
When you left me behind
 
I feel like I could drown
Get lost and never found
I'm drifting out to sea
Why have you forsaken me?
 
I don't recall all the roads I took
Or the streets that I have roamed
But I'd trade them all for just another look
At the faces I once called home
 
All the years it took to build these walls
Stone by stone and brick by brick
Could not prepare me for the fall
Or the pain that I'd inflict
Sometimes I feel I've got to 
Run away, I've got to
Get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love
(Ooh) Tainted love
Now I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away
You don't really want anymore from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love
(Ooh) Tainted love
Don't touch me, please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
But now I'm gonna pack my things and go
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love
(Ooh) Tainted love
(Ooh) Tainted love
(Ooh) Tainted love
He cursed
Like a billiard player
Rap his stick upon the ground
Almost blind like an old man should be
Shakes a lot like an old man should
Off and on he's been here
Probably twenty years
Off and on he's been here
Guess he'll never go home
I guess it's a comfortable chair
And company, you can't buy company
It's a frame of mind
It's people who have been through what you've been through
And a cigar, a good cigar now and again
Had his heart broken
By a little girl, she was small
Had his heart broken
Little girl, she was small
Had his heart broken
You'd never expect a thing
When he was a young man
It was like an event
He'd promise her anything
He really never had to deliver
He'd promise her everything
Help yourself if you could do better
He promised her everything
She caught on
A lot of people say she's crazy
And I know - I know a lot of people, and I 
And I think, I think she's alright
Cursed
Like a billiard player
Rap his stick upon the ground
And she would ask him
She was young and she didn't know
Why things were like this
And not another way
He lied to her
He lied to her, with a perfectly straight face
She believed him
A wounded world, an absent creator
Empty prayers fly through the air like burning papers
There's a monster in the garden you call him god
There's a monster in the garden eating you alive
The only religion I know is dripping from my pen
The only religion I know is my lips kissing her skin
Out of the darkness wolves will come
Out of the dark the wolves will come
God is a gun and the bullets are free
God is a gun and it's targeting me
God is a gun and the bullets are free
God is a gun and it's on a shooting spree
There's a monster in the garden you call him god
There's a monster in the garden ripping us apart
The only religion I know is holy poetry
The only religion I know is the heat of her body next to me
Out of the darkness wolves will come
Out of the dark the wolves will come
God is a gun and the bullets are free
God is a gun and it's targeting me
God is a gun and the bullets are free
God is a gun and it's on a shooting spree
Lost Father, hollow be thy name
Where were you when they screamed your name?
Where were you when the war began?
Where were you when the babies died?
Where were you when the mothers cried?
Where were you when they changed you name?
Where were you when in the darkest night?
Where were you when they pulled the trigger?
You were the gun in the hand of the killers
You're just a myth
You don't exist
Show yourself
You're not on the battlefield not in the cancer wards
Out of the darkness the wolves will claw at your door
God is a gun and the bullets are free
God is a gun and it's targeting me
God is a gun and the bullets are free
God is a gun and it's killing everything
A wounded world an absent creator
Empty prayers fly through the air like burning papers
The earthmovers:
Building cities in the desert. Cities in Antarctica Cities on the moon.
Bulldozer. Back-hoe. Hard-hat. Harvester.
Rough gets smoothed, everything can move.
They got just the tool, everything can move.
Got a foreman and a crew, everything can move
Got a union too, everything can move.
The earthmovers:
They rule.
Development.
Settlement.
Sharp eyes
Dissect space and time
With a measurement of lines
Divide lots and plats
Plot the map plant the flag
Drop the marker like that.
Got plenty
Property
Proper
Documents
Safety
Goggles
Priviledge
Hard hats
Thick skin
Dig in
We are the architects
Few view the blueprints
Never stop to rest.
Never mind the mess, we're going to mars next
Father of the projects
God complex
"Let there be light"
How large is your obelisk?
It's a contest.
Watch this:
Mountain from a molehill mountaintop removal
Terra-form irrigate excavate level grade
Dam (it's hydro-electric)
It's your boy Pipelaya
Bobsledding throug the desert
Fuckin' up the sandbox since I was seven
Tonka toy permanent permit for demolition
Flatten every surface, de-stroy difference
Grease the commission just to keep the wheels spinnin but
Listen:
We were born with permission.
They see the vision in our clear blue eyes
Air conditioning the ice cubes, chillin' poolside
Come to Jamaica,
Come to Dubai
Got a new mayor
Cleaning up the crime
Got a snow machine
You can ski anytime
Not a cloud to be seen
In the dome of the sky
Reshape Harlem into North Manhattan
Wake up on the reservation like
"What happened?"
Sleep to the sound of a chainsaw massacre
Wake to the sound of a dumptruck backing up
(Back that thing up.)
The earthmovers:
Building cities in the desert. Cities in Antarctica Cities on the moon.
Bulldozer. Back-hoe. Hard-hat. Harvester.
Rough gets smoothed, everything can move.
They got just the tool, everything can move.
Got a foreman and a crew, everything can move
Got a union too, everything can move.
The earthmovers:
They rule.
Swallowing this hurt
Making it lie down
I'm my strongest ally, living life as I know how
I'm carrying the weight of a world that sold me out
I'm running with my eyes closed
Hoping you don't see this doubt
I'm lost for words
I'm at a loss to tell you what I need
I know there's something more
God, help me to believe
And all this time
I thought the fight
The fight was only mine
I need to let you rescue me
I'm taking fire
I'm feeling tired
I'm tired of this fight
I need to let you rescue me
I let it go to breathe
I can't take it anymore
I refuse to wake up one more time bleeding on the floor
I won't let myself hold back
I'll surrender what's inside
You become my healing tourniquet
So I can feel alive
I feel so exposed
I'm afraid to lose total control
With nothing left to hold
You reach for me and wouldn't let me go
I hearken to the grisly murmer of nameless fiends,
Black jaws drooling blasphemy,
Beyond the witch-song, darkly sweet,
The wyrm-horn sounds cross Dagon's mere,
Shadow-gate (portal to the Black Pyramid) yawns wide, beckoning...
Spells scrawled in blood and frosty rime,
Squamous god encoils the onyx shrine,
(By the bleeding stone) I am enraptured by ophidian eyes.
Pungent odour of engorged flesh,
Vaults of eon-veiled horror,
Embraced by delirium, witches' balms anoint me.
Veils of frost entwine me in the haze of baleful moon-cursed dreams,
I hear the High Ones whispering ancient spells in the long-dead tongues,
There is the gleam of blackened steel in the flickering torchlight,
And I embrace the balm of sublime forgetfulness...
By the blaze of the burning skulls,
Beneath the Well of the Black Flame,
In the vaults of the dreaming gods,
Shackled to the slime-smeared bleeding stone.
Squamous orbs, black sword, drink deep, blood oath.
Supine shapes dancing in the mist,
(Serpent-tongued) priestess bares her pale flesh,
Shadows crawl to the sundered stones,
The Eternal Fiends exult in rapture.
Tomb-worms bloat on carnal blood,
Trickling onto wraith-carved stone,
Dark laughter echoes through the vaults,
Black-winged, cruel as envenomed steel.
In the Well of Black Flame, squamous shapes writhe,
A dark tide of shadows follows me,
Ravening fiends unleashed to feed,
Incantations pour in torrents from my lips...
Wraiths and fiends whirl to my bidding...
Horrors 'neath the pyramid.
(Lyrics: Byron, Music: Jonny and Chris)
Reach back into your mind
And grab what you
Left inside [x2]
You're pushing me
And I'm gonna push back
Pushing me
Set to attack [x2]
Reach up and touch the sky
This time you're asking why
You tried to achieve it
I could not believe it
I left it in your hands
And you dropped the ball
You're pushing me
And I'm gonna push back
Pushing me
Set to attack [x2]
Reach and grab what you want
Do you want to feel
Someting that's harder
Than your fucking soul
Push, go far
Grab what is left inside
That's cool
That's who you are
And I don't
Want to believe
You're pushing me
And I'm gonna push back
Pushing me
Set to attack [x2]
You're pushing me
And I can't push you
Back [until end]
Yo!
(Hook: Eminem)
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know - that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people acting stupid
(Verse 1: Kon Artis)
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smelling like Boone's Farm
Hiding under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own mom
Kuniving Kon, artist with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach screaming, "Let's get it on!"
A lush that love to drink, drunk driving a tank
Rollin' over a bank, cops see me and faint
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slitting your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street, till it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music!
(Verse 2: Bizarre)
You know why my hands are so numb? (No)
Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't cum (oh)
Smacked this whore for talking crap (bitch)
So what if she's handicapped, the bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap!
I fucking hate you; I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you (hell yeah!)
Satan done got me on this song
Eating a hot dog reading the Holy Qu'ran, while I'm on the john
Tired of wearing this yellow thong
Take it back Sisqo, you know where it belongs (thong th-thong thong)
Now here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms
Fuck your love songs!
(Verse 3: Proof)
Just bring who you gon' bring on, who you gon' swing on?
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen m-16's and one pump
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaws
Have you running out this fucking club in your drawers
We loving the broads, there's nothing to applaud
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in us all
It's fight music!
(Verse 4: Swifty McVay)
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back right in front of the precinct (YOU HEAR THAT!)
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talking
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers and made them drop his coffin
It's fight music!
(Verse 5: Kuniva)
These beads I'm swinging is stinging them
See all these niggas? When I step in the club, I'm bringing them
If any nigga looking too hard, we Rodney King'n them
Malice green to them and gasolining them with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at them or spit it at them
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him (no!)
Blast while you right hooking, right when your wife's looking
Fuck fight music, bitch, this is losing your life music!
(Verse 6: Eminem)
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it!
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit!
You Liberace's, Versace's, and you Nazis
Watch me, cause you figured you got me in this hot seat!
You motherfuckers wanna JUDGE me 'cause you're NOT me!
You'll never STOP me, I'm TOP speed as you POP me!
I came to save these new generations of babies!
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy!
To grow to praise me I'm making them go crazy!
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me!
And you fugazi if you think I'mma admit wrong!
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm siced on!
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on!
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called!
It's fight music!
I observe the Universe
And it's looking right back at me
I float through dimensions
Disconnect myself
From the perception of reality
I wait for no one
Reconstruct
Deconstruct
Disassemble
The Inner Core
It holds the answers
To it all
It's all about the Ancient Batteries
This oven's kind of burning
These devices do not function
It has a mind of its own
Routine... follow the routine
Reaching out...
Into the air...
Yeah...
You, are becoming gods. 
There's a new master of creation, and it's you! 
You've unravelled DNA, and at the same time you're cultivating bacteria strong enough to kill every living thing! 
Do you think you are ready for that much power? 
You lot? 
You lot? 
Cheeky bastards. 
You're running around science like kids with guns, creating a new world, while the world you've got is stinking, but, hands up, hands up anyone who thinks you've got it right. 
Yeah, there's always one. 
I can see you. 
If you want the position of God then take the responsibility.
You keep saying you got something for me
Something you call love (but I call sex)
You've been (kissing when you ought to be a-screwing)
And now someone else (can kiss your ass)
These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you
You been lying (and there ain't no believing)
And you keep (saming) when you ought to not bet
You been (staying) when you ought to (be a-leaving)
Now what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet
These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you
(You keep dressing ways you shouldn't be dressing)
And you keep thinking that you'll never get burned, ha!
I just found me a brand new box (spring matress)
What you know (bitch, you got a lot) to learn
These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna (stomp) all over you
Yeah
Are you ready boots?
Are you ready boots?
Are you ready boots?
Start walkin'!
(And you think I'm kidding, don't ya?!)
Dices que asi no estas bien pero no cambias nada
Dices que puedes hacer pero ni empiezas ni acabas
Luchas contigo esta vez no puedes salir corriendo
Es tan fuerte tu tormenta que fuera ves mojado el suelo
Y no recuerdas que tus botas nunca te fallaron
Que pisaste mil tormentas y siempre te has salvado
Solo tuviste que andar solo creer en tus pasos
Eres tu quien sabe mas eres quien saldra ganando
Hay tanta fuerza que debes romper el silencio que abrazas
Silencio de miedos silencio de planes
Que son posibles que tienen llave
Si dejas atras la pregunta de como saldran
Silencio y respuesta elige el que sea
La que te hace bien la que no duela
Veras como se abre una puerta
Solo tienes que entrar entra
��Que dia no salio el sol que dia no despertaste?
Recuerda cuando creiste perderte y te encontraste
Tan facil como que vives que suenas que sabes
Tan tuyo que si tu entras tu tambien sales
Hay tanta fuerza que debes romper el silencio que abrazas
Silencio de miedos silencio de planes
Que son posibles que tienen llave
Si dejas atras la pregunta de como saldran
Silencio y respuesta elige el que sea
La que no duela la que no duela
Veras como se abre una puerta
Solo tienes que entrar entra
The air is thick and the place is packed
I'm going out to get a heart attack
The light flashes and the mind goes numb
My head beats like a drum
Please hand another rum and coke
Something, to moisterise my soul
Every night is a leaving home
It is sad to be alone
I go out every other night
Coming home with a broken heart
Hit it, hit it, hit it
Hit it to me harder
Bass drums and tambourines
Try to fix the make-up, but the mirror's mean
Out to nourish a salty dream
Hit it, hit it, hit it
Hit it to me harder
Walking home on a lonely street
High heels and aching feet
Is this supposed to be my golden years
Another day disappears
Contrariada
Desconfortavel
Mascarada, Incontrolavel
Como se um copo tivesse arrastando um corpo
Descobrindo quando voce anda mal acompanhada
Sufocada
Impenetravel
Manipulada, Indesejavel
Pra que tantos livros em sua estante?
Tente guardar um instante pra nao se sentir tao mal-amada
Seus presentes nao valem tanto assim
Suas historinhas nao sao tao boas assim
Refrao:
Ve se entende agora
Faz a mala e vai embora
Nao! Nao pense em mais ninguem
Ficou facil agora
Poe esse cara pra fora
Nao! Nao pense em mais ninguem
Contrariada
Desconfortavel
Mascarada, incontrolavel
Como se um copo tivesse arrastando um corpo
Descobrindo quando voce anda mal acompanhada
Sufocada
Impenetravel
Manipulada, indesejavel
Pra que tantos livros em sua estante?
Tente guardar um instante pra nao se sentir tao mal-amada
Seus presentes nao valem tanto assim
Suas historinhas nao sao tao boas assim
Refrao
Nao se deixe enganar
Nao vale a pena
Nao se prive de nada
Nao vale a pena!
Hey my friend I thought you knew it's all an illusion
And nobody knows what to do, what's your point of view?
It goes on and on and on and on and on. BREAK OUT!
If you wanna dance better take your chance (suckers)
Don't be scared 'cause I'ma show you how
We can learn to boogie
I'ma break it down turn this world around (suckers)
If you wanna follow DO IT NOW
Gotta learn to boogie DO IT NOW
All the things they're selling you makes you think you need them
Pretty pretty girls with witty witty words
I don't know what you think you heard (suckers)
And nobody knows what to do, what's your point of view
It goes on and on and on and on and on. BREAK OUT!
We are slaves in our bedsheets 
Sunk to a new low
Is there something inside? 
Something you hide? 
A chain of sores 
A chain of sores 
We all suffer the symptoms 
Of a subtle disease 
Is this something, a toy 
For you to employ? 
Something left that a kiss could not destroy 
Boil the water
I really love the daughter
She's a flower
She's a scar
A space in the silence
She destroyed me with one blow
Suckers the girls roll
The suckers the girls roll
The suckers the girls roll
We are safe in our bedsheets 
Sunk to a new low
Is there something inside?
Something you hide?
A chain of sores
A chain of sores
Boil the water 
And led me to the slaughter 
It's a flower 
It's a scar
Boil the water 
A lamb led to the slaughter 
She's a flower 
She's a scar
Todo parece estar
queriendo cerrar una herida
lejos de abandonar
cerca de una despedida
No quiero mas
verte pasar
solo me quiero sentar a esperar
Lo fueron a matar
y lo dejaron con vida
sin sospechar
que todavia respira
No quiero mas
verte pasar
solo me quiero sentar a esperar
Que saltes al vacio y que no vuelvas nunca
y que toda tu vida te mate la culpa
de haberme robado una parte del alma
y es lo que a vos te hace falta
alejarte de aca
Vos queres ensenar
pero te faltan ideas
Vos sabes senalar
pero espera que te vean.
I'm a soldier on a battlefield
Got an army on the battlefield
Outnumbered like the Alamo
I don't even want to go
This is war
Yeah yeah yeah
This is war
Always stuck in a daydream
Can't focus on the other team
Hunted you all day and night
Now I'm ready for a fight
This is war
Yeah yeah yeah
This is war
I can't be your friend
'Cause I got to knock you out
Are you ready for a surprise?
I don't even think you even realize
They say that you're the best
You gotta follow all the rest
This is war
Yeah yeah yeah
This is war
I can't be your friend
'Cause I gotta knock you out
So I can win.
So what comes now
Run through the answers and you can feel the scratching
Get down
This breed bring it against so coy
A levitated incubation
Instincts with imprinted cryptic code
A dotted line hit return dash dash
If you took the time to unmask
Retrace the mockers of intemperance
In with the herd
Split poison ivy scratch rash
This calamine lotion made my skin feel good
Right before me they sat
A snitch inaugurated
Lets slip the hunger of these carnivores
This kin is a knock knock knocking on your door
Is it welcome if it happens
Heart sowed a trick - or - treat overture
With this promiscuous livestock
Every day is November first in this Sodom and Gomorrah
Get down
Run through the answers and you can feel the scratching
Get down
Yeah
This coup was made of incognito (x3)
In with the herd
Split poison ivy scratch rash
This calamine lotion made our skin feel good
Right before me they sat
A snitch inaugurated
Lets slip the hunger of these carnivores

I've been stuck
At this stupid job for far too long
And I just don't know
How much more of it I can take before I lose it
How can people that you see every day
Turn so evil when they come in and pay
For a burger and some fries then they yell
I swear I must be in a living
May I help you?
Tell me how you're doing on this very lovely day
Would you like to try a double bacon burger with a shake
I can fake a smile of a kind that you've never seen
'Cause my manager is a bigger douche than you could ever be
Leave me alone I've got work to do
Leave me alone I've got work to do
Leave me alone I've got work to do
Leave me alone I've got work to do
That's when they come
And they go and they come
And then they go and they come
Then one after the other
That's when they come
And they go and they come
And then they go and they come
Then one after the other
I don't think
That I can take another day
But I have to pay
The rent or I am gonna get evicted
I don't wanna go to work but I must
Might as pay, turn away in disgust
Deal with people that just like to complain
Their sane is dead, they long to dish out
Let me get the manager.
Tell me what's the problem, is there something I can do
Do you have yourself a boggle here that I can help you through
I am very sorry that we got your order wrong
If you give me just a second I can fix it in a jiffy
Moron
Leave me alone I've got work to do
Leave me alone I've got work to do
Leave me alone I've got work to do
Leave me alone I've got work to do
That's when they come
And they go and they come
And then they go and they come
Then one after the other
That's when they come
And they go and they come
And then they go and they come
Then one after the other
(Ahhh)
That's when they come
And they come and they come
And then they come and they come
Then one after the other
(Ahhh)
That's when they come
And they go and they come
And then they go and they come
Then one after the other
One right after the other
And here comes another
Oh, heh, how considerate of you to come in and order five minutes before we close. We already shut everything down, and cleaned it all up. But we'll go right ahead and fire those grills back up, just for you, champ.
No, no, it's cool. I don't even wanna go home. Especially not after a twelve hour shift with no lunch break. My reason for living is to serve YOU.
You know why? Because the customers always right, right? The customer is always right.
I'll kill you
I'll kill all you
Hey, where are you going
You forgot your fries
You know what? I quit.
Joo
Pitais jarkeva olla joo
Olla aikuinen mutten oo
On anteeksianto tarkeaa
Mutta jos noin kusipaa
Kuten sa
Naatko mita mun kadessa
Voi ala viitsi nyt itkea
Niin kuin niina paivina
Joina sa syytit sun perhetta
Mut nehan oli poissa
Kun kiusasit mua
Sa vaitit etta mitaan
En oo ilman sua
Naatko tan veitsen
Ma oon teroittanut
Miksi sa teit sen
Sammutit mut
Viela vahan on aikaa
Pieni ikuisuus
Sano aaneen se kulta
Etta ma en oo huono en oo huono
Kusipaa kun kuolee
Jossain syntyy uus
Ma haluun kuulla sen sulta
Etta ma en oo huono en oo huono
Jaa
Kaikki katsomaan meita jaa
Joku rapeltaa kannykkaa
Vielako sua havettaa
Saalittaa kaikki taa
Mita teen
Ma olin varma se paranee
Asiat selvii kun juttelee
Ja niin ma juttelin paljon ja lisaa
Sa syytit sun isaa
Mut sehan oli poissa
Kun kiusasit mua...
Viela vahan on aikaa...
Huuto nousee jostain mun takaa
Ja kiskoo kateni vierekkain
Konepelti on kylma kun silla makaa
Ma naan kun sa poistut pystypain
Viela vahan on aikaa...
Kusipaa kun kuolee...
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in
Drop dead, a bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me, what would you say
I'd say its time too late
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in
Ignorance and understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding
How far will we take this
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me, what would you say
I'd say its time too late
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe
This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this is worthless
Tell me
So
What have we done
We're in a war that can't be won
This can't be real
'Cause I don't know what to feel
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
For this world to believe
Yes I did it and I'll do it again 
It doesn't matter if I am your best friend 
I don't think so 
You're not that smart 
Over and over it breaks my heart 
The cycle continues time for your crime 
The pain comes back in an ugly design 
Her makeup smears 
The tears that she cries 
Over and over every night 
Emotional swords slash my soul 
And now the pain it takes control 
I think about you 
I think about me 
Think about the way that it used to be 
I need a bottle
I need some pills
I need a friend 
And I need some thrills 
A shoulder to cry on a friend to depend on 
When life gets rough 
Time and time again 
You think about yourself before you think about me 
Time and time again 
You think about yourself before you think about me 
It's like a fight every single day 
It's always easy when you have it your way 
Deep in my heart 
In the depths of my soul 
My selfish ways are out of control
I'm sorry that it comes down to this 
I punch through the wall as I break my fist 
The makeup smears 
The tears that we cry 
Over and over every night 
Time and time again 
You think about yourself before you think about me 
Time and time again 
You think about yourself before you think about me 
You're so selfish 
You're making me want to end this relationship 
You're making me want to end this 
Time and time again 
You think about yourself before you think about me
You think about yourself before you think about me
You think about yourself before you think about me
You think about yourself before you think about me
Loving ties unwind
Lost time behind 
Loving ties unwind 
Lost time behind.
Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding
That withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Second to none
Isn't funny how some people never practice what the preach
Isn't it sad that the strongest arm's still to short to reach
I watch him struggle with the fact that he's become what he said he'll never be
Hip parties and sunglasses at night they help him not to see
Can he see?
He's been high on a young girls vibe
Never alone on a Saturday night
He's been a around the world, about a million times
But he's never been love, not on the inside
Isn't so messed up to be witness for a man who won't confess,
He won't confess, no
That he lost his truth, so caught up in believin' his own press
I watch him struggle with the fact that he relies on people that don't really care,
They don't care, no no no
You say that the business is a whack
So baby why are you so deep in there
One day it's gonna be to late
Or maybe it's to late, anyway
Famous has made you shameless
But not blameless
Just loveless, loveless, loveless
Picture time as before where you slept through it all
They believe you were there why deny what I said?
Vicious lies being heard you stand there how absurd
And with hate in your mind convict me
Take my life away or give back the answer you hold
And stand unashamed of what you have done
Don't just walk away unlock the chains from your heart
Prove my innocence 'cause I did no wrong
Empty words lies from the start? we stood strong never apart
Had it all in our hands we had it all, yes you and me
Now the tables have turned all I gave you return
Makes it hard to believe what you've done to me
Don't call me your friend, won't you understand I don't need
Take my life away or give back the answer you hold
And stand unashamed of what you have done
Don't just walk away unlock the chains from your heart
Prove my innocence 'cause I did no wrong
It's all been done before and
No one can listen to anyone's answers
They're drifting farther everyday
And they say
We hold our hands to block the sun
We blame the light for what we've done
We look away so We'll forget what We've become
First take what you want
Then you throw it away
This is the way of their world
Don't know what you've got
Until it's taken away
This is the way of your
World
When the night falls you know who you are
And you cast reflections as the mirror gathers rust
It's so safe and lonely with you
Lovers ripping in two
Grind away till nothing's left
There's nothing left inside
First take what you want
Then you throw it away
This is the way of their world
Don't know what you've got
Until it's taken away
This is the way of your world
Your lives will fade before their time
And you'll never say goodbye
The end of all the things you know
And all of what you can be
It's fading fast before you

Happy robots say "life is fine", they're the ones I loathe
They're stupid or they're lying - or a little bit of both.
Ignore disasters and say that life is great,
It never stops a smile on your shit consuming faces.
The stupid hippies, too stoned to see their lives are fucked,
Go with the flow into the shitter they are sucked
And then they
They've got these magic crystals that don't do a god damn thing.
Just stinking of pachoulli while they choke on their ginseng.
Beating on a drum you sing of quiet and peace.
Burning marijuana and take the time to hug a tree
Say no possessions but get all that you can.
You stink like shit and smile through it
Don't ever trust a happy man.
Cheery retard masses with evil osmond smiles,
Way too glad to be here cause "he" is on your side
And then they
Hand out propaganda for sheep to join the cult.
Collecting guns they rape your daughters but its nobody's at fault.
I don't want to go to heaven, its filled with pricks like you
I won't go inside the gates, leave me in the waiting room,
I'm sure that god hates you, he thinks your an obsessed fan.
See how you are, I'll never trust a happy man,
Never trust a happy man.
Scattered thoughts and scattering masses
The war has just begun
The bully pulpit never had so much fun
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a renegade who wants to get stomped
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a hammerhead who wants to get stopped
Who wants to get stomped on
All I see are daisies for miles and miles
Lighting universes
The rappers in their limousines just want to be loved
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a renegade who wants to get served
Like a wrecking ball on a string
I'm a hammerhead who wants to get stopped
Who wants to get stomped on
Take me back to days of summer
And give me all the simple things
I bet you got that tattooed on your lonely heart
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a renegade who wants to get stomped
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a hammerhead who wants to get stopped
Who wants to get stomped on
I laid my black heart on the table
It may just make itself at home
Cut short your cord length on the phone
Your smoke alarms and barred windows
Can't save your house god burn your soul
Is my dinner in the oven?
Lovebird, you haven't touched your bread
Revenge served cold, breakfast in (death) bed
I'll never touch a hair on your pretty head
I want your heart, I want your head
Sweetheart, I'd send you up to heaven
But you'd eat them out of house and home
My tender jewel my precious pearl
My ruby red my diamond girl
String up my kitten by her curls
So how does it feel to know that this is all you'll ever be my darling?
A slight grease fire, accident-prone at home
Say we won't lie to ourselves like those bastards you swear
Say it to me we make this bond
You and me or you and me
Do you want to go to heaven?
Come to the light hang on to this arm
My good boys good girls and good gods
The sinking ship the grand applause
You owe it to me make me this bond
You and me, you and me
Do you want to go to heaven?
Oh dear, oh dear and if I show you her dark side
Should you meet your malcontent or maybe meet with an accident
Good daddies won't let you die
Oh do you want to go to heaven?
I will never let you die
Tass'on nainen tuulen tuoma 
tuulen tuoma ve'en vetama 
meren aaltojen ajama 
meren tyrskyn tyontelema 
Kuin mie kaynen laulamahan 
laulan mie meren mesiksi 
suoloiksi meren somerot 
meren hiekat hernehiksi 
Yhen vyoni vyotannalla 
yhen paitani panolla 
solkeni solittamalla 
polkimeni painamalla 
Nouse luontoni lovesta 
syntini syvasta maasta 
syntini syvasta maasta 
haavan alta haltiainen.
The sun shines red
Over the sand
Psycho shutter speed
Red eye red eye
Buried forgotten
Left to the dust
Instructions are haywire
Unearth the voyeur
He's in here with me
Gets him out of my head
Eyes plugged in to my veins
The devil walks in the sand
See all we see
And touch all we breathe
Feel his dreams through us
Living the recess
Woken in hunger
Electron alarm
Uncle Sam is spared
The carrion keeper
He's in here with me
Gets him out of my head
Eyes plugged in to my veins
The devil walks in the sand
(She knows his name)
(She knows his name)
(She knows his name) The devil treads the sand
(She knows his name) Stopping all she can
(She knows his name) The devil treads the sand
(She knows his name) Stopping all she can
He's in here with me
Gets him out of my head
Eyes plugged in to my veins
The devil walks in the sand
He's in here with me
Gets him out of my head
Eyes plugged in to my veins
The devil walks in the sand
I am a one-ton, armor plated;
Living breathing being
I wade in streams all day;
Eat grass; and little else
Then one day my world was shattered
By freakish two-legged beings
Wielding instruments of pain
Hell-bent on striking me down
A super-psyochotic need
To make me and scream and bleed
Brought on solely by greed
I only want to be free
If I had my way, I'd stomp you flat
Under my bulk
Or ram this horn you so crave
Into your fucking throat
I'll topple the noisy creatures
In which you flee
But I'll never understand
Why you want me to die
Who was around when the world was falling down?
Who turned away? Couldn't bother to be around this now
Who walked away when the game wasn't fun to play?
And my escape became my only game
Hand me over and hand me down
Get me out of your sight
No direction, my compass is broken
Where'd you leave me tonight?
I was a child, and now it seems so long ago
Why'd you abandon me? Maybe it's not for me to know
No explanation needed, nothing can change the way things went
You just weren't interested, I guess, I guess
Some days fine, others out of my mind
And the curse I curse is the worst it gets
I hold it inside as you sleep, as you hide
From the mess that you made of your life
Some days fine, others out of my mind (who was around when you were hungry?)
And the curse I curse is the worst it gets
I hold it inside as you sleep, as you hide (who eased the pain of all your sadness?)
From the mess that you made of your life
Who played with you when you were lonely?
Who was around?
What will your conscience say? Maybe you'll change the channel soon
Or simply hide it in the chest of drawers inside your room
Like old linoleum, battered and worn beyond repair
Go burn the whole house down, like anyone cares
Maybe in time these indelible lines
Will fade like the hopes and the tears you denied
These feelings are gone, they've been buried along
With the rest of the mess that you made in your chest of drawers
Maybe in time these indelible lines (who was around when you were hungry?)
Will fade like the hopes and the tears you denied
These feelings are gone, they've been buried along (who eased the pain of all your sadness?)
With the rest of the mess that you made 
Who played with you when you were lonely?
Who was around when I was hungry?
Joskus tekis mieli lyoda otsaan

Deine Party war an einem Sonntag Abend
Am ersten warmen Tag dieses Jahr
Ich wollte mich deinen Eltern vorstellen
Bier trinken mit deinem Vater,
Mit deiner Mutter uber Musicals reden
Und mich beliebt machen.
Doch all das stumpfsinnige Geschwatz
Dieser Sippschaft, die du deine Freunde nennst
Hatte mich nicht gestort
Ich hatte sogar zugehort
Deine Party war an einem Sonntag Abend
Am ersten warmen Tag dieses Jahr
The only boy I understand
The one ashamed to be a man
Just rape the world
Because you can
That's what it takes
To be a man
Well, knock her up
Just slap her hand
Prove it to me just be a man

I'm big enough to be a man
Tell you the truth

So impotent

Well give it up

Under the gun to be a man

Give anything
Be a man
I'm potent yeah
Be a man

Be a man

I'm potent yeah
The fire started long ago
The flames burned out, still embers glow
So charred and black
There's nothing left to burn, to burn
We had the same dream
Lived life to extreme
A loaded gun jammed by a rose
The thorns are knots around your head
Your ego cursed you till you bled
You cannot crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah
The future isn't set in stone
Decisions past leave you alone
Betrayed us all with your own selfish greed, your greed, yeah
New soldiers now say
That your beggars collect
Re-crucified and paid by you
The thorns are knots around your head
Your ego cursed you till you bled
You cannot crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah
We were like brothers with the world in our hands
You always have too much to say
Someday you look back and you wonder why
You let it all slip away, yeah
Crucify the dead
Crucify the dead
The thorns are knots around your head
Your ego cursed you till you bled
You cannot crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah

The best fuck you've ever had
But I never could do more
I always leave before it ends
Before it even begins
I push you away
In verge of tears
Still you're the only one I want
One I desperately need
You're so irresistible
Why did I do it all wrong
I just want you back
All my intentions are good
I just want you back
Hopeless but endless love story
I want to live a life that you
Can write a book about
I want audience
I want us
In a pretty picture on my wall
You dried my eyes so well but still
No peace inside of me
You dried my eyes so well
No, I'm not sorry
You dried my eyes so well
You dried my eyes too well
No, I'm not sorry
You dried my eyes too well
Chances are you've heard this
But your headphones mute your equilibrium
The mattress hit, the mistress fooled
But nothing ever felt this good
Wake you up and shake you
But your motor skills still speak in slurs
Court jester, don't kill the humour
Court jester, don't kill the humour
Chances are you've cursed this
The volume of the speakers must be proud
Don't change your tune
A princess' work is never done
In the bed and breakfast beck and call
Wake you up and shake you
But your motor skills still speak in slurs
Court jester, don't kill the humour
Court jester, don't kill the humour
Eeyore, chase your own
Eeyore, chase your own
Court jester, don't kill the humour
Court jester, don't kill the humour

In hearing tests again
Court jester, don't kill the humour

She can hear water rushing underground
She can hear him breathing, breathing
She can hear him walking up the stairways
She can hear him on the ceiling, ceiling
She can see the birds living in the leaves with their fucked up, fucked up language

You're furious, I never taught you to sing
You carry rocks in your head and pitch them
Without warning, Happy drunk
You're furious, I beg you for sin
I beg your skin, You buy a whore
Don't give her water
You're furious
Don't wake the baby
Step on its fucking head
You may be an asshole
I love you instead
Don't wake the baby
Step on its fucking head
You may be an asshole
I love you instead
Don't wake the baby
Shut up you're waking the baby
Shut up you're waking the baby
Daddy feeds the scary clown
He likes me more with his pants down
Fuck you!
Don't wake the baby
Shut up you're waking the baby
Shut up you're waking the baby
Shut up
Shut the fuck up
I don't feel it,
Your so-called confession,
That taste of simple truth
Has bled you dry
A heart to trade-off,
A love repressed,
Yes all your lies
Add up to regression
There are so many things
I need to say
There are so many things
I need to say to you,
It never was easy
Throw it all back
And I'll tear it all down
In front of you
But you will never understand
What I went through for this
All the twists and turns
Have left me silent,
My constant decadence
Hanging over
Always making promises
I'm destined to destroy
So many things
I need to say
There are so many things
I need to say to you,
It never was easy
Throw it all back
And I'll tear it all down
It never was easy
My constant decadence
Hanging over
Always making promises
I'm destined to destroy
But I'll try to love again
Without fighting to know you
With honestly needing
And always forgiving
I'll try to love again
Without fighting to know you
With honestly needing
And always forgiving
I'll try to love again
Without fighting to know you
Honestly needing
Always forgiving
Forgiving
Forgiving
Forgiving
I awoke dead
The sun now faded
It's laid out
The monorail
I awoke dead
The sun now faded
The progress of science
Torn away from my warmth
The progress of science
Put to work to destroy
For diplomacy
Stupid human scum
Insect gods
Put to work to destroy
For diplomacy
Stupid human scum
Insect gods
Territorial and pissing
On their history
Put to work to destroy
For diplomacy
Taste the venom of the wicked
In my axis I splinter
Ground to dust around
I still see what you don't
I awoke dead
The sky filled with bombs
I awoke dead
The sky filled with bombs
I awoke dead
The sky filled with bombs
I awoke dead
The sky filled with bombs
Look at me, I'm alive,
I wanna jump but I don't know why!
Don't wanna live, don't wanna die,
Just wanna see if I can fly
I'm desperate, I'm glorious
I'm going down with up interest
Hold onto me, hold on tight
And let's just see who gets out alive
Stupid, 'cause no one cares,
There's not a net, there's no one there
Can you fly-y-y, you'll never reach me
I'm too high-igh-igh, it's my own myth I'll,
Deci-i-ide, to finish what I started and
I-i-i-i, I know the meaning of life!
Look at me, I'm gonna jump!
There's not a net, I'm so far up
I'm glorious and I defy
Gravity to even try
It's through the fight, it's time and I
Wanna go for the speed of light
Stupid, 'cause no one cares,
There's not a net and there's no one there
Come in here from the light,
I have to leave you behind,
I know the meaning of life
It's dark, but love is so light
It's dark, but love is so light
I'm just a flash, light of the sky
Now look at me I'm still a fight
I hit the ground, and then sit
Around six of the glorious
Ve? srce zagori ko te pogledam
Ti me gleda? tokrat se zagledava oba
Le nocoj ta pomlad je le za naju
Jaz na trati nabral bom cvetlice zate le
Zdaj ni ve? nabijanja v prazno
Zdaj ni ve? bedarij
Daj nam mir umakni to golazen
?koda vro?e krvi
Pa da ne bo nehote
U?aljen tvoj ponos
A zgleda, da je ?e
Nam je dost tele butaste norije
In osladnosti ki nam kljuvajo o?i
In v ?tali se davijo ?ivali ko izvejo
Da je za njih ta tvoj navdih
?e tamali so posrali se k videli so tvoje delo
In debili so zarili svoje glave v zemljo
?e bi vedu kdo bi tebi dopovedu da bi rabu skero
Ne zakaj k pol pokvar humor
K je k je ?e tolk bolan da je jasn kdo je nor
Jest ti bom naredu stih k bo dobr...k ti
Nam je dost tele butaste norije
In osladnosti ki nam kljuvajo o?i
In v ?tali se davijo ?ivali ko izvejo
Da je za njih ta tvoj navdih
Nocoj bom vse zate naredil
Na tvoj na?in tole povedal
O veseeno malo nase bom gledal
In pod vokal ?age prtegnu
Nocoj bom vse zatte naredil
A ?al ne gre brez zajebancije
Nocoj bom vse zate naredil
A ?al ne gre ker tega res mamo dost
Nam je dost tele butaste norije
In osladnosti ki nam kljuvajo o?i
In v ?tali se davijo ?ivali ko izvejo
Da je za njih ta tvoj navdih
Nam je dost tele butaste norije
In osladnosti ki nam kljuvajo o?i
In v ?tali se davijo ?ivali ko izvejo
Da je za njih ta tvoj navdih

And why do we call ourself 'Niggaz 4 Life'.
'Cause if we die we still gon' be some dead niggas.
"You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?"
"We haven't spotted them yet."
"But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity."
(MC Ren)
A 100 Miles and Runnin'.
MC Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in.
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck.
Chances are usually not good
'Cause I freeze with my hands on a hot hood.
And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who.
When in a black and white the capacity is two.
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers.
Now wearin' my dyes, 'cause I'm not stupid, mutherfuckers.
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past.
Point blank - They can kizz my black azz.
I didn't stutter when I said "Fuck Tha Police".
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace.
Now it's broken and can't be fixed.
'Cause police and little black niggers don't mix so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall.
Runnin' like a team. Well, see, I might have slayed y'all.
So for now pack the gun and
Hold it in the air.
'Cause MC Ren has a 100 Miles of Runnin'...
"Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run."
"FBI sources tell us that the four are headed"
"100 miles to their homebase, Compton."
(Eazy E)
Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear.
So I can tell you why...
(Dr. Dre)
Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase.
With a steady pace on the face that just we raced.
The road ahead goes on and on.
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon.
Runnin' on but never runnin' out.
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out.
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do.
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude.
Confused...
Yo, but Dre's a nigga with nothin' to lose.
One of the few who's been accused and abused
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds.
But you don't know shit till you been in my shoes.
And Dre is back from the C-P-T.
Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E.
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!
And any mutherfucker that disagrees.
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass.
'Cause I'm a nigga known for havin' a notorious past.
My mind was slick - my temper was too quick.
Now the FBI's all over my dick.
(Eazy E)
Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock.
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block.
A 100 Miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch.
A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch.
Yeah, back to Compton again.
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen.
'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time.
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind.
Runnin' like I just don't care.
Compton's 50 miles but, yo, I'mma get there.
Archin' my back and on a straight rough.
Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out.
From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by.
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm
A straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'
Straight at yo ass.
A 100 Miles and Runnin'...
This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton.
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:
"Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide."
Good luck brothers.
(MC Ren)
Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose.
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused.
I know it was a set-up.
So now I'm gonna get up.
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up.
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong.
They got everybody singin' my "Fuck Tha Police" song.
And while they treat my group like dirt,
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts.
So I'mma run till I can't run no more.
'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score.
I got a urge to kick down doors.
At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls.
(Dr. Dre)
Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'.
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'.
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it.
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it.
The number's even - now I'm leavin'.
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in.
Her and the troops are right behind me.
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me.
(Eazy E)
One more mile to go through the dark streets.
Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet.
But you know I never stumble or lag last.
I'm almost home so I better haul ass.
Tearin' up everything in sight.
It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight.
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
Four mutherfuckers goin' crazy with
A 100 Miles of Runnin'!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Surprise, niggas!
I'm standing at the shore
See the ferries passing by
Waiting for the final day
Which almost never comes
I will never understand
Why I've lost you
Remembering your face again
When I found you
I see blue lights in your eyes
Reflections of another land
Our golden sun will rise
I will wait until the end
Your hair still smells like the sea
Your blue lips are so cold
I really would die to see
Your pale skin in the light
Though you're gone forever
Will never get awake again
But I am still waiting
For the day which never comes
I see blue lights in your eyes
Reflections of another land
Our golden sun will rise
I will wait until the end
Every now and then I think about you
And it makes me, it breaks me
Out of you and into me, I'll make it
So take a look at what you do to my head
When you're leaving, I'm breathing
Out of me and into you, I feel sick
I feel sick
Now that you're leaving
It complicates our lives
But I am the reason
That I will stay alive
We are the energy
We are the same as you
Take everything you need
We are the answer to
The broken, breaking through
Take everything from me
Every now and then I dream about you
I've lost the feeling, it's dead skin
I will never be dependent again
And every now and then I think about you
It's bringing me closer to closure
Every now and then I know it's over
It's over
Now that you're leaving
It complicates our lives
But I am the reason
That I will stay alive
We are the energy
We are the same as you
Take everything you need
We are the answer to
The broken, breaking through
Take everything from me
We are the energy
We are the same as you
Take everything you need
We are the answer to
The broken, breaking through
Take everything from me
'Cause I'm not dying
No I'm not dying
Today
Pop pop don't stop I need your heat
Raw paws won't stop these dancing feet
One crown, two kings, three wars, four more
Dead eyes live lies, I know you're sore
Two kills to me, two hearts too far
I need you. I need you. I need you.
Butterflies of love rain on me
Fifty reasons why you'll see I need you
Pilot this plane our path remains
You paint the sky such beautiful shades
I need you. I need you. I need you.
Butterflies of love rain on me
Fifty reasons why you'll see I need you.

To distract from the mess I'm in
I would find religion somehow
But I can never make a go of it
Nothing's working! x3
Are you listening to me!?
Nothing's working! x3
Are you listening to me!?
Electronic cheap narcotics
Are just stoking the disease
I've got no ambition to show
And I can't tell you what I really need
Nothing's working! x3
Are you listening to me!?
Nothing's working! x3
Are you listening to me!?
Well you've told me once but I've told you twice
I'll never take your good advice
When passion drives then hold the reins
If you need revenge then dig
Two graves!
Carnal bondage
Bacchanalian knowledge
Fetishistic anomalies
(Nothing's working)
Let's just fuck our brains out my love
And you can fake what you can't achieve
Nothing's working! x3
Are you listening to me!?
Nothing's working! x3
Are you listening to me!?
Nothing's working x3
I exit through the spotlight glare
I stepped out into thin air
Into a perfume so rarefied
"Here comes the bride"
Not quite aside, they snide, "She's number four"
"There's number three just by the door"
Those in the know, don't ever flatter her, they go one better
"She was selling speedboats in a tradeshow when he met her"
Look at her now
She's starting to yawn
She looks like she was born to it
But it was so much easier
When I was cruel
She reaches out her arms to me
Imploring: "Another melody?"
So she can dance her husband out on the floor
The captains of industry just lie there where they fall
In an eau-de-nil and pale carnation creation
A satin sash and velvet elevation
She straightens the tipsy head-dress of her spouse
While her's recalls a honey house
There'll be no sorrows left to drown
Early in the morning in your evening gown
But it was so much easier
When I was cruel
The entrance hall was arranged with hostesses and ushers
Who turned out to be the younger wive's nursing schoolgirl crushes
Parting the waves of those few feint friends
Fingers once offered are now too heavy to extend
The ghostly first wife glides up stage whispering to raucous talkers
Spilling family secrets out to flunkeys and castrato walkers
See that girl,
Watch that scene
Digging the "Dancin' Queen"
Two newspaper editors like playground sneaks
Running a book on which of them is going to last the week
One of them calls to me.
And he says, "I know you"
"You gave me this tattoo back in '82"
"You were a spoilt child then with a record to plug"
"And I was a shaven headed seaside thug"
"Things haven't really changed that much"
"One of us is still getting paid too much"
There are some things I can't report
The memory of his last retort
But it was so much easier
When I was cruel
Look at me now
She's starting to yawn
She looks like she was born to it
Ah, but it was so much easier
When I was cruel
I want you to know
That I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but
The best for you both
An older version of me? Is she perverted like me?
Would she go down on you in a theater?
Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died? But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well
Things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well
I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face, how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name 
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died? but you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Ooh
Ahh
Ooh ah
Oh ah ah
Ooh ah
Ah ah ah oh
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?
Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Did I hear you say that
You want another chance
You need another try
You're ready to reclaim your prize
So, you want my love back
Why'd you let it slip away
Why'd you ever let me go
Your change of heart has come too late
Well, the door is locked
You can't get in
The game has changed
You've been
1 - Too gone, too long, baby
To ever get back again
In my heart
Too gone, too long, baby
You're too many tears too late
To ever come back, to get back in my arms
Been gone
Too gone, too long
Didn't you hear me say that
You'd be a fool to leave
You'd regret the road you chose
You'd come running right back to me
You had such a good love, sugar
You'll never find with no one else
But what I knew all the time
You had to find out for yourself
And now you'll never know
That love again
You're on your own
You've been
Been gone
Too gone, too long
Did you really think I'd take you back
Let you back in my life
Oh, baby
Just like that
Someone new is loving me
Loving you is what used to be
Baby, you're too late
To win my heart again
No, never
No, never
Just too long
I don't need you
I don't want you
Later for you baby
Oh, oh
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back
No more
No more
Ni ar den stora graa massan
Ingen hor er rost
Ni kommer aldrig fatta
Konsumtion ar ingen trost
Vinst och produktion
Deras javla religion
Offrad pa maktens altare
Slagen i blod

Se er omkring
Vakna - Vakna for fan
Maktens murar rasar
Respektlosa svin
Exploaterar allt dom ser

His head is a little interior of grey mirrors
Drains like water out the hole at the far end
The dead smell of fresh wounds
The white light that opens the doors
I can feel the daylight
A bonewhite light
His head is a little interior of grey mirrors
Drains like water out the hole at the far end
He suffers this desert heat
Stretching its fine, irritating sand 
His head is a little interior of grey mirrors
Drains like water out the hole at the far end
Too many
Fucking people
I don't know why
But people make me angry
Inner segregation
Isolated
Solitude
Depressed reality
Saves my sanity
Happiness is a state of mind
Sadness
Fills all minds all the time
We are not alive
I wish I'd never see
Another human again
Keep my hostile thoughts to myself
I'd rather be alone
When it rains it rains plenty
I think you need to walk
I think you need to walk home
We don't need to talk
I think you need to walk home
Sun shines on my skin
Rips my head right off
It's burning it's burning it's burning (tears right through)
I can see all the veins in my lids when I close my eyes
Now I can see right through (all of you)
I can't complain about the same (hi hi hi)
When I'm sitting alone (some people think)
Reading a book at home (they know what heat is)
And it seems like such a waste
And it seems like such a shame
Always
Slamming overhead (hurting my hands)
Against the same fucking wall
I don't need no razors
'Cause summer is cutting me again
I don't need no razors
'Cause summer is cutting me again
I don't need no razors
'Cause summer is cutting me again
I don't need no razors
'Cause summer is cutting me again
I don't need no razors
'Cause summer is cutting me again
All we get is censored news
Either left or raving views
Melting ice and rising waters
Tend to lead to mutilated daughters

Is anybody else here sick of this shit?
Sick of this shit... sick of this shit?
Is anybody else here sick of this shit?
I'm sick of it, sick of it!
Poison coffee, diamond blood,
Feed your children toxic food,
Factory farming killing flora,
Puppy mills for fur lined collars.
Chronic fatigue, anti-depressants,
Credit card for Christmas presents,
Fair unbalance, Foxy Fox,
Blowjob parties, celebs in detox.
Is anybody else here sick of this shit?
Sick of this shit... sick of this shit?
Is anybody else here sick of this shit?
I'm sick of it, sick of it!
I'm turning on, to different information;
I'm tuning in to a finer high vibration;
I'm tuning in, turning on, and tuning in.
I'm tuning in, turning on, and tuning in.
Cocktail parties, personal talkers
Auto-tuning folk punk rockers
Pig feed killing soil
Now we're spilling blood for oil.
Then all the leaders thank the lord
And drug your kids for being bored.
Forgotten the earth is our mother,
No wonder that we shoot each other.
If this is what we're being fed,
This is Generation Zed;
This is Generation Zed.
I'm turning on, to different information;
I'm tuning in to a finer high vibration;
I'm tuning in, turning on, and tuning in.
I'm tuning in, turning on, and tuning in.
(Tuning/Sick of... medley fades out)
It frustrates me
That I don't have the words to explain to you what I'm feeling now
I'm not moved that much but what I just heard moved me to the left
More to the left
I don't know what put me there
If I had a guess then your voice would top this list
Leave me, Leave me be
I don't need a bed to hide behind, I'm laying by myself
But your sheets are on my mind
I don't know who put them there
But if I had a guess your voice would top this list
Leave me, Leave me be
I don't want to remember summers in December
And I don't want to remember last summer in June
Leave me
A fior di pelle salirono gli sbotti
Usando i nervi a mo' di comodi condotti
Fu zona rossa nell'attimo di un lampo
La superficie di un colpo senza scampo
Di lacerata sensazione
Sentirsi vulcani in eruzione
Un esplosione ormai vicina
Avrebbe acceso quella fulgida mattina
Ma che tragitto curioso
Fa quel tram chiamato sospiri e guai
Dopo un risveglio gioioso
All'inferno porta e non torna mai 
Ci sono istanti che vivere e una merda
Che vada a fuoco poi
E pur sempre una scoperta
E pur sempre una scoperta
E pur sempre una scoperta 
A fior di pelle avvamparono gli sbotti
Bruciando i nervi e le vene e i loro fiotti
La zona rossa esplose in un secondo e fu
Davvero come deflagrasse un mondo
Oh che esecrabile emozione
Sentirsi vulcani in eruzione
Incandescente come la lava
Che dalla bocca terrifica e sbava
Ma che discesa gloriosa
Fa quel magma senza fermarsi mai
Come una belva furiosa
Il suo inferno porta portando guai 
Ci sono istanti che vivere e una merda
Che vada a fuoco poi
E pur sempre una scoperta 
Sono le volte che proprio
No non ce la fai piu
Che vorresti volar per davvero
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Per poterti sentire leggero
Come il cielo impassibile
Leggero ed impassibile
Leggero ed impassibile 
Ma che finale odioso
Quel can can di grida e gestualita
Quinto cerchio melmoso
Dell'inferno ulula la realta 
Ci sono istanti che vivere e una merda
Nessuna cosa al mondo sa come si disperda
In quegli istanti
In cui vivere e una merda
Che vada a fuoco poi
E purtroppo cosa certa 
Sono le volte che proprio
No non ce la fai piu
Che vorresti volar per davvero
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Per poterti sentire leggero
Come il cielo impassibile
Impassibile
Impassibile
Impassibile
I've had enough, morning papers chill me to the bone,
Eyes sewn shut, stilted conversation breaking up,
Heads cracking up, biological depression, drugs aren't enough,
The travesty of science waking up, I've had enough,
My thinning blood, reaction-based anxiety, I've had enough,
Frustration isn't helping, turning black, decisions suck,
Immobilised from hair down to my feet blue coming up,
Optimism wretched in my throat, no working parts,
Broken like a train disaster, I've had enough,
My thinning blood, reaction-based anxiety,
I've had enough, my thinning blood, concentrated therapy,
No getting out, no question of a head start fair or fake,
No getting up, knuckles smashing windows in my wake,
Like throwing up, nausea restricting loving host,
Mistrusted start, chemical replacement in my head,
I've had enough, my thinning blood, reaction based anxiety
I've had enough, my thinning blood, concentrated therapy.
I-N-I-T-I
A-T-I-O-N.
Follow you home after every show.
Perforated into tiny fragments.
Heavy breathing's your new fan club.
A John Hancock with the safety off,
After every show.
And how this pedestal fits like glove.
Such a pity I built no ladder from the roots
And above I'll be hacking off,
After every show.

Watch you clap your hands by the stage.
Lend me your ears for just another page.

Around your neck
You know you're beautiful,

I'm a living sunset
Lightning in my bones
Push me to the edge
But my will is stone
Fools will be fools
And wise will be wise
But I will look this world
Straight in the eyes
What good is a man
Who won't take a stand
What good is a cynic
With no better plan
Reality is sharp
It cuts at me like a knife
Everyone I know
Is in the fight of their life
Take your face out of your hands
And clear your eyes
You have a right to your dreams
And don't be denied
I believe in a better way
God doesn't keep the failures from me
Like an assassin for the better half
The weak are washing upon the shores
I've got a need to kick them down
Knee jerk reaction, got a mouth on me
Sure to make enemies of best friends
Why am I stricken with a pair of these
Lips likened to poison in a rat trap?
Are you still down with me?
Got a knack for knockin' all my loved ones down
Maybe it's what keeps them always coming back
How can I expect to ever be loved
When all I can do is just to break you down?
Never think to censor the pride inside
Take a shot for nothing rather than not
Always have to have the last word, no matter what
Is it in my blood to have to take you down?
Are you still down with me?
'Cause I am just a bastard
And I always will be
A stupid fucking bastard...
No sleep till the location is found
No sleep till that man is out of town
No sleep till I can't hear the sound
Of your voice your voice telling me there is no choice
No sleep till that man is found
No sleep till he's kicked right out of town
No sleep till I can't hear the sound
Of your voice your voice telling me there is no choice
Your voice your voice your voice
There is a choice.

(AiYAHHHHHHHHH!)
Chorus: Busta Rhymes + M.O.P.
Everytime I take a look, the only thing I see is
My live niggaz in the spot
Tell me what y'all want
Give me everything you got
Y'all niggaz ready to do it
Let's blow the motherfuckin spot
All my niggaz
Attention... (loud and clear)
Where my niggaz ready for war? (we right here!)
Get 'em (when we spot em) hit 'em (kid we got em)
Where my niggaz ready for war? (we right here!)
(Billy Danze)
I got reason to believe, some of you niggaz feel
The man isn't live and direct (GET AT EM BILL!)
LONG, breathe easy pop, this is Hip-Hop
In the HARM WAY, we do it the war way, all day
I never procrastinate (you shouldn't)
I'm from where the war games fascinate (you couldn't)
You wouldn't believe what they've been tellin' me
The perfect match is jail and me
'Cause I was born with a felony (uh uh uh)
Fuck that! How this shit look
When a nigga stretched out, with his chest out
And a mess out in Brooklyn, HI-YAHHHHHH
(Busta Rhymes)
Y'all motherfuckers is back?!
Y'all motherfuckers don't know how to act
Y'all motherfuckers attack!
(Billy Danze)
And those motherfuckers are wack, I travelled a rocky road
Swift to the Flipmode, quick grip for the unload
Father forgive me for my sins
But I'ma raise hell to the bitter end - I'm a soldier!
(Lil' Fame)
Fuck the bullshit! I kick a bone out yo' ass
Hardrock nigga?! I kick a stone out yo' ass!
Warning, to all those, caps get peeled
Quicker than e-mail to your ass sayin', "Kill kill kill!"
Curb chasin, straight lacin, with a Mac-10 blazin'
Split yo' ass up like a Temptation
You cats is animated cartoons (WHO YOU?)
The return of Goodfellas Part Two
BITCH throw your fuckin' guns up, put your fuckin' hands down
HOT FLAMES UP, (buck you with), (BUSTA BUST DOWN)
We sneak the guns right in, y'all keep tryin'
And I'ma check all pussies like a G-Y-N
Open up your can of "Whoop Ass"; I'll open up
A fresh can of "I'll Fuck Yo' Ass Up Quick Fast"
Flipmode, M.O.P. Fizzy Wo-mack, Wo-mack
Y'all know who the fuck I am!
(Busta Rhymes)
Aiyyo yo-yuh-yo, and now I hear no one
(You) would let less than a motherfucker fear no one
None of y'all niggaz don't really wanna fuck with the dread
The street brawler stomp your face into the back of yo' head
C'mon now, I'm quick to roast fry boil and even toast a guy
Multiply the ghosts like the world's greatest coke supply
Shit changed, you sellin WEED over the damn computer
Introduce the millennium STOMP nigga for the future
I be that prime honorary nigga
That'll voluntarily blast the last, Tom and Jerry ass nigga
And write raps to the sound of these gats
Perhaps my raps will paralyze a bitch-ass and make him collapse
Yo, see they be quick to bust they fashion of a calico
My niggaz Berkowitz and that other motherfucker Fizzy Wo'
Mashin through the city yo, and the foot it don't lie
Ready to blow this bitch up at the drop of a dime
(Ad libs for about 8 seconds before fade)
I don't know where I belong
Is somebody there to catch my fall
I'm running in circles to get where I started from
It seems like there's nowhere to turn
I drown on the streets and I'll never learn
I'm counting the days while I'm saying
No matter where you shoot me down
No matter where if you do it now
Look in my eyes I stay strong
Lost all my fear so I hold on
There is no place to call home
Roaming the street with a bag of stones
Awaiting your call but I hear nothing at all
It feels like a broken bird
Got locked in this cage of a cold cold world
I'm trying to speak without saying
No matter where you shoot me down
Don't matter where If you do it now
Look in my eyes I stay strong
Lost all my fear so I hold on
Should I bleed myself while you're smiling?
Why should I lose myself in this fighting?
Would you now hurt yourself 'cause of my lying?
So come let's drown ourself and end this nightmare
Obscured by the sun
Apocalyptic clash
Cities fall in ruin
Why must we die?
Obliteration of mankind
Under a pale grey sky
We shall arise...
I did nothing, saw nothing
Terrorist confrontation
Waiting for the end
Wartime conspiracy
I see the world - old
I see the world - dead
Victims of war, seeking some salvation
Last wish, fatality
I've no land, I'm from nowhere
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Face the enemy
Manic thoughts
Religious intervention
Problems remain
When a life breaks it is silent
It just withers like a leaf in the fall
When a faith is sealed without you
What remains is hope that has gone
You have to leave me alone
It doesn't matter what you might do
'Cause if you scream, I don't have to listen
I'll put it in black and white
What you do won't scar me no more
I just need to, get on with my life
Now when colors turns to grey
And the shadows brings the sweetest company
And indifferance turns to solace
A pretend life in a make believe world
You have to leave me alone
It doesn't matter what you might do
'Cause if you scream, I don't have to listen
I'll put it in black and white
What you do won't scar me no more
I just need to, get on with my life
The truth will hurt more than lies
I'm pinned down but I need to move
The truth will hurt more than lies
And this is just getting us down, down, down
You have to leave me alone
It doesn't matter what you might do
'Cause if you scream, I don't have to listen
I'll put it in black and white
What you do won't scar me no more
I just need to, get on with my life
The truth will hurt more than lies
I'm pinned down but I need to move
The truth will hurt more than lies
And this is just getting us down, down, down
You've been led on
Yes, you were wrong
The whole time
You've been led on
Completely wrong
The whole time
They pave the way for every second of the day
It is no myth; no it's the Bible of the God
That they erected on the ashes of your neighborhood
He's looming like, like the god of blunder
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
You sing to sing his praise because you're lazy
And you've been taught too much to learn.
Another pawn, a pink flamingo on the lawn
On the capitol of shame
With you buried head and only you to blame
The rodeo begins. They take us for a ride, and we are flailing
But as hard as we may buck, the king of fools is still in place and fit to rule.
You fucking praise him. Yes, you fellate him with your trust
Your parents' parents made this happen, yeah eat your words and fold your napkins
Another pawn, a pink flamingo on the lawn, and that's all you'll ever be.
And if you thought that you were free, well...
Been in love 10,000 times
And I've been hurt 10,000 times
Yet and still you want a try
What would you do if I gave my love to you?
Would you hurt me too?
Been a long time since I been serious
Now you're curious
Well, I can't stand to feel your touch
I might start to like it a little too much
And it hurts, but I'm pushin' you away
Tthree months from now, you won't stay
Just when lovin' gets good, you'll be gone
And I'll be left with a broken heart to heal all alone
Been in love 10,000 times
And I've been hurt 10,000 times
Yet and still you want a try
What would you do if I gave my love to you?
Would you hurt me too?
Keep telling me it won't be
What I'm used to, you won't hurt me
But that's so hard to believe
'Cause everyone has said the same damn thing to me
And the sad thing is I want you
But my heart keeps telling me, "Don't trust you"
'Cause just when the loving gets good, you'll be gone
And I'll be left with a broken heart to heal all alone
Been in love 10,000 times
And I've been hurt 10,000 times
Yet and still you want a try
What would you do if I gave my love to you?
Would you hurt me too?
Been in love 10,000 times
And I've been hurt 10,000 times
Yet and still you want a try
What would you do if I gave my love to you?
Would you hurt me too?
Maybe love just ain't for me
Why does this keep happening?
Maybe one day, I'll trust you
But for now, here's what I'm gonna say to you
Been in love 10,000 times
And I've been hurt 10,000 times
Yet and still you want a try
What would you do if I gave my love to you?
Would you hurt me too?
Systematic warfare - and an obsessive
Need for perfection - what has been done
Will be forgotten as soon as its done
Desease will be - will be overcome
After everyone out there has long gone deaf
I can still hear the screaming in front of the
Barrels
Don't you drink - the water of the earth
Free is your way - far ahead all your thoughts
You've been given a present
Can't you see it is empty
Only emblished - with a big shiny ribbon
Untie the ribbon and dance - dance with your
Present
Over bodies and cases
After everyone out there has log gone deaf
I can still hear the screaming in front of the
Barrels
Murder on command
Act on command
Then taken your revenge
Breath on command
Sell yourself on command
Don't dare to be hungry
You'll be eaten alive
Don't dare to cause troubles
You'll walk in to a surprise
Systematic warfare - and an obsessive
Need for perfection - what has been done
Ironspy
I didn't hear you coming from behind.
Yes, I'm afraid to turn around,
To watch you point and whisper like a child.
Someone
Stop my hands from shaking
Iron in my spine's conducting lightning
Raging anger,
Yeah, you've never been truly mine,
But if you were, yes, if you were, I wouldn't want you anyway.
Please leave -- stay...
I promise I'll try harder now.
You've made the cut, and stayed to watch it bleed,
Just making sure your secret stays with me...
Someone
Stop my hands from shaking
Iron in my spine's conducting lightning
Raging anger,
Yeah, you've never been truly mine,
But if you were, yes, if you were, I wouldn't want you anyway.
Ironspy
The lines just keep escaping me.
And people on the trains play little games
To keep their guns from firing rage restrained.
Someone
Stop my hands from shaking
Iron in my spine's conducting lightning
Raging anger,
Yeah, you've never been truly mine,
But if you were, yes, if you were, I wouldn't want you anyway.
The roof the roof the roof is on fire 
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn 
Burn motherfucker, burn! x4
Burn! burn! burn! burn!
Just a little and nothing now it's over 
Just a little and nothing now it's done 
What you said, no, you're never gonna say again 
In your own special way you tear me down!
Sway - so hypnotic x8
Neither up nor down, just been turned and turned 
It just sits inside so it burns and burns 
If I can't decide what makes you hurt 
In your own special way you tear me down!
Sway - so hypnotic x8
So ask me please x4 
Give me something good, now 
Something 
Give me something good, now 
Give me 
Fire!
Sway - so hypnotic x8
Come sway this way
Floating up
I'm floating high up
Far into the stars, below
I feel it beneath me, giving way
Earth below
I feel around me
Echoes of the world, dissolved
This feels like a dream now, then it comes
And it feels so real
And then life fades away
Darkness pulls me away
I'm falling into nowhere
I can't see anything
I want it, I want it over now
Death comes knocking again
I'm falling into darkness
I can't feel anything
I guess it, I guess it's over now
Higher now
I'm high above the
Stars light years away, alone
This must be a dream now, till I feel
Terrified
I'm falling fast down
Into the abyss, the void
Is calling me into, somewhere else
And it knows my name
Then my soul slips away
Darkness pulls me away
I'm falling into nowhere
I can't see anything
I want it, I want it over now
Death comes knocking again
I'm falling into darkness
I can't feel anything
I guess it, I guess it's over now (now)
Falling into nothing
Feel my soul is slipping... away
Darkness pulls me away
I'm falling into nowhere
I can't see anything
I want it, I want it over now
Death comes knocking again
I'm falling into darkness
I can't feel anything
I guess it, I guess it's over now
I guess it's over now
I guess it's over now
I guess it's over now
I guess it's over now
Tender moments with a burnt-out cigarette
I'm dying to know what doesn't happen next
Your drunken kisses leave a bitter taste on my lips
It doesn't feel like me anymore,
No lover coming to the door
To rescue me in the middle of the night
And I don't understand
And I don't give a damn 'cause it's making no sense to me
And I'm caught in between your lies
And my dreams and there's no out that I can see
Maybe the sound of your voice or the brake of your car or a little more than everything
'Cause it's driving me crazy and I can't understand
'Cause it's making no sense to me
Life becomes one long infomercial
Selling junk only cowards will buy
I'm sitting here figuring and wondering why
Somehow I've asked all the wrong questions
'Cause you've had none of the answers
That these blinded eyes were looking for in you
And I don't want to be the one you're not thinking of
And I don't want to be anywhere not near you
I'm sorry if I'm a little confused if you're leaving
Did you ever think that was the wrong thing to do?
I'm gonna kick your ass
No time for reason - I'll pass
Talkin' that shit - you're mine
Better watch your back - your spine
Cleanin' your clock
It's time motherfucker for the shit to go down
If you wanna see tomorrow better get out of town
Fuckface - that's where I'm gonna stick it
Swear I'm gonna kick it
Better bring a stretcher when you come down here
I've been up for days and I have no fear
I can take the punishment of you and your friends
Wipin' down my head and do it again
Asshole - the shit is goin' down right now
Put down the kid and run
Daddy's gonna die - wave bye-bye
Dumb cocksucker
It's time motherfucker for the shit to go down
If you wanna see tomorrow better get out of town
Payback - cashin' in your ticket
Swear I'm gonna kick it
I've been pumpin' stomachs since the age of 10
Losin' my shit since I don't know when
I been seein' red and I don't know why
Better start runnin' 'cause you're gonna die
Baby, why you're so sad
What's the thing you're running from
Caught in the red lights
As if money is the cure
Is this your only way to survive
Are you trying to get even with the past
What happened to the dreams you had
I think it's time for you to
Show them you are able
To leave without saying one word
I know it won't be easy, baby
But I will run with you
'Cause every night has a day
Every wish a prayer
Don't lose your faith
And I'll be holding your hand
'Cause it's never too late
There's someone who needs you
So break down that wall, baby
There's a new world out there waiting
Just tear down that wall, girl
Run away and don't look back
Break down that wall
Break down that wall
There's someone who needs you
Lady it's your turn now
Just walk the streets with your head up high
Oh baby doesn't that feel right
So put a big smile on your face
You walk on straight
Yeah tell the motherfuckers they were wrong
Isn't this your sweetest revenge
Feels good, hey I told you so
'Cause every night has a day
Every wish has a prayer
Don't lose your faith
And I'll be holding your hand
'Cause it's never too late
There's someone who needs you
So break down that wall, baby
There's a new world out there waiting
Just tear down that wall, girl
Run away and don't look back
Break down that wall
Break down that wall
So break down that wall, baby
There's a new world out there
Tear down that wall, girl
Run away run away run away
Break down that wall
Break down that wall
'Cause I need you
[Malte:]
Ey, wahrend ich Mic's burn wie beim Grillen Kohlebriketts,
riechen Typen wie du nach su��em Eau de Toilette.
Deine Raps komm' so lastig wie 'ne Heizung mit Nachtspeicher.
Ihr zwei klingt am Mic wie keifende Klatschweiber.
[Philipp:]
Meine Raps sind so hei�� wie in der Sauna 'n Daunenschlafsack
und deine kalter als Emanzen auf 'm Frauenparkplatz.
Wahrend ich mein Reim wie 'n Keim frisch in die Erde pflanz',
komm' deine Raps peinlich wie 'n Typ mit Pferdeschwanz.
[Buddy:]
Junge, lungerst du noch an deiner Blubber bin ich schon langst startklar,
unfassbar, ihr seid lastig wie Krumel im Barthaar.
Ich diss euch hemmungslos wahrend ihr mit Nutella-Toast im Keller posed.
Auf meinem Redefluss sitzt ihr im Rettungsboot.
[Malte:]
Du wirst dein ganzes Leben lang nie in Applaus baden,
es sei denn dein Vater sieht dich im Garten Laub harken.
Du siehst Rauchschwaden, ich hinterlass 'n Flammenmeer
und dein Rap reicht nicht mal zum Schmelzen von Camembert.
Break:
[Malte:] Tut mir leid Leute ich muss jetzt alle Drecksgoren,
die mich auf diesem Track storen, wegburnen.
[Buddy:] Ach, hor doch auf mit dem Schei��, wir vertragen uns.
[Philipp:] Dann war' der Track doch zuende, war' doch schade drum.
[Philipp:]
Cruise ich auf der Autobahn nimmst du den Trampelpfad,
bin ich 'n Sechs-Gange-Menu bist du nur Tankenfra��. Danke, das war's.
Auf dein Style kam's dir nie drauf an.
Du bist jetzt 'n MC und endest doch als Industriekaufmann.
[Buddy:]
Was? Zuerst hie�� es, dass du cool warst, doch du nervst.
Auf meiner Reise endest du hochstens als gro��er Tourscherz.
Ich flie��e wie ein Wasserfall, da hilft kein Rettungsring.
Bei deinen Raps wird mir schlecht, da du aus dem Mund nach Mettwurst stinkst.
[Malte:]
Mit deinem Mundgeruch kannst du am Bahnhof sogar die Penner schocken.
Deine Raps sind stillos wie Sandalen mit wei��en Tennissocken.
Hast du's kapiert, dass du das Battle verlierst.
Mann, dein Reimbuch ist fur mich nichts als Toilettenpapier.
[Philipp:]
Was geht denn mit dir ab? Ich bin 'n MC, der sogar Promis flasht.
Sitzt du auf 'm Schaukelpferd, dann reit ich so wie Jonny Cash.
Du rapst seit '92 und ich seit '96
und trotzdem fress ich wack MC's wie dich, wie Smacks mit Vollmilch.
Break:
[Philipp:] Tut mir leid, Kollegen ich muss jetzt alle Drecksgoren,
die mich auf diesem Track storen, wegburnen.
[Malte:] Lass uns lieber einen saufen und wir vertragen uns.
[Buddy:] Dann war' der Track doch zuende, war' doch schade drum.
[Buddy:]
Also, entschuldige bitte, das was du hier ablieferst, das soll tanzbar sein?
Ich fuhl' mich belastigt wie beim schlechtesten Gesangsverein.
Im allgemeinen hast du die Stimmbander eines Eunuchen
denn dein Schei��gefasel klingt in meinen Ohren wie Keuchhusten.
[Malte:]
Meine Methoden kommen krasser als Chirurgen mit Kaffeetatter.
Von deinem Sabbelwasser kommen hochstens Flecken auf 's Plattencover.
Was battle ich denn hier mit wack rappenden Edelassis?
Ihr wirkt auf mich wie Witzfiguren oder die Teletubbies.
[Philipp:]
Warum musst du standig uber Leute wie Puff Daddy lastern,
wenn deine Metaphern trivial sind wie Spaghettiwestern.
Ich trag' so dick auf wie Kleister auf 'm Tapeziertisch.
Du kapierst nicht. Mein Shit ist hei��er als dein letzter Bierschiss.
[Buddy:]
Ach red' nicht, wenn ich mal gnadig bin, kriegst du mein Taschengeld,
weil ich mitleidig zuseh' wie dein Style in Schutt und Asche fallt.
Du denkst, du bist der krasse Held, wenn dann nur bei der Mullabfuhr,
ich sanier' deine Fassade mit 'nem Blatt Papier und meiner Fullerspur.
So ihr Assis, ich werd' jetzt alle Drecksgoren,
die mich auf diesem Track storen, wegburnen.
Outro:
[Philipp:] Ich hab kein Bock mehr, kommt, wir vertragen uns!
[Malte:] Der Lied ist sowieso zuende.
[Buddy:] Schade drum.
It's not that I hate people
I just feel better when they're not around
It's not that I hate your world
Keep pushing me and I'll stand my ground
It's not that I hate you,
You'd have to kill me to take me down
Push me again
Push me again
Find satisfaction on the island where I live
'Cause zombies only take, they don't have any life to give
It's never been, will never be a picnic
So step right up and pull your fucking reign again
Slackety-slack, lack of inspiration
Be the voice of a new generation
This is me
Past the point of caring
This is me
Push me but I won't go
Down down down down down
I don't need a license
I know the drill
I hope you have a happy
A happy fuckin' day
La-la-la amuse yourself
I wont get in the way
I just can't stand your apathetic motion
As if you care showing your devotion
Kicking and screaming, thinking that I meant it
If I was dead I couldn't be more over it
Over and over and you wouldn't talk about it
Over and over but you try to keep it down
This is me
Past the point of caring
This is me
Push me but I won't go
Down down down down down
I don't need a license 
I know the drill
Question my silence
Outlast it will
Outlast it
Outlast it
Outlast it
Outlast it
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it will
Outlast it
I don't need a license
I know the drill
Question my silence
Outlast it will
I don't need a license
I am the drill
Question my silence
Outlast it will
Outlast it
Outlast it
Outlast it
Well over the sea, and far away,
Our kids die in deserts, they been sent that way,
To guard oil rigs where the head cutters reign,
And blow them away without any refrain
Well why are we here? It's thinning us out,
To see our life's work in your constituents clout,
Is your exclusion of dissidence masking your guilt?
Do you want to be dissident in the world that you've built?
Political scum! Political scum!
You lead the way, you beat the drum
Political scum, Political scum!
Sacrificing your own while their under your thumb
When broke powerless people grab any power they can get
Dominance over women, racism and threats
We'll be losing media jobs and you make us your pet
Reconsidering this weakness and the promise he forgets
Do you really believe in the stories you tell?
How Christ turned his cheek or came down from the hill
Will you profiteer or ransack with the soldiers you kill,
Are you upward bound or will you burn in hell?!
Political scum! Political scum!
You lead the way, you beat the drum
Political scum, Political scum!
Sacrificing your own while their under your thumb
Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don't discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather 'round and haggle
For hard cash, we will lie and deceive
Even our masters don't know the webs we weave
One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ... One world
Invisible transfers, long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can't stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have a dark side, to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast
One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ... One world
(One world)
(One world)
The dogs of war don't negotiate
The dogs of war won't capitulate
They will take and you will give
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go, you know they've been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain
One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ... One world
He joined up to get a job
And show he wasn't scared
Swapped boy scout hat for army cap
Hed finally be prepared
At the age of 17 he was forced to choose
Now at the age of 21 he's in Catch 22
He joined up for just three years
It seemed a small amount
But they didn't tell him
That the first two didn't count
At the age of 17 how was he to know
That at the age of 21 he'd still have one to go?
Tin soldier
He signed away his name
Tin soldier
No chance for cash or fame
Tin soldier
Now he knows the truth
Tin soldier
He signed away his youth
He joined up 'cause Dad knew best
To do right by his son
Now he hates and counts the dates
That mark time on square one
At the age of 17 he did as he was told
Now at the age of 21 tin still won't turn to gold
If at the age of 17 you fall in line too soon
At the age of 21 you'll still march to their tune
Tin soldiers
You sign away your name
No chance for cash or fame
You never see the truth
You sign away your youth
You go and join the queue
Do what they want you to
They take away your name
They treat you all the same
Sign away you life
Black!
 
Pestilent conformity
Holds us back from a greater
Understanding
 
I am the Gat spawn
The abyssal hero
The sacrificial
Lord of the bitch
Hand of Gomorrah
Sodom's prick
Original Gangsta
 
Gather 'round my covenant
And chant with me
 
From the LBC to Helsinki
From the open sky to solidary
From orthodoxy unto anarchy
This is the sound that should not be
Street logic and demonology
Foulest union, most unholy
Will blacken everything, but don't you worry
It's just a little bit of ghetto blasphemy
 
Feeling Old Testament
Breaking forties on the concrete
Mother Mary voodoo dolls
Pissing in
The well of the souls
808 thunder in the heavens
Welcome to
My irreverence
 
Gather 'round my covenant
And chant with me
 
From the LBC to Helsinki
From the open sky to solidary
From orthodoxy unto anarchy
This is the sound that should not be
Street logic and demonology
Foulest union, most unholy
Will blacken everything, but don't you worry
It's just a little bit of ghetto blasphemy

It's coming down all over me can't feel no love tonight
It is so sweet I lose everything I'm lost in my mind
This life is sick I don't know why
I hate myself I want to die
I hate
I hate
I hate
I hate myself
I hate
I hate
I hate

Jesus can you listen to me my jeramaid my ray of light
There is no way of any hope

Oh...
Oh...
Here's a beat, it is a solid beat
And no one's paying attention so I'm free to speak
Something passionate will work real well
But I am bored so bored, yea, it's easy to tell
But I don't mind that it's the same old shit
'Cause innovation's really hard to sell
So come on!
Well, it's the second verse now and I really like how this sounds
It's got all the right elements that I like
It's that four/four on the floor
That keeps me moving all night long
And that chord progression, I've heard it before
It's the same one in every song
But this message really throws me off
I can't sing along to this at all
Get it through
I'll never get through to you
I'm too wide
Get it through
I'll never fit like you do
But you're too blind
So shut up and swallow!
Don't mind me
I'm just another face
Just turn your head and I will be replaced
And don't you worry, I am all alone
But you'll never understand
You'll never understand...
(So just shut the fuck up and swallow)
Because I can tell you
That you're live that in the night
You are the beginning
You are the end
You are the question
You are the answer
You are the good
You are the bad
And I fear that I can't find you
You are my blood
You are my soul
You are the one I've been searching for
You are the pain
You are the pleasure
I don't want you to hate me
Let me feel it
Tear me apart
Let me feel it
Tear me apart
Because I can tell you
That you're live that in the night
You are the trust
You are the doubt
You are the anger
And you are the good will
You are the ice
You are the fire
You are the dream
And you are the awaking
You are the storm
You are the shelter
You are the angel
You are the devil
And you are the storm that's raving me
Let me feel it
Tear me apart
Let me feel it
You need me
I fear
I fear you
I fear myself
Treaties are written on history's pages
But no one wins wars by evacuation
I guess superpowers control for a reason
In the name of your dead drive on
Let no heart be faint, let the battle rage on
Lies, Hate, Greed, feeds the machine
Takes war to make us live free
Give me strength
(This is not an ordinary war) 
Fight for every inch that we adore
This is a sad day (To none is it sadder)
Sadder than to me
Be committed to emancipation
Before the sun sets on the situation
In the name of your dead be strong
So the name of your family tree lives on
Lies, Hate, Greed, feeds the machine
Takes war to let us live free
Give me strength
(This is not an ordinary war) 
Fight for every inch that we adore
This is a sad day (To none is it sadder)
Sadder than to me
You're helpless and hopeless
You want to help out the homeless
But you've got problems
You're selfish and worthless
And you have no fucking purpose
You're a cancer causing, cancer having slob
Whoa, Who-oa, Whoa
There are morals that conflict with orals
That conflict with anals, that believe in angels
Angels are hating on you
Good is the absence of evil
And evil is the absence of good
There is an axis of evil rolling into this neighborhood
With the sound of gun shots
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
It was then that I found I am vampire
I have fangs fucking 15 inches long
And the sanguinary sweetness of stealing someone's blood
Feels so good I am compelled to sing this song
At night when I retire to my coffin, to sleep for a hundred years or more
All you people that I know will have died long ago and your children will have died 10 years before
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
Think I'm joking about your smoking
Think it's fair to steal my air
You you you you you take my breath away
Don't cry freedom 'cause you've stolen mine
Smoke filled rooms make me blind
You you you you you take my breath away.
Leave odor on my clothes
Spread your venom up my nose
You you you you you take my breath away.
Right to smoke in it's place
Far away from anyone's face
You you you you you get it away.
Did you ask if I minded
For my eyes to be blinded
Make my lungs black
From your smoke attack
You're going to burn you'll learn you'll learn
You're going to burn you'll learn you'll learn
You're going to burn you'll learn you'll learn
You're going to burn you'll learn you'll learn
Don't you dare and steal my air
Don't you dare and steal my air
Don't you dare and steal my air
Don't you dare and steal my air
Don't you dare steal my air 'cause I care
Oh get down, getting down, so much money in the ground
For the people who don't deserve it now
It's a circus we're the clowns as the giant ones disown
Every bit of something we call home
Said it's a pity 'bout the middle class Holden mass
We get a bit to play around with doesn't really matter
They kid us with their dole, kid us with the dope
But generally speaking, nobody's got a hope
We're playing the music of the middle-aged queens
Getting fatter and fatter and splitting their jeans
It's all the same, we're out in the cold
The good ones died, the others just got old
Everything's set, everything's fine
You just got to stand in line
Oh everything's set, everything's fine
You just got to stand in line
Getting down, getting down, we have to make it now
Everybody's beaten, everybody's down, oh everybody's down
So goodbye to the creeps who are making it
Goodbye to the let it happen stand
I'm moving out got no doubt they've forgettn twist 'n' shout
They never ever listen to the man
(Moginie/Hirst/Rotsey/Garrett)
Till death do us part.
You're still safe, crossed my hart
She shook here head and gave me a blow for breakfast
Till death do us part
God I know we don't belong here,
Is that a quote that sounds familiar to you these days?
For crying out loud
Stop messing with the people's head
Stop messing
'Cause the joke ain't funny
The joke ain't canny at all x3
Till death do us part
You looked at me, we connected
She took my hand and started running all the way.
Till death kicks in your face
Three boys dead, non that I knew from
It took us down for a few showers in the afternoon.
Me and my girl in a love machine, your Toyota is fantastic
It takes us down away from here, your Toyota is fantastic
I know a house upon a hill; we could stay there if you will
Me and my girl on a trip to heaven, your Toyota is fantastic
Me and my girl on a trip
Me and my girl on a trip to heaven, your Toyota is fantastic.
Child of convention,
Have you been let down?
Been dragging your cross all over this town
Your crucifixion has been so drawn out,
But you accept it by drowning out the doubt
 
They??ll throw you away
They??ll throw you away
Pick the meat from the car wreck,
Leave the dregs to their fate
They??ll throw you away
They??ll throw you away
A dispensable reject,
Kings and queens of F. A.
 
Your young apprentice has worn through your shoes
Don??t shoot the lame horse for bearing bad news
Have you lost patience though you were her muse?
Did you teach her too well how to take the world??s abuse?
 
They??ll throw you away
They??ll throw you away
Pick the meat from the car wreck
Leave the dregs to their fate
They??ll throw you away
They??ll throw you away
A dispensable reject
Kings and queens of F. A.
 
They don??t see the worth in you that I do
 
They??ll throw you away, away
They??ll throw you away, away, away
They??ll throw you away
Throw you away
Throw you away, away, away
Away
I'm sick and tired of the games you played
Every move I make your ass got something to say
Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper
Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way
Everybody is trying to figure me out
What the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my life
I can't go one day without y'all in my face
Y'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I say
Cops chase me when I'm standing still
You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell
You don't like my songs well it pays the bills
And you cut me down 'cause I keep it real
Sometimes I wanna fly far away from here
To another place it ain't worth these tears
Sometimes at night when I close my eyes
I know the haters are busy making up hater lies
Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying
If I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust
See I work so hard just to get ahead
If it wasn't for God I'd probably be dead
Sometimes I think y'all trying to pull me down
But y'all wasting your time I got you haters figured out
If yo had your way it'd be lock and key
Everywhere I go trouble follows me
Where the hell is my father shit it hurts sometimes
There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind
Forgive me father for I have sinned
When was your last confession
His true fears he left without a care
And that was more than I could bare
When you need my help I never tell you no
When I need your love you got somewhere to go
I'm getting sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit
I've come too far gotta keep my pockets thick
I get mad as hell but that's ok
Kick off these shoes 'cause I'm here to stay
I gotta let you know got no time to play
So feel me and all that you hear me say
What I'm building up you can't tear it down
'Cause it's built on solid Rockland ground
We don't die, we multiply, hit after hit, living platinum style
Keep my head up high, looking toward the sky
Nothing inmy view, hey I can fly
Y'all just hate, I can't take no more
And if you feel me raise your hand and show
This is what I feel, ooh, this is what I feel
Feel me, feel me, feel me, hey, hey feel, woo
Westside tell me can you feel me, hey, oh
Eastside tell me can you feel me, whoa, oh south
Southside tell me can you feel me
Feel me, feel me
You said you wanted to be loved
I think you wanted to be saved
Well, tell me, how am I supposed to save a girl like you
When I don't even know how to save myself?
Wish I could just forget
The double lives, the awkwardness
A union scarred by bitterness
A house we built on top of our regrets
There we were in California
Two tarnished golden hearts
Were we ever really together
Or just afraid of being apart?
I wish I could drive all night
Wake up in the harsh day light
In a different town, start a brand new life
And never have to see your face again
I wonder if the spell we're under
Will ever be broken
I wonder if the spell we're under
Is ever, ever going to end
I guess there's never any closure
Since the last look in our eyes
You said you hope that I'm happy now
And we both know, like everything, that's one big fucking lie
Wish I could turn around
Erase our lives, take back those vows
I guess it's not that easy now
I'll tear that fucking chapel to the ground
I wonder if the spell we're under
Will ever be broken
I wonder if the spell we're under
Is ever going to end
Today I woke up and these leaves had all withered
Faded and fell to the ground
Like our tired hearts
I wonder if the spell we're under
Will ever be broken
I wonder if the spell we're under
Will ever...
I wonder if the spell we're under
Will ever be broken
I wonder if the spell we're under
Is ever going to end
I wonder if the spell we're under
Will ever be broken
I wonder if the spell we're under
Is ever, ever going to end...
I whispered in her ear just to glare inside the fences
Her ambrosia could paralyze the senses
A paradigm to hear the acid rain
Of paradise she dreamt with, the tears she can't contain
And one by one, they poured in incrementally
She took my crown of thorns and she wore it as a wedding ring
Said "I do", reciprocated vows
And blew a thousand kisses to the dissipated clouds
I held her claws as we walked between the headstones
Of those who tried connecting all the dots between her freckles
Then she let go; and so did I
As I studied hieroglyphics on her alabaster pigment
All her thoughts would compose a careful symphony
That summoned all my scars and the ghost of serendipity
They sang a hymn though that could cloak the air in mystery
To shatter all my shields, to expose a flair of misery
On a day like this, I'mma break my wrist when I write a little bit about the strangest kiss
That would grace my lips, and the frozen tongue that was soaked in blood but it tasted bliss
I start to choke, break in half 'cause I can hear the battle sounds
Of gods that close their stake in hand to fight vampiric habits now
You think I'm sentimental? I think you're heavy mental
With some innocent intents too intense 'cause you said "be gentle"
And this is more or less a morbid test of sordid stress
A foreign sense of orchid scents before I lay my skull to rest
I sit alone and think of darkness while the sun is raised
You grip that throne to drink from hearts until their blood is drained
But at least you're honest, speaking like you're being modest
'Til you see a carcass at your feet and then you feast upon it
Your eyes resemble Mephistopheles, in fact
I've never seen you smile at all and all your teeth are black
The Diva de los Muertos is just swallowing my skin
When she sneaks in with the scarecrows and it's haunting me again (when she)
Clementine: I'm not gonna tip-toe around your marriage, or whatever it is you've got goin' there. If you wanna be with me, be with me
Joel: Okay
Clementine: Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind; don't assign me yours.
(I always knew you were pretty with all those scratches on your face, look)
And while I'm all apologetic you just conjure monsters headed
To my head, it's probable, the claws are sharpened, sharp and ready
Steady when you're treading, careful not to fall in love
'Cause when I'm finally done you'll know why it's called a crush
All your bones corroded and they hide inside decaying flesh
Still you cut your tongue out 'cause you don't want to taste it yet
So save your breath, you kiss me like a guillotine
Fuck just like a whore and smell like whiskey and some Listerine
Follow me again and sing an hour with the wind
And when I travel to the gallows you just scowl me again
And grin with foul teeth and skin, when you go to bury daisies
Haunted by carriages, Rosemary's Baby
Listen grave-dancer, with disarray pander
Your lips display cancer and kissed my face after
Come and go to summon hope with cryptic, fake glamour
But under oath you cut my throat with sickle blade laughter
And it's hard to keep your sanity when spirits'll consume you
And you're consuming spirits just to peer into the voodoo
Who knew that you could smile when you take a life?
Surviving from the vitamins you're finding when you take a bite
All my questions all are meshes, wallowed sections
Of my chest, the small intestines, large intestines, all a plexus, all digested
Not to mention, you're just following a trend
When the Diva de los Muertos is just haunting me again
I know you're really proud 'cause you think you're well hung
But I think it's time you learn how to use your tongue (yeah)
You say you want things to be even and you want things to be fair
But you're afraid to get your teeth caught in my pubic hair
If you're lying there expecting me to suck your dick
You're gonna have to give me more than just a token lick
Well, you may not like it but you better learn how
'Cause it's your turn now
Now, you suck
Suk it hard
Go down, baby
You suck
Lick it hard
And move your tongue around
If you're worried 'bout babies you can lower your risk
By giving me that special cunnilingus kiss
It's on your face that I'm gonna sit
You can wiggle you can jiggle your tongue on my clit
Don't worry about making me have an orgasm
Just take your time and do it with enthusiasm
I can tell it's making you scared just thinking of it
But you better learn to love it
When you hear 'safe sex' you snicker under your breath
We've gotta take cover we're flirting with death
AIDS is our problem, we've gotta talk
Break out your dental dam and your latex sock
I'm your latex lover wrapped like a gift
Got my microwave plastic wrap heating up my clit, wooh!
Dinner's on, get busy with my booty
Got a couple of flavors, sweet licorice and fruity
I know you said luscious pussy with a cover
I'm aching too, we can't taste each other
There's no slacking off with an unprotected stroke
This ain't no joke
Sisters... Sisters, you've got the power... use it!
Chick: You brought a condom, right?
Dude: Huh?
Chick: I'm unprotected
Dude: Ain't you on the pill?
Chick: Oh, that was great and everything, but you know,
I think it's your turn to go down on me
Dude: Oh, I'm tired, I'm tired.
Chick: What do you mean you're tired?
Dude: C'mon.
Chick: Come on, baby, come on!.
Dude: No, no, that's awful... that tastes terrible!
Chick: You asshole! You shit!
I know you think it's a real drag
To suck my cunt when I'm on the rag
Quit making up stories, ah, give me a break
'Cause I really don't believe that you've got a headache
You tell me it's gross to suck my yeast infection
How do you think I feel when I gag on your erection? ugh!
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Get your face between my thighs
Now, you SUCK!
If your instinct's always right
How about I step aside?
And let you do your thing again
And if there's nothing
That can fool you
How come you're all alone?
Anything can happen now
And when you close your little eyes
They will plunder all your dreams
And take away your teddy bear
I guess you fucked it up
I guess you fucked it up this time
Monkey see and monkey do
Now what a fool are you
To do just what they told you to
And now you know how roles can change
You used to be so out of range
From anything that brought you down
Now every time you go to sleep
You get to feel how this runs so deep
Makes nightmares out of pretty dreams
I guess you fucked it up
I guess you fucked it up this time
I just wish there was something
That you could say That could make
Me care again Something that would
Make me want to get you out of this
But there is really nothing left of
Anything we had So now you're on your own
So now you're all alone
No one to tell you how to think
No one to tell you when to stop
No one to tell you when to think
About the fact that you fucked up
That you fucked up
About the fact that you fucked up
That you fucked up
About the fact that you fucked up
That you fucked up again
They're in control now
And there's nothing you can do
There isn't much to gain
By living all the same way
The years just slip away
But it's too late then to play
If you live from day to day
You can play the game your own way
There's a million things to say
In a million places
For her it stays the same
Though a million towers have tumbled
And you can hear her pain
Voiced in a distant rumble
And when it starts to rain
All your monoliths will crumble
It's always been the same
Don't you feel a little bit humble?
She came up to me, she said:
'Wanna know a mystery?
There's a whole wide world for you to see
You're just a player in the game'
Well I've nothing left to say
Except take the time to ramble
In a million different ways
There's a million paths to travel
And when there's something in the way
Take your time please remember
There's hope yet in the rain
And a voice in distant thunder
Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste
Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic ways
Can't escape this place, I deny your face
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying
Put me in a homemade cellar, put me in a hole for shelter
Someone hear me, please, all I see is hate
I can hardly breathe, and I can hardly take it!
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't-
Lost, ran at my own cost, fearing laughter, scoffed
Learning from the rush, detached from such and such
Bleak, all around me, weak listening, incomplete
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you're dogging
I am in a buried kennel, I have never felt so final
Someone find me, please, losing all reserve
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't-
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something in you I despise
Cut me, show me, until I am willing and able and never any danger to myself
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain, or was my tolerance a phase?
Empathy, out of my way, I can't die
I can't die
I can't die
I can't die
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something in you I despise
Despise, depise
Purity
Purity
Purity

Yo, this song, yo
This song is for all the women out there
That have been lied to by their men
And I know y'all been lied to over and over again
This is for y'all
Yo, maybe you didn't break the way you should have broke, yo
But I break, know what I am saying, this is how it goes y'all, damn
Last year, Valentine's day, you would spoil me, you say
"Babe, I love you, love you babe I swear"
Held you when you were sick even (sucked your dick)
The whole time I think to myself, this isn't fair
What is this I see (No)
You don't come home to me (Oh, no)
When you don't come home to me (Man)
Can't deal, can't bear
You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look, I found her red coat
And your (bitch) caught out there
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ah...
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ah...
I hate you so much right now
So sick of your games, I'll set your truck to flames
And watch it blow up, blow up, tell me (How you gonna see her now)
So far from sincere {I love you}, fabrications in my ear
Drive me so far up the wall, I come slidin' down
What is this I see (I don't believe this)
You don't come home to me
When you don't come home to me
I can't deal, can't bear (I won't)
You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look, I hope you're happy
Since you're caught out there
Yeah, you've been caught
Yo', come on
Come on
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ah...
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ah...
(She's so) raunchy, so vulgar, not me, why the hell her
Look, she dresses (Look at her) a mess, what do you see (I don't know)
It's not all about cash (Hell, no), not how much you flash
How I dress is a reflection of me
What is this I see
You don't come home to me (Uh-uh)
When you don't come home to me
Can't deal, can't bear (Told you I won't)
You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look, I got somethin' for y'all
Since you're caught out there
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ah...
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ah...
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Ah...
I hate you so much right now
Sie ist langst verloren
Sie ist fast schon tot
Sie ist ubergossen mit leicht entflammbaren Mitteln und warten auf den Todessto��
Sie kriegt keine Luft
Sie atmet schwer
Sie hat nur noch wenige Tage und wei�� es genau 
Glaub mir sie kann nicht mehr
Diese Welt war verlogen
Die Welt war nie rein
Sie liegt am Boden um zu sterben und ich lass sie sterben denn
Ich wei�� so soll es sein
Diese Welt war verlogen
Diese Welt war nie rein
Sie liegt am Boden um zu sterben und ich lass sie sterben denn
Ich wei�� so soll es sein
Sie war gegen das Leben
Gegen den Geist
Gegen den Herrn der sie schuf
Den Herrn der sie liebte und der sie nun niederrei��t denn
Es gibt keine Rettung
Sie kann nicht fliehn
Sie muss sich mit ansehn wie die 
Tage des Donners sie nun langsam uberziehn
Diese Welt war verlogen
Diese Welt war nie rein
Sie liegt am Boden um zu sterben und ich lass sie sterben denn
Ich wei�� so soll es sein
Ich wei�� so soll es sein
Sie hasste mich 
Und ich liebte sie nicht
Ich werde singen und tanzen und es mir
Mit ansehn wie sie langsam unter mir zerbricht
Denn es wird alles neu
Alles wird Licht
Alles wird herrlich und prachtig denn der Tag des Herrn wird alles
Halten was er verspricht
Diese Welt war verlogen
Diese Welt war nie rein
Sie liegt am Boden um zu sterben und ich lass sie sterben denn
Ich wei�� so soll es sein
Ich wei�� so soll es sein
Sie ist langst verloren
Sie ist fast schon tot
Sie ist ubergossen mit leicht entflammbaren Mitteln und 
Warten auf den Todessto��
Sie kriegt keine Luft
Sie atmet schwer
Sie hat nur noch wenige Tage und wei�� es genau 
Glaub mir sie kann nicht mehr
Es gibt keine Rettung
Sie kann nicht fliehn
Sie muss sich mit ansehn wie die 
Tage des Donners sie nun langsam uberziehn
Diese Welt war verlogen
Diese Welt war nie rein
Sie liegt am Boden um zu sterben und ich lass sie sterben denn
Ich wei�� so soll es sein
Ich wei�� so soll es sein

Sie ist fast schon tot

Ich wei�� so soll es sein
Ich wei�� so soll es sein
Seems like just yesterday, you were a part of me
I used to stand so tall, I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight, everything it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
No, I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
I told you everything, opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright, for once in my life
Now all that's left of me, is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
Cause I can't breathe, no I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I've cried
Behind these hazel eyes
Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore
Anymore
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Life - They fought and fell and died and never came home
Words - For words they fought and words they fell and words alone
War - I tried to see it your way
Tried to see it your way
But words fail me
Life - Above all else if nothing else
I can't see my way again
I can't see my way again
So here we are
Dawn of a new day
Fuck how it looks
Fuck yesterday
I'm not saying forget
That's not what I'm saying
That's not what I'm saying
You make me feel like I'm nothing
But that's life
Yeah, that's life
50 million
A small price for freedom
My freedom
Fuck freedom if I'm not alive to live it
I'll fight for it
I won't kill or die for it
This is a rich man's world
Let the rich man fry for it
Strange - On no man's land for no man's land
How brave how grand how very dead indeed?
Hope - How many more if any more
How many roads before the hand we hold is free?
War - I've tried to see it your way, tried to see it your way
Reasoned but with reasoning life only echoes mine
Life - Above all else if nothing else
I can't see my way again
I can't see my way again
So here we are
Dawn of a new day
Fuck how it looks
Fuck yesterday
I'm not saying forget
That's not what I'm saying
That's not what I'm saying
You make me feel like I'm nothing
But that's life
Yeah, that's life
50 million
A small price for freedom
My freedom
Fuck freedom if I'm not alive to live it
I'll fight for it
I won't kill or die for it
This is a rich man's world
Let the rich man fry for it
Peace - They fought and fell and died and never came home
Words - For words they fell and words they fought and words alone
I've tried to see it your way I've tried to see it your way
Words fool me
Words fail me
I've got a feeling
I know it all too well
I'm getting even
And I'm going straight to hell
For all the thoughts that I'm thinking
I think I'll stick around
I found a ship to sink
And you're going down, down down
You're going down, down down
I've got a feeling
I think I need your touch-
-Me if you feel it
Oh god it hurts so much
To be the bearer of bad news
We barely left the ground
I know you did what you had to
But you're going down, down, down
You're going down, down down
So lie your way out of this one again
Cry? I think I won't this time.
I'll take you for all that you are.
All that you are
All that you are
A fading sc-ar
Won't leave a mark
I'm off the deep end
Still swimming fast and hard
Against your current
But my current state
Won't get me far
I'll keep you closer now
You bring me down
But I don't care
Don't bother lookin' for me
You won't find me anywhere
You won't find me anywhere
You won't find me anywhere
I've got a feeling
I know it all too well
I'm getting even
And I'm going straight to hell
For all the thoughts that I'm thinking
I think I'll stick around
I found a ship to sink
And you're going down, down down
Fuck me
Push me
Let me know how you feel
Grab me
Lust for me
Let me feel the fire
Burning my skin
Under my skin
Over your skin
Combustion / energy
A black hole chaos theory
Under this burning flag
You and me
Will raise the flame
Kiss me 
Feed me
All that heat that you feel
Love me
Hate me
Give something that is real
Hit me 
Hold to me
Give me the pain that you feel
Grab me
Lust for me
Let me feel the fire
Burning my skin
Shady day, I'm the prey
It's the rage, I know that you are hunting
Everything, inside of me
Enemy, and you are so damn dirty
Shoot the man, I still stand
I don't care, because I'm not afraid
On the run, got a gun
But I can't erase this pain
Shed my skin, time wears thin
In the end, all I want is to survive this
Everyday, energy, seems to stray
Can't stop this pain
Save me, save me, save me
'Cause I'm running from these things on me
It's in my head, it's in my head
And I suffer from this deadly disease
It's aching, it's aching
Inside of me...
Shady day, I'm the prey
It's the rage, I know that you are hunting
Everything, inside of me
Enemy, and you are so damn dirty
Shoot the man, I still stand
I don't care, because I'm not afraid
On the run, got a gun
But I can't erase this pain!
'Cause I'm running from these things on me
It's in my head, it's in my head
And I suffer from this deadly disease
It's aching, it's aching
Inside of me...
Rising above all
'Cause I am killing over
And I know you
Are going on
Yeah!
Don't want to burn up
Don't want to hide
I slip away, genocide
Don't want to burn up
Don't want to hide
I wait, I wait, I wait, I...
It comes down to you and me
You better look me in the eye when you talk that shit about me
This time is different
This time you will see
This time I refuse to die
And I will hunt you
And I can feel you under my skin
And I can smell you putrefied
And will taste you
Do what you want and you're never gonna kick me round
Do what you want and you're never gonna keep me down
Do what you want and you're never gonna take me down
Do what you want and you're never gonna keep me down
This time you die
I refuse to die
Better hold your fire till you see the whites of my eyes
The time is now, the time of do or die
I can't get you from under my skin
Do what you want and you're never gonna kick me round
Do what you want and you're never gonna keep me down
Do what you want and you're never gonna take me down
This time you die
And I will hunt you
And I can feel you under my skin
And I can smell you putrefied
And will taste you
Do what you want and you're never gonna kick me round
Do what you want and you're never gonna keep me down
Do what you want and you're never gonna take me down
Do what you want and you're never gonna keep me down
This time you die
I can't get you from under my skin
Better hold your fire till you see the whites of my eyes
The time is now, the time of do or die
You got a pair of balls... Well, it's time to put 'em on.
Run.
And I will hunt you
And I can feel you under my skin
And I can smell you putrefied
And I will taste you
I can't get you from under my skin
I can't get you from under my skin
I can't get you from under my skin
Do what you want and you're never gonna kick me round
Do what you want and you're never gonna keep me down
Do what you want and you're never gonna bring me down
This time you die
This time you die
It never makes no sense
It never makes no sense
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter, fire, fire, fire
Armageddon is a deadly day
Armageddon is a deadly way
They comin' for you everyday
While senators on holiday
The army recruiters in the parking lot
Hustling kids there jugglin pot
Listen, young man, listen to my plan
Gonna make you money, gonna make you a man
Bom bom here's what you get: an M-16 and a kevlar vest
You might come home with one less leg but this thing will surely keep a bullet out your chest
So, come on, come on, sign up, come on
This one's nothing like Vietnam
Except for the bullets, except for the bombs, except for the youth that's gone
So we keep it on till ya comin' home
Higher and higher
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter, fire, fire, fire
So we keep it on till ya comin' home
Higher and higher
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter, fire, fire, fire
Tell me, President, tell me if you will
How many people does a smart bomb kill?
How many of 'em do you think we got?
The general says we never miss a shot
And we never ever ever keep a body count
We killin' so efficiently, we can't keep count
In the Afghan hills, the rebels still fightin
Opium fields keep providin
The best heroin that money can buy and
Nobody knows where Osama been hidin
The press confrences keep on lyin'
Like we don't know
So we keep it on till ya comin' home
Higher and higher
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter, fire, fire, fire
So we keep it on till ya comin' home
Higher and higher
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter, fire, fire, fire
Some say engine, engine number nine
Machine guns on a New York transit line
The war for oil is a war for the beast
The war on terror is a war on peace
Tellin' you they're gonna protect you and
Tellin' you that they support the troops
And don't let them fool you with their milk and honey
No, they only want your money
One step forward and two steps back
One step forward and two steps back
Why do veterans get no respect
PTSD and a broken back
Take a look at where your money's gone seen
Take a look at what they spend it on
No excuses, no illusions
Light up ya lighter, bring it home
So we keep it on till ya comin' home
Higher and higher
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter, fire, fire, fire
So we keep it on till ya comin' home
Higher and higher
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter, fire, fire, fire
So we keep it on till ya comin' home
Higher and higher
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter, fire, fire, fire
So we keep it on till ya comin' home
Higher and higher
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire, yeah, you know, so light up ya lighter
Fire, fire, fire, fire, no, light up ya lighter

Tulvasaarekkeen keskipisteessa,
ma istun kupla volsussa paniikin partaalla
Miltein hermojeni hallinan ma menetin,
kun stereot oikosulkuun simahti
Taalla siis istun jo toista paivaa ja vetista tulevaisuuden kuvaa hahmotan
Kuplassa istuen, latomerta tuijotan
Kuplassa istuen, latomerta tuijotan
Kuplassa istuen, latomerta tuijotan
Kuplassa istuen, latomerta tuijotan
Onneksi joka MacGyverin seurasin, nainollen kinkkisen tilanteen selvitin
Idolini tavoille uskollisena,
loihdin hatakeinon hammastyttavan
Vararenkaan kaulaani pujotin,
kohti vapautta ma pian matkaisin
Tulvassa kelluen, latomerta tuijotan
Tulvassa kelluen, latomerta tuijotan
Tulvassa kelluen, latomerta tuijotan
Tulvassa kelluen, latomerta tuijotan x2

Hey you!
Don't you run
I know you
And the things you've done
Careful what your lips imply
Your eyes will not tell a lie
Listen, don't try to explain
There is no resolution at the end of the day
I know you were not lonely
I know you weren't afraid
The only thing you've proven
Is your lack of self-restraint
Take it away now
With a smile
With the twinkle of an eye
She will fight it when you steal her love for your lust
Take it away
She will hold on, hold on
Hey you!
Don't you hide
'Cause I see you
I see the one that you made cry
Careful, choosing what to say
Cause your eyes will betray
You say it was your father
And his violent hand
Or was it your mother
And how she never taught you to be a man?
But if you blame somebody
Then it might as well be me
Cause its only your own choices
That define who you'll be
Take it away now
With a smile
With the twinkle of an eye
She will fight it when you steal her love for your lust
Take it away
You told her she was special
And nothing could tear you apart
But when you finally wake up
She will be gone
Take it away now
With a smile
With the twinkle of an eye
She will fight it when you steal her love for your lust
Take it away
She will hold on, then she will let go
This soil is dripping with the blood of angels
I can almost touch their hands through the ground
My eyes are filled with pride
For this land of the dead
Is the precious gift of my father
No mortal value can buy such a treasure
Which I cherish in my heart of hearts
Father - Satan with fangs stained in blood
Smile to my naive dreams
This unhallowed ground
Secret sanctuary of my thoughts
Where I walk hand in hand with death
Upon blood and soil
Oh, don't mind any pain - it gives me wisdom
My rage is my strength - it gives me might
But something inside me seems to be lost
Is there hope for the blood of live
Or will I always fly alone
Those who are in hell hallowed be thy name
This is for you who made me what I am
For the storm that tries to shake my roots
Is just the breath of the dying god who once ruled heaven
But he won't succed as long as I stand true to my ways
And even I am alone
I can't remember what I'm missing
1982 1982
There's nothing here for me and you
19,1982
You won't get a job anywhere
Not when you've got short hair
There's nothing here for me and you
19,1982
There's nothing here for me and you
19,1982
You let jobs go into the distance
Your on the dole for your existence
More Fleeced attention
More forced intentions
There's nothing here for me and you
19,1982

Silence, silence all sides
Raw with indecision
Without the mind to congregate
In fault the line extends
To further burden divided friends
Silence all sides
Why bother to defy when we still can't unite
So put your fist down until sanity can be contained
We burn out before we fade away
Losing time and not changing anything
Burn out we isolate,
Rather stand alone than divided
Stuck on lines deplete
Chant slogans timed one step off beat
Full loss of common sense
When passion becomes status end
Silence, silence all sides
Why bother to defy when we still can't unite
So put your fist down until sanity can be contained
What's been said has spread like fire to all
It takes no strength to pass blame
We burn out before we fade away
Losing time and not changing anything
Burn out we isolate,
Rather stand alone than divided
Con questa pioggia nei capelli perche lo fai
con questi occhi un po' fanciulli e un po' marinai
per una dose di veleno che poi
dentro di te non basta mai.
Con le tue mani da violino, perche lo fai
tu che sei rosa di giardino dentro di me
come un gattino sopra un tetto di guai
dimmi perche, perche lo fai.
Perche lo fai non rispondermi se non vuoi
pero lo sai che io vedo con gli occhi tuoi
e tu se vuoi puoi nasconderti dentro di me
finche non capirai.
Perche lo fai disperata ragazza mia
perche ti dai come un angelo in agonia
perche ti fai
perche ti fai del male, perche ce l'hai con te
perche lo fai e il domani diventa mai
per te, per me, per noi.
Perche, perche lo fai
fra questi angeli nel fango di questa via
dove non entra piu neanche la polizia
io non ti lascio in questo nostro Vietnam,
anima mia,
come la gente che lascia che sia.
Disperata ragazza mia
perche non vuoi che il mio amore ti porti via
perche lo fai e il domani diventa mai
per te, per me, per noi.
Perche lo fai, puoi rinascere quando vuoi
perche lo sai che io vedo con gli occhi tuoi
se tu volessi vivere io non ti lascerei
se ritornassi libera, se ritornassi mia
invece sei una macchina che va via.
It's the bird, it must have been the bird, disgusting critter, it must
We should have known better than to trust
This disease infested ball of lust and carnage
Piece of garbage with wings and she has the guts to sing
Get the bird, catch her, shoot her, I don't care
Get the bird, bring her down to the ground from out the air
Gotta tear her apart, let me at her first
Sink her to the level of the rest of us that inhabit the earth
What's she thinking? Does she really believe
That she's above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets
See her up in the tree, looking down at you and me
Like she's chosen over those who walk around on two feet
The bird, the melodies she play
The music she make, rubbing our faces in the feces of the daybreak
Trying to remind us it's time to awake
Antagonizing and instigating my hate
The chirps, I turn them into screams
My feathered friends' end will justify the means
Disturbed, I'll grab her by her beak
And swing her in circles until she's too dizzy to speak
Well I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(She's a snake that can fly) she's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better then me just because she's free?
I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(She's a snake that can fly) she's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better then me just because she's free?
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
There's not a lot of difference between a foxhole and a grave
And knowing that you dug your ditch and climbed in anyway
Touch gloves take your corners and come out fighting when the bell rings
You don't get more points for all your suffering.
So you closed your eyes, and dreamed your heart to a safer place
And smiled for awhile with a brand new style and a change of pace
What a beautiful cover, a talk show makeover, and you'll lose some weight
But if you wanna get well then why the hell do you hesitate?
Listen to yourself The king of hypocrites
Who do you think you are you ain't foolin' shit
But if you keep preaching then you just might believe it
You're always sayin' that it's all going better
Well I've seen you, and needs to
God I hope it's all going better for you
And you're saying that it tastes so much sweeter
Well I've been there, and it's bitter
God I wish that I could feel sorry for you
A few bridges were burned while your backs been turned
But hey that's life
You're getting used to the sickly, thick fog of indifference and you think that's all right
You don't need nobody to hold your hand
You don't need nobody you're the littlest man
'Cause you don't trust anybody
There's still a withered soul that now filled to the brim
With speeches you repeat that mean a lot to you
But not enough for you to get off your ass off the floor and do it
You're always sayin' that it's all going better
Well I've seen you, and needs to
God I hope it's all going better for you
And you're saying that it tastes so much sweeter
Well I've been there, and it's bitter
God I wish that I could feel sorry for you
You're always sayin' that it's all going better
Well I've seen you, and needs to
God I hope it's all going better for you
And you're saying that it tastes so much sweeter
Well I've been there, and it's bitter
God I wish that I could feel sorry for you
OH
God I wish that I could feel sorry for you
OH
Another grand surprise
Your rapier wit cut me down to size
You love to pass your time
Looking for ways to play the thorn in my side
It's deja vu one more time
Whoever said to take it on the chin
Whoever said that good guys always win
Has never seen the sorry state I'm in
A victim of romanticide again
My little atom bomb
This is the last time you'll do me wrong
So listen when I speak
I can't go on forever turning my cheek
Your whipping boy's about to speak
Whoever said to take it on the chin
Whoever said that good guys always win
Has never seen the sorry state I'm in
A victim of romanticide again
I've paid my bills and cleaned out my closet
Slammed the front door tight
I can't believe that I ever thought
This all would work out right
Whoever said to take it on the chin
Whoever said that good guys always win
Has never seen the sorry state I'm in
A victim of romanticide again
Whoever said to get down on your knees
Give your ground, or try your best to please
Has never seen my lonely misery
A victim of romanticide, that's me
If I could smell your words
I'd reek of hate disturbed
Consumed by your own phrase of
"Go to hell," you said
The more you're in my life
I think Hell might be nice
'Cause it sure as hell does
Feel like Hell to me... with you
Say what you want to say
How you feel, what you think of me
So you say I'm not real
Mistaken me for someone who cares
You dizzy bitch, swallow this
The thought of you makes me sick
You're just a thorn in my spine
Your shattered world is your piece of mind
They label us as the love hate kind
You need not say a word
You tripped on my last nerve
As you fell on your face I had to laugh... at you
Say what you want to say
How you feel, what you think of me
So you say I'm not real
Mistaken me for someone who cares
You dizzy bitch, swallow this
The thought of you makes me sick
You're just a thorn in my spine
Your shattered world is your piece of mind
They label us as the love hate kind
What do you expect I'm doing up here
What's with you what's the problem
You will always treat me obscene
Who cares if they make sense
You went and sat there and broke their bottles
You rip the seam off the bottom of their jackets
But you won't even know what are there
You're shit
Verbal abuse I get into trouble
Verbal abuse Burn me, I'll do it again
Verbal abuse It's totally your fault
Verbal abuse I guess you want some more
Leeches
Listen to her try to suck me dry
Problem with you you're afraid to die
They'll come around again and again
But in the end I know I'll win
There's no preference
Fuck this lets just kill them dead
Fuck with this discussion
Fuck this lets just kill them
Well well what the fuck
The worst thing has been done to you
That dumb ass will blow you away
No one now is getting dead
You won't feel a thing
Or your body's life you were fighting for
Got one now is dead
Got another that makes two 
Got one more that is three
Don't cross me no more or you're dead
Problem with you you're afraid to die
They'll come around again and again
But in the end I know I'll win
Fuck this let's just kill them dead
Smash their head
Kill them all
Oh well, Oh what, Oh once and for all
Nobody's gonna stand in our way
Nobody's gonna hurt us again
Some say, they wanna shoot the game
But use your brains, we know who's to blame
Nobody's gonna stand in our way
Nobody's gonna hurt us again
Some say, they wanna shoot the game
But use your brains, we know who's to blame
Wir haben lang genug geschwiegen
Jetzt sind wir wirklich wild vor Wut
Wir werden euch besiegen
Weil es viel mehr von uns gibt
We could have shared and would have lived
Forever and a day
Going there and doing this
Like when children play
But we can't let you get away
With murder, first degree
This is the planet of the apes
And man, you will see
Wir haben lang genug geschwiegen
Jetzt sind wir wirklich wild vor Wut
Wir werden euch besiegen
Weil es viel mehr von uns gibt
Von den kleinen Plagegeistern
Bis zum riesen Trampeltier
Plus die Konige der Meere
Ja, wir hauen euch weg von hier
This is dawning of the age of the animals
The new leader of the world will be one of us
You had your chance, but you built bombs to bring hell on us
You hung a bell on us
We won't take prisoners
Wir werden euch besiegen
Weil es viel mehr von uns gibt
Von den kleinen Plagegeistern
Bis zum riesen Trampeltier
Plus die Konige der Meere
Ja, wir hauen euch weg von hier
Wir haben lang genug geschwiegen
Jetzt sind wir wirklich wild vor Wut
Wir werden euch besiegen
Weil es viel mehr von uns gibt
Von den kleinen Plagegeistern
Bis zum riesen Trampeltier
Plus die Konige der Meere
Ja, wir hauen euch weg von hier

Give me a reason to fight
When there's nowhere to run to
Go home

Hide myself inside a' my clothes
Hide myself inside my mind

Communicating through the genelect
High tech

I've got untapped material

Give me the real shit
X finish him off quick
Making your jaw split
When I'm touching the mosh pit
Constant conflict
Knock you faggots unconscience
Nauseous, raising the stakes
Increasing the weight
Got homies I can lay down
And lift their plate
So quit trying to invade my space
Before I call for a face to face
And gotta rest my case
This is how we do it
Just recognise
We can get you right to it
Look into these eyes
Look into these eyes
And you'll see the size of the fame
Then you might despise
The size of my game
Step the fuck back
Xzibit's on the track
You shoulda buckled up
Before your head hit the dash
You gotta hate that
A demo from an eight track
Brought me to a place
Where platinum comes in eight stack, bitch

Cause a little somethin' somethin'
Didn't go your way

We're only giving a fuck
If you're invading this space
Gotta getcha groove on (Gotta getcha groove on)
Don't keep us waiting too long
(Don't keep us waiting too long)
If you could see
Into the future
How dark it could be
I would sure consider you supreme to me
Questions regarding
What we can create
Is still to be humane
So far
Answers are what
We start to simulate
The creation of world war
You don't learn to live
Life to the extreme
Until you stand before death so now you can create
Your own scene
Simulating your last breath
Raise the flag for me
Raise it real high
Supreme beast
Raise the flag for me
Raise it high in real
Supremacy...
Supremacy
Then burn the flag down
In 1998 we can simulate
What we can not create
Hide behind the mask
With 3 dimensions
To choose your fate
I cannot believe this
This interactive lifeform
You forgot to see it
Because you had your mask on
So we have to find a new way
Random access memory
Cyberhead punch in your code then you can go
High-tech access denied
The code was broke
An old man once told us
That technology and reality would collide
Supremacy
You are supreme to me...
So scream you, out from behind the bitter ache
You're hanging on the memory, you need most
You still want love, love's ugly, smooth and delicate
But not without affection, no not alone
And instead of wishing that it would get better
Man you're seeing that you just get angrier
And it's good that I'm not angry
Well I need to get over
Well I, I'm not angry, anymore
Cry when you cry, run when you run
Love when you love
Well now, represent the ashes
That you leave behind
And instead of wishing that the road had shoulder
Man you're seeing that you're sinking over time and you're blind
And it's good that I'm not angry
Well I need to get over
Well I, I'm not angry
Oh well, it's dragging me under
Well I, I'm not angry, angry yeah
I'm not angry and it's never been enough
It gets inside and it tears you up
I'm not angry and I've never been above it
You see through me don't you
Well it's good that I'm not angry
Well I need to get over
And I, I'm not angry
Ah well, it's dragging me under
Well I, I'm not angry
Well it's good that I'm not angry, oh anymore
I won't fight for a cause that's been lost
When we gave up our nature -- denial
