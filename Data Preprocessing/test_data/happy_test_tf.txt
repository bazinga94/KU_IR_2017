The power
'Cause the sun is shining
Why did I bother
Now means a lot
And made it light
She rocks my world
I had been broke down from my enemies
That's all lies
So what do you do with all your precious time
And even at my door, with a poor poor four
Sleeping with a bookblanket out at sea
Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
Down came the good fairy and the good fairy said,
And none of us stay, ah
And their shiny toy guns
Long after I'm gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause I lived with many ghosts when I was younger
Not talking about holiday
Playin' around
They were the roadtrips that we launched
But you brighten up for me all of my days
I'm not aware
Something real something real
When I don't wanna dream
Who they gonna take to the Sadie Hawkins
Oh, how I love things as they used to be
And she takes your hand when the world stays outside
Always try and keep
Yeah every time you look like that, oh oh
In the back seats of rented wrecks
If she lived in space, man
Is what we'll get
Go on, get going
While soothing words hover like hummingbirds
You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
And if home is really where the heart is
There's a blue sky
Then you said Stop it Ca suffit 
Everytime you look like that
On the little back porch it's about to fall apart so I think I might repair it
Bedu, bedu, bedu, bedu
It's nothing to do with acceptance
That I can feel I can feel
She said, "You're right, it's a living, but you're wrong for the life
This world ain't got too much time
Scream my name scream my name
Don't matter what you find
A semblance of their old ways, what has happened to our handmade days
But the heart of creation it's the only
Honey pie, you know I'll love you forever
So, wrap me up, return to sender
If you're still up when the ships
With a john deere logo and a stain on the back
Ask someone who knew me
At midnight
Don't blame it on the sunshine
And I might never be the same again, but have you seen my friends, they're just the same
But once again something's happened
And more importantly, who did you smoke it with
Who has done to the sailor
I go it alone
You always said the world would never last
Can we rise Can we get along alright
In an effort to uncover what has happened to their salad days 
No argument can amend
Upwards to the vanguard where the pressure is too high
Caught me listening to water dripping
Hey little rich girl
They're just paper cuts
So sing with your hips my baby
And screaming car alarms
Tart with a heart
Because Mother
Baby look over your shoulder
Changed the color of you hair, are you busy
So I step back to reflect in this town I hate
Leads away decay
I was walking along in the sun
So wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel
It feels like I'm constantly playing
Hey, hey, what's that you said
It's just you and me and oh dear, our life has just begun 
And we won't stop
You wore it to the disco
Ah, one I haven't cashed yet, uhhuh
Say goodbye
Life is upon us and the time for love is here and now
I write my blue songs
'Cause I'm drowning When I close my eyes
The good ones are gone or not able
But when I look behind, I'm so glad that you were mine
Keep the windows down
These pills are fine to pass the time
Out in the streets, I hear the crack of thunder 
If I had a song that I could sing for you
That her mind's completely wrecked
Rivers that still bring us life
If you don't wake up and the truth never comes up 
I'm calling it love soon
Divide everything, just put it all flat
Don't show me no more, please
I didn't have a penny
And your friends were pretty cool
Music tastes change like the wind
Now I'm right here, you got me where you want me
Or maybe let you watch too much TV
They hoped and prayed
Clowne towne no shelter
Are the friend that act's friend in a Lex or a Benz
When no one's home and the weather's fine
Up to the stars and counting all the suns and all the moons
But she was with another guy
I need to feel the strength to get by
Always on your side
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend
And when we were finished making out we noticed that your skinhead friend was gone Long gone
It feels so hard to win, so hard to lose
Starts at  and plays through to sunrise the next day
Everyone lies, everyone lies
Comment ca va  Je ne sais pas 
Someday I will tell him maybe, It's been like this since I don't know when, but it's great
We look to Los Angeles
I said, Thank you for seeing me again
Song after song after song after song amounting into mountains
My boyfriend's back he's gonna save my reputation
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs,
Shadows over my shoulder that as ghosts owned
There's usually one or two there's usually one or two
Let's hope these wheels got what it takes to carry us home
Even if it hurts you inside
Let me talk about this feeling
There's not enough hours in the day
And they've got something
Got no resolutions, no clever anecdotes to say
But they told us they had tried,
Do you want to dance under the moonlight
D, world destruction
And I know I said I needed some time alone
Everybody
I'll get myself a new one when I get you on the piss
Whether wholly heartened life fades away
I got a full drawer of letters
They left me with these blisters on my skin
Straight down the line
And I hear you say
And when I can't take the fall I really wanna make that call
I never count the gloomy hours, I let them slip away
And all of the things that you did to me
Well, the little things you say and do
With an M you'll feel the surge of your American past
You dream, you make movies, you dance
Don't try to stop the tail that wags the hound
At times I wonder if we really took the steps to break right through it
I want you now, I don't care how
On an island with red kites and verdant seas
And they say,
All those things that go to make heaven and this
For the wings of a dove
Something you may not believe, yeah
Is what you're feelin'
And failed out of the priviledged life of his dream
Did I look stupid
She told me that you got yourself somebody new
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
In the perfect fashion; just watch my heart's reaction
Now that they've shown you what to get
That's right That's right
Just can't wait to get on the road again
It involves pain to look inside
So I walk through the streets I love
And I will ride you home drunken in the rain
I thought that she would never let me get it
And I lay in your bed again
Baby now that you're gone
It's up to me if I decide to be what I think is right
"Little bunny foo foo I don't wanna see you scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head"
You wake me up and you wait for it
Well, if I had to choose a number
And we tend the garden all day long
So come on back now comeback comeback
This is the reason we should all be tied up
I never had a girlfriend
Well if my feet don't touch the ground
If we never get another sound
And I'm afraid I need my baby, I'm afraid he doesn't know it yet
I don't wanna become someone
Not the way that you look
Inside my head, your voice
And my poor dog needs feeding
You shouldn't wake me awhile 
I just can't control my feet
Hey that's alright
Love is the truth I realize
Deep in a sleeping bag in your backyard
Be with my baby, then
"You and me are the world", she said
My whole heart will be yours forever
And people lost their lives
Rejoice despite the fact this world will hurt you
Having an argument with myself down Queensbury Street
You've got a busy day today
Do you still pick up the seashells on that pebble beach
Do Mase got the ladies
Because I'm free of you now
You will end up like always back where you were before
And I found that 'round here
I always forget to tell you I love you
But the new kids have got one above
Yeah, you're the shit but you won't be here for long
Meanwhile in Tahoe outside Casa Tony
Back to where I said
'Cause it's a beautiful thing
Mr Jones and me look into the future
That wouldn't have me in a million years 
You used to be such a sweet young girl
She kept on dancing, refused my romancing
And it feels good
He wrote a book about the Bible and he, he wrote a book about men in the sky
It's better to be loved than left out
They say I'm doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong
'Cause without you I'm just bones bones
I put my hand dans ton panier
Out of my blue eyes
From that night I kissed our love goodbye
Just holding a piece of what's been left of me
It's always a surprise
You say this could work someday 
I will wait until another indistinguishable day arrives outside
And I can unscrew the stars
Then passed Ernst's mausoleum defended by a rook
In the heart that you've been handed
One time you had it all I ain't mad at y'all
Ladayla, my boyfriends's back
Such a pretty boy, only nineteen
And your soles are worn
And I can't believe you got that girl
Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again
Squeeze me, squeeze me baby all through the night
And the people are kind, a new state of mind
We don't need your money, money, money
You will have long flowers in your hair
I'm a midnight toker
And my friends were acting cool
Let my shoes lead me forward, please bring me some luck
You are so brave
Build them back up with your bones
Grinnin' like a dog diggin' up dinosaur bones
Just know I'll play this song
That's how I am girl
Got your voice in my head
Turn around and what do ya do I don't know
I've got machine guns,
In the arms of my sweetlovin' man
Climbing over people 'cause I've been blinded
You stopped me where I stood
A part of me drift away with you and will never return
And it's cold inside
People say I should watch my pace What do they know
We got to take it to the sky
Till the day I die,
And we like different minds workin' off the same brain
I could wrap you up, wrap you up in my love
And young girls
You've seen the future, now a love that is blind
Stormy nights reawake
Of the cherry blossom tree
No, no, target market, television
Oh beautiful smiles, won't you stay awhile 
I dreamed one day I'd be livin' off the system for free
You are the morning
I need that little hope I can find
You're starting now so please stay off 
Let us grow the balls to break the walls
Laid bare
Pictures of things as they used to be
To the top of the building
Woke up this morning shackled and drawn
And at my feet, it fell, like
"Come on, let's stay here for a while"
Where the song repeats itself inside you
Wintertime in London, are you making plans
And nothing really feels the way you do
I've been beat by an industry I've never seen
I got a bad flavour
Let's clash with madmen, grime is fine
The sun is shining, yeah
I ain't got much to win, not much to lose
Mr Higginson, am I not good enough for the world
People you've kissed, people you lust
I will never be lonely, son, I'm never gonna be lonely
Sem fome, sem telefone
Sometimes the sun shines on us
To get out of this town
And tomorrow, I know,
Your friends they wanna leave girl they're calling you
There's something taking over
Let's get into all kinds of trouble
I didn't think this life was gonna be for me
Our love's always growing
So what if we loose our minds, so what if it doesn't make much sense
It's ok, hey come on, no time for education so let's go
We gotta take it now Yeah
Why your answer machine's still on
Hold me baby all through the night
He knows you're afraid of the dark
On the road again
This city's full of life
Now we can see what do we need
Why won't you just let this be your sun
The way you make up when we fight
Cooler than you boy
Well I've strolled across some dance floors
Pick up the rock, son, and carry it on
I'm licking your postage stamp again
Or playing little solos on the keyboard so the kids will ask me how and why
And they only steal me away from you
Now you're open to attack,
Give me a break
And then the tears pour
You're wasted from the boredom
Hit the streets
Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
Oh, Annie, let's not wait
I wanna wrap you around the world
But yeah, like you told me
Knew this girl back in junior high school
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest,
But one thing is true is man now look at you
And I hope to be free
If you believe in magic, come along with me
So this mic thing can move the right thing and do the right thing
Wondering where it all went wrong
Let hands guide the way
Little rivers run in rings around the town,
Left a thumpin in my head
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's all awake
You've got me tripping
His mom had once been attacked by a dog
We break down a party landmine
Beyond the northern light
To te querendo
One day I'll tell you what you did for me
So when I find myself alone and unworthy,
Its either them or me, girl who you wanna do
I can do anything I want to
I try not to let them show
Y un dia despues de la tormenta
What a dark and dreary life
Kiss my petals and weave me through a dream
It feels so right now
Cause a lot of wags want to hear it
Spirits floating in the night
Ooh, ooh, no
Yeah, love is an ocean of sweet emotion Sweet emotion
'Cause I'm a rainbow with you
I know you won't stay there forever
And I wasted tears, I let go
I don't know what I don't know, it's harder everyday
Kiss me baby all through the night
Damn this wild young heart
But she won't give that to them, until they learn how to love
Baby, bitte mach dir nie mehr Sorgen um Geld
Cause there's always time for second guesses, I don't wanna know
I dreamed she'd come, I'd make my escape
And she stands up strong and she demands
So let me feel your leg of hope around me
When I feel like an oar in a sunken canoe
In your arms I'd stay
I can't wait to see your face when you and your friends show up
You're breaking branches
I pick up stones 'cause I might need them
The night alone I've been waiting 
I've been living out my dream everything I saw came true
I don't mind if you play your game,
You spike my blood
The weather is sweet yeah, woah
He told me you beat her up
In your father's steps
Oh looking, oh looking, oh
Nobody can take that no no no
And any moment could be magical
You're gonna get in trouble with that
We spoke for hours
His name was Bluebeard
I am not scared of the elements I am underprepared but I am willing
She sat me down and lit some colored candles over my head
I didn't want you around
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoo
Who the hottest in the world right now
And you're gone too
If I had a day that I could give you
Tryin' to live without your love
I knew that you'd miss me
Get out while you can
Stay indoors, sit out the storm
I bought you a fur coat
Chrissy's such a pretty thing
Our burden rests on your back
But it said
Went out with the guys
Spinnin' with the stars in the planetarium
Yes, those mystery hours
I met a blue dog
Like a spider hit it's you deep inside and
I lie awake in the dark
And we stare at the beautiful women
Do you wanna fun dip and drop, look at me in my solo pop box
I play the piano and I play the guitar
I never said I was the best thing for you
I followed my heart everywhere
From time to time her eyes get wide
Yeah Yeah, now ride it, you've got to ride it
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Well Kim's got the answer with her watermelon gun
You know they needed aid
You take your seat and hold on tight
You really got a hold on me
And every day's the darkest of my life
If you say everything will want to go your way
It's funny when you find the words to say
In the places that you never knew to get through
Her fickleness was thrown back in my face
And I called, you called me
And your body can't take it no more
That you didn't like
Some eyes were looking down at us
'Cause we're hanging back
Need you now, I need you right now
And its funny how you find
That God made me this day
And I'm feelin' like Mike at his baddest
Dressed in white This candle radiates throughout the night
No men ever really dance like this
I fell to the ground on a windy, windy night
'Cause I, I wanna be someone who believes, yeah
Now you'll wear any old thing, oh you'll wear any old thing
Anything we find out
And if we're gonna take this ride we can go wherever we like
And now I'll take a step back and look in your eye
"And I don't want to get innocent
The feeling inside
Would he love you like I would
Making love to only you so
The blood of mankind runnin' through the same veins
You go walking through the terminal
And I said fine
Cross the delta
At eveyone down below 
We're gonna have a good day and all my homies gonna ride today and all these mommies look fly today and the only one we wanna do is get by today hey, and ain't nobody gotta cry today cause ain't nobody gonna die to you save that trouble for another day hey we're gonna have a good day, We're gonna have a good day and all my homies gonna ride today and all these mommies look fly today and the only one we wanna do is get by today hey we're gonna have a good day
My job was calling
It's always a good time
Back in my head we were kissing
My rollercoaster's got the biggest ups and downs
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Nobody's hoping for better days
'Cause I just wanna compliment your Soul
And never was it your eye be
There's no bouncer in the after world
I can't stay, I can for the night, for the night 
Nobody minds, everyone lies
I ain't ever gonna let you down
The bus driver laughs and he shakes his head
He has things you'd never do
It might bother you, don't let it
Nothing can save us
And I have to turn away to keep from bursting
The kid is back he's back on track
Now we'll never be lonely,
Where the stars gravitate toward you
If I died tomorrow
Would only turn out a negative
Wherever you go, you'll be thinking about me
She wont ever let you meet her family,
I never knew till someone told me that
And there's something about this rush
And forget our restless destination
Give me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break
Hell yeah I just got paid
You've got the touch, now come on let it show
Even angels would be homesick in this forsaken town
I could love you all the time
You got to the bell rings three, do you understand
We could close the door and sleep all day 
Quiero ser tu firmamento
I just want to be alone
Right to the bone
I won't mention tomorrow
They keep things loose, they keep things light
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running, and the running it around
Bad thoughts away
It's gonna take alot of time before I can cross that finish line
And my chest was beating
I could beg you baby please don't go
You broke my heart, you broke my mind
I felt so symbolic yesterday, if I knew Picasso
And a baby on the way
Now I feel okay
Feel that wind rushing by heyayaya
Don't try coming back
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight
But I just can't get your love
Empty hands and tired eyes
Ooh ooh ooh la la
So I got drunk, had sex with all your friends
There's an open road
And I felt my head exploding
You've got the elegance but it's weighin' you down
But I hope someday he'll take me away
Smile at the empty sky and wait for
Where the light's even and bright
Hands up if you're down to get down tonight
You make it hard to smile because
As long as it keeps goin' round its unbelievable
It's about that time
We dance at the festivals
Save those lies, Darling don't explain
We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun goes down
Inescapable fate, yeah, it's out of my hands
For all time
I never knew all that I had
Im going cross the delta
I see her in my dreams at night, I see her when I close my eyes
It's so funny
So you say
You run an airtight mission
Took them away
And only I still call you mine
Air in my lungs, air in my lungs
Fallin' to my knees
I regret every single thing I ever said, I said those things too softly
And I didn't need you till melody
Look at her falling out of a taxi cab
Had a bad tendency to explode
I'm feelin' so mischievous, original cheeky chappy
When I'm dead will use my bed
Anne Disaster's her name
Look through the tree
So Timmy goes to school and Timmy goes to work all day
And I'm led to the house I built
With the desire to carry on
And you still think that you're so it
But I like you 'cause you're
I, I only looked in her eyes
Then you say I'm untrue
Ooh, ooh
If you're looking
I'm trying to be alright
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
Send back my dream test baby
They searched but they could find no trace of us
All these rocky mountains
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down
Tell me I'm the only one
So hold me up
And I even like the birthday presents you get me
So for now I'll keep believing your words
I dream and see you floating high above me
We turn it up, we turn it up
Woahwoah, woahohoh the girl got hot
We don't need your money, money, money I don't, we don't need it
You got to demonstrate
Oh baby please stay true
We are the ones who're gonna last forever
She'll be the one
You can watch the sunset from the bed 
And when you walk inside I feel the door
The faces there
To the Nth degree
Let a man work, is that so wrong
Like a tropical forest, like a cop on the beat
I search among the clouds trying to see you
I was so frightened
To find the human inside
Everyday I'm fighting 'cause I can't read you
Why don't you come on over Valerie Valerie Valerie Valerie
I don't wanna look at fashion magazines
Pay for my tattoos or buy me diamond rings
I said build high, yeah, build high
But if you really love me
Each and every one of us still pray
I don't wanna hear it
Why are the Robots so sad
You said you were my girlfriend
Clowne towne a big dumb kid
It's ok, come on, I won't do the things they learned me
Match a name to the face, do you suspect
Tonight, tonight
Had to pull off your nice clothes
And everyday I compare your face
Somebody tell me, tell me, tell me, when will I learn
There's no need for guessing
I said hello hello, Eugene Eugene
Doesn't matter where
Can't you hear the laughter in the air
I wanna die, and I'll take it from you, if you got it
My brain is super fried
I'm not done with my traveling
My friends they always told me
So let us be married
And your never gonna get that girl
I think I might go on and on forever
Who says it's hard to reach
From high up on this mountain I can almost see
Little bitty hearts upon my cheek
And I'll only make you cry with these feelings
Then my life can finally begin
Hear ye, hear ye, friends and Romans, countrymen
Eagle feather in her feathered hair hey
Do you thing, it doesn't matter
This ring will help me yet
Good times good times
I've had this itchin in my shoes since I was just a little kid
And all the people who really understand
I've tried to call you names, but every time it comes out the same
Every street you walk on
It's from the television lies
Make all our dreams of make believe reality
Here is your shovel, there's the ground
If you think of all the things that you feel
We were looking for a place where we don't fear heaven
And I watched Superman fly away
You left your keys under my bed
I'll give you a massage when you get home
You didn't come here for nothing, did you
And all the people who've seen it all before
Right here, right now, Elvis brings his children home
Why don't, why don't I fall
No matter what you might do
GIrl, you done broke me down inside
Drops a marble from the sky
But what I know is I'm his girl
But now I just pass out watching TV
Clowne towne single angel
Our present was empty, our history a mess
Says the magpie to the morning
Hold you here until the pain has all gone
Your naked body shimmers in the night
And did it make you happier
Look at it from another way
I find it to be magical
I loved you from the very first day
I can't get enough
This a number one champion sound
'Cause it's the weekend
But you are just a blur
We on the floor and we grind to the beat
Is that it's best, kid
Temptation's callin' you, a secret reply
'Cause our love our love
Is when I noticed you, yeah
Down the Langlands Road we set off the best of friends
And when I wake so helpless and thinking of that
They're on your back
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Yeah, I just wanna compliment your soul
Everyone lies
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes
You got your money and I got cast
We'll sing, it's a beautiful day
Do you still get knocked down by that Bacardi Breeze
I didn't catch much through the sobs 
I alway seem to make
And I am getting out
Now I'm right here, waiting for your calling
I'm putting my heart out on the line
Because mimes are dears
Never feel happy
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
It's the thing that does drive me
But you've got to make your own kind of music
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah
You hold me up
We should start somethin' simple,
The cops they got the guns, the night destroys the sun
I'm ready for the good times
Forget about the price tag Forget about the price tag
My TVC one five, he
Growing sleepy as the rain falls 
Michael's nervous and the lights are bright
I am in love with a boy
You'll complete me, right 
I'll be the greatest man of your life
But there's a wideeyed girl back there
We had some real fun
But I still talk that caaash
Why are we so loud when we say it won't happen to us 
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down
And nobody will love them, and nobody will love them
Still I burn this earthen fire
The life I chose is past
Being here alone tonight with you
You say I'm acting naughty but girl you're naughty too
Infatuation took a hole of my mind
Girl stop your talking
Neck full of gold, baguettes in my Rolls
I wanted someone to love completely
Your feasty eyes won't make me fall apart
I've enjoyed making you miserable for years
At least they'd have a hella fine merlot
I wanna walk into the store
Sunshine almost all the time makes me high
We got the money
As the lights go on with emptiness and how you seem to stand out
Have you ever, felt so lonely
They tell me everyday
Though I didn't know it at the time
You are so needed by everyone to do everything 
I think I'll download a brand new head
Old captains and brand new cruise ships
Do you want to dance
I was old enough to want it,
Wishing the car was from you
Good, good, good, good vibrations
Hey, these are different times but we feel the same pains
I feel like Superman
So much for believing the fat guy doesn't win
Don't say it will all be fine
Let the sun fade out to a dark sky
A game that I'm destined to lose
I bend in shapes and ways I never knew
I found a lover and then I lost myself
One thing's for certain, I'm insecure
She saw my TVC one five
Get a load, get a load
Last night we had a rendezvous
The loneliest kind of lonely
when they tryin' to work it out 
'If you want I can take you on another kind of ride'
Midnight, who lost control and found this world
Cooler than you girl
We have to party all night
You're extraordinary baby
She served up my heart on a plate
No matter what, I'm by your side
Won't you show me everything you know,
In my head it's insane
Money in my
Kind of odd, look out for quicksand, there is high ground
Don't let the daytime get you down
I can't tell them apart
I walk in from the kitchen
Through their clothes
I think it's your heart, but you already know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But dreams come true, honey; welcome to my reality
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations ahappenin' with her
Because I can hear the memories in my ears
When we would take trips
Comb the beach and put those blue 
This the championship game you ready yo
Love forever love forever baby
Wanna see you smile
You don't sound ready better scream it just to let 'em know
Let's ride the valkyrie, commit a bit of sin
Is it what you dreamed it'd be
How the music can free her whenever it starts
Your mother likes my smile
And share your freak with the rest of us
Would he please you
And then I feel the weight and then I come back down
Spell it to me love
It's like this man, you can't put a price on a life
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running and the running and the running and the running it around
Can't get over you
Solo creo en tu sonrisa azul
Y vos, solamente contame la verdad
'Cause even though we never get things right
I'm all right
And I stared back breathlessly
I've been calling your name
Let's forget this five year bender
Some time later I met a young graduate,
The lion sleeps tonight
You've got to make your own kind of music
That's why I'm still here and walk with you
Caught up in your feelings
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
And I will kiss you till your breath is found
Gotta head back to reality but reality is greater
Each time it feels its in vain
From the end of the sofa
I feel like I'm loving you in 
To the Sadie Hawkins"
A man in a bright light
And I'm righting all my wrongs
Were all gone when you went into the kitchen
Where the wind withers memory
Am I the only one, who see's what you've become
Island of lost so oh oh oh oh Far away from Babylon Oh oh oh oh oh On the boulevard
Because sitting in our room
Will be rainy at best
She's picking up her clothes
Just take it away, yeah
Be still
Because we never have
My heart melts like ice cream cones
I respect your hustle girl
There's still room in my wooden horse for two
Even god he would agree
It's ok, come on, I won't do the things they learned me
Right here, right now, teenage kicks and gramophones
Why am I dealing with this feeling
It's all about chemistry, Ohohohohoh, oh,
And stare at the world from deep under eiderdown
But it's so dangerous but they're determined
Your pentagram is down below our floor
Fresh and deep as oceans new
We fit together like if we was two Lego's
You're takin' me out to wine and dine me
With outstretched hands
Dash of rouge, buyer beware the girl got hot
And now I'm walking by Bev and Mick's backpacker hostel on Victoria Street
The girl I adore was right in front of me
Once the black has veiled this sky
To make your kissing complete
Well, don't let that worry you baby oh baby
So she left herself in swallowing up the fever to the air to a broken wing
What I feel like doing, when I'm inspired to
Still I build my towers high
Black hands held so high
Doesn't matter when
You're still my favorite melody
Getting sick of being just alone
Who wants this rockscene
And we've found the music
We kissed in your car and we drank from your purse
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood
Do you wanna celebrate our just made little holiday
The bottom line is laying in the bed that we've been playing in tonight
We conquered in the sun, but we lived in the shade
Need you to hold me up, I
We just can't get enough
Why is everybody so serious
Filled with girls all dressed in red
'Cause in your mind I just might find
Lighting up drugs always fightin' in the club
Each night I sit there pleading
And all of my unfaded charms
And all the celebrities want permission, but she won't give it to them, till they learn how to love And Kim's got her watermelon gun, 'cause it's the consciousness of love
Maybe I should give her time
To take a second look
So I let you buy the house, the car, the ring
We dance in the movies
From no hoes at shows to menage in suites
There's something going on that wasn't here before
Believe in me, help me believe in anything
The light that wraps itself around me
I better rest my eyes because I am growing weary of
You're a heart attack, just the kind I like
If fingers are mistakes
So I die die die alone 
And what's a girl supposed to do
I can't believe things are really that bad
And I, I wanna be someone to believe
Reluctance ties up the line
But I'm the one who keeps on reading reading
Yeah baby we were nothin', we existed for less
That we could lay here for hours, and justa reminisce
The Taliban said who rejuvenated your eyes, boy
Oh rejoice, your father's been calling
You're feelin' good
You cannot separate yourself
You will be married and you'll be gone
I am softer than my face would suggest
How I found a love so pure
You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
It's a suicide, waiting, others say
It's nothing conscious
I'm that chick you danced with two times through the Rufus album Friday night at that party
We've waited so damn long, we're sick and tired
Flowers in my hair now
So I said
All of these faces are crowding around me
Perhaps someone you know 
You know I want your body Your body wants me too
Hey darling, let's steal it,
Forget all your technicolor dreams
And they sit around playing all their favorite songs
Gonna take you home tonight
Inside a thousand people with yellow ribbons sing
You'll always remember my name 
Because all of us are
Dance till you got no more"
Girl your hot, your body's on fuego
Their needs too deep
But it feels great
Keep close the cold compress, such a poor substitute
If fingertips are relationships
Tonight's the night girls, yeah
Kissing and having fun
Sunshine almost always
I don't go for secretive games
You came in to my life
Like a full moon to a werewolf,
Sell it to me, love
It's gonna be a beautiful day
Verse one
Watch it burn, humming "Sherry," splits the scene
I've found I always move too slowly
Every time it's the same old thing
Slim chicks, round chicks
Channel like a lion, channel like a lion
Well I woke up in too many beds with girls I didn't know
Honestly I could easily replace you
So we could take a step
If you're afraid, you know your walls will keep them away 
Dancin' all night long boogie
Everybody needs a home
To see me something has been on my mind, something has struck me
Do I drive you up a tree
I'm on a flatbed yellow pickup underneath the half moon
I used to love The Tenderloin
Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad
Take off, both your, shoes and clothes, I'll follow
They kill their lives every day
But hear me when I say I'm glad we steered that way
I remember mother that day
And the sound of the sea
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me
Are made of fur
Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar
Won't you show me everything you've learned,
Time past has thrown
Gonna make this songbird sing
What if I shout shout shout my name 
Mr Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars
Replace, retrack
There was no return address 
KKK kicken' at your front door
Seems that I'm still waiting for the sun
You said, "I don't know, you don't know"
I'm still waitin for your heart, 'cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna start
People are intricate, people aren't swines
I'm gonna be ready this time
House on the rock
That's a shame that love can make you stay 
You already gone
Oh I feel good
But our dreams are all we really need to know
Give me a night that I won't forget
If I put myself to the test, would I ever raise a fist
I get shaking inside and the sun in my eyes 
But hell seems like fun to me
And if he feels my traces in your hair
Reasons to dance in the moment
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
Ooh, you gotta go your own way
While soothing words
I waved her goodbye
Hold me tight
No wonder I feel
I sure don't want to hurt no one
Whenever wherever forever together whenever
I told her I was sorry I came 
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running it around
Try to make a brother fall in love
Come on baby girl, let see me those legs
You never walk alone, and you're forever talkin' on the phone
And then, after dark,
Oh, all about chemistry,
Oh no I only meant to be a friend to everyone this time
And now things are gonna get better baby
Thinkin' that his head surely would explode
And take the cash back
I had my mouth on her nose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Swim to me through stars that shine down
All the energetic people they all sparkle as they're walking down the street
She said I'll show you some rhythm
Mr Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
You make my dreams come true
Someday, someday in a cloud of gray
But most of all the little ones
And I know I can be self righteous
Don't worry I'll be there to rock the party all night
I've seen lots of brothers act tough,
We're both to young to sit around
But I don't get no loving, and that's no lie
Still the memory stays, for always, my heart says, Danke Schoen
You are who you are
I'm fixin' to die
Great morning light splits through the chain
You're extraordinary, baby
Shouting, Bay, bay, babies
When this life tried to keep us apart,
And by the looks of things, fate came along for the ride
Is a place that I respect
I wanna try to be the person you want
I can sing a song of suffering
You've been wasting my time, always
But there's just one kind of love you can spend your life dreaming of
Someone we just can't ignore
This can't be real, I must be dreamin' could somebody slap me
There's no time for a debate 
While I'm away
You'll be my American boy
Rockin' back 'n' forth in my little old chair
Sweet thing 
The places you go
That we're getting up early to go to the state fair
I've always been quietly dreaming
Will hold us in their arms
Well, I'm gonna paint my picture
I feel so good for me
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
You know just when to jump off
And I still believe I still believe
This be the route we'd always take and
I hope I got a little more time
Understanding that I misunderstood
We've got to find the time
An old feeling that feels refreshingly new
She's givin' me the excitations
I watch from the sides and try to reach out
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Bring me all the good gossip
On a bus stop bench sat an ancient lady
I don't to be lonely
But the clothes that we wear
But I don't, and I won't, so you've got another thing coming
She didn't choose this role
Words just get in the way
I'm curing viewers by thousands
I always act a fool ow, ow
The guys were feeling good about their liquor run
And you warm me up and you wait for it
While I walk alone in the rain
Who knew I'd cum so fast
Waiting to see or send a sign of defeat Uhuh
When the fire's burnin' from sky to ground
My bad self, my bad self
When the going gets tough then get to going
If now is forever then what's to prove
But there's no answer
And now you're half awake
Come on this is screaming "photo op"
Everything that rises
And the sun is shining
Sit you alone
Talking 'bout home
I'm playing at the wrong game yeah
And everyone was coming towards the center of the city
What it used to be back home
I guess well turn out so well
The buttons on my phone are worn thin
Come fill up your souls with our blessings
You saved the day
Then I'll share an elephant ear with you if you'd like
So I've taken out this time to say
I got on the blower
And laugh all day
Don't wanna hear it
For all of these simple things and much more a flower was born
Shot an arrow in your head
'You will be all the things in the world you've never been
Ain't love such a sweet thing
Never be the lonely one so
In the room with the alcoholic guest
So you want to go on with someone
Something real
She got hot, and they did not, hoh
What's a poor boy to do in a world gone wrong
He just stares back unblinking
Show me your personality
Tell me, does it make you feel too real
It's a mystery that we are all still holding on
Wandered through the valley of the shadow of the dead
Always find some number that we know
My foot to the floor I will drive to the place
I'm sorry love but I don't really care
It makes you wanna move those dancing feet
Moonlight yeah
Well this is life in color color
The empty rooms feel cold 
Lord it's a long way to go back home
I miss you, forever you'll stay gold
Wearing your matching shorts
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
There's a number you can call
Now we're feeling extra high
My stairway to the sky
We'll never be more than a few hours from home
We're singing a new song now
To light the way gladly
And I will love you,
You'll be haunted by her face
That still make me think about my middle school kiss
The quarterback asked me if I'd like a beating
Your decision is a sure thing
That sails the sea
Think I got a tan from the light which I was basking
I'm glad you threw all that away 'cause now you look so great
And we'll get a head start on the day
And you're buying every line of it girl
I write my rhyme for this track
I can't beat the feeling
Oh But what do you need
We gotta let it
You'll miss me when I'm gone
And sing for the wings of a dove
In Paris on winter nights
That I want for the rest of my days
When it's raining, we'll go to the video store
What you do to me when you hold his hand
Trudging through the dark in a world gone wrong
There is nothing like someone new
Still I can't get enough of it
What have I done with it
Love is all we need
If I've seen it all before why's this bus taking me back again
She says to me
Can you feel that yeah
But now I'm caught up in a dream, don't wanna leave
Tell me, tell me not to be lonely
I brought my baby home, she
At every kind of disco
And we had fun
And darlin' you've got me wantin' you
And while the city sleeps
And make out in the rain
How did you know
"We all said hallelujah"
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely
Cherie, cherie, comment ca va 
In the midnight moonlight I'll, be walkin' a long and lonely mile
Have in me a little faith
Whether whistling heaven's clouds disappear
This song is not a fuck song
We gathered around the school
If you wanna, you can gamble everything for love
'Cause without you I'm just bones
everybody
An American hazy sea
Provide me with a means of getting home 
As daydreams slide 
How sweet it is to be loved by you
You played me hard to get for a while
You know you never should've listened to my father's advice"
Everybody dies frustrated and sad
With someone that can make me
I wake up at twilight
It's still love in the first degree
I hope he never has to deal with wronging someone
'Why thankyou' she said
I give thanks everyday for these words that save my soul
Mit Geld, als ob es Brot ware Yeah
Up the coast to catch some sun
I will never grow older, at least not in my mind
Just to show that they love one another
Became the dark reminder of
We're always kickin' back nobody can take that
I carried on
Tell our friends go ahead
I work it out when the situation seems unworkable
You make my heart beat faster
And let me swim around your eyes
All these people talk a lot
Does it take to get smarter
If you ain't happy with yourself you need to work it out
I know that's what you've been saying lately
When the going get tough, the tough get going
Oh, I know that tomorrow I'll feel bad
I hope my little brother puts a call in today
I'll never find a love like this
I still believe I still believe
Well, your mother likes my smile
But I'll never get down hearted
You've got an energy
Ho's ride, get your nut till I can't get it up
Cast as a wish into a well with no sound
A fire burns inside me
Spiritual fashion, yeah
All those times I'd hung my head to keep the peace
Mmm, everybody, has got to demonstrate
But I like to hold something I can see
But together is much better
Well no more, well no more blue days and lonely years
Sha la la la la la la la yeah, 
Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
We can fall right out of bed
Fights away all decay
At the trees they are
And anything I said or do
Such a waste, But it feels great
The four of us, the royal we, he bangs the drums, she's VIP
I hope it's not the end of the line
Put your new weight in gold and see what it's worth
As often as the mail comes
We'll sneak to some place
Where the fog wraps itself around you
It was clear she was dead yeah we all could agree
Oom bop bop, good vibrations
White hot glistening shadowy flows Feelings to grow 
Yeah she rocks my world
I don't have no pretty friends, can't pretend
The east river when you are in love
When you and I both know this is the end
When I say I'm not excited
It's a suicide, waiting
And waiting pent, save, sad, and look
But it feels great today
Turn out the light
Back and forth, side to side, oh my dear
Go all the way to the right
We have to take our clothes off
To find a diamond at the bottom of the drain
Well you knew this would come
Money can't buy us happiness
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy
Give me a solution
What were we thinking
Oh, I nearly started screaming
I swallow the beams and sun drops
We spent the night in Frisco
Because we are alive so we've gotta live life
Since outta high school I dropped
The sun on my face and my shovel in the dirt
I've got no time for school books 'cause I got no time to study
'Cause every moment life is slipping away away
Lola lola lola lola ooh
Jumping round till the ground shook
Absolute horror
I sing the blue notes
Then I promise I'll be the one 
Is the best love best love
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
In the city with no one else,
That's not to say
And their shiny toy guns
Walking rounds in search for stars these nights
And the sisters take pictures of brothers
Falling into your arms"
Oh Darci, Darci don't look so sad
You're still waiting for someone who never ever came
Our guns
Think how you spend all your days They all say so
N, do I need
That he would never be the satisfying shag I needed, no no no no
Your hair, your Spanish ass
You can stay with us till paradise
So for awhile we conducted experiments,
There's nothing else to do
And I sleep all day and wake myself in the shadows
And that old man is me
You'll never feel
Well you sure look fine
Standing on unstable ground
And then we'll eat it off these blue plates
A chance to build it from the ground
and because of that, my heart is yours
Looking for a place
And it's always too late when you got nothing
Leopard handbag out of sight dynomite
Do you have the slightest idea No, I don't 
And baby's gone, she
You say it's true, know it's true, nothing left except for me and you
Are you everything that I missed Don't hope so 
I'll never find my way back home
Try to mute the sound,
One of these nights I may just
I don't know what I did
It wouldn't be a bad thing
'Cause it's always a good time
I'll never let you touch the ground
Before the sun rises today
Right inside and
Ain't no use in your sitting all alone
Oh, so demonic, oh my TVC one five
And we all fall down, there's not enough hours in our trip
On the outside looking in like an aquarium
Everything else would be overrated
He's got his mothers eyes, his father's ambition
Started out this morning feeling so polite
You look the same on TV as when you were mine
And the subtleties you start to sling
If love's the truth then look no lies
Close those doors
I just wanna compliment your soul
And if we keep up this pace pretty soon we'll know the name of every kid and every grown up booking house shows in their town
A diamond at the bottom of the drain
In an apartment by the River Road,
I get a prescription and set it on fire
But I swear I heard you scream
Lady, dreamer, you might be the soundest sleeper
And it's magic if the music is groovy
I'm rolling so quickly
Well now, oh oh baby
But now that you are here
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight Mmm, everybody
Following the girl
Oh, trying our best to feel alive
Are there people you don't recognize, do they lie
Hey that's say ahh
'Somewhere where it warm and wet'
But your never home
Just in case someone thought they had missed it
Yaeah, baby you the bomb
I'm fortunate they don't see a fourth what I get
And we were feeling down
They think it's not right, fine
That I get
Endless sky with the evening around you
Pushing right out your seams
And rearranged the size and forms to look like something understood
Stop at the cafe, coffee and a salt beef bagel
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying
Ripped apart by the crows not the vultures
But you look amazing
To hear just what they found,
It's not about the money
When my momma said I look good in white
And these are the words
Holla, holla, holla, life goes on
Tapped my shoulder one last time
And I'm feeling the love of you
Ciao adios, I'm done no, no, no, no
What'cha know about living
You've got to learn to love what you are
You know I really want you for your company
'Cause I don't want to be lonely
And when I feel bad when people disappoint me
I'll play you a song on my guitar
It's nights like these when you know that your alive
But in practice believe me, there was a nasty fire burning
Demonstrate, you got to demonstrate
It had resigned itself to night
I met a Mexican called Juan
Never seen the sun shine
And he's on the way to the real first in all the universe Yeah Yeah
There's only one bullet
Look out now, yeah, my boyfriend's back
Swinging in your backyard,
But she came with feelings too complex to be amusing
Oh my TVC one five
But where did I find the source
I am a deserted bus depot
That ex got a bullet aside and she likes what you did before
Wanna make the world dance
This is a song
It's not like we'll be parted
So hold me up, Oh
End of story, I fade to black inside
They make the music that we play
When I look at the television
And before I had a mini van I rode the Greyhound bus
Oh, can you hear the beat of my heart
Chrissy put on some lipstick
"Game over" they said
Don't set aside,
We could sit for years
Keep 'em open, yeah, keep 'em open
I watch you sailing far above the seashore
All the robotic families
Starting missions at the break of dawn
You're James Dean driving in your fast car
I'll be love's suicide
Here comes a comeback
Stay just a little bit more
How can I begin to say
Our days were filled with frowns
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night
Now I'm peaking in so many ways
But now its time to get some better days some better days
Can you hear the sound
You way too sexy, never be shy
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
Something extraordinary
That you feel while listening to every word that I sing
I'll be right there
At the funny things we'd say
But I've had to fit a second hand
You say if we were to wait 
This is a world of dreams
Ja sei onde ficar
It's hard to celebrate with a headache Oh Yeah Yeah
Maybe things get bad before they get worse
And every song was right
By then I'd stopped looking for my way out
Got keep on, gotta go on, gotta go on
That I used to wear not to block out the sun
But this song is a real song
I just get so nervous when I'm talking to you
Get out of my life
We got space to do what you please
For years feeling dead
And bring a bottle of rum
Run along, run a long way to find a one
Money, money
You turn me over and over
And the basic construction of my feet
Con fuego baby
A fickle beast who's nice today
And stuck another needle in the ground,
I used to get so paranoid In places like this
You had me going out of my head
Problem with y'all I say it directly
I ain't looking to receive
Mason Betha
You'll shiver all summer
And you looked into my bloodshot eyes and said is it too soon if I call you Sunday
And it feels just about right
In the morning light
Yours and that boogie sunshine
And you'll smile and say, how are you
I've got problems,
I felt your body move through my coat
For the love of a sweetlovin' man
I went to look
After three, after four times
Crackle crackle crackle of the vinyl
Whether hope dampens memory
And I know we'd do anything for love Oh yeah
And you're lost and you're gone
Went to a show last Saturday night
Now it's evening and the sausages are frying out back
And he's the one for me
Ripped apart by the crows and the vultures
For about four years I've hated this town
I don't care what it does to me
I just want to stop stop to thank you baby
You'll never feel happy
And it can come as no surprise to me, with another guy
Time that we had was like sand in our hands
Oh rejoice, your nails all got chewed off
Ohoh, TVC one five
Body my holding cell
I said rave on
Before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
But it's always too late when you got nothing
Baby, are ya cold, are ya cold, baby
Just stylishing cars 'cause they all true Nig'
Baby, I could fall apart
that nobody has loved you,
I needed the shelter of someone's arms, there you were
So we have to get off
Though we go on our separate ways,
We swore we'd never take pictures
In the exact same way they never did
'Cause Audrey's a stone fox
But when everybody loves me
Every penny don't fit the slot
If you've been looking for me
And it's funny how you find
And I just couldn't do it alone
Everybody shake it
I watched Superman fly away
And don't pick up the line
You make me feel so good
'Cause there's a river runnin' underground
My boyfriend's back and you're gonna be in trouble
Come on LA, take advantage
The palaver of Solipsists exploding in my skull
And if I die at least you'll die too
You bend 'til you break
We'll sneak to some place and
I want everybody to stand up
She's turning around
What ya wanna do about this thing
So the crowd gets quiet I start to play
It's coming back to me
Just say what's on your mind
Still the little boy had died
So you my love can sing this song
I'm going with my bad self
Yeah, Estelle, we about to get down get down
That I'm not the kind of boy that she needs
I didn't even want around
I feel like I owe you my life
Sale el sol
Show me your love, your love
I don't know when I've been beaten
When I've spend one with you
And now I'm sunny with a high of 
There's a place where the strange ones go
Then you look in the mirror, wish you were somebody else
Me and you we strollin',
Forget about the price tag
He was a man of many nations, two hearts, two hands, it's a slippery slope
I sit here in this chair and I wish,
Someone to leave this town and
What surely said, "We wrote a book"
"Let this be a warning,"
And you're hot, cold, you're battering my bones
Did not let me down when I was a kid
And hurts me baby when you try
Still got me deeper every day with your smile
Get a load, get a load of it
With matter removed of divine dimension
So much it feels nice
He's not the perfect boy at all
What a cruel way to treat a friend
I'll be the only thing who cares 
So while you daydream my Mercedes gleam
Did not let me down when I was defenseless
Till I find my new drug
It's a suicide, waiting, another day
That the struggles gonna come in all shapes and size
And I like my head on your shoulder
But my party has just begun
And I feel happy too
He said, "I hope the names will get changed to protect me"
That you'll be thinking about me
Ya, that's alright
To fill my days and nights with something
Just happy times and half assed rhymes and mimes
Free from all the happy thoughts and smiles across the sea
Everybody look to the right, to the right
She was a young girl
To believe, to believe, yeah
I went back, I went back to your love
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
Lose your friends
And your Sundays
All along the path, feelings I can't tell
Yawn and smile say
It's catching my eye
All these haters say I'm faking but I really don't care
Mystery hours
What's a poor boy to do but keep singing this song
We've got an energy
It scares me just to
At least we can say we won't be lonely
From the streets of Babylon
And your waist and your smile
So, baby, tonight just be the death of me
Do you want it to be outside in the cool night
And I felt so many wrongs
No need to sleep we come alive
Even if nobody else sings along
And wondering what dreams
Jump on the big wagon 'cause I'm so cal
O sol e tao bonito
Something out of nothing
It makes you feel happy like an oldtime movie
Don't let me be the last to know
Very good friend of mine
Have faith that when you call on me
Tell me, are you gettin' hurt, is it worth it
But she'll show you pictures
Wake up your saints, Jenny, I need them
Foaming like the melody of sea foam fairy flutes
You never need to be afraid just know you went the right way
When all is in order you get lost in the heat
Did you know I could be a lot of fun
Once in a blue moon
That summer feeling
My sneakers in his hand
Fur too soft for words
And get crafty
Freedom, son, is a dirty shirt
I'm depending on you
In West Palm Beach on your holiday
She goes above and beyond her call of duty
You're not alone
And then it'd leave for a while
So a pig was the closest thing he could get
I said now, Drive it, Drive it
Leave me the way it has to be 
Here is my unopened letter to a world
I, i, i, i, i, iii, iii
By a blue creek
Can we get away this weekend, take me to Broadway
There's not enough hours in our life
And everybody on the street is singing like it's Sunday
Everything loved it's way
And the way you look when you say good night
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
"You and me are the world", she says
Love me with an open heart, tell me anything
You shouldn't wake me awhile
'Cause man, I know we never get things right
And it gets so old just saying we'll keep trying
It's a sweet summer's night in Hammer Hill
We should need nothing, nothing at all Yeah
Where did he go
Mayla, sunshine
This point of view is nothing that I'm used to
Oh yes, I'm up on that thing
How sad I just got
Again, everyday
My lips were much too shy
And I just feel so good; you know I'm seventy years old
This is the blood that we're made of
You're so ooh You're so, so ah You're so, so cool Baby, baby, you're so
In the tall grass where
And I know they love it
If these people just don't get it
Night work
Everything you said
Woah, woah woah yeah
Ignore me in the parking lot
What it means to hold you tight
Oh, it's real love
I watched it all come crashing down
There's gotta be something roaming up around the bend
Go and run through the hallways, find your way to the door
But let me hear you say
And it's almost midnight, the time is coming up
He's got  tattoos
Your search for paradise will come to an end
No more fat dumb fucks keeping people out of our nation
O sol nas bancas de revista
It feels like ten thousand nights of thunder
This world, it lost control and then saw God
Six cars and power to fire big stars
So what else is new
Hangin' around for someone to call
Dressed in all your fancy clothes
Haven't seen that boy in over seven years
Now all the girls raise your hands up in the air yeah
And just to lay inside you, and just to know this feeling
I said I'll make everything all right
The party wasn't all that great 
I see you dancin' but you never ever mark your words
It's not about the money, money, money
That I've heard so much about
If it's your birthday
Everybody look to the right
From the cradle to the grave, it never ends
And it gets the best of me
So I shall unravel my love
It's been three weeks
But we'll climb back to the top,
I don't care what you tell the other guys
Wishing the card was from you
I've been up some baby shit and every time I wake up
Logos is the king of life
Drowning in despair
No damn jedis or hobbits this time
See this shit ain't worth tripping over
We were cool back in high school
But in my heart I know
Everybody one more time yeah
'Cause every moment life is slipping away
I don't mind if you play your game
Where midnight was, were splashed across the canvas
My salvation's ahead of me
And I've got my family, and one big bed is all we need,
And though we did not believe in God
But then I act like I know everything
You look like Audrey Hepburn
Uh, can't go further, losing
I'm leaving the light on just for the sight
To a lifelong love letter
The stars this night in the sky are ringing out
It's green, the fire
This is a story and you are not in it, uh huh
If I win or lose what the fuck I gotta prove
I was sure I never would be sure we were in love
I'll never find my way back home,
Throw off your fears let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born
Yeah and we both despise all of the academic swine
I'd build a plane
You are reaching something that is beating
Lessons I wish that I had mirrored
Everything that I'm trying to say
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
And dance, dance
They look down from the underground
Alone
Well I've got the same phrase
And pretty soon the spirit was a lot like
Could that have been back in the sweet summer of 
Guarantee we'll be feelin' all right
Some say, yeah
Give a lot, a whole lot received
Where no one's home and the weather's fine
"We don't want answers anyway"
So I can teach it when it comes my turn
In a second you were always there to break my fall
And my friends they all looked stunned yeayeah
For a tender glance, ohoho
I've been falling apart
Say yeah 
Missing her warm embrace
If you're sitting in the places that we use to be
Senorita, I can't forget your eyes
Yes, all I need are keys and guitars
Did the ironing in a cowboy hat
Let your fit body bury it
First the feeling's all right
Wait till I stake my claim
They named me lucky
Your lonely windowsill They'll carry you off tonight
I said hello hello, Eugene
Now she commands
The black and white sets us free
All you did was construct a mess
You'll rescue me, right
Don't ever let me go go go
And when I can't take the fall I really wanna make that call
Hit the big big big bang
Fire me through the night
Pure and simple every time
We know that deep inside
I wanna turn all their dance floors
Take me to my city by the Bay
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
So I'll have to say I told you, 
And rejoice, the bed you sleep in is burning
And your eyes grew red and wild before the chasin'
Okay, Coconut Man, Moonheads, and Pea
"I'm the one that you want and you want me now"
C'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
I remember taking you home on that 
She was easy on the eyes so I had nothing to say
The time is getting closer, the time is almost here
They don't wanna come around
That you are my precious little girl
It was rock 'n' roll
Disregard your past
It's like y'all be talkin' funny
Gambling man rolls the dice, working man pays the bills
Gonna turn my enemies into friends
And looked you in the eye
Some twinkle for your eyes, I
See, here's the thing
Right back where I started from
And prematurely ended my career
Picking locks with footprints from the snow
And the thought of loving you is getting so exciting
Leopard handbag out of sight the girl got hot
I've always been in love with you
Don't let me down
Snooze all afternoon
We had them saved for special times
Said 'young man
Oh, I feel your love deep inside
I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
No I don't need you to buy me pretty things
Say what you want, say what you mean
'Cause you're so ooh Tootootoo, so ah Tootootoo, so cool
I feel so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel
Your girls wanna leave, I hear them calling you
Denn ich hab jetzt die American Express und zwar die schwarze
What will I do alone
Wanna make the world dance Yeah, yeah
And I whispered your name
Don't lift a finger, let me hold you
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna get up off the shelf
Are you having an affair
I'm closer to the grave and come the dawn
Nothing's wrong with you and me
The airway
They don't hold no weight with me
Especially when I take my clothes off
Got to do them before I die
I didn't have to explain to her that I wasn't dead
And you're so sweet, you say
And tell me why I'm not dead with them in the valley down below
And as we planned there's fireworks, stage right,
Some guys they get a little bit uptight
You know there's always something in there to see
I've seen the lightning leave me
It's all in the stones that you throw
And there's a distance to her voice over the phone
Whoa, oh, if you really love me 
The magic down there is so strong
We are the tide ah
And shifty expression but now I'm past carin'
Let it take you on a ride
I'm breathing down her neck
Slide over here let your hands feel the way
So I wrote you and I told you
Lookin' at the stars
You hold me glad
One by one, we're makin' it fun
On the back page of a supplementary magazine
Let the code of silence repeat  times
Hold me up, No
I feel in love with people sleeping
And walked out onto a piece of paper
Just be careful when you shine
But they have no impact no value no power
Firmly looking outside me
Ain't nothing new, now, now
For any of the boys
That you can't even have a good time
Living on alert, rubbed in the dirt
Under the grand silver birch tree
Never could be mine, no matter how I try
"Yeah, me and you are a world", he said
Trams pass
It's not like we'll never know love
You can't buy one at the mall but he'll come if you just call
Hmm, that sounds absurd to me
Why's it surreal when my hands feel they can't roll the dice
And I think that's sometime soon
I would remind you of the photo in your pocket
It's always a good time
I can put us to bed tonight
Bajando de la montana en seguida me puse a cantar una cancion sin motivo pero tu te tenias que quejar y siempre estas asi no puedes parar no puedes entender que quiero estar solo que no puedo ser como los demas que solo significa sin nadie alrededor y si me voy ya no se como vas a poder decir que lo que hago es cosa tuya y yo solo voy detras a repetir lo que digas tu como el loro al dueno si todos saben que soy el que te ensena las historias de naves espaciales los tambores y los pasos de baile y en vez de estar nadando juntos en el fondo del mar en una hoguera con los cuentos de noche me querias quemar y siempre estas asi no puedes parar no puedes entender que quiero estar solo que no puedo ser como los demas que solo significa sin nadie alrededor
You are missing that kissing when we're over
Everybody loves the underdog
You always put me first, and somehow that broke my heart
Keep moving and forget the rest
Lasting love, if you know the difference
Sold my bed, no need to sleep these nights,
Trying to make ammends
Simply because I can't
Waiting for the rain to stop
Is it a change of heart that keeps us apart
I'd a hit everything, from Cancun to Grant's tomb
I don't care what people say when we're together
I can be anything that I, anything that I see
If you keep looking
Run and get your quarters in
I wanna travel round the world
And the sun comes one more day
I'm was starting to think I was onto something good
Just nervous in the alley
Am I destined only to die the same way that I lived
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
When you say it's no love affair 
And tour guides make happy brides feel heavensent
What you gonna do when I come for you uh oh
Oh, I want to be your firmament, 
How I loved to catch your gold and silver tears
Down all the power
The way her shadow used to walk by your side
To rock it till there's light our fists in the air
I used to be fossilized but now I'm out of my shell
We do the things you wanna see
Oh rejoice, and holy fuck you're bleeding there
Is real love
But hear me when I say I'm glad because we're here
What the world ahead would store
Staying awake that night
At eveyone down below
It's a suicide, waiting, so decide
And we're having fun
I watch you held aloft way out of my reach
See all the things in the world you've never seen
It's that time to transform,
People keeping low, people searching for some cover,
I feel like a machine
Oh oh Of broken dreams iyayailan Island of lost so oh oh oh Oh oh
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bouta rock and roll
To get cut enough
Go save the world, I'll be around
I said "Yes, okay, let's,"
Without a leash on the light around me
She looked incredible
He'd kill me without any warning
What's broken gets stronger when it mends
Good god girl, you're giving me goosebumps
A friend of miiine
But when I look in the window I see girls on TV
I don't wanna be a part of all the quality that falls apart these days
You were always the one
Don't you blame it sunshine
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations ahappenin'
Did you expect to kiss me one time
The Spanish guitar someone strums
And it all falls down, there's not enough hours in our life
This is the song that reminds me of my trucker hat
Tttripping across this island
But if you hold me up to the light
My ears are burning, but I kept on walking
Number one I'd find some
The way you walk, the way you talk,
His thoughts go deeper than ever yeah yeah
Whether harps heal the memory
I think it's your heart, cause you don't want me around
Frozen by the fear to fail
When we were young and the world was free
Dancin' in the moonlight 
Of everything I know
But a master of disguises, her demise was her design, they said
It feels cold, it's creeping
Rotting on the train tracks
And sometimes I feel like I ain't nothing at all
And lives are falling and
We're paying with love tonight
No one ever would suspect
People talk about me, baby People talk about me, bad to
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up
A young boy
This is me on my knees
She made her home in a poor country
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll take my eyes off the prize
Every time the lights go out out
Not everybody made the list this year
Nananananananight work
Been dreaming about you a lot
It's the end of a broken heart x
Smile through a joke inside
Ciao adios, I'm done I'm done
It's days like these
The ride is in what we make
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
I said, you might be found
Can we miss the storm that sucked the whole world in
Picking pennies off the floor with my cold, cold hands
Eu nao sou audiencia para a solidao
And I know it's got me reelin'
And keep you safe inside of me
We built a wall around ourselves
We were born in the desert, we were reared in a cave
And everybody loves a comeback
I hugged a man's arthritic shoulder
I love being in love
Woo hoo the city float
Boys will be boys, baby
Bottles and the cans, the idiots go dance
Begin the windstorm
Two winters gone in a blur of sleepless nights
There's something strange going on tonight
Just turned 
Well eight or nine, well that's just fine
This right here is the DO Proletariat
White hot glistening shadowy flows Feel goes 
You said inside grand central station
From this second story window I can hear the church bells
See at rehearsal there in the pass by her
Where my life's sweet as it's slightly disappointingly just gliding softly by
Hey, Snow White  It's going to be all right, it's going to be all right
Inside every man lives the seed of a flower
Oh baby, give me one more chance
It's a little red sea let the miracle worker go free
It's pitch black
And the backpackers are pouring out like a tidal wave of vomit
Hey Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think you failed to mention'
They stopped the lightning
I fell in love with people sleeping
Sayin' "let's just be friends"
Cause you came and saved my life
Let yourself float upon the notion
I'll stop my heart and then I'll wait for you
Wanna stop
Maybe it was only a dream
I know you'll never let me down
She was a black Thai bombshell out of Bombay
Pick it up when it's yours to hold
Think we're ooh so unique
Can't say I'd even notice it was absent
I'm so funkin beautiful
With what they say and what they do
It won't be hard to start again
On a Tuesday in the rain, I never thought there'd come a day
Late nights, play fights,
Pretend my feet are running away
Oh, I can't see where you are
All right
And everyone who believes
But look at what we got, the girl got hot
To the road that we've been on now
If you were a beautiful sound in the echoes all around
Clowne towne revealing nothing
Lately we're running out of time, aren't we
Holding her tight every night
Eu quero seguir vivendo, amor
From this second story window I can hear the children
Except for number one, write "love," gamble everything 
Che cosa inventare
Baby don't want at the end of the day
She was always such a pretty girl, nobody like her in the world
When her tears woke us so quietly
Oh wayow ohwhoaoh, oh wayow ohwhoaoh, oh wayow ohwhoaoh
Why's it so strange when they say that the world's movin' upwards
Forget the wrong one
In this cold, World so cold
But I don't even know if I could look you
Un rayo de sol
All the things your trying to say
All the voices in your head that you hear
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
And so we're standing in the street staring at a bloodred moon
And I realize I'm away
I certainly hope that you are happy
Everything that you've been giving
Oom bop bop, excitations
When I'm outside from over the phone
My baby just can't take her eyes off me
As night falls into dust and it's day again 
But I picked up something I just can't explain
But if I did I would groove, and hit the ground running
Ela pensa em casamento
Missing you is all I'm thinking about, yeah
To find some kind of glow
But heaven knows I know
You just thought you could be anything that you wanted to be
Hours passing by
Will I walk away from love knowing nothing
While we're thinking 'bout the people we meet
Since You took my heavy heart
And sometimes you just need a night on the town
My stairway to the sky, yeah
Now you aren't so in step
Everybody needs this happy thing
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
That you're gone and now I'm fallin'
We still need the medicine quick
I will let you down I will let you down
Hold onto your time
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
There is a river running underground
Make 'em opposites, so there's a reason
In loving your true self and your true love
We're both too young to be sitting around
You know the ills of this world they can get you down
I saw on TV about this little kid
Oh I love you and that's all you need to know
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
I sense evil at the heart of each far flung welllighted home
I've done our charts and it says
I told her I was looking for somebody to appreciate,
And I was a stain on her unmade bed
I'll memorize everything you do to me so I can,
They can always find
When I look at your face I can tell that you're not going to be stopping soon or even slowing down
But it's bittersweet to me
Just a perfect reflection, you and no one else
And tell me what they did this time
The devil's gotten to me through this dance
And if it feels like we're dreaming
I'm running a fast as I rock
Well, I dream
Love it when you hold me,
You just want to good times
And the car went down
Then she sigh 'ah there's one thing
I wanna share this with you
I'd rather make an honest sound and watch it fly around and then be on my way
Then tryin' pull a brother, I'm not lookin' for nobody to judge
Oh Never find a love like this
And mine's a paper ball
Oohooh
And there's something about you
You never had a boyfriend
When love falls from the sky nobody ever asks why
Who has done to the tiger
But three days later
I just can't seem to shake, Emily, yeah
When I'm six feet under the ground
And a bad tendency to get burned
I'll be your man
When the chaperone said that we'd been crowned
It's am, that's the evening your time,
﻿You'll never feel happy
If you say that you love me
Finally made our way back to the train, rolling into Sheffield tonight
Well, she's not bleeding on the ballroom floor
Can't handle you their way
Lost in the beat of my heart
Still waiting for
Fit for a fortnight
And you will tear off your clothes and kiss the floor
It was a straightfaced lie I believed
Tired feet
It's the weekend
That I ever did see
To the pages I loved
Float through the air air air air
But don't, don't, don't let's start
There's no one left but me
'Cause the numbers are wearing off
We're ripped apart by the crow and the vultures
Are these the good days
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me
He's got more channels
While I'm still sitting here
Don't on the good times
Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets
Won't you tell me, yeah
And if you catch us coming up about around the bend
If you really wanna speak than make the sound
And all of your friends don't know who I am
So can you hold me up
You're not alone in this love
We're on fire now
New girl
Since the stars predicted something new would reconnect our worlds
Believe in the magic ofa rock and roll
Come on say "Oh Oh Get on the floor
Around the angles there's a race,
The lines about you, they never rhymed
I bet that we could light up the sky
In and out of my mind
Cuando menos piensas
It must make you sad to know that, nobody cares at all
To play five songs and drink some more and fall asleep
Saying c'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
You say she's just a friend now
A place in the sun
Does any of this ring a bell Eugene
Oh I love you,
Please say it isn't so 
They come running
No one in her family knows
Now I remember earlier in the day
I wanna stop
I never tell my decisions to the ones I adore
I'll stroll down your treelined driveway
Our ways will separate tonight 
So, if we take a walk down, the beach tonight
Will go downtown in his car
We don't need to admit, we were wrong
I've always been chasing rainbows
Life got a little serious
Well are you strange enough
Drew a line between love and hate
When we all come together, this song will play
The weathered concrete stairways
Makes me think that every girl I see
That I know wrong from right
Ain't about the yeah babling, babling
Back the in your eyes
You've got to get the shit they sell
And my eyes want to cry
Still we could not conceive the call
We should be happy, that's what I said from the start
We could made a brandnew start
But never really understood the reasons why
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing
'Cause man I know we never get things right
Can you hold me up
Jig wit it 'cause ship crisp, split it all
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now
In this world
Rejoice because you're trying your best
Just stop for a minute and smile
Magpie comes a calling
As colder nights harden
It's always a good time there
So let's smash the past like a tacky figurine
I miss the typewriter in the basement
Find the words you sing to be
Your feet are dry with the ashes from dead babies,
I'd be dancing like a monkey up a tree
If I don't need anymore why's this bus taking me back again
What's all this talk about love
On which from this city we can flee
So before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
And since then loneliness has been
You never heard it from me but there's a breach in the hull where the truth and the water's too deep to prove
But it's like you told me
That father's sleeping
There's always someone out there cooler than you
And I share her love of wine and cake
And keep your freak to yourself
Two people synchronized
Unbending, neverending tablets of time
Comes back tenfold, fold, fold
Live in a blue house
Thought you would be the one it's 
Dododododo repeat
Nothing in the world could ever make me look as good
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
There's lots of things that I can't find
You're gonna be all right, all right
So to hell with all that rubbish
With a blue sack
Hear ye, hear ye, now anybody could take this stage
Anonymous until the ending,
Drive so deep that we can't see a thing
And love was in the air
But you're always on my mind
No one never really has a clue
Oh, ooh, yeah, no point regretting that it didn't last
The sun will never go down Yeah
When I speak from my heart you laugh like it's a game
Past the sky
Shiver at the sight of you
You the shit
True ring, true ring
Riot on the streets, the touch beneath the sheets
I'll be there right by you
But you said you don't need it
Have faith that when you call my name
Blown by strong wind, but ithere we fear 
Here comes the comeback
Forget about work Start all over again Oh oh oh oh Island of lost souls
But I love you,
That it's best, man
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Deep inside the 'but' is 'please'
I need some clean air in my lungs
Lyin' here, and I've slain my hero, yeah, yeah
You been spreading lies that I was untrue
Too prone to break
He saves the day and the world knows, the sonic boom explodes
Up and start a secret
I'm always looking for some kind of sadness,
If ever you need me
So I've got a  I got a new girl repeat  times
Make a list of things you need, leave it empty
And bothered me, every night
The power of bein'
Well, keep the price tag
Sometimes you find yourself waiting
When I had nobody to call my own,
Under the burden of your heart of stone
'Cause you're so ooh Tootootoo, so ah Tootootoo, so cool Baby, you're so supersupremelybabadioh
You know we've got a good thing going
I'm wide awake, and so are you 
We'll be for a while
Baby, come on, take a ride in my little blue bug
It's like a power
It sounds all hectic, you're having cold feet
He's never done, got OCD, our love is to the Nth degreee
It's a wild, wide, beautiful world
All while hoping things
Empty hands
The sound is ringing clear
People take pictures of each other
The farmer told me I was late
It's wrong to feel the limitations and the
She's got me dancin'
Different parts of the picture highlight the same frame
I remember when I found out about chemistry,
No confiding nor bite it to my rose
There ain't nothing we can't do
But in this world who would
I borrowed your swings and I've heard your hardcore
That's my, that's my dog
Hurt me baby if you like
Everybody needs this
Oh wait for me now Dododo
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
Such a shame I'm to blame all the time
Hopeful days and stormy nights
This place could be just so beautiful
Their skin too thin
In over my heart
You can't picture love that you took from me
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you
Stay a while, we'll wait and see Wait and see 
The only time I ever noticed my heart
Tryin' to make a brother fall in love
The thunder struck, the clouds appeared
And when that old moon gets so big and bright
It was a long, long way from here,
Giving me a heart attack 
What it is your thinking
We shot them in the things we said
Can't feel right today
I wear my blue jeans and fly my blue kite
I close my eyes and see cellar stairways
This one 
Iis harder than I ever feared
Head west, red Lex, TV's all up in the headrest
So I'll stay away
You will learn it can be quite demanding
Long after the days of living are gone
But she says she loves me all the same
Helped me sing a song and
To the center of my heart
I better check my pride because
I fall down and I try to get up
We'll take it to the cabin and we'll show ya what we got
The way bloodsuckers do, the way bloodsuckers do, the way bloodsuckers do
But somehow that always seems to be enough
It's sneaking around out there
Midnight, who was a girl
So many faces
Ooh, you can go your own way
You've been looking at me for days
Absorb the summer sun and think of me
Way back when, we were the latest around
You to get over this
Even if the words are gonna hurt were better off this way
When the company goes public
I remember seeing someone dressed in a suit, looking like a lunatic
We dance on the sidewalks
Just touched down in London town
When you hit the ground just roll
And I'm saying
They happened in these dancehalls
'Cause when you're walking along
I close my eyes and remember
We crossed the borderline at dawn
You've dreamed of thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
When all these people who will lead you down
Rockin' back 'n' forth
In the sound
I will become yours and you will become mine
My bones begin to shiver 'cause I'm aching to deliver
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
The wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
But I'm better at rapping, forever the captain
We got the money, we got money, we got the money now
And you wait your turn to fall
The best thing I can think to do right now is leave it alone
Our page is one and the same 
No jumping, conclusions
Find sweet simplicity
Why don't you come on over Valerie Valerie Valerie Valerie Valerie oh Valerie Valerie Valerie
Let me tell you something, oh
And girl you turn me on
Then it arrives and says, "You're perfect, my love"
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Don't move your mouth, they don't like when you talk
'Cause it's time
With the invite in my hands
Bend your knees, bend your knees
They took it in the first place
And there is music in every sight and every sound
Where are all the men in this town
You'll be fine
The next thing I know you're speaking
Leopard handbag out of sight
While someone does my nails
Yeah, I don't want to be number four
Say a little bit of sweet loving in your day
Don't need them around
Sucking my thumb by the old oak tree
I shoulda put my heart on the table
As the years they all roll by,
Memories that I'd black out if you were mine
We'll fall asleep
Let's forget we're running out of time
Just keep on screaming
I'm "hot like wasabi when" I'm next to your body
That does take me away
No answer at the end
We're on the edge of a beautiful thing", he said
As will you knight in shining armor
Out on the blue sea
I won't weep because I didn't keep
Tell the man I'll take it all
You're so ooh, so ah, so cool
But I don't need to rest, I'm not old and tired, but I've been through fire and I've seen enough,
And waste our time
Stumbled round this old sundial, there these words I read
And soon enough my strength will return
Ooh ooh
Oh please, no you oh please

He said, "Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya"
Fine, Fine, I never want to be alone
But the hurt will never destroy her hope
And elevate myself
But when I get under control, I see you ache for it and all
I will not let you down
And we talk about friends and we talk about records
You said things that weren't very nice
'Cause I loved her long blond hair
And everyone will be
You're on my mind all the time
You said whatever you wanted to as long as you thought it should be true
But some say we're headed for destruction
Goodfellaz baby
We made some plans and let them go 
I'm just tryin' get with ya and pose in the same picture
It's only gonna make you love me more
And dirty hands
All right now
Don't let this fading summer pass you by,
I got dirty clothes
You're the one who saved me,
Should do as were told
My plastic access cards
But we got lovely posters for sale
But we keep inside and our looks stay at bay
You gotta walk tall y'all, y'all, y'all
Somebody push me through the door,
Your friends were pretty cool
I should have muffled my obsession but I was all too pure
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
I've been aiding my fall 
Sound advice, sound advice
Got chicks, all hot chicks
As the morning gathers a rainbow
Will a lady pin me in her hair
Stay a while and wait and see Wait and see 
That I'm a rainbow with you
We all need to feel secure
It's weird how she comes in so strong
All of the things that go to make heaven and this
I saw my neighbor out crying on his front porch
That you never even took the time to see the real me
They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls 
Because wherever we are in this great big world
I wanna give you everything, all of my heart and more
My hair is poofy
And I'll stay up late and I won't even care
And I shed a tear between my legs
And if it hurts me baby you know why
Don't ya know baby
Get the girl in the end I never thought that I could
Kill someone in argument
And can't you see if I could be anything
What are we all looking for
I told my friends not to worry, my wife would know how to fix it
That's my new best friend
What made you think he'd believe all your lies
Step out your house and prepare to be amazed
Who doesn't want a machine so they can go back in time
Someone more than weekly
That makes me feel so good
Oh baby do you want to dance
You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again
Everything has taken a turn
The way you want them to
When I am in the sea
Every day, I'm away from you
To be the new statistic
There's nothing better
And this time I'm really broke
The night's gone
I'll be right there showing
Yeah, I just wanna compliment
But my heart finds a dream in these unseen hues
All we are is too fast for love
I always thought a fish could not be caught that didn't bite
Recall senses sadly
No one bothering you
Eagle feather in her feathered hair the girl got hot
I've got some sugar for your bowl
And I won't let go if you wait for me
You're the type of girl that any guy would die for
Oh Never find a love like this
You're such a mess
We took a trip down in '
Things are getting out of hand, you make an embarrassing retreat
When everyone was in jeans
Tonight I might just loose my way
If he took a look in my brain
I wouldn't change it for the world
When I'm out on the bay
Yeah, you're pushing me, pushing me, I can feel it, yeah
But it's mine to decide when and if I'll be all right
Brighter lights fill the night
I hope he don't forget where he came from
Just a little bit higher, then I come back down
always be the wind from your wings
For ever having said goodbye
Look what you done
So they say
It's gonna be my beautiful day
And I deal with ho's that pose in Maybeline
Oh rejoice, his eyes are big X's
Estas semanas sin verte
It's been a long time since
I've always been in love with
We are the tide, and none of us stay, ah
You declined so sweetly and commented on my jacket
You speak kind
I say that I don't have the strength 
From her pining after furniture
Drinkin' yager all day
Old men with kazoos and beating drums 
Still I burn this earthen fire 
Oh baby
I'm full of funky fever
You've got it all worked out with so little time
This old world, well, it was mine to take
I am a blue blood
Every day's so caffeinated
Let's get, backwards
Nights like these when you laugh until you cry And all the songs I'm singing
And the rest was history
And I say
So sit real still, they've got to size you up
And that's important because I need to travel
You haven't mentioned me yet
Let's begin, bring this BS to an end
It's time to look to the future
Stand tall, that's right, be proud'a yourself,
Of the man in the moon
But after this day
The weeds are green, the sky is shining
And now little rich girl
And I was amazed by the things I learned,
This song is not a gospel song
And I'm up, down, I'm spinning around
To the place that I can always call my own
Singing that's my dog that's my dog
Just like it hasn't been three years
They keep calling
That's when I need you two to help me believe
And the beat that she throw at me
I got it in the mail one morning 
And walked out on a piece of paper
We unlock the mystery
Tell me, are you gonna cry all night
I'm happy knowing that you are mine
I'll be long gone 
Ooh they won't come knocking at all
In a way I'm relieved
Oh, they're such pretty things
She said you musta like him 'cause he's, oh, so nice
Go break their hearts
In the middle of the night
Ain't no way you're walking out
And I'm thinkin' about my boys Joelly chic and Freshly Sean
When that old guy gave us all those drinks for free
And we're bogged down in a delta of glee
And I still believe
Sippin' DP to the TV, look greedy
Keep your fingers off my money
Whoa whoa for the wings of a dove x
Well sometimes I go out by myself
Hey You I moved to the side
'Cause, since I've come on home,
Living next door to challenge
Make your own kind music
So I could beg you baby please don't go
So we gon' keep everyone moving their feet
You and I are mortal, but rock and roll will never die
It might save time if I meet you there
If this is how I feel
Thoughts of love
You're okay in your secret place
Blame it on the boogie, woo
And we might break up
If things go right, we're meant to be 
When we went walking through the pines
I still don't believe in myself, 
If you really love me 
Its all right in the sunny time with the Black Eyed Peas,
Stand back, son, and let a man work
Another scene that we're creating,
I walk through
And we'd sneak into a carpark
'Cause now today is your day
It's the way you swell, slow
For something good, for something great
Gonna listen to some rock 'n' roll
But I keep coming back for more
Lookin' at my scars
Jesus wrote a blank check, all right
Oh, show me your love
And my mother always made me eat broccoli
Come on baby girl, let me see those legs
The dance floor was crowded, the bathrooms were worse
Salem is home
I visit your city and I've slept on your floors
Lost on my own lonely mile
But now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on
Oh rejoice, his hands perform hexes
Walkin' that walk, talk that slick talk
Will you be my American boy, American boy
And a rocket to depart in
And when I'm with her she talks about you, the things that you say, the things that you do
But everything goes in and it stings,
But there's no need for you now
I'd rather wait for you
Well, I had been broke down from my enemies
A don't stop stop your dreamin'
Sing your own special song
Why don't I just fall in love with you
Won't you come on over
And your hips are a note
I hope he's right in the head
I would hitch a cable car
Social Security Number please
You told me now and then
You're not holding yourself in your arms tonight
Or any other random spirit lover busted, I have lusted after you
Your mama told you to be discreet
Suspended in the air
I know that there were better days, but to see the light and to feel the rays
Feeling all alone without a friend you know you feel like dying
I only believe in your blue smile, 
I didn't think much about it 
I'm surprised at how hot honeycolored and hungry she looks
We banged on blue drums and call it blue grass
How can I say
We hold them in our hearts
Make a nigga scream and shout, shout
You will feel better
So someone else can treat you wrong
Sacrifice it all and maybe say
That anyone here will be thinking in modern ways
Grab that beat, by the balls,
You're Bruce Lee with the way that you move
Ooheee baby, I'm gonna show you a good time babe
We do battle in our bedrooms
Tin roof sounds alarming
The big big bang, the reason I'm alive
Inside us all, it makes me cry
All these games you play you're messin' with my head
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
Swear to me you won't be gone
You got soul
Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light
So I threw it out a fishing line
How many licks, how many licks 'til you get to the center of my
Parting with a childhood best friend
As she slides towards me smooth as a snake
Can't you see if I could be anything
She had the gun in her mouth
Message to the world, can you feel the heat is rising 
He's an underdog he's coming out on top and
I think about all of the things I learned,
I've got some loving for your soul
Everything is beautiful here 
Little players comin' 'round
There will never be a time when we have to say goodbye
Can we just talk about this, please
'Cause I don't want to keep acting this way
Got to hold on tight
If I cry to set the mood oh please could you cry too
To be true blue
You're needing someone older
Yeah, let's just get married
But then cracks peel back and hell bends the room
Bringin' us to life
And she's already workin' on my brain
And who said life was easy and who said a man was fair
But hear it this way hear it this way
And we found out that the two things we put together
She said it's okay that they
You're extraordinary, baby
Stand beside me
It was the moon that stole my slumber
I am so happy, knowing you are the one
Do the shackles underneath your bed
To be the freak that god made me
Work myself frantic to the moon and back
Mean nothing more than "meow" to an animal
I don't wanna stare at stacks of paper all the while while the world goes by
But before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
In only a moment you'll say goodbye
Anyway, I'm off track gotta stop that
It's real love dripping from my heart
Back to the years and all of those tears
But when I got up in the place there were smiles all up and down 
It's still fat and easy up on bankers hill
Tradin' out the weather for a clever lyric written by an Ikea light
and no matter what they say 
And in my head I paint a picture
I think I might I go on and on forever
It's a suicide, waiting, yo no se
"And I don't want to get obvious
You'll be my American boy, American boy
Justa live a little least of your life
What do you know about the song and the dance in your mind
The first thing I did when I got up the nerve
With hard working security guards
On the slow boat to Lan Tao, the misty seas
We all wanna be big big stars
"She's looking at you I don't think so She's looking at me"
And still, if I yell at the top of my lungs
I'll put on a brand new shirt
Afternoon delight
Next stop, right around the corner from your mom and 'em
Oh no I never meant to be a pest to anyone this time
In the sun in the rain
I was the only one left at the right time
I felt you footstep silent but heavy, you followed me onto the shuttle
Honey in my tea
War, war is explosive
I get a feeling, you get a feeling we got a feeling
A jealous Frankie Valli says "Dawn, I want you back"
You'll be pulling out your hair
In the lonely hour
"Close your eyes now, kid"
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
To scream
And bride white
I did what I had to
Everybody here is outta sight
You are perfect just the way that you are
Let me show you, girl,
My teammate right beside me
Born to a world where it is a fight just to fit in
No one in this fair new world can talk us through this situation
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden
Yeah we make great friends but it just isn't the same
And I'm sittin' there on the porch
Oh rejoice, his arms are burning witches
Buy the E, get a key, to the Lex to hold
And you've left me alone
Always tried to keep
And now they see we rollin',
"I want you to see when the sun goes up"
I'm rolling, I'm rolling
Honey lookin' perfect
They don't bark and they don't bite
Some have given up and died
I call out the numbers, the rumble of collected thunder today
A week in the fog
The big big bang
Of sleigh rides in seasons
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it, come back to me
You are invited by anyone to do anything 
But I'm still waiting for next week's chemical blast
To the top of the mountain
That's the only time I ever noticed my heart before
And then you run to the right it seems there's no hope in sight
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too
All anyone can ever want is a copilot
Still I wallow in the mire
Why did he run, run away from me
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
My father had a dozen wives
I understand I wasn't part of the plan
When I had you to myself
And I love it that way
It's just another one of those, just another one of those
'Cause I loved you from the very first day
So far away from everyone
You will see my delight
Have a sniff, it smells like a cigarette
I'm all right y'all, all right y'all
You are invited for all time 
What do you see when you dream about it
Nothing in my forgotten years
Of the time when they mattered to someone
I think it's really gonna happen this time,
We're running out if time, two wrongs can make it right
When you're walking along
Just living on dreams
Not a stream of pretty lies
She turned and she gave the evil eye
All the things that we used to do
Oh, 'cause there's always someone cooler than you
Unless it keeps me from being true blue
So for the rest of my life
Your eyes permanent on mine
Calling out my name This table is set for one
The world is born
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
Something makes you think that you're some kinda winner
Nobody cares at all
Need a magic ball to see her in the morning
Burgh representative I need y'all behind me
I'm under attack again my dear
When there are ghosts in my coat
Or float upon the air the way that you might
Wish it didn't faze me
A gente topa tudo
Yeah, well you know gray is my favorite color
The eternal hell of boredom in heaven
No, I couldn't cut a check with a blade
Come ye, come ye, to soulless corporate circus tops 
I'll tip my cap to the world even though I don't wear one
So starting today things are gonna be all right
Oh yeah
Baby you got me sick
Oh strawberry avalanche, please crash over me
Well how can I guess by the subject of the best predicate that's left unsaid when the matter is too delicate
An I'm a midnight toker
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
And I can hear the memory in my ears
All of these dreams I don't recognize
They never care at all
"Makes you look like a lumberjack
The sort which leads you up the streets of sin
When you're walking round
It got you this far
Sea green, see blue
When we met I thought money was everything
Sailin' all the seas we've never seen before
That I really wanted to be someone
But you know there will always be some oddball singing
Woahwoah, woahwoah the girl got hot
I don't care how
I know an Ital Rasta man
To be the one that I believe
Let the whole world know you're out there
Feat Carina Andersson
It's a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
And I look stupid
Going to put us together with glue or an elastic band
My little bird flew away from me
My mom would say "I hope some day you get paid for being Kimya Dawson"
Walking on water
Where feelings not reasons
How you end up here
Fast revolving 'round our feet
I'm using my right brain and I'm praying that we don't crash
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
I've got my Scrabble game, food on my plate, good friends and family
He had a fear of being naked, but you're any other man in another man's clothes
This is the life I'm gonna live to the end
You rattle my bones
Lyin' on the bed while I'm at the piano
Is not to wake up till PM
And I don't wanna see it end
But you got nothing to fear
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
Money in my pocket
Sitting here watching other people live
Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
Thought you were being so kind by keeping your mouth sealed shut
You just can't let them pull that cloth over your eyes
I miss winter just because I miss when I knew you best
We'll last until the end
Your search for the meanin'
You feel it coming on
I got to say California
More than any other girl yeayeah
Ladies and gentlemen
But later that week it was Friday once again
To the gods in the sky
My mouth on your neck
I feel better off when we stayed
Find a one who could turn you on
But there's one thing that you missed
When we get delayed can we cast a line towards anyone dismayed
You said our love would be
Choosing one the rhythm war
Ooh la la, that's what you are
I hang on every word you say, yeah
And everything's fine, everything's beautiful, everything's great
You're still king
I got a pet hedgehog
Who's got the crack
Don't you misfire fill me up
And I'm branding each day
You had a little game on ya
Underneath a cloudless sun
Hey handsome, we got it good
Love's rating in the sky
And all the parents
Right here, you got me where you want me
'Cause all the lazy boy could do was RUN, then I knew for sure
He clutches the wine and tips it in cyonide
Thing's like a bluebird, until the wind dies
Got a stellar reputation girl be who I am
Hesitant to tell the real reason, the Nobel PEACE Prize is givenYeah
You've wasted every moment
Baby, you'll be on my mind
Reasons to live in the moment
Oh baby, yeah, yeah
This is screaming, this is screaming
Your true love has drunk herself into not being able to pay her rent
I can't stand dumb love songs
You can gamble everything for love if you're free
What a rash and inconsistent faith you had
I woke this morning shackled and drawn
A baby's born
And now try to make you not regret anything
Do you wanna get away Get in the car we can leave today
When you say I love you, I say rave on
So the doc came with his black bag
The night closes in
But hell for the company
Because you thought that you could outrun sorrow
I feel the push and pull,
From higher points than sunrise
Market crash, out of cash, we're in the poor house
You are so needed if you really want to go 
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
It's gonna be alright
Do you want it to be outside in the sunshine
Then I could barely carry your weight
That I come and I go
I'm tired of waiting here for him
The walls line the bullet holes
It's like tonight I'm really not me at all
To see someone like you
So just remember, folks, we not just saving lives, we're saving souls
They're just humans with wives and children
In a crowd you raise the tempo in the disco as you make this place your own
The water and not descend
Why did you try at the choice
But we enjoy what we like which is not always right
Their brains are like porcupines
To be the one
So you better get a charge 'til I see you again
Like Samsung gotta shoot around the back alley oop and one
From cradles to sleepless nights
I've got a collar full of chemistry from your company
Over cliffs we will swim ahead
Unfolding, enveloping missiles of soul
My my, pie in the sky
Well I can't wait to tell you all about her, all about my new girl
It's already gone
But I awake and I see the streets are ice cream 
But I would love you to take my time
Bumping into backpackers and
But you, you look swell
And get back to the high street, I need somethin' to eat
Raindrops splash rainbows
The time is coming near
That's lost its feeling of so afraid 
And while in the meantime roaches used to climb my door
Know they're right, and have done it right, could I get to be like that
That coulda took me right back home to you
I'd just been fired and her first offer had arrived
Oh, the memories come astreamin'
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah x
Where I felt the stars explode around me
Just remember to sing along, yeah you better start singing along
I love Love
And war is in our hearts,
Even if the words are probably gonna hurt
I can see, hearts carved on a tree
But to my defiance the music fades
I'm big in every way I'm running as fast as I can
I know you don't want it this way
Growl and hum say hmmm
It's like the wise man said,
You're never gonna help yourself
I hold on tight and reminisce
Please say it is so 
Whether willing witness waits at my mind
So many ways in which to reach for the sky
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth
And you drop down to the tube that takes you right to level eight
Got your shades on your eyes
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
Fall in love and kiss and smile from every girl walking by
It's the oddest feeling since you're gone
Truth told, truth told
Work out just fine
Just don't say it will be all right
And we all fall down, there's not enough hours in a day
If I never stand at another corner trying hard to be a father
Let's all have a real good time together
But now we can see, now we do as we please
But now your twentythree and it's all gone now
Where I can kick it with friends through the night
Where the clouds take their places for you
Sem lenco, sem documento
And let me look at love and I feel better
Take me baby up to higher elevation
Trapped in myself
It's the slacker lifestyle
Cause, everyday there's a war to fight
Yeah the dark epoch is over I've found my efeblum
I got the, oh
I wrote you in this song woo woh
So far down, or maybe you were thinking about jumping
If you're caught up in the gales on the junk boat seas
But just like them dogs, well those guns just get bigger
Blame it on the boogie, ow
Gonna drive my car to the sea
Who shot a look so virulent it pierced me like a hook
Yet you see some hope in me
Oh, you're so lovely
Checked out of my room, hit the ATM
Yes, I just wanna compliment your soul
It's what we are
But when the sun goes down you can't realize
I drove into Seattle rain, fell in love, then missed the train
But this won't work as well as the way it once did
Their moonlit delights
I was down on my knees
I lock the door and check my pockets
Play that rock and roll for me
I'm tired of believing in the things that go on here
You're aloft in the airway
All right, fair enough
We're staring at all these lights
KKK kicken' down your front door
You taste like sunlight
I know I'm kind of distant
In a way we are an army
Before the world catches up
You're running through my mind and it makes me cccrazy cracracrazy
When I noticed you yeah, you, yeah
Sunshine almost always makes me high
But that's one thing you've already got
And I will make it someday
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside
'It's the rhythm you forgot'
Tell me, are you feeling lost, have you crossed
The weatherman says it's wet and cloudy
It's an act, I think she's just pretending, it's an act, I think, she's just pretending
All I can say is I can't fake it
I'm sittin' here on the back porch just eatin' chocolate pudding
Hush my darling, don't fear my darling
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
I just show up like a Biblebreather outside the door
You don't pay no mind
There's something about you
With some two string, one string, no string guitars Hey, Chris, wanna jam
Oh, all night long boogie
Then I met some ladies from Marin
I'll say just fine
And we'd grow old
Heyla, heyla, my boyfriend's back
There are worse ways for a guy to spend his time
If you try to stop this, you're just too late
Imprisoning me
Aw yeah, all right, feel good tonight
I'm changing my next flight to Paris
With the snow set deep
About one more war and one more fight
Can we keep it together
Lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
Time's not on our side
I will let you down
I wanna see you drop down on your knees
And then you take it away
And there goes my hero, he's a underdog
Not the words that he says or the band
I'll be your cryin' shoulder
If things go right, they'll have to agree
But I am your man
Now that the city's awake, my heart aches
For the time being
I got hot head, hot eyes, hot ticks, hot mouth 
Would you be my American boy, American boy
Before I get flattened away
Memories are lost and found
It's chic transportation to new destination 
Late at night I dropped in hate
It was a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
Now the time has come and yeah the show it must stay strong
Gonna gamble everything for love
The telegram said are you gonna call our way home
You could be mine
You down, right dead in the eye
I thought about my friends
Drop it from the rooftop what's gon' break my fall
She know where you are
I found Ive come in a dream again
So come on and face it
You're giving me a heart attack
He was a man of many nations, with revelations, oh revelations
Standing alone
Movement of my desires lost like a stone
Drive so deep where we can't see a thing
And if I could have a door knock
Then you can't handle the wax
There ain't no man can replace
Was that the best part of your life
'On the attack now on the attack'
Like Don Corleone
One, two, three, let's go
And I can't hear one single word they said
The moment a million chances may all collide
As the glow from the street light bled
Together we'd be fine, fine
Let's live in the moment just this time, could we
I said hello, Eugene
Don't get up 
Just to be loved
When you came I woke from many sleeps
You've been away for so long oh
Said that those who rush will fall
So many thangz that I want to try
So I say
Some cops came by so we hid behind a tree
Don't you know honey that love's a game
I wish you were here, 'cause I feel alone
There doesn't have to be a reason
We gathered arms and fired shells
Oh yes, you are
I got to keep I heights
Tell me, do you lose your way each day
That I wasted on you by the crowd
Where silver never gets golder,
There's something going on that's not quite right
So maybe later today I'll know
See the paddle go up and the paddle go down
Put your finger in the handgun
Then your dad came out and chased me down the street
Broke every rule from the start
One day finds the perfect boy
Whippin' Piccadilly tonight, and it all falls down
And I won't even let you home
I said hello
Found peace of mind in playing on your fears
Though we go on our separate ways,
Every song was right
So concerned with friends and your popularity
Well, I just wanna compliment your soul
Che cosa vuoi tentare Che cosa inventare
I had a hole in the middle where the lightning went through
She sat around forlorn
Irreplaceable but in the end,
From a distance, the world looks blue and green
Sweet Pacific scenes through,
'Cause he's kinda big and he's awful strong
For all my reckless nights
She's calling out
How d'you do Comment allezvous 
I think it's time for me to go heyayayaay
With a love so sweet in so many ways
It blooms to spread love and joy faith and hope to people forlorn
Oh if you were mine
Yeah, but I can hear a knock on the door
And then the fog it slips right in
They tried to break me down
And everything is askew
Every time I do 
Standing in your doorway where we use to kiss
Thought I could make up your mind you had a decision locked up so tight 
And if you really love me
Said you're making fun of me 'cause I'm young and got no money
And nothing now can ever be taken away from you
My debut comes today and my feelings have all run away
So tonight let's be honest
For the next three minutes please
That I pretend
You're Mike Jordan, you're my superstar
Any other girl I'd be long gone
Tony Orlando has been postponed
Said take your water to the Leprechaun man
We've got a life that hasn't even began
Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane
I guess I'm quite controlling
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
And the truth comes second
But your move that catches my eye
That I love you,
From the Sky Bar to the Standard, nothing took
And I can hear the taxi calling, telling me we haven't left yet
It's nights like these when you know that your alive I feel like I've been living
A mouth said, "Not a sound at all"
This world alone this world alone
And I hope his guardian angel puts a gun in his hand
And when I find myself getting to close in the situation
Sometimes the rain goes and a rainbow's all that's left
And that's just a thing that takes time
Blame it on yourself sunshine
Goodnight
a ray of sunlight 
See if I have enough cash to take a taxi home
Staring at this yellowhaired girl
You're the only one that knows me,
I wanna see your hand waving "Farewell"
Their faces are green and they don't know what they've done
And if I win or lose, nevermind
In Babylon on the boulevard of broken dreams, my will power at the lowest ebb
We love it and we leave it and we watch it burn
What do you need
It was clear there was no one else around
What can I say, we just live too far away 
Oh rejoice, you burned your whole beard off
Old man on the back porch
We got an energy
Picture shows, second balcony, was the place we'd meet,
I think this could go on and on forever
To keep our feelings strong 
Combustible, and I can't wait to finally explode
Everybody break it
But I'm an old man on the back porch
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
A bass player I know swum my way
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
I can take most anything
Some have turned to dust inside
Yeah, we see that fire
The things we go through just to work it out
That used to hold your clothes
It's so strong that nothing can ever break it
Ring all the bells sing and tell the people everywhere that the flower has come
I'm gonna turn my back to everything I know
How long it's been there, two years, I bet
Oh, the days you came around
As the descent began I got the distinct impression
Everybody is dancin' in the moonlight
Lost in the things that you do
Pluggin' in their instruments feelin' good about themselves
Is still resounding, but what can I do
Both of them side by side so determined
Fashion magazines line the walls now
I know it's got me reelin'
I need a little faith
Tell them put the money in my hand right now yes
But there is nothing like someone new
I wish they were Golden Gated
Einmal um die Welt fahren
If it were up to me, yeah yeah
I close my eyes at night
Off the wall, I wanna say,
With the pilgrims, the mountains, the high trapeze
All that wine was tight
For the life of Riley
You know you make me feel so good
Give as good as you get
I was always thinking
Hold me up, Yeah
Don't stop talkin' to me please
If I look back when I begin to leave
So wake up like an early birdie
When you and I both know this is the end 
Would he say he's in LOVE
Slip away and out of sight, feel the magnet of a night
Acting so damn mysterious
I need to feel my soul come alive
I meant the letters to be bolder, bolder,
Now that you're away I'm out there without you
And I'm gonna be ready this time ready this time
Nobody can tell you
I'm all right y'all, I'm all
Ooh la la, love the way that you are
I'd make a wish for sunshine for all the while
Surely we're here in mind
Having an argument with myself down Victoria Street
I be riding in my car with the music all the way up
So I'll try to postpone my existence
Your back's against the wall
I'll be happy, right
It was the tender mending of this slender gown that brought me bending to the ground
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
You're my super, superstar
Ah, in the first place
Just put to bed and stand beside me
What can I say
He kicked up the river with a flick of his wrist
Live my life in dignity
We're all children of
You son of a bitch
Maybe I could fall
I won't leave any doubt or stone unturned
Taking pictures of everyone
Please don't misfire
But baby I'm fine because maybe you're mine
Minutes run into hours, hours run into days
Yeah, I feel that good
Here comes Superman, from neverneverland
Where I felt the stars explode
Don't slip away yo
Every step I take
Me parecieron anos
And you're alone on the pier
Life was always back and forth and we were idling or making useless ruckus
You're a hot track, you're my super duper star
Buy and sell, may as well invest in the weather
Fall down the stairs
Yeah don't mess, 'cause I know you gon' lie
When I come home, home, home
Is a dreamy melody
And he said "Inside of them"
So take my hand
Well it's all coming back around
And she'll smile for you She'll smile for you
Gib mir nur deine Hand, ich kauf dir morgen die Welt
All the things that I should be
Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight
I'll take a mile if you let me
When your healing powers kick in
This is a song that came upon me
Today feels like no other
It looks like you might fall
And can you keep sleeping metaphysical girl
And then I sung
In a different time, in a different city
When was the last time you smoked a cigarette
Pulled my foot from my mouth answered back to things I've said
Girl come with me, it's plain to see
I can't stop, I don't know why
Every time, so baby
Our eyes meet all the time
I don't care, all I want is your lovin'
One day I'm gonna get mine too
Hoping that I step on out
Someone say I'm not making mistakes and please don't be fake
My heart plays a rhythm in my head
It's a suicide, waiting, donde estas
It's always a hit or miss
The girl got hot
I've been watching you all night
And I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
They are waiting, waiting
I'm afraid of growing old
Damn, I wish I was, so I could fall in love with you
Shoot that sky 'til the moon explode
I'll be right there 
As the sky fade to black
She smiles
The way that you let your hair down
Or if I'm just missin' the sun
For the rest of my days
I'm just a penny on the train track
I hate to love you
Then the news would not be telling me
The thing I finally found with these other girls in town
She could be sweet sixteen, bustin' out at the seams
Tag als ob ich morgen tot ware
Mr Jones and me staring at the video
I hope for you to get through this rain
I said "It used to be my grandgrandfather's
Was my whole life just a lie
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
Well come on, well come on, hon' get up and dance with me yeah
It's the way you smile, baby
Can you still hear my voice
The girl got hot
Would this song live on forever
Still I couldn't get arrested,
This song is not a long song
Thinkin' of you's workin' up a' appetite
From where you laid me out flat one look I was done
For a small town girl like me
She's grinning, singing, spinning me round and round
Channel like a lion, yes
Now she sings along, when you play guitar
There's a ghost in your old bedroom
Please somebody get me out of this hole
It hurts me deep inside and
Fights away all that decay
Or the way you find it
I need you to need me
If you really love me
And he saves the day and the world knows So watch his head explode
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
We've got an energy, energy, energy
Through our window
This rocky road and this steering wheel
'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home
The moshpit started, and then the crowd parted
At least her teeth are clean
Boogie's got me in a super trance
He said g'day
Making love to only you, so
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
Ciao adios, I'm done
Like walking down ChampsElysees
But the sheets are still dull, been this way for so long, yes I know
It's not as if I'm being sent off to war
I've sworn a million times
Her face gets big, her face gets small
I am wasted but I'm ready
We get it on most every night
She doesn't have the answer yet
And the sunshine
Well we go back so far,
We like loving, yeah, and the wine we share
When you come back down
Middle of the day
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
Boy what I'm feeling never feel it about another
Of your Saturdays
I said "What's up with this weather"
This is screaming "photo op"
  Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
We were talking together
Hold me up
Picking pennies off the floor with my cold hands
Well no more, well no more blue days for you my dear
And everybody's packin' up their station wagons
All the movies were blue
He was a bore, a true chore and I still wonder why I ever wanted
Thinkin 'bout you's working up my appetite
You're gonna throw'em, aren't you
My boyfriend and the summer's end is here again
I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum
And you will slide on the back seat of my bike
When it rains and pours and then it runs out
Protection until time
Cause the poor wretch died with a book on her knee
How you got there, so just blow your mind
Spirits drifting in the night
You breathe in life forever
Sit back, put your feet up and relax
And all the kids now
If you see me hit the ground
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying
And did you have to pay the fine
I rolled the dice, and lost them all
But someone picked you from the bunch
Hey mister, we gone and done it
The midnight fell, we felt the measure fall
Your skin got slicker
You don't talk of dreams
To have a good time
So we split apart at last
When music made us all unite
And I'm sorry that you lost that girl
It's engraved into this song
Another day
What matters is the love that you give
Said hold me up, Oh
We're not in trouble anymore anyway
If you're rock 'n' roll, disco, heavy metal angel
And she looked at me
We'd like to make it right some which it remain tame
See the paddle go up and the paddle go down
Bringing me to life
This water that I must give her, can I get some
And then drive that train
I called you and screamed
I might just get up and dance
When you get all dressed up
I do what work for me, you do what work for you
How you messed me up, I'm better off now
With the man that I am but understand if I don't keep going
It's rock 'n' roll
Who have passed the test just like all the rest,
I promise you I will bring you home
We're on fire now We're on fire
Staring at their shoelaces
Spent a long long time pretending
Good evening shuttle bus
Just give me six strings and a hashtag
All the seasons where you dye your hair
And I don't want to see it end
But don't keep up this old line
Lying smiling in the dark
Something never dreamed in all the science books the biggest light switch gets turned on yeah yeah
Funky squaredance, funky squaredance, funky squaredance
Thanks for asking now I'm fine
There was this girl she looked so fine
And everything starts today
Wearin' my heart between my legs
We got the drinks by the dozen and mo' bottles coming but
How I love
The city screams
Whoa whoa yeah yeah yeah
And they said,
If you never go away
Can you hear the beat of my heart
It don't matter what you find
You and your ways capture what I've misplaced
But it's harder just to be who you are
And my friends said
"No luxuries No no Amenities Too dull Your senses Oh oh Only primitive Hey hey Really get away Island of Lost Souls"
Was say, "Hey baby, what's up" What up
Loveydovey, doveylovey, dovey all the time
You know today I just woke up and I said you know instead of waitin' on a good day waitin' around through up's and down's waitin on something to happen I just say
So here's your life
For the first time
Use a blood stained sword and a snowwhite horse, please
We're all one big band across this land and we should sing in tune
There's still more to come
You gotta gamble everything for love
Em caras de presidentes
Forget modern nature, this is how it's meant to be
My boyfriend's back now
The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary
And I watch you fly around the world
Other ways, other ways
I got on a boat on a hot sunny day
And I will tie your hand to the highest mast
Look at me with starry eyes
"History repeats itself twice," said Marx
A week in the forest
Don't come near, don't make a sound
Just because we could
I trace my footsteps to the place of my birth
Watching my life go by
Yeah, they shine like stars under the ground,
Come ye, come ye, to toilet circuit touring stops
But I'm feeling so uptight
And though the names will get changed to protect the innocent
Know I'm right and do it right, could I get to be like that
Like, "I don't care about the songs you sing"
'Cause it's not my place to choose
Sitting around
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna elevate myself
'Cause I jump back, crash, I crawl
And although they still exist,
Or the way you find it 
'Cause I don't want to keep acting this way
And I hold you to the light to see
Did knock me off my feet
And right then I knew what was what
Is stay till early in the morning
I'm sittin' on the back porch kickin' my legs back rockin' in my rockin' chair, just sittin' there
Ooo, That's alright
And I won't keep it up even though I would love to
I can sleep in your dreams 
That makes me fly
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight Everybody
Girl all I need is for you
I just want to stop stop just to thank you baby
Your all night noise
Because I'm ready now 
And if you really love me 
It made me feel so good
But for the time being, bump your head to the beat
This is life in color
Keep saying that it doesn't mean much
But things started to slide and thinking in retrospect
When the crew would call a shakedown
When the sale comes first
'Two chord cool in the head,' she sings
I let her slip away
Though I got more hooks than Madonna got looks
"Look at Twisterella, she hasn't got a fella"
When the boy gets that look in his eye
No need for headphones
That's what I love about you babe
They've gone black and white
I've got a nine to five
Do you want to break my heart
When I am thirtyfour just talkin' 'bout high school years
'Til I noticed you, yeah, I noticed you, yeah
About all that warfare endlessly and
Warm panda cola by the mountain the in the sun
Are we not trying or are we trying to hard
The love go on and on
If you're so sure about this Laurel Kismet Hardy thing
Millions, the only thing we in a hurry to make
'Cause what you bring
Eugene oh yeah
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Oh, what is it your thinking
I get the feeling they got you believing
Could just come apart in my hands
The girls were kinda flirting with the setting sun
'Cause, Since I've come on home,
The minute hand moves faster than you think it does
And I know this is not the way it should be
That's coming out on top
Otherwise, we're just going backward
But I'll wait outside
I dream you paint the stars against the twilight
Too many noises
They judge, but when they spoke said, "Not at all"
Do you believe like I believe Do you believe in magic
You know there ain't nobody else
Porque uno y uno no siempre son dos
That you don't see the hands upheld to catch you
Like we could die
Let me hear you say
It doesn't matter that they say we'll never make it
I been stop
We bounced a blue ball
Say, little bit by little bit, someday
Oh my god, this is who I've been
Our enemies lay dead on the ground and still we kick, hey
He was a man of many nations, had a hundred souls and a hundred to go
Every moment on her feet is torture
I'll be there forever
When we are younger oh, our hearts are so much bolder
Is one long, sleepless night
Estelle once said to me, "Cool down, down
I've been trapped by love
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
And when I ring you up
But there's always someone cooler than you
But here I am with eight more lives
What we'll do it wait forever
And I believe in something again
We are what we're supposed to be
Success which was survival gone too far
Said now you're dead and gone and I've got a new thing going
Something in his deep brown eyes has me singing
Honey pie, don't 'cha cry, we're still together
They're into something that is too big to be
Swim out far 'cause I believe
Never took a scene check
Ciao adios, I'm done you get on with your life, I'll get on with my life
And I've missed your ginger hair
This magic music grooves me
So I could fall in love with you
Way back then
Flowers in my hair
One on one
I'm all right y'all, all right y'all I'm all right
Woke up on the right side of the bed
Wetting rags in gasoline
Scream my name just one more time
This has of course nothing to do with anything
Credit card number please
I wanna be a lion
Let's cross the river now
That I learned to break dance in and thought I was good
Let's get lucky, come on, go all the way
I can walk and I can need
Hold me up with pride
We're on the edge of a beautiful thing", she said
To go it alone
We declared a national holiday
You better hide your feelings
They will try and tear you apart
For what it's worth, darling dear,
You got some things to resolve
That's why I'm here today
Island of lost so oh oh oh oh Iya iya Island of lost souls Forget about work
This gone on for way too long
See I know you like being round chicks
Little arms, little arms
And I'm slurpin' everything through a straw
We could take a thousand walks
But now it's time to get some better days better days
I guess the thing I'm trying to tell you
All the words come out my broken jaw
And I look across the water
Because that's just ridiculously odd
And I chill the way you met me
Dreams come bouncing in your head
And to fall down from any height
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
What I know your thinking anyway
Why don't you come right out and say it what it is your thinking
On a sunshine bus
You go straight to the top you're not scared of getting squashed
If she's your only then why are you lonely
Don't forget, don't forget about me
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
Move in a little closer, let me tell you about
Everybody's gotta get their kicks somewhere
No more bad times
If you starwipe all your past away
And everyone fell right to their knees and then,
You're like Caesar stepping on to the throne
That's right That's how it should be
Beginnin beginnin beginning beginnin yeah
But let me draw attention to a exhibit B
I'll memorize everything you do to me,
And our attributes are the same
Down on Main Street They're singing their songs tonight
And it gets so old just saying, "We'll keep trying"
My greet will cure your great soul
Your touch on my check
It's hard to be a garbage man
Everything's gonna be all right now, everything's gonna be all right
Gonna find our love today
Staring out of classroom windows
I feel a burning in my eyes
Went back to places that I knew
You're Abe Lincoln 'cause you fight for what's right
You wanna see the smile on my face
All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful
Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness is gone
Look, two lovers covered in covers, uh huh
You know it's clear that tonight we belong in this place
Nothing stays the same
In the womb of winter, summer seems a myth
If you really want hell, hell
Something so small
Did they all run off when they knew
So c'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
Cause it won't be the same next summer
I got nothing to fear
And said fondling the dead is a felony
But yours and that boogie good times
After driving you home once
I had a blue dream
And it's hopeless, hoping to be found
And she'll spend her life
They go on and on she sees but I say
You walked by in those tight ass jeans,
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
If ever they get ambushed or pursued
I guess my friends were right
I'm going past, I'm going past, I'm going past the next two lights
So many ways to walk upon the earth
Cause the tarmac was melting and the people seemed to sway
"On the roof" he says
Fur soft as fur
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
Leave it while it still smolders,
Yes, to get the answer
Oh Lord, I think I heard you
My black dress
What is the secret to your song'
Ain't nobody's fault moonlight
You're my hero in a mythical dream
What matters most Everything
Don't want to die
If you let me baby
Stuck in the underground
She said, "You're smooth
If I never need again I'll find that sleep again,
Would you be my love, my love would you be mine
I can't go losing my mind
I'm curious I need to see
And maybe, if the music is right
You're just about to fall
Said catch your reel and then catch mine
All you gotta do is trust me
Second seat, go Dutch treat, you were sweet
Clowne towne a single beauty
Even though I'm attached to you physically
It's just the way that he sings
Since the apple wasn't there, yeah
Just a distant memory
From the fine, fine girl with nothing but good intentions
Is now one
You hold me down and up
Spattered with plasma on a bus in Indiana
Could believe for all the world
Don't see the sense in wasting time
Do I turn around, do I turn my eye to the sun
And you will slide on the back of my bike
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
EEverybody wants to pass as cats
'Cause back in school, man that gets cruel
Time will bring them back I bet
Reality ruined my life
Can you take me back to that place where stars glow
The sound, it found, the ground, and it hid it for free
The hateful, hateful tough little boys
I need you, why can't you come over
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
You will feel whole
Circuit flights bend the lights when I am spent
And the two chord cool still grooves
All the guys tried to take me,
Sometimes I feel so isolated
So keep breathing
Reading between the lines, like writing on the wall
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my French clothes
It's a supernatural delight
Who's gonna stop me on the road to success
So for a while I conducted experiments,
I'm onto you, yeah you
We gotta let it out, let it out, let it
And I have seen worlds filled with wonder
That move their lips whenever you're around
Stop
In the shadows, I will listen to their every movement
Gotta do the night work
That reminds me less of youth
How can one sit back and dream it
The light is green our break is through
Outwit them with our brains
If I died tomorrow would this song live on forever
There are worse things in this world
We'll spend some time together
Had to pawn all your nice clothes
And he's mean talking beanstalking icey man
And the stormy nights
I need you here tonight
Sneakers looking fresh to death, I'm loving those shell toes
And I don't get around how you get around
The feeling alive
Alright, yeah
Moonlight
From the fine, fine women with nothing but good intentions
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
And the eagle takes to flight
I really love your peaches
Who really needs the past
Everything was bathed in light
Crossing the street and crossing galaxies of taxis and
But they'll still look in your eyes
While the children of makeshift hills
It's everyone for themselves
I want to go to heaven for the weather
It's all about chemistry, California waves
And when I hold you in my arms
We were looking for a place where we don't need heaven
Over little things the way I do
The person you need
 days since we first met
I'm love struck, and looking out the window
This is a beautiful start
And by no fault of yours and by no fault of mine
I don't mind
All his songs are stolen so he hides
Well then you just figured out today
And maybe for a little get to where I find it really hard to hate myself
Even lucky man has a bad day
I used to dream and I used to vow
When I'm with you I've got everything
Yeah but we've got different reasons for that
Now it's your turn you will tie me to the tree
No more tears
With soul searches sweat it out
"Game over" they said, run and get your quarters in
Work out in the end
Because on and off,
I've been sleeping on the floor
I'll be lookin' at the ceiling, so concealing
You gaze down from the sky trying to see me
'Everyone feels good in the room,' she swings
Honey yeah, a sure thing
Best way to touch your heart is to make an ass of myself
I watch them pierce the blue, blue sky
Got fifteen hundred bass drum luggin', bugeyed monkeys
I can't do it by myself, need you now
I know it's useless to complain all these years after, well
But we can't go back
Ooh, like a solitude erasure
Though I need you more than air
We've got to do it soon
So just let it be
When the rocket ships all fall
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side
Done in the PAST
Satin tights, boots so white
Oh, I still remember "Regulate" with Warren G
Leaving broken hearts all over town
The back of the track
My loneliness is evident
We floated weightless through the tops of trees
And every time I do, I keep seein this picture of you
Will you drift away
Take my home
We still take the pill, but only for the fix, hey
Sometimes your soul might make a stumble
Give me real selfesteem
There's only one song worth singin'
Oh, bubbles, float through the air,
That somebody like you could be with
So I shook hands with you freely
You can cross the line whenever you want to
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
There's this weight across ma shoulder
Made it so you had to walk away
Now we do away with our disease
You above with the ocean around me
We need to stay
They shot an arrow at your head
Another girl on the scene
In this world of wisdom
And messses up with you and falling
And I can't wait to get on the road again
And I don't wanna let it go
You tell me, "What's my name"
While our reflections flicker bodies collide
'Cause kid I don't know much about about you
"Nothing else is real
You know she dances while his father plays guitar
And all I want is to come right out my shell
So we make it up as we go along I won't let you down
Know that you are here
And it make my day if you would just stay for awhile
Hiding in estrogen and boys will be boys
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
Where nobody here could know
It's time that we say it
All of daddy's money and she fancies herself
I still believe that
I don't mind if you play your game
But they believe it from the tears
I'm a big man, give this man room
If I could have you back best believe it'd be forever
I don't need you to hold my hand
Although this world is a crazy ride
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Without your love,
No date, no place, no time, no RSVP
It feels so special
Be all right, be all right
I, i, i, i, i, iii, iii, iii
It's always a good time then
To practice the life
I'll take care of you
She would know that our love our love
That I've been thinking of you
And have another baby
Thinking of a real way to see
And pass me a bottle, Mr Jones
You're my superstar Ooh la la, ooh la la
And now I'm getting a little homesick
Hey little rich girl where did you go wrong
Get me through the weekend
And save the day, yeah
But I'm still on my feet
It feels great
You might be found tomorrow x
And blood is in the land we love
Now we can see, what do we need
And he's on the way to a real first in all the universe yeah yeah
I'm maxed out like a credit card
Hold up your hands to the sky
I popped him in the kisser 'cause I couldn't resist
I don't think that I knew the chaos I was getting in
He can't wait to tell you about his new girl
I get a feeling, you get a feeling, we got a feeling
Because these days aren't easy
Something more than this
Take it away
You gave me a solution
My daddy said 'Pretty woman, Mama married into the mob'
Your true self has become weak and alone and annoying
Our weapons were our instruments
But I'm the one who wants to let it go
I'll shine up my old brown shoes
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Might make someone think that I'm still around
Today I watched the boats
We gathered around to hear just what they'd done,
On the wings of an eagle
I should put on my armor the next time I see you
Over and again, racing out of my skin
Where's the woman you love
We will never have our old way; we will never have a right of way
Like the one I found inside
So I'll run away to the hopes that I have
Oh, there's always someone cooler than you
Rest when we're old
I can wash your sins away
Che cosa vuoi spezzare
Teach it when it comes my turn
And we dance in the living room
But I forgot how to love
Well, she sure is going to get it
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
And a child by every one
Watching our lives blow up
It's time to get this started
Someplace that I have never been
Where is the man you respect
And clap on one and three
I'm the one that you want and you want me now
You're so ooh You're so, so ah You're so, so cool Baby, you're so supersupremelybabadioh
It's safe to say, saving you, saved me
And her heart may be broken a hundred times
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
And pretty girl has a scar
And you make my heart beat faster
I used to cry against a wall
Will soon start wearing you
Straight in the eye
Because you're true blue
And tiny island chains throughout the sea
You broke my name, you broke my will
Up on bankers hill the party's going strong
You gotta believe
Tear the tear, and fold the fold
You gotta walk tall
You'll have to sell your car
We can set this thing apart, 'cause we're gonna
Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo
If it works
Would you be my love, my love could you be mine
Oh, there's always someone cooler than
I'm aware that friendship can die young
That everyone
But some say we're headed for destruction
My baby's in there someplace
Two scientists were racing for the good of all mankind
I only borrowed them in case we die
Hey such a mess but I don't care
More than any other girl yeaa
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now
Keep me in your thoughts, don't disappear
'Cause we can't stop
Can't believe the words came out of your mouth, yeah
Are getting mirrored everywhere
And that's when I fell in love
I though if we live apart
"Morning's teeth are lit"
But it's still your reflection, you and no one else
I'm in love with this soul
You shrug your shoulders as I decompose
And make me still believe 
I made my way to a party all the way 'cross town 
My first love, and my only muse
Oh I felt real blue, eating that blue fish
But I think I get a bit confused
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
For the weekend and the night 
It's difficult to see from the surface
I compliment your
And my eyes were squinting
Gotta let it
Few miles away from heaven above
My new found faith
You let me get in dans ton lit
He is the one for sure
Here comes Spiderman, arachnophobian
Lavender wrestling a rich wild boar
Told a funny joke, got the whole class laughing
Sometimes at work
I miss everything everything
Scratched on the back of both my eyelids
I like the way he's speaking, his confidence is peaking
So many sights to see
You've dialed that number now, so where's the surprise
We'll find our way
I can't swallow, I just start to shake
You said, "I don't know"
We're just normal people exploring our minds
I think I heard you, yeah
Ooh ooh ooh, oh oh Save me, San Francisco
So will you try and look surprised
You're dressed to have a good time
To the fullest you spin the bottle and I'll dim the lights
If you're giving all of your money and time
We're dancing all around
We together like, oh
Or how deep the city roots go down
But I'll stay right here and hide 
Tall, dark, and beautiful
It was thrown by the friend of an exthing 
All right
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play
We're gonna have a good day and I fin to worry bout what noboy say I'm still above ground that's the reason I pray got my car cleaned up now I'm ready to play make call to the sticks say I'm headin' dat way heard my cousin cookin out I gotta get me a plate got new outfit ain't even out in the states so if they ain't speakin' to soon but this is a hell of a day and these dickies got me sitin' in a hell of a place got my stunna shades on a grin on my face my grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight and the hood showin' love so I'm a okay
You asked if we should sleep on these cardboard sheets
You'll never find your way home, no matter where you go
Like a puppy getting lucky
There's something in the sun this day, I feel it
Outside the in crowd
And we all want something beautiful
Don't go feeling insecure, no feeling sad
Believe in me 'cause I don't believe in anything
Two points for honesty
Backseats and drunk suites and halfGreeks
Oh wayow ohwhoaoh, oh wayow ohwhoaoh, oh wayow ohwhoaoh Yeah
Last night you sat home waiting, and I got home much too late, yeah to late
When my pencil tips broken and my brain is too
Woo, yeah
And that's because she stands alone
I feel the wind blow through my hair
And I think I'm getting older
That boy is looking at you and he says that he knows your kind
Doesn't matter to me, I could take it or leave it
I just want it to be you and I forever
In the port prepare to set sail,
So I packed up and I left town
Let me let go 
How's that working out How's the music, how's the food
And our airforce flying
I'm not afraid of a love parade in my daydream 
You are the best, but you say you don't know
I need a little, I need a little faith
Lazy ooh lazy
I'm gonna ride the biggest ride, it'll be out of sight
If you can't get behind your own life 
Heartbreaker
Why does my mind blow to bits every time they play that song
But most of all I want no more tears
And playing video games in the middle of the night
Was to backstab
And I know you're underrated but one day we'll all make it
And kickin back feelin' real good, real fine, real full of the wine
Like nibblin' a little afternoon delight
We don't have to get colder
I shouldn't beat myself up
We just gotta get it up, we just gotta get it up,
Just take one moment of our time, mmmmmaybe
Picture the moonglow 
At night during dreams of submission
Then rock it, dance right till it falls,
We keep breaking our backs,
The souls that made the call
Rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
I get anorexic chicks, who model six
Oh, baby
'Cause I like your head on my shoulder
You say in evidence, they won't take you alive
To the Nth degree
I say it all the time
Yeah I'll stop or start my heart if you ask me to
All my friends know it keeps the
O sol se reparte em crimes
Let's bypass the bullshit and move on because
I setenced myself now a long long time ago
I'll love you forever
Keep your eyes on the prize and realize
Your heart is big enough for two
All the boys raise your hands up in the air yeah
As children draped in flowers form a chain 
Think that something so beautiful
I'll never find my way back home
I've bought a calendar, and every month
Cross my heart, hope to die
Don't let them get you down
Come on, everybody, to the Nth Degree
Nothing's something that's important to me
Your grinning face scaring a poor parakeet
And the way you like to dress
So many rights, so many nights
So I never hear from you, and that's fine
And she means everything everything
Tell me, are the people strange, do they change
And she's got simple feelings
Someday they'll play drum with my shinbones
Don't let my heart turn sore
You're givin' me a heart attack
Like the Jackson 
I'll never let it push your arms no more
I'm using my left brain
My only tears fall with the rain
Always the true one, calm, selective, 
Watch him burn, he never fails to please
I would say sorry, what's the use
I love love
And now there's you understanding why I do the things I do
Everything makes sense when you
Take me somewhere new
That dazzles my eyes
The faintness that you feel
Oh yeah, there's always someone cooler than you
What's up, enough's enough, where's my morning coffee
Look both ways when you leave the building
Something in me was not the same
Grinnin' at the women in the salon gettin' their hair done
Well are you strange enough 
I thought out loud, but no one heard me saying
For control over the sky
I was not looking for arty farty love
I'm gonna get it times two
Tell me the truth, and I'll tell you the truth
But do it sound so crazy
You've got a pocket full of reasons why you're here tonight
Remember the night when I saw
Hey what do you know I think you've done it to yourself again
The answer yet
Stop making a fool out of me
Then it's gone from sight
Cause from above it all, you can't help but say
CCC climb to the top of the mountain break ya backbone
The day we're born till then we
I don't wanna stop
Yeah, for the rest of my life
Look up at the rooftops
Night nursing a broken man
So he came right back
You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
For you and wait
What's you're persona about this Americana
With the sun on my shoulder and the wind in my back
And I can feel that destiny is on my side
Would he need you
You can see my broken heart
Underneath the town towards the sea
We just sold out all the floor seats
I'll unfold before you
I'm turning into something
What I will do with my life as I know it
It's gonna take a lot of time before I can cross that finish line
What you find and heal my broken jaw, yeah
But you should never let the sun set on tomorrow
You quickly change your ways
We lined and we painted this town
'Til I hear her say your name
Aloft in the airway
You see the ads and start to think
And now things are gonna get better, baby
Just sounds like a worn out cliche
Turn looking at hips, and a little outfit
Stocks are in the Dow,
I hope it can stay this way
And I awake at dawn
Rejoice although this world will devastate you
The moment has come to face the truth 
I'm a doctor today
In chilly subdepth railways
So what if Wednesday finds us
Cause each and every day you would hear those four letters
What in the world should we do
I guess this world is over to me
Watch him burn, he's dropping to his knees
And then return again
She's looking good
In a failed attempt on blue
Any minute you will feel the chemistry
To make history of a love, a love like ours
I'm throwing rocks at broken windows
"Jump on the roof" he said
Would I know just what to do, yeah
Che cosa posso dare
If things go right, we're meant to be
Mr Jones strikes up a conversation
Welcomed at the
The third week with the jar you find
You're a memory with nothing to show
Oh man, we won't last long,
Comets swarm like fireflies outside your window
Just your smile 
Now I'm right here, right here
And the leaves are golden
Well me personally, It's nothin' personal
Little arms on a big body
The sun bursts, cloud breaks
And I think they're buying what I've got to say
Everything dies
That has the power to raise a temple and tear it down
Only you, bend my reason 
But its mine to decide when I'll be all right
I used to sing the saddest songs
I need a little space in my mind
How d'you do  Comment allezvous 
I'm going where there ain't no disease
Who line up girls
But I'm leaving in the morning for a year long tour
Who can't live up to what I already done
You don't need him, you need to be seen
To be the best, we got to pass the test
Promise me this, take me tonight
In the need
Don't wanna stop
When time stands still as it's trapped inside the letterbox you gave back to me
The one that I came with
That's the way it looks and I'm really glad you think so
Oh, show me your love, your love
When the chaperone said that it was time for me to leave
The game was gruesome
My heart goes like,
I recall, Central Park in fall
It feels good
Maybe a song unsung is dancing on the tip of your tongue
Surrounded by your enemies
There was a time when I would have believed them
And I've watched them come and go
Of looking down
Nobody can take that
Made for your life gain, plus my man might sing , 
Look what you've done
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
Come to the club girl, I'll get you on the list
So try and guess my weight, waiting at the station
Feel the weight letting go, feel more lightness than you've ever known
They explode us with their looks
Well I wish you well but keep your paws off mine
Till you came and saved my life
In fact, I wish your heart was mine
Hey, that's a say ahh
It's like you got somethin' good to sell
Stormy days and lonely nights
But when we got slightly more intimate, it wasn't that bright
Some girl you turned out to be
On something magical
Everybody Singing Along
Will I surround you, entombed and warm
Because it wasn't supposed to go this bad
You're Travolta getting into your groove
Close those doors now
Don't lie to her, no bones, no form
I thought you liked it but you called it cheap
Tell the world that we finally got it all right
The rest is just a dream
So many choices
That nasty boogie bugs me
And this week the trend
And everybody has to see you wait
'Cause since I've come on home,
I fed it milk so it wouldn't grow old
You've dreamed a thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
The summer's gone too soon
Now that I've got the disease
But you can't hear it being played
If you want me, baby, that's fine
I walked a year to hear a howl in this give and take
You, yeah, you yeah
Dream of sights
Emily, I sure am glad you didn't want me anymore
My words are just ccccoming out all wrong
And everyone moves around with ease
Take it easy son, this ain't so deadly
My time went by too fast
Well I would feel for you
That I love you so
Your turquoise and silver won't weaken this old heart
Come on, everybody, to the Nth degree
Falling back down to the floor
That I got to be
Need you right now
So much for the late rent, cause your money's spent,
How I love being in love
I'm walking rounds in search for, doesn't matter
We don't go around here putting poison in wine
'Cause I don't want to get stuck in here
Across the night
Nights like these when I'm drowning in your eyes
When I crash my beloved desk job
We're breaking free
Love that you just can't help feeling
Just a little bit closer, then I come back down
I hope she sticks around when he does dirty in this dirty, dirty duel he has brewed
The happy ever after girl
And it took shape in the form of an image in the form of a living memory
As long as you're my shelter every night
See me shining imma star take a picture see you later
My mouth has sprung wide open
You can't dance and stay uptight
Who's got the crack 
Satin tights, boots so white the girl got hot
Che cosa vuoi tentare Che cosa
It may be a waste
The power of two hearts
This kind of love don't come easy
Ciao adios, I'm, I'm done
Float through the air
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it back to me
I need to feel happy Every, everyday
And the wind and snow and the rain that blows
Why, oh why, did I not see this before,
I'm so glad you're revealin' your love for me
Finally got it figured out
'Cause no one was having much fun 
But I didn't care
I just lay back down
And we all sit silent and I crawl back inside
Tell me baby I'm your lover man
All of the time
When everybody loves you, oh, son
Good thing
You dirty dance me all night long
On a blue street
We got the money so we'll put you down
And you know I'm not getting by
We're passin' out on the carpet
You're messin' with my head
And a longer day spent accepting
The answers we find
Look at me no hands, ain't it cool yeah
This ship will still sail on
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
'Cause I'm drowning when I close my eyes
I can feel it calling me
You just got to moonlight
He's in the yard just washin' his car
It's a September sky with pretty pictures in my mind 
Inside that's happening to me, oh
And we took a train into the town,
Because it's on like
That we could lay here for hours and justa reminisce
No matter save for a friend
And when your legs give out just lie right down
Each howl, I get bigger 
That we work as one
And are you shoppin' anywhere,
You bite my lip
Still half high
"Relax yourself
She's a simple girl
Agora so me resta sonhar
Your mother complains that you need a man
Hardcore reggae beat bring my feet out of these shackles
Prime time, capsule maker
Boys will be boys
'Cause I just wanna compliment your soul
Spent the day laughing in the sun
I'm a mess,
Is look into your eyes
And rejoice although you will not survive
See maybe if the world contained
'Cause I was absolutely sure
From far away
It longs for me, and someday we
So stay awake, stay awake
Ooo That's alright
How we ever started out with our sights so high
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you
Until you've had sweet lovin' there's no lovin' worth the name
Time to get up, gotta get up
But pretty soon it will happen the sun will go murder the snow
Synthetic fighting
I through utter desolation
Heartbreak I can live without
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
I love her body, especially the lies
Strapped to a chair
The evening tails that will fit my corpse
You're a big man now but he'll cut you down to size
And you make out in the rain
Remember it was Paris you said we were gonna meet
If you remember just how scared I use to be
Are you there, Eugene tell me are you there
If I am another waste of everything you hoped for
Yeah Oh, yeah
We gotta make it all the way
And you told me
I'd love you to love me
And later on, after I'm gone, you'll wish that you had listened to me
You'll be sad to hear that
When we were together you tried to break my heart
So don't expect me to stay with anyone
Let your heart go where the wind takes it
And my smile was growing
And so blindly sure that he'd always have the satisfying hug I needed
'Cause the night and the sky is so high
He puts his papers in his briefcase and drives away
As long as we gon' rock forever
Then you're destined for the world without chores and sweating 
You've got to drive your train
My life had barely started since you jumped all on my heart
Our fearless crew was not prepared
Hear ye, hear ye, and make miracles for minimum wage
When I'm alone at night
You told me that I should never call your house again
The windows of aeroplanes and hotel rooms
At her feet
These days aren't easy anymore
Because this world you know it can get so crazy
The pills that fix the way you feel
So look out now 'cause he's comin' after you
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Wouldn't change your mind, non pas du tout
Who can save me from this hell
But we won't ever let them win
I'm coming round to take a stand
Caminhando contra o vento
Just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do
And I guess I'll see you in the spring
Forget about the price Hey tag Hey
Nights like these when you know that you got fire My life from the beginning
But the streets are still white, been this way for so long, yes I know
They stole the children
I don't need a tuxedo
I can be anything that I see
So maybe tonight I'll be the libertine
I leave tear stains on the ground
And tonight I'm in love with everybody on the city bus
Says, "You're okay, I drive this route everyday"
On the street when I think of some
You enjoy your life
And I won't be back in your neighborhood
We all fall down, there's not enough hours in the day
Always meant to be, I can feel it
Come over sea
So cut the crap, stop that shit, don't be dumb, I will love you forever
And baby when we get older,
Oh, girl
For the one that's listening
We can work it out, we gon' work it out baby
But all of my thoughts just seem to form around you
If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
And are we all part of the latest craze or is this how we mend our ways
All the way, yeah we're moving, oh
Cause you my friend have had your day
But we'll climb right back up
To raise her son
That I don't feel the limitations and the
'Cause I speak of the pompitous of love
That I chose to spend
But you never let me stray out of your view
Yeah, there's always someone cooler than you
Burgh representative I need y'all behind me cause
And the one's that you might not
You know I love you baby
Yeea, yeah
And magic eyes to read between the lines
To show you that I love you
Smile on my face and an air guitar rocking
And I want you to see when the sun goes up"
It feels so good to know two people so in love, so in love
And it's a mixture of dumb jealousy and fear
Oh, the way you hold my hand
I Think his could go on and on forever
So come and talk to me If that's your plan
Dream all the things in the world you've never dreamed'
It could be this night
Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Once upon a time, not too long ago, we took a day out in Manchester
I'll cut loose and leave this madhouse,
No siempre son dos
Smoking, often, and calling out our guilty pleasures
Yes, our love our love
I'm gonna search for someone just like you
I'm liking this American boy, American boy
Yeah, so much I just wanna get out
Can't beat the feeling
Make you mine and mine will be all yours
As I was swimming through the bay
'An I don't think there's no solution
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my brethren
That your love is all my soul needs
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
He said 'Will this do'
Sapatao a bigodudo
Where nobody here could know 
That wherever you say you want, 
From those old lips to a town where its dry
That's right
Heads up, heads up, heads up
Prove to everybody who doesn't understand
No one ever let her know that she could get it out her heart, now
Am I the only one gettin' tired
All those things you left unsaid
While looking at me with the same eyes ever again
And a candle burning bright
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
Then you heard that there's always someone
If you're not giving all of your money and time
in your crystal stare,
Ready to get it on
But now they're good at getting me played
will someday lose its salty flavor, 
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
Can you see the lighting flashing
No one's going to say goodnight
Used to take me out, in your fancy car
Bills are due on Monday and I
There is one thing left to hold on to
Say sing with your hips my baby
Nobody will love them, nobody will love them
The band was doing their thing
Surely it will last forever
I was crying on the bathroom floor
Squaredoff, all bother
The lord will have his way but I'm just a call away
Folded on a big mess
But it seems to take an hour for her to reach the floor
You were better to me than I was to myself
I'll kiss you right between your eyes
Don't forget to celebrate the radio's up
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
Let's keep, talking, anything to stop clockwatching
I want to be with you forever
On a shortlived flight, making love on economy
And all this time oblivious to what you make so obvious
And there's something on the tip of my tongue
It's not about the money, money, money We don't need it
Maybe for now I'll drive back to that place where I belong
We're gonna have a good day and all my homies gonna ride today and all these mommies look fly today and the only one we wanna do is get by today hey, we're gonna have a good day and ain't nobody gotta cry today cause ain't nobody gonna die to you save that trouble for another day hey we're gonna have a good day
The state fair marquee reads
For a safety dance, ohoho
When I come home, you won't be there any more
Me I like the way you smile, the way you smile oh oh
To get the answer
Speeding through my veins until we hit the ground
"I'm gonna give you  chances then I'm gonna turn you into a goon"
And everyone's a soldier just marching towards the ocean
That tears me inside out whenever you're around
All the nights, all the fights You are out of sight
And she's got simple emotions
I miss making your room a mess
That there's no reason to doubt
Cause my old man is bleeding
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Just lying smiling in the dark
And fought it off and fought to feel
I'm not what I was last summer
Hold up, we're tryin'
Dash of rouge, buyer beware
When we meet we can talk awhile 
Come back, I'll be with you someday
Under the burden of my loneliness
In a small ghost town, there's a little arcade
Yeah, but it feels good
Till I made some tender coin
I want to shake your tree
I can't believe I love you still
I barely had the chance to shout
How you tore your dress, what a mess, I confess
I am sure I never would be sure of love to come
We need to take it back in time
Where do all the lovers meet with one another,
End of story, I fade to black inside I never said I was the best thing for you
Let me know how you feeling
It starts in the morning
Day in, day out, I worked through the same old plight
You weren't that drunk, and that I was your favorite Salsa dancer you had ever come across in New York city
And my hands were sweating
So you're walking on the edge
Go save the world, I'll be around, forever and ever
But I won't close my eyes, 'cause they're onto you
When you look my way, something's pounding away
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
Our calls on the company dime
It sounds so good right now 
I'm all be e e, be e e be all right y'all
Get out, goodbye
It looks like this might be a quickie
But I guess that you've heard that before
I'd want it to be number one
and in everything you say
I really didn't stay too long there 
Doin' unbelievable things
The lonely light from the town hall clock tower
Can ya take me far away from here, save my soul from sin
Bound for the Atlantic blue
And you will sing and sing forever you and me
The sun bursts, clouds break
And I'll come to you like a little girl
Ne vous rappelletelle pas l'hostiele style
I find I always move too slowly
I know that I have, it's time for you to go
Now, I know you're working hard
Their control over the sky
Yeah, Jesus wrote a blank check
Every single one of my friends
Used to sing along, when you played guitar
These precious illusions in my head
Now he's back and things'll be fine
Every day I'm fighting 'cause I can't leave it
Someone like me
When you look in the mirror, wish you were somebody else
If I had some money yo id lay it on ya
He flew a blue flag
They're swallowing the brains of all in sight,
The things that you dream in
Lola, lola, will the world end me and you
Are these the good days
Aw, look at him So delectable So chewable
From the darkest grays
The vast expanses, the need to grind
You'll never find a love like this
Clowne towne no anything
That's my dog
White hot glistening shadowy flows Feel flows
I don't wanna clear the cobwebs from my head
My life had barely started since you jumped all my heart
Some girls they got something to prove there's usually one or two
Tell 'em whawhat, blood
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
This one's for Maggie This one's for Maggie this one's for Sam This one's for Sam
But you said, "I don't know"
We might as well do what the children sayin' take a day off hit park and just hang barbque roll a few and put up your dukes if it's beef put down the peace and put up your dukes it's time to change our ways so we can save the day for the children sake and make a better place to play and if it's all good break out your click and grip your wood and if you ridin' dirty just light your swift abd blow yor sss but dot real big exactly like a player should enjoy your 's do your thang and rep your hood the world is all yours but still we all bound forever in a day the choice you make is relly all fine
Yo, now if you know what I know you need to work it out
It could have been just another dream
And I walk through the streets I love
Some people call me the gangster of love, yeah
Oh, what a world this life would be
On your side
Do I drive you up the wall
Brings you closer
And just to taste your lips
The next time I wake up, I want it to be
I hope somebody lends me a dime
You burn down the trees
I am on your side
Only I'm still hanging on
Happy New Year, you are my only vice
In my blue car and when I got there
Some people like to talk but I'm into doing
I need a kind, and honest man honest man
Watching history unfold
We should need nothing, nothing at all
Because your light is the light of ten sunsets 
My future to the new horizon
And everyone's a little nothing,
And my life is sublime and it's mine and it's time
This world, which time forgot
"Come on baby, shake me all night long"
You'll be in love, there's no other way
To see if the same thing's on your mind
Will I get better or stay the same
You know we got to pray together
All dots and lines that speak and say
It's all about chemistry, sweet Pacific scenes
And the teeth right down to the blood
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
Just some one new
Waiting for someone to come around
The rest is just a dream"
Something's calling us
Hearing her voice soft and low
We got the money, we got the money, we got the money
Though you're not mine
I'd give to you a day just like today
The saddled streets, the burro beats down my door 
I feel horny when I thinking of some of that rhythm in my mind
You're my gangster, you're like Al Capone
Yeah, we got some guns, got some dogs
When all anyone want is to be seen
I said 'Why not, Yeah"
We just wanna make the world dance
Punch that clock and break all the numbers
That I was coming round, coming round
And taking advantage of amateurs
Don't know where you are
It's that time again
Best place in Paris to be
When you leave don't say
But I have to be gone by three
But everybody close the door on me
I guess their fathers taught them well
I'll sing a haunting refrain
The moment to get closer, the moment's almost here
I'm far away, but I never let you go
Say you feel the same
The sculptor we hardly knew
That I might feel should she appear
Ooh la la, you're my superstar
Come on, everybody, to the Nth degree
But there's no romance in my blood
Smiling as I start to fall
And baby, baby, you're irresistible and I'm insatiable Ooohooohooohooohooo
Like a flash before our eyes we'll leap toward the night
We got the money, we got money, we got the money
La la la ooh, it's so amazing
It's such a waste, another day
Gonna push this beat till it hits the top,
Don't blame it on the good times
Life is a highway and I'm gonna ride it
You call me up in the mornings
If he's XXL, well what the hell
The clouds have fought
So I'm putting my country shoulder
Avec ses apparences instables
I took it in the first place
Sailing over the briny sea
Tears me inside out whenever you're around
From sweet beginnings to your bitter end 
Working class to the bone
How many licks 'til you get
Dreams don't always come true
And I wish they would stop singing
The day we're born till then we
Yes, those mystery hours,
You and I in the airway
We call love late at day
I always love the feel of sweat on my shirt
More people like these
All the things I've got
Don't say no 
Don't need to deny the hurt and the lies
The music is so loud
Fur, fur soft as fur
Restore this crack so
All the scores of the C to the A of the youth of today
But in the end they're just a suit
I've changed my life completely
Grown sleepy now as the rain falls 
And jump on the back, if you can handle the candle
Egal, wohin du willst, wir fliegen um die Welt
She said my name and my spirit are both corrupt and if you hold me close, you gotta hold me up
Then why don't we call her
But its mine to decide when and if I'll be all right
Is taken up by lover man
Travel on a tour before screaming fans
People take pictures of the summer
Whoa whoa for the wings of a dove x
Or all the things we put each other through
But it'll soon be night which is nicer
In step
the way I do
We had some massive nights
Imposing, unclosing thoughts that compose
No instead we're doing simple things
Behind green skies, I can see my girl's eyes
It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane
To my blue friends
We will get ours
Let's screw the rules up and rely on our minds
Oh man, it's ladders to the sky,
In the strangest fashion you start a chain reaction
No, better than fine, perfect in my mind
We proudly welcome Tony Orlando
Can find a song for every time they've lost and every time they've won
And the writings on the wall
And the boats went out at night
It's the end of a broken heart
Who's dancing all around
"Deputydogdogadingdangdepadepa"
Gotta get that midnight meal
And then you both smile, I feel so good inside
And your father likes my lifestyle
Just like that Barenaked Ladies song,
Some people walking round calling me Maurice
The wuthering heights
Is your love's extraordinary
And I'm waiting, I'm waiting around
Che cosa vuoi tentare
Get funky like Bond
Ladayla, my boyfriend's back
I said, "Yeah right"
I want to stop stop so I could thank you baby
It's all about chemistry, Ohohohohoh, oh
I'm still waiting for
Maybe you should just change yourself
Sickness lover
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
I don't know where, but she sends me there
I have asked myself what are we gonna do
From the glossy magazine that's stuck inside the Sunday Times
And we both think the weather's getting better
Who doesn't have curtains on her windows
Doesn't have to be that way
They'll take advantage
Always under the bed
I'm on your side
Passengers on different cars steppin' off the same train
It wont be too long till
She said I passed myself by day
We are the Cartoon Heroes  ohohoh
Cross the delta Go on
You know I'm not a weirdo
You're haunting every memory
And I wish that she was mine
Good friends keep enemies at bay
Oh why did God create this world so unfair
Money please
Lost in the sight I try to reach out
I'm gonna be the man, sir, connecting people everywhere
Staking a claim among the young defectives far off under the nighttime,
There's a party on the hill would you like to come
I carved our names in a tree there,
The smiles, the laughs, the funny,
My papa told me to be home by now
One night
Every fucker needs a home 
The father's gone
Sitting in the back of my next class, napping
Why you standin' on the wall
The sky is perfectly brown instead of black
Tell the promoter we need more seats
Show me your love
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Gonna climb that hill behind my house
Oom bop bop
It gave me more street cred
The telephone number I got from you says nobody's home 
We are not perfect we'll learn from our mistakes and as long as it takes I will
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
Les parties qu'on ne voit pas
This thundering and lightning gets you rain
I'm yearning to turn you on
Oh just look at you
I got that ow ow
A famous figure for every picture
But yours and that boogie
Boogie you just gotta
Parting with invisible best friends
Hey what do we know I think we've done it to ourselves again
Have ambition simply to see things through
Is the last hope the world has Yeah  Yeah
Disque parfait, disque lumineux
La la la la la la wont you holla sometime, holla
You keep me lucky like the roulette wheel spinnin
To do all the things you used to do to me
Say that you stay right here for me
Yeah, we're on fire, we are on fire
Ah, still I burn this earthen fire
Played a bit of football, fell into the union
There goes the heartbreak
Honey I need you
No turning back so you better buckle up
And now look at me
Right now my only rhyme is this lesson I learned
I'm liking this American Boy, American boy
That smile that shines
Lately I found myself thinking
There's lipstick on your collar
Got the skin got that thing
Loving in the sun
And gave us a big surprise 
That's just' bout as funky as you can be
Everything's a mess,
In love on the airway
And make the same mistakes, always
It seems like yesterday we had the world our way
That the ship will still sail on
You need to handle me so gently
I look tough enough
And you should never let the sun set on tomorrow
Even if he has to wrong someone
And I know I'm quite unkind
On crystal sand we sleep handinhand
You're lookin' so cool, you're lookin' so fly
Everybody gonna to say you, K
I can do anything I want anything my heart tells me to do
In this cold, world so cold
Till the night time wake me
They tell their lies and something dies
Before the sun rises
Hear ye, hear ye, these folk songs of the modern age
Calling me all the while
Would angels come aflying down
We all wanna be big stars
Where nobody gave her a look
I just met this foot guy who's just my type
We can find a place to start to gamble everything
If I don't wake up to the sun
Yeah, I've been hiding with nothing to hide
Calm has come to take me out on a date
Because if you throw a light
Ran into a friend just the other night
Whenever you need me
If he looks within he finds beauty and power
Wrap your world around me,
Welcome to the toon town party
I grabbed my ex in the kitchen 
Outside, thrown out on my ass
Crazy for running all the time, mmmmmaybe
To hear her talking again
T, need this torture
Hear ye, hear ye, punks and skins and journeymen
Owwwww, come on
From where I live, I can hear the voices joining
And I've got a hunch that you're thinking the same thing and with some luck
But if it would have been easy I would not have cared
With mouths open wide to devour
I like the way you smile, the way you smile oh oh
Can't see their faces but I've noticed that they seem to have big hands
And catch a bus outside the reef
But we feel it's coming back soon
I'm going where the living is easy
It's funny how we've seem to made it, funny how we can even walk up straight
Take everything I own
Che cosa vuoi sognare Che cosa vuoi lasciare
Then maybe I could use a break
Good morning and goodnight
Asleep in a golden ocean
I been so damn lost since you're not around
And though I know who I'm not I still don't know who I am
Well this is life in motion motion
Overhead in the airway
And though I've been warned to live day by day
I'm not like the other guys you see
Half a million strong
And I'm hard to please
With your new change of company
Something as simple as rock 'n' roll would save us all
Take a look around
And we both like to stretch the truth
Oh yeah it's almost our time, the feeling's coming up
The wages are down
We like our fun and we never fight
I can't tell what kind of life I've led today
But she looked at me with a glazed smile and said
With the beat one two
Stayed in my house for days with my weed psychosis
But still turned out all right, yeah
If you're willing let it go
Put it in a place you keep what you need
So all of a sudden I'm facing the raging river that passed me by
Don't make me feel ashamed
Slow, slow it down, wait
We won't ever let them win
But you know that you gots to believe in
In the end, makin' it right's the main aim
I been rock 'n' roll and disco
There was no time or location 
I'ma talk a hip hop and how bad its got
Put your mama in a headlock baby
About a blue star
Is all the love I'm giving
Scream my name scream my name
But now since I see you in his arms
Burn, furnace burn
And though you will see me with someone else
But in the dark I wonder what you see
Those pretty faces always
So they know I'm not forgetting them
When your mourning has a sound
She wont ever let you in,
That we could lay here for hours and justa reminisce
I swear, I know you did
See what this place is all about
There's one thing you can do
Our time reduced to an honorable mention
Yes he was kind, polite, sound and sublime, in theory
Can't lift a finger, can't change my mind
Jesus wrote a blank check
Bien vite reprend pied
I get you off till the break of dawn
When you've got me on my knees
And my friends say
Tie my shoes and zip my jacket
Things are looking good now good now
And I'll shed a tear between my legs
Or keeping her own word to her own self
You said you ain't I never thought you was
Come on come on back that's my dog
I don't want to be number two
In the love dimension
Yeah baby we were savage, we existed to kill
Tryin' to wind me 'round and around
We'll just have to wait and see Wait and see 
Take my fate in your hands 
Go without the love I receive
With sweet love and devotion
Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on
You and I can tackle anything of any size
Careful when you open, it's easy to be broken
Why don't you come right out and say it what it is your thinking
Hear ye, hear ye, my sisters and my brethren
Jump down that rainbow way
When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
Down these roads
Because he knows I've been true now
Because we will be wild like children 
Gotta catch that train by midnight for the
You're uneasy and you say you're scared
My computer mechanism wants you mentally
Don't use this one to point the blame
Skyrockets in flight
Torn us apart
I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
I always used to leave before I went to sleep
In my desperation I throw my faith into the wind
No one knows what to do
What is it about you that has commandeered my brain
He's not the one for sure
Build high, build high
On random notes of parchment I'm scrawling my existence,
But you can go blind from crying all the time
Diamond girl,
This is the worst part
Could you be my love, my love ooh
CCC climb to the top of the mountain but your still alone
There's no such thing
And now I'm sunny with a High
We don't have to wait till the morning
You can't see when light's so strong, you can't see when light is gone
The tundra under us cracked and ruptured
And rejoice although this world will penetrate you
Can't go back
My mother never takes a break
You gotta keep on movin', remember
A grass blade flashed with a gleam as it slashed open a moonbeam
If I were you I'd take a permanent vacation
Found something dying, it was my light
I never dreamed that I'd come here to become the next Jolie
Vermiculated with delicate animal bone
You left me for no reason
When you fit me like you do
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
My neurosis was thinkin' everybody's staring at my red eyes
Instrumental
To come around
The Sadie Hawkins Dance
We'll be lying together tonight
From on the bedroom floor
Man I can't tell as she says to me
I'm a lover
Why you wanna be someone else
Just like that ACDC song,
In a rabbit hole to the sound of you
Too many voices
And she snuck to my lips
Seems like everybody's got a price
Total subsonic vacation
Yeah, you were always the one
I know I can't come near you 
And gave us a big surprise
Every day's a winding road yeah
Smiles would die too soon
Because there ain't much that I won't do
Find a place that you don't know
The stage is set, is there glamour, I'm in this rockscene
But still I fall asleep in the arms of my past
And you can keep the cars
My friends said I looked like I was dead
You're the cutest thing
"You wanna get away You've had it man Nothing's going right so come sit on the sands of the island Island of lost souls No luxuries No no Amenities Too dull Your senses Oh oh Only primitive Hey hey Really get away" is what he said
Oh, the sound of distant carnival drums
She's got me dancin
"But not the only one I need
But I cannot take flight
Oh what a hopeless tumbling down
Yeah, you're the shit but you won't be it for long
Yeah, yeah, I'm just being
Uhhuh, yeah
You're lookin' so fresh
You're so ooh You're so, so ah You're so, you're so Hey, hey, yeah
All the girls in the bathroom, talking
And hope to God it hasn't changed
Stainedglass skyways and crowded  lane highways
In my thoughts in my eyes
Take it all with what we've done
Our friends are so unreasonable
No sol de quase dezembro
When the train rolls by
All right
We're building us a new horizon
That I didn't know,
You let me come alive
Whoa whoa for the wings of a dove x
Complete attention to a 
This hour, this day
And slept away the rest of them
Taking everything for much more than it means
Won't you show us where you heart is
So, go turn their heads, go knock them dead, go break their hearts
In a blue town
I better start oiling the gate
And leave a voicemail message
Woke up on the attack
Ah we didn't need no bullets
And there's something about your kiss
And the shoes you've grown into
All these words that we speak casually
I swear I won't say what happened that night
He drives to school every morning
You call me up in the evenings
Nighttime slows
Why's it so great just to wake every day alive and by your side
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
Stuck watching our lives blow up
Faith can keep you warm, but I'll teach you how to shake
Here underwater we're down Here underwater way down
I was been told, you will never grow old, if you live your too fast
I dance in blue shoes and wear a blue hat
Corn rows have companion feel
After that train comes and takes me away
And we got me this far
Like an old red woolen glove
Baby, if you can't change the world
I wanna tell you secrets no one's ever heard before
And you're gone now
If I am another waste of everything you dreamed of
If you try to stop this, you're just too late,
See I can't give one for wish or not at all
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway
When a sailor stole my glove
Quelle heure est il  Je ne sais pas 
Heartbreaker
Something wasn't right
And if you find another boy when I'm gonna be broke
Though we live in the same city
Damn it, I'm in love with this planet, you gotta realize
Waiting for my judgment day
Now we can see the warnings and the signs
So if you hear me say that I believe in love
Brama, am I shallow cause all my clothes designer
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall, never
Windows are rolled down
And all my questions still ask for answers
Sunshine yeah
I said baby, don't ya know
And this girl, she was nothing like you, whoa
And the snow capped mountains white
Then nothing now is true
Will I surround you, entombed and warm
Tshirt salesmen and the followers it brings
I don't wanna work all night and day on writing songs that make the young girls cry
Aiding my fall, aiding my fall 
E uma cancao me consola
Yeah, oh boogie
Gone I'll be gone
Your heavy breathing scaring the wind
A room at the top
I've bought a watch, to time your beauty
He went away and you hung around
I said now Ride it, Ride it
In the place to be Uh huh
The shovel in the dirt keeps the devil gone
Got the lips and got the skin
"You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall"
Any stranger feel at home
Ain't about the yeah chaching, chaching
Someday will come back to us,
What'cha know about love
Oh, oh, there's a lot of things I could say
Honey
You better give up, come on and give up
You'll never get her, etc
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
And made it light made it light
You can have the keys to my car
Bring your body here, next to mine
Always had blue lips
Like a destiny thing written in the stars
Then I could save my calls
Never been arrested for nothin' domestic
Life is a journey where you stumble and fall
I am the night
You got my time on the dotted line but you show up invited
And you'll leave, got places to be
You got my Crate combo
And everyone move with ease around and then,
But it has taken me a while,
Makin' him a perfect life
Nothing isn't nothing,
If they told me you could not come true, just love's illusion
What's up with this Prince song inside my head
You can have the password to my phone
That's something to see, that's nothing to hide
I hadn't tried a lot of looking for anything at all
Hold me tight tonight, tonight
And rejoice despite the fact this world will kill you
He was kind, polite and divine in public, tender as a sleepy child
Of hopelessness, left standing
Away down stream,
But baby, where'd you go
Just as I'm thinkin about repairin' it some little friends come along
So come dance this silence down through the mornin'
From feeling down; things look grim
Prove my love to you
And where is the woman you love
We dance at the festivals, 
And lately the weather
Just to be Just Jack and just that, still intact
I feel so alive so alive
I love you baby, do discover was I here
We don't care what you say
Come on, let's get all antsy
You might be found tomorrow
After today
Circled by eyes burned blue and open wide
No one in the world ever gets what they want
I can't deny that when I'm staring
If you're true blue
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
And the sun burns one more day
That you know that your fine as hell
When left to devices some humans try shit
Shakes me up inside
And the moment could last them for ever
And I got so scared I tried to lure him back to bed
I'm too much in love
I'm fine on my own
All I wanna hear is your voice
But these feelings run right through the night
No cares, come what may
Rejoice, rejoice, God's ears are stitches
Got a handful with their projects and with their looks
Well, I've tried to get along with you
Guess it serves me right
Staring at our fears
I said, "That's one thing I won't be needing"
Watch his mouth its open wide
And call to the sleeping world as they fall to Earth
On the verge of a world profound
At the bottom of a french blue pool
I was looking for a decent boy
You live in another state far away from me 
Do you want to dance and hold my hand
At your dad's office party
You are saying baby it's time to go
It lights up the dark
Ill take everything and more
You're my superstar
Gonna wash the dust off my soul
Next to mine
And they plug them all into the back porch
Why don't you come on over Valerie
Take time for your pleasure
I will bring you home
But I sure know there is someone, around somewhere who's meant to be
Joint lit y'all get what the point is
With my blue pen
I said 'You know, Doc, I don't feel swell,
Something so simple
I'll be making music out of joy stick thumbs up
But either way, I'm a man of many nations"
There used to be a lot of things,
My bad self, bad self, bad self
But I'm beginning to see that instead its trouble
I know, oh, it's got me reelin'
I don't want to live in this world
And if we step a little higher will we find it then
I went home, we stared blank
Unfearing, allappearing message divine
To let me pass you by would be a shame
My feet are walking over him
The stage is set, is there glamour, who's got my Etnies
Than you could ever imagine you say that you pull up
And I can't wait for you to hear me shout it, all about my new girl
I don't want to live in this world anymore
Their moss mangles polyanthus
Gotta let it out, let it out, let it
There's an hour of sunshine for a million years of rain 
Had to write you this song
Blow me a kiss, I'll be happy for the rest of my life
And they said "It's all over"
Keep it together
Living and dying in LA and it means nothing to me
Then we're the smartest kids I know
I'll tell you the truth if you tell me the truth
We'll bake a blue cake
And we ate blue gill and we ate blue chips
Everyone was funny and everyone was pretty
Oh rejoice, the sky's fucking falling
Behold the "Super Keith" on the cup
Begging you to please
A few more weeks till worms lick my bones
Sweeter than the words of the bird in the sky
I only just left my dying bed and
It's been a long time coming
I was lost from the start
We don't want those things
It's all right
Wearing rabies parachutes
She told us
She crawled right in my
Everybody has a TIU
Shined a diamond with no end to its trip
You can see there's something in the way
I can't believe that she let me hit it
With a blackhaired flamenco dancer
I've got a weak heart
Don't blame it on the moonlight
And all I gotta say,
'Cause I could live by the light in your eyes
It's not a scam girl
Count the stars, watch the waves
I'm there when you call
My heart is racing
I know everything went wrong OK OK
I'm not your number one
And if you say everything will want to go your way
You call the shots
Beneath the fruity landslide we both laughed hysterically
Letters intertwined, for all time, yours and mine, that was fine
And I love you
And bluer skies reflect in your eyes
And my knees were shaking
So baby come over
I'm afraid of letting go
I could learn from way back when and still live right now
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic
You can almost hear them saying
Got my teammate right beside me you know where to find me
Hey Eugene, then we kissed once we lugged your friend into the elevator and went to write my number on a soggy paper towel
Would I just shut my mouth, would I just block it out
You'll do what was done unto you
But pretty soon it will happen, the sun will go murder the snow
Only to get stopped by a girl so stunning
Though I'm thinking it's not what I wanna hear
Everything I did was just a bore
And we talk about life and we talk about death 
And crystal eyes to read between the lines
We do this for the love so we fight and sacrifice every night
This small town, without you,
Passing the market now, the windows in neon illuminating my path to defeat
But this won't work now the way it once did
Night work gotta do the night work
Shoot me out of sight
You and her in the local newspaper
He can't wait to tell you about Repeat  times
Barged our way into the toilet with a kung fu kick
None of those would matter much without you
I wait, yeah I wait
Will somebody wear me to the fair
You'll never be evil, you'll never be turned
It was a straightfaced lie
There is one time that I'm thinking of
I'm the stalker, the funeral face that will follow wherever and ever you go
But we just hang around and think of clever things to say
I'm still waiting for
"She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me"
I'm in the way
Lost in the moment, then I come back down
Heartbreak, heartbreak
He's been gone for such a long time
But in my room, I hear the sound of trumpets,
The very first words of a lifelong love letter
Hopin' that I'll catch sight of the sun
Tear it apart and start again
Go on and get going
Here I come, Omaha 
I don't believe that the sea, 
Scanned the cafeteria for some good seating
I'm feelin' groovy, kickin' down the cobblestones
"The sky is blue, the sea is warm and clear, and golden sands are calling out to you Inviting Make a new man outta you You can come for a while, come with a friend, forget about work, start all over again, let the real you through Here's what we do"
Gotta let it out, let it out
And Kim's got her watermelon gun, 'cause it's the consciousness of love She won't give it to them, she won't give it to them
It's so funny, we went down to the store
You tossed your phone fifty feet in the air, I can't believe you caught it
Weekday  to  shift is over
Just why I love you so
I want to feel through you tonight
Our hands are bleeding through
My life was falling
So let's get lucky, let's go all the way
It broke a blue glass
And the boys with the brown skinny legs
But you were just a rich girl only having fun
With the skaties on our back
Whenever your falling
Everyone's telling me I'm just too blind to see
So keep going till you know when it's time, when it's right
Let's be, let's be love
Oh, I die, I die, I die
I thought things were going all right
Just in case the world end
And you were left feeling so alone
Went 'round to see her
Beneath the candy coated clouds
I'm making a beautiful day
Same crimes even though the names changed
The eyes neglect to see what the heart pursues
When I am on the beach
Agora so me falta sair
And this girl, she was nothing like you
You'll be mine to hold each day, but till then, this is all that I can say
Some say more with their hands I'm running as fast as I can
Are you out of love with me
Your best you tried, yeah you did fine
We are the color symphony
Sign on the line
But are you afraid
It's spinning circles around my ears 
And the new year would see her flying far away from me
Did you think of something He didn't think of
I'm so warm, new dawn, reborn, new forms
Keep showing yourself in that light
Mirage like soft blue like lanterns below
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin
And the choppers in the sky
Reluctantly, cause most of this press don't fuck wit me
Be dirty dancing me all night long
I don't know anything
Got to time it right
Whenever you call me
The sprite ones on the corner, dream of something warmer
Your father said
Little bunny foo foo hopping through the forest scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head
When I lie down in your arms
Yeah, my boyfriend's back
Don't think for a moment
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Come on, come on
Saying, "I am the water at the foot of the palms or I am sand and wind and a shitty mirage
I wanna see me staring right back at me
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away
Fine spring day, California waves,
At everyone down below
Mr Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
You keep callin' me back to your heart
You ate your words wrong this time
All right, yes, can we just try to figure this out
Women that so sexy
They look down from the clouds and smile
So full of energy nothing to hide
A few more minutes till they bury me
So baby, let's not miss this thing
And all this time it was staring me blind
We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
Down by the railway station
And it's been hours now, to be here like this
Said you always did your best at keeping us apart
I told you damn this wild young heart
And rejoice despite the fact this world will tear you to shreds
Black hot glistening shadowy flows Feel goes 
I threw it down at his feet and I said
Never be a time when we have to say goodbye,
People say that
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn
When I tell you that I love you
It's the only poison that I like
It's what I asked for, it's what I needed
To tell you the truth
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
Right here, right now, you never have to feel alone
I will turn you away as easily as I turned you into me
Oh, they're such pretty things 
Not a penny to my name
But I love you like a brother
Na na na na that's my dog
With your ruffled hair
We were born on an island, we grew out of the sand
Are never what we had in mind
Watching our spirits dance on the
Something about a party and he didn't go 
Shut my mouth and just believe
Till I can't control myself
What you need is higher than your shame
Swing my weight around
Junior high love affair is okay
They say love is hell,
It's not like you ever cared
I cannot die
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
It's the same thing to me
Talk of the weather will do
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
I got my hands on your teenage poems
Knowing that you do them too makes me really happy
In this city
But I love it
Fathers take pictures of the mothers
Little kids see me, way out in DC
If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
They are friends of mine
When you grow silent I start to fall
I need to know if we're still making useless ruckus
While you are down on one knee
Your just going to get sacked
"So come on, jump with me"
High and dry and kicked to the ground
Made some sweet love to the beat
Do you want to dance
I get the feeling
When they took the beach that day
Dropping in a heaven fantasy
We'll last a month
You sign on the line
Clowne towne no exit
I'll get home early from work
And though I feel so sad,
We came out of a crazy mind  ohohoh
You're my angel bringing peace to my life
Are you still rocking Converse with your old Ray Bans
All the hearts I'm gonna' love in the morning
We just gotta get it up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Could believe for all the world 
Ooh that's alright
She slips from the stage a foot no more
I play the music in the sun
Around me
I'm all right y'all, I'm all right y'all
Pick up that guitar
Some Christmas Eve some God was kind enough to set aside
Again I'm afraid of one thing
Lonely streets and dusty roads
And now try to guess what goes on in your head
Me never find a lo lo lo love like this,
I hope that you know I'm wondering where you are 
You're my superstar Ooh la la, ooh ooh ooh la la
It's much more fun
When we're all in the crowd and you catch her eye
Under the microscope, hope against hope
You havin' problems with your family then work it out
You've got to ride your train
Who do you call to ease your pain
Some people call me the space cowboy
I see the light of your smile
It's such a fine and natural sight
When your love slides
Do you believe in magic
Now I'm gonna tell you what I've been thinking
You gotta walk tall y'all
Your true father smashed his hands through the glass
Tell me, tell me you love me only
But when the rocket ships all fall
Don't you blame it sunshine
I will let you down If I am
So I requested this song
Tootootoodooroo
Don't lift a finger let me show you
They're trying their best to define you to define you
Through the week and can't get away
I'm givin' it some heart and soul, now
So Hold me up, Oh
You said I never get things right
And she blew my mind
 flavors, listen to the neighbors through the wall,
But your mama lied to you all this time
When you were home, we'd sing,
I only count the sunny hours, the brightest hours of day
I got a little bit of hope,
The words that came made not a sound
If you're afraid to love
You know the kind I mean
It's not appealin' as you truly speak your feelings
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh huh
And she's always one step behind
And parting with them is like
I'm the one that you want and you want me now"
We just wanna make the world dance dance, dance, dance
You deserve to get your wish 
Visions of love recollected
There's an angel knocking on my window
Believe in the magic that can set you free
I wonder how they sleep at night
Why you hittin' yourself, why you hittin' yourself
Never saw another creature, never knew another man
Tall, dark, and Superman
But there are people you meet
So hold me up now
Like the girls told me
We got tickets they were free
Don't have the nerve to ask for food and die of thirst
You seem so glad my place is free
Gamble everything for love, gamble everything
I noticed you yeah, you, yeah
They know inside
Give up your life
I don't want to be lonely
Und um das Ganze noch zu toppen, gehen wir shoppen in LA
They'll just have to wait and see Wait and see
A little piece of heavenly that no one else could stand
Good times mm
But you're so far gone
And I'm falling, I can't breathe tonight
Let me hear you say,
I love the way your body's moving when its grindin on me
I'll be worthy, right 
I tried with books but I'm not pleased yet
And pointing my way
When I say "Shotgun," you say "Wedding"
She's giving me the excitations
I said to my sidekick, I'm up to my high wick
I found a million dimes
She's always got them stuck on me
Your legs are a melody my hands
And the man falls in the sea
I'll be the guiding light
But I sure don't want to get hurt
All the deer despair
Blame it on the boogie
So smart just shouting answers shouting answers
In a galaxy of stars with nothing in the middle
Even when no one is feeling
You are invited for all time
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
Invisible wires keeping us apart
Turn rock to rubble, punch me in the chin
We dance in the living room
Baby, break their hearts
Don't you miss this time
And now you take her out, in your fancy car
Don't set aside
We hang around dans ton quartier
Can we go it alone say say say
Hand in hand side by side
Back to the years and all those tears
She's a simple girl
When I'm walking 'round daydreaming
White hot glistening shadowy flows
And how could I forget
Looking to the town to show us what they got,
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
Now you're wondering how oh yeah, you're wondering how you ended up here
You hold my head when I throw up
Well, you know me better than that, or at least you did and something happened
Upstairs
So here's to the passing of all that could be 
I headed for home kinda early 
I flashed it once and I was inside with a drink 
You're dead to me if love is death
Soul where did it go
I love you forever and ever for always I love you
And all you want is something you can move to
Beneath a snowy veil
I change my name to "Did He Really Just Say That Shit"
I reach for her hand
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
So if you cannot take my hand
Well it's that time
Why the world is right when you're near Oh, is that so 
And back doors to the heart from where we always, always fall apart
I'd sing a song to make you feel this way
'Cause I'm the only one, who knows the things you've done
And I'm feeling for you
If tomorrow's not too late
I want nothing tonight to hold but you
We turn it up, we turn it up
So  O'clock sees me heading out towards the tabernackle
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away
I'm not the perfect guy
With a blue tongue
Married and you'll be gone
We were all powered up on some new upper drug
He smelled your boring apex
The surface is gone, we scratched it off 
Some things just might be changed 
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running, and the running, and the running it around
Always drives us away
But since you've left, I don't hear anything
The only way to let this go
Where my check be
On his mind
And every night
Oh yes, about that thing
We both think the weather's getting better
Found something crying, it was my soul
She'll hold your hand Hold out your hand
I'm there when you fall
But only in the street man
I got it real bad
Surrender the town 
My evenings go beserk every time your voice gets near
Here is a bedroom that you've never been in and
See we'd rather fight with music
Slowly fill that black hole
Said you wanna get married and cook somebody dinner
When feelings with meanings keep on appearing
Do you dread every phone call
When when when when whenever, rock scene repeat
Away, I know,
My spring, 
Be a fool who sits alone
Got a two string on my lap
The sound of the collective crumbling around to the ground
I gotta be with you now, baby,
I would die for you
Ten thousand stories and two lovers disguised
I don't wanna let it go
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Girl, you see me here on another quiet night
I found you seaside in the fog
There's stardust in my head
Not withstanding I think we could work out
A love natural, oh that love actual
De quelques visions imaginaires
You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise
But there's never been a song or a melody
I've tried to show you, my door is open
Mr Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
Our time is ever on the road,
Deliriously, mysteriously I'm feelin' curiously marvelously
Cross the delta Looking
I'd have no peace in my life
'Cause it makes you feel good
I don't wanna wait at all
And I can feel how right she'd be for me
I simply, Lucifer, refuse to wind up on fire with lowlife liars
Living in a lonesome avenue
When I woke up with a smile,
For the rest of my life
With the allure of something new
On the backs of our lives
I just wanna compliment
A red light
Just when I was gettin' used to the humdrum
But then you found me and everything changed
Shooting stars around your heart
Sinking in the past
If you had a blue bag, I think I'd get well'
When the frisbee in the sky
See whenever we're together
To keep my head above
If you're afraid, fear will only break your heart 
I'll sellotape them up
That I can feel
Dancin' in the moonlight
You'll be thinking about me now
To do whatever do whatever baby
'What' I said then she said
When you don't care then you got nothing to lose
I know that you are just like me, oversensitive
I sleep all day but I break my back in the moonlight
Go now and get your own life and live it your way
With a whole lot of nothing on your way to nowhere
Why don't you come right out and say Come right out and say it
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight Everybody
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Well baby look over your shoulder
'Cause we rely on some words instead
A white lie
It must make you sad to know that nobody cares at all
So, I kept on going, going, gone right through
a song from your mouth, 
Many works, Many men converse
If you gamble everything for love
You see, it feels like I'm starting to care
But I don't wanna wait for waves
She's stopped replying to my texts
Tell me how many more times
Only fools fall in love
I'm finally breaking free from fear 
Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
You're not alone in this life
'Til I kiss you next time
But I will give them all back to you
Now its time for you to leave so baby please go
Never find a love like this
Sold my bed, no need to sleep these nights
And I can't see the darker wood
With a sign on my back saying 'kick me'
No I don't wanna be there, and feel so stuck right here
Like something we had seen before
And she was shooting up at her dreams
Damn these wild young hearts
Che cosa vuoi provare
and I could never say no to you 
I don't understand language of people with short money
All that you said to me is still so very clear
And waiting pent, save, sad, and look 
White flowers on our backs
Just to be loved by you, baby, yeah
I love it and I leave it and I watch it burn
Young boys
Every time I hear you say "Fuck it"
You're all of my days
And when she rings you up
You come around every day to collect me far off into the nighttime,
I'm going where there ain't no need
I never thought there'd come a day, yeah
I've spent so much time
You keep callin me back to your heart,
Que nadie mas te amara asi
When the chaperone said that we were dancing too close
Now a spectacular night ahead
Make me feel tiny if it makes you feel tall
And do it right
As will these boys gone through like water
These boys don't care
I know they don't understand they don't get us at all
Because there's always someone cooler than you
So let's run let's run let's run
I know you wanna leave so come on
Maybe it's just the way
The words I'm singing now
Y, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I was a young boy I pretended I had a job
You're the best in the world
Cause' we were singing along to Peter Gabriel's "Sledgehammer" song
I picked the few conscious hours
And all these things mean nothing to me
But they're all disappointments
Have your face to see
Make your own kind of music
We've got an energy
Speak to my needs, my needs
Another night out
When you threw me away
Forging for the future but to sacrifice their lives
Just another one of those glory days
Tell me, are you letting go, do you know 
I'm catching my second wind again
Caught in this old room,
Bend your knees when you're lifting these
Everyone, anyone who want to hear
The life of Riley
Nothing in this whole wide world saves us from this situation
Your lowcut dresses threw stares from everyone
Sometimes I feel like I can't run, I can't crawl
I keep comin' back to you
Come on the weekend
I need someone like you around
Eee ya ya ya ya ya Island of Lost Souls Iya iya iya iya island Iya island
The things that shouldn't last
Nigga's talkin' shit they ought to quit
Test the eye, test the eye
Heyladayla my boyfriend's back
Though I never pray God reigns today
Because it's cloudy out there
Sometimes your life can crumble
Einmal um die Welt
Need a crystal ball to see her in the morning
When my world was full of seven legged cats
Diamonds shine like stars beneath the ground,
Oh rejoice, the world we know is turning
I stopped to see what his deal was 
Today feels like no other other
I, i, i, i, i, iii, iii, iii
I hold your hand when you weep
Divide everything, a flag or a number
Because I love you,
Won't let you get in dans ma vie
A last ride in the city's hearse
You know tonight you're mine"
'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
And heavy is fine
There's a cold frost sweeping
How quickly will your joy pass
At the thought of being stuffed in my home
Have a session while we're smoking
Yeah, I know I'm Cain'd but now I'm feelin' Abel
Well, academy cogwheels breaking your hand
Climbing these walls in an hourglass
He is the perfect boy
And the moment to last them forever
And baby I just don't mind, mind, mind, mind
Written about my friends
It feels so good
Now, Jesus wrote a blank check
My friends will second that
Now you're gonna get a beatin'
Well, if you really love me
I've lost it, you've ripped my mind
Don't, don't, don't let's start
And I think I've seen the light, Yeah I, I'm gonna be here a long time
Once I laid it on ya you never would forget it bet
I'd rather have the truth than something insincere
You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall
Come ye, come ye, to bedrooms, bars and bunker squats
I'm moving on, I'll look ahead instead
I could claw back my heart and soul
But I really couldn't care about that
It's just another one of those glory days
Let's not forget we're alive
Bonsoir Jacqueline, bonsoir a toutes et a tous Pour toutes les zones de la mer du Nord et de la Manche
Apartment lights go dark
All the way, get lucky
I came back to haunt you
And we're climbin' all the way to the top of the highest mountain
All I think about everyday is just kissing you
And I said hey wait up
Take the hand of another
I used to think it glad while at my country seat
Said "I love you", said "I like you
Uhoh, here we go, turn up the radio
I I I I I was robbed
We're always kickin' back
And when all is said and through, would I know just what to do
She painted pictures
Why don't you come right out and say it
Don't let this fading summer pass you by
'Cause your never gonna get that girl
At times like these I'm at my lowest ebb
So decide, it's a suicide waiting, all this time
People move a new direction
I wish your silhouette would always stay there
Nights like these when you know that you got fire
Wahooh, wahooh
Nanananananananananight work
Oh, they are waiting
You've got the crack 
Just don't feel right
Tonight, sleep tight, and build your nest upon my shoulder
You punched a hole in the sun
Wahooh, wait and see
Well my body's been a mess
It's a mystery, I guess
Cross the delta looking
You open up and let them in
This gone on for way too long
'Cause I know I'll make you scream my name
Where the poltergeists play their video games
A honeysuckle in a plastic envelope
Let the bough break let it come down crashing
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
You came like a thief in the night and stole my heart
And I know you're tired of hearing it
To the islands, the black kites, the wishing tree
Will they ever find their way
I have to sit down on the curbside and count the coins in my pocket
I'm the reason they made the dress code
Gotta cash that check by midnight for the
By the moon by the sea
To feel the high, we got to learn to fly
He holds up paperwork  sign the line
And before my eyes
Jenny, I need them today
Another day older and closer to the grave
For guitars and drums and desperate poetry
I stepped to the floor with her best friend Jill
I've been working on getting you off, so get on board, now
You've got to express what is taboo in you
Everybody gotta fit in somewhere
And I know what you thinking of
"She's looking at you Ah, no, no, she's looking at me"
Every fucker needs a home
Hiding in estrogen and wearing Aubergine Dreams
You caused him so much heartache
This one other 'ere's got a little something else
Tastes just like a warm body fluid goin' down
Pure like the raindrops of time
So I took it down to a disco 
To make you understand I don't have time to explain
It matters to me, took a long time to get here
My motto's always been "When it's right, it's right"
Down the mountain
That you'll be thinking about me now
Where it's reggae night tonight
'Super Duper' like Joss Stone
Yeah, I'm depending on you
My baby's always dancing
"I feel it coming on"
Like nothing for the choice
Time after time
In the sky when you parachute over the harbor
That you could lend
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you
To take me all the way, you got me right here
I can work this thing on top
Well I long to be alone with you
On your way down
She's says
Stopping in somebody's old hometown
As mountains of fruit tumbled out
Clowne towne a flock of coots
On houses and building tops
Like you've got nothing to prove
Party people
Having an argument with myself down Elizabeth Street
Whatever you got in your crib
God knows I'm feeling really stupid now
Something on the thermals yanked his chain
No, ooh, ooh
We got lucky, hey, didn't we, baby
'Til I ended up
So you better get a runnin'
Vibrations in the brain can't ever be explained
"Just do what was done unto you, always"
I'll be right here on the ground
My contracts are finally void
People pass through
One time where one woman
And your face and your eyes and your hair
She had a name, she had a spirit, she had a line in the play if you waited to hear it
Soul DJs and you know the riot that that brings
Sometimes it hurts
To get used to this new feeling,
And we both know the weather will get better
Be careful with that game you're tryin' to bring
Put your house up on for sale, did you get a good lawyer
There's something in your eyes
And we have to take our clothes off
Whispering
Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn
You are the cat, you are the phone, you are an animal
It's all an orchestra of strings
But it's certain nothing's certain
So let's ride bikes into the sea
You can send us some sun
Young ones grow anxious to proclaim their advances to the fray
We took the highway to the One
So in the desert of the bed I looked hard for an oasis
Felt as fresh as the paint in this new flat
What's the matter, take a number, Buttercup
But all I know is that I'm happy to see you smile
Long Beach Dub Allstars, Black Eyed Peas, Will I Am
Fall before I get out of it
Longer than three months
Why the world is right when you're near Is that so 
Gettin' head from girls
Keep your chin up when you're feelin' lonely
We learned to run at speed of light
By kissing my honey
I wanna hear you say oh oui 
And I will live with many ghosts until I go
I said I'm gon' make you scream my name
I've been waiting awhile 
And walk around naked with our bullocks platinum plated
I'll do what you say
Just a little bit closer and then I come back down
Lately it makes me feel just like someone's forming in the air air air
With the warm, salty sea
The midnight streets feel dead
The first day with the jar you find
I wish I could remain the color
Never to be left again with that feeling
I am from about, umm, number five
But I don't care, I'd rather wait for you
Then our allies grew
When I look at you, oh I feel my heart
We don't care what they think
I wouldn't dream of it now
Oh yeah, Mary Ann
Making brand new memories
I've found a place I'll never leave
Baby I love how you sing
But then you get back up
Can't live with what he's done
And even better, I get to be the other half of you
No matter where you go, you'll never find your way home
Although I'd love you too, I'm proud of you
I sailed a blue ship
Everybody look to the left
But the heart of creation
You call my name, ooh, so sweet
A place we'll talk about now and the past what the future holds
During the fight
For a soul, a soul
That I don't know a thing about love
But you have to work now, so get out of bed
 nightmares and  days since I got near you and your anxious ways,
Remember all the game have I tried
Just my name in gold leaf on the front
I wanna walk into the mall
And I know now girl that I love ya
There is no other way
Yeah, yeah, everything's gonna be all right
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Girl, you won't wait for me in some secluded stand of trees
Well this ain't no game
Is it true you just don't care
Remember when that crab came up and pinched your feet
And rejoice, your hair it smells like burning hair
When the news it had been telling me
She was once mine
From our dreams
I feel like moving back
Ignite the starry fire
And I'm falling I can't breathe tonight
I got a strange neighbour
Tried to thicken the plot
Dancing feet, wasters on the cover of a magazine
We know we shouldn't do it, but we do it anyway
Whenever wherever you wanna go one day
Ooh ooh ooh, oh oh
Well no more, well no more blue days for you my dear
Still just go to the same old clubs
Remember all the thing that you've seen
And now it won't shine for anyone
And I been oh hell no
Baby love has gone
But as we get older oh, our vision becomes blurred
Misfire
I really want to come kick it with you
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Now you're mine
But you gotta stay strong, don't let your knees buckle
I gave it all and managed to get shot down yet again
The time is here for being straight
And laugh with love
Why is everybody so obsessed
Haun' sofort wieder ab, wenn es dir hier nicht gefallt
Not who I was in the spring
And I miss everyone
That waves will wash the grey away
Oh, you've never heard of me
Now that I'm not alone
Everybody look to the left, to the left
Quelle heure estil  Je ne sais pas 
Is nothing permanent
The girls ask the guys
Got a dirty mouth
We'll stay on the phone until dawning
When you are alone
Thought you would be the one it's
So I left it beside the road
Where your skinhead friend passed out for several hours on the bathroom floor
No pushing buttons, no telling lies
We all kinda fumbled through the Jitterbug
And you my lover
Singing myself to sleep
Singin' original songs by the original masters
And the way your shaking it at the club,
C'est pas grave ca reviendra
What I've strung together
Yeah, yeah
She crawled right in, oh my
Oh, a kind, and honest man honest man
And my broken heart
And I think I've seen the light, Yeah I think I see the light, I'll be here for
And when you sneak out at night
That's what she said to me
Its such a shallow scene
Although it's dark and black
You call me up around noon and
Said it's days like these kicking back
Mayla, long time
And the darkest grays
It's never gonna work, I don't know what I'm doing in here
Moonlight on the beach, sweet amphetamines
Why don't I fall in love with you
But no matter what daylight brings to us
I've only count the sunny hours, brightest hours of day
Sometimes it's hard to dream
Hide under the bed
To save the world or go to work
But the happy music will carry on
I feel it more and more
I'm going where there ain't no fear
But are you man enough to wear it"
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely
To throw your arms around
Hey here comes a comeback
Now I'm five feet under the ground
It's not that strange, when all I have to say
So shut shut shut your eyes 
But you got some bait awaiting and I think I might
Everybody has to demonstrate
In your hospital room 
And do I always think I'm right
Oh, once you crawl in you'll never come back again
Ah, one I haven't cashed yet, all right
Please keep a eye on those red haired boys
It's this week
