Hmmmmm
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woke up on the right side of the bed
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
Hands up if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time
Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time
Good morning and goodnight
I wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time
(It's always a good time)
Whoa-oh-oh
Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again
Checked out of my room, hit the ATM
Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time
Good morning and goodnight
I wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

In a small ghost town, there's a little arcade
Where the poltergeists play their video games
("On the roof" he says)
"Game over" they said
"Game over" they said, run and get your quarters in
(Over cliffs we will swim ahead)
Do the shackles underneath your bed
Haunt the records in their grooves?
(And he said "Inside of them")
Salem is home
Sentenced to live
Yes, this I know
Comes back tenfold, fold, fold
Run and get your quarters in
At the bottom of a french blue pool
Roamed the drunk chipped tooth
Of the man in the moon
("Jump on the roof" he said)
Burn, furnace burn
At the bottom of the cliff
Shined a diamond with no end to its trip
(Over cliffs we will swim ahead)
Do the shackles underneath your bed
Haunt the records in their grooves?
(And they said "It's all over")
Salem is home
Sentenced to live
Yes, this I know
Comes back tenfold, fold, fold
Hook and sinker
Hook and sinker
Hook and sinker
Hook and sinker
I wrote it all down for you
Match a name to the face, do you suspect?
Do you confess?
Do you confess?
Sentenced to live
Salem is home
Yes, this I know
Comes back tenfold, fold, fold
It's funny how we've seem to made it, funny how we can even walk up straight.
Last night you sat home waiting, and I got home much too late, yeah to late.
So what if we loose our minds, so what if it doesn't make much sense.
At least we know we're lazy, at least we know how to play, we're so great.
Well come on, well come on, hon' get up and dance with me yeah.
Well no more, well no more blue days and lonely years.
And I'm afraid I need my baby, I'm afraid he doesn't know it yet.
Someday I will tell him maybe, It's been like this since I don't know when, but it's great.
Well come on, well come on, hon' get up and dance with me yeah.
Well no more, well no more blue days and lonely years.
Well come on, well come on, hon' get up and dance with me yeah.
Well no more, well no more blue days for you my dear.
I was been told, you will never grow old, if you live your too fast.
But I don't need to rest, I'm not old and tired, but I've been through fire and I've seen enough,
And I might never be the same again, but have you seen my friends, they're just the same.
Well come on, well come on, hon' get up and dance with me yeah.
Well no more, well no more blue days and lonely years.
Well come on, well come on, hon' get up and dance with me yeah.
Well no more, well no more blue days for you my dear
It starts in the morning
When you're lying next to me
I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm rolling so quickly
Now I'm not a doctor
And I'm not a lawyer
I get a prescription and set it on fire
Blow me a kiss, I'll be happy for the rest of my life
And I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
And I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
Oh, oh, aw
And I'm so happy
And I really shouldn't like it
But I love it
When I say I'm not excited
You're invited
And I think I'm getting older
There's this weight across ma shoulder
It's a shame we're the same
Such a shame I'm to blame all the time
But early this evening
I wanted to be with you
I got on the blower
The next thing I know you're speaking
Now I'm gonna tell you what I've been thinking
And I've got a hunch that you're thinking the same thing and with some luck
We'll be lying together tonight
And I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
And I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
Oh, oh, aw
And I'm so happy
Oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, ah
And I'm so happy
Up every evening 'bout a
Half eight or nine I give my 
Complete attention to a 
Very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a
He's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
I brought my baby home, she
She sat around forlorn
She saw my TVC one five
And baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my
She crawled right in my
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
Oh, so demonic, oh my TVC one five
Maybe if I pray every
Each night I sit there pleading
Send back my dream test baby
She's my main feature
My TVC one five, he
He just stares back unblinking
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way
Be with my baby, then
We'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
My baby's in there someplace
Love's rating in the sky

If I died tomorrow would this song live on forever?
Here is my... unopened letter to a world
That never shall reply
If I died tomorrow would this song live on forever?
Here is my... unopened letter to a world
That never shall reply, never shall reply
From this second story window I can hear the church bells
Calling out my name. This table is set for one
Even angels would be homesick in this forsaken town
On random notes of parchment I'm scrawling my existence,
Dressed in white. This candle radiates throughout the night
And it's never burning out, Never burning out
From this second story window I can hear the children
Down on Main Street. They're singing their songs tonight
In the shadows, I will listen to their every movement
Mr. Higginson, am I not good enough for the world?
Am I destined only to die the same way that I lived...
In seclusion?
From high up on this mountain I can almost see
Your lonely windowsill. They'll carry you off tonight
There's a ghost in your old bedroom
And a candle burning bright
If I died tomorrow
Would this song live on forever?
There are worse ways for a guy to spend his time
Than to sit and think of you
I think I'd marry you
Just your smile 
Keeps me satisfied
Though you're not mine
So for the rest of my life
I'm gonna search for someone just like you
And we tend the garden all day long
Watching history unfold
And I'd be enough
And you'd be enough
And we'd grow old
So for the rest of my life
I'm gonna search for someone just like you
For the rest of my life
I'm gonna search for someone just like you
Yeah, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna search for someone just like you
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'll shine up my old brown shoes
I'll put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work
If you say that you love me
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Feeling all alone without a friend you know you feel like dying
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me
I'll shine up my old brown shoes

Well, if you really love me
Won't you tell me
(If you really love me
Won't you tell me)
And if you really love me
Won't you tell me, yeah
Then I won't have to be
Playin' around
You call my name, ooh, so sweet
To make your kissing complete
When your mood is clear
You quickly change your ways
Then you say I'm untrue
What am I supposed to do
Be a fool who sits alone
Waiting for you
But if you really love me
Won't you tell me
(If you really love me
Won't you tell me)
And if you really love me 
Won't you tell me, yeah
Then I won't have to be
Playin' around
I see the light of your smile
Calling me all the while
You are saying baby it's time to go
First the feeling's all right
Then it's gone from sight
So I've taken out this time to say
Whoa, oh, if you really love me 
Won't you tell me
(If you really love me 
Won't you tell me)
And if you really love me
Won't you tell me
Baby, tell me

Playin' around

What will we do, Gwyn?
What will we do, Gwyn?
Everything's a mess,
'Cause when I touch your arm, I can tell.
Caught in this static,
I think it's your heart, cause you don't want me around.
Stocks are in the Dow,
But you have to work now, so get out of bed.
What will we do, Jen?
What will we do, Jenny?
Market crash, out of cash, we're in the poor house.
Honey pie, don't 'cha cry, we're still together.
Buy and sell, may as well invest in the weather.
Honey pie, you know I'll love you forever.
Stocks are in the Dow,
But you have to work now, so get out of bed.
Caught in this old room,
I think it's your heart, but you already know.
What were we thinking?
What were we thinking?
Everything's a mess,
'Cause when I touch your arm, I can tell.
You'll have to sell your car.
'Cause when I touch your arm, I can tell...
Why are the Robots so sad?
We're not in trouble anymore... anyway
And no more
Synthetic fighting
They stopped the lightning
After today...
When they took the beach that day
They stole the children
Took them away
And I miss everyone...
But most of all the little ones
And their shiny toy guns...
Each and every one of us still pray
Hoping for evidence
...Looking for clues
All the robotic families
Searching the circuitry
For what remains
When they took the beach that day
They stole the children
Took them away
And I miss everyone...
But most of all the little ones
And their shiny toy guns...
I remember mother that day
When her tears woke us so quietly
From our dreams
She told us
That father's sleeping
And he is watching
From far away...
(And their shiny toy guns)
When they took the beach that day
They stole the children
Took them away
And I miss everyone...
But most of all the little ones
And their shiny toy guns...
Nighttime slows
Raindrops splash rainbows
Perhaps someone you know 
Could sparkle and shine
As daydreams slide 
To colour from shadow
Picture the moonglow 
That dazzles my eyes
And I love you
Just lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple every time
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple every time
Dream of sights
Of sleigh rides in seasons
Where feelings not reasons
Can make you decide
As leaves pour down
Splash Autumn on gardens
As colder nights harden
Their moonlit delights
And I love you
Just lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple every time
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple every time
Look at me with starry eyes
Push me up to starry skies
There's stardust in my head
Pure and simple every time
Fresh and deep as oceans new
Shiver at the sight of you
I'll sing a softer tune
Pure and simple over you
If love's the truth then look no lies
And let me swim around your eyes
I've found a place I'll never leave
Shut my mouth and just believe
Love is the truth I realize
Not a stream of pretty lies
To use us up
And waste our time
Lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple every time
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple every time
Look at me with starry eyes
Push me up to starry skies
There's stardust in my head
Pure and simple every time
Fresh and deep as oceans new
Shiver at the sight of you
I'll sing a softer tune
Pure and simple over you
Pure and simple just for you
Make it

Come on LA, take advantage
Give me a night that I won't forget

From the Sky Bar to the Standard, nothing took
These boys don't care
Got a handful with their projects and with their looks
Where are all the men in this town?
And what's a girl supposed to do?
Did they all run off when they knew
That I was coming round, coming round?
Where are all the men in this town?
And what's a girl supposed to do?

Wintertime in London, are you making plans?
Are you still rocking Converse with your old Ray Bans
If you're sitting in the places that we use to be
Or if you're somewhere listening to Bob Marley
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me
Do you still pick up the seashells on that pebble beach?
Remember when that crab came up and pinched your feet
When that old guy gave us all those drinks for free
Do you still get knocked down by that Bacardi Breeze?
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me
Oh yes, you are
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me
Oh, ooh, yeah, no point regretting that it didn't last
No point regretting that it went so fast
Time that we had was like sand in our hands
But when I look behind, I'm so glad that you were mine
I remember taking you home on that 86
Standing in your doorway where we use to kiss
Then your dad came out and chased me down the street
If you remember just how scared I use to be
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me
I know, wherever you go
That you'll be thinking about me now
I know, wherever you go
That you'll be thinking about me
Bumped into Irene down in Waterloo
She told me that you got yourself somebody new
She said you musta like him 'cause he's, oh, so nice
But I remember that you like a pinch of spice, well I
I know, wherever you go
That you'll be thinking about me now
I know, wherever you go
That you'll be thinking about me now
I know, wherever you go
That you'll be thinking about me now
I know, wherever you go
That you'll be thinking about me now
Wherever you go, you'll be thinking about me
You'll be thinking about me now
Everyone, anyone who want to hear
Move in a little closer, let me tell you about
A love natural, oh that love actual
Love that you just can't help feeling
When feelings with meanings keep on appearing
And it's almost midnight, the time is coming up
The time is getting closer, the time is almost here
Life is upon us and the time for love is here and now
When I look at you, oh I feel my heart
Oh, I feel your love deep inside
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Let me tell you something, oh
Something you may not believe, yeah
Let me talk about this feeling
Inside that's happening to me, oh
Oh yeah it's almost our time, the feeling's coming up
The moment to get closer, the moment's almost here
Life is upon us and the time for love is here and now
When I look at you, oh I feel my heart
Oh, I feel your love deep inside
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
All the way, yeah we're moving, oh
Gonna find our love today
The love go on and on
And we're climbin' all the way to the top of the highest mountain
Flyin' through the skies we've never seen before
And we're divin' to the depths of the deepest ocean
Sailin' all the seas we've never seen before
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Let the bough break let it come down crashing
Let the sun fade out to a dark sky
Can't say I'd even notice it was absent
'Cause I could live by the light in your eyes
I'll unfold before you
What I've strung together
The very first words of a lifelong love letter
Tell the world that we finally got it all right
I choose you
I will become yours and you will become mine
I choose you
I choose you
There was a time when I would have believed them
If they told me you could not come true, just love's illusion
But then you found me and everything changed
And I believe in something again
My whole heart will be yours forever
This is a beautiful start
To a lifelong love letter
Tell the world that we finally got it all right
I choose you
I will become yours and you will become mine
I choose you
I choose you
We are not perfect we'll learn from our mistakes and as long as it takes I will
Prove my love to you
I am not scared of the elements I am underprepared but I am willing
And even better, I get to be the other half of you
Tell the world that we finally got it all right
I choose you
I will become yours and you will become mine
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane
What is it about you that has commandeered my brain?
Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
When I look at your face I can tell that you're not going to be stopping soon or even slowing down
And if we keep up this pace pretty soon we'll know the name of every kid and every grown up booking house shows in their town
And if home is really where the heart is
Then we're the smartest kids I know
Because wherever we are in this great big world
We'll never be more than a few hours from home
And that's important because I need to travel
I've had this itchin in my shoes since I was just a little kid
And before I had a mini van I rode the Greyhound bus
My mom would say "I hope some day you get paid for being Kimya Dawson"
And now I do and it's not much
But it's enough
I've got my Scrabble game, food on my plate, good friends and family
And now there's you understanding why I do the things I do
Knowing that you do them too makes me really happy
On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
From a distance, the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance, the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight
(Whispering)
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
I'll be dun-ah dun-ah dun-ah
I'll be the greatest man of your life
'Cause I like going for hikes and riding bikes
And playing video games in the middle of the night
And I'll stay up late and I won't even care
That we're getting up early to go to the state fair
I'm gonna ride the biggest ride, it'll be out of sight
Then I'll share an elephant ear with you if you'd like
Because we are alive so we've gotta live life
To the fullest you spin the bottle and I'll dim the lights
Four five six seven minutes in the closet
You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane
What is it about you that has commandeered my brain?
Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
You go straight to the top you're not scared of getting squashed
You know just when to jump off
You are so brave
And then you run to the right it seems there's no hope in sight
And you drop down to the tube that takes you right to level eight
Life is a highway and I'm gonna ride it
Every day's a winding road yeah
My rollercoaster's got the biggest ups and downs
As long as it keeps goin' round its unbelievable
Life is a highway and I'm gonna ride it
Every day's a winding road yeah
My rollercoaster's got the biggest ups and downs
As long as it keeps goin' round its unbelievable
It wasn't supposed to be like this;
Another dose of unhappiness
I gave it all and managed to get shot down yet again
So I got drunk, had sex with all your friends
You told me that I should never call your house again
Emily (Emily), ah
You saved the day
Emily (Emily), ah
When you threw me away
She was always such a pretty girl, nobody like her in the world
A little piece of heavenly that no one else could stand
I see her in my dreams at night, I see her when I close my eyes
I just can't seem to shake Emily
You got your money and I got cast
Outside, thrown out on my ass
In the city with no one else,
Nowhere else to go
So then I hooked up with a model from Singapore
Emily, I sure am glad you didn't want me anymore
Emily (Emily), ah
You saved the day
Emily (Emily), ah
When you threw me away
She was always such a pretty girl, nobody like her in the world
A little piece of heavenly that no one else could stand
I see her in my dreams at night, I see her when I close my eyes
I just can't seem to shake Emily, Emily
She was always such a pretty girl, nobody like her in the world
A little piece of heavenly that no one else could stand
I see her in my dreams at night, I see her when I close my eyes
I just can't seem to shake, Emily, yeah
Emily (Emily), ah
You saved the day
Emily (Emily), ah
You saved the day
Emily (Emily), ah
Emily (Emily), ah
You saved my ass
I saw on TV about this little kid
Who had a pig for a pet
His mom had once been attacked by a dog
So a pig was the closest thing he could get
This has of course nothing to do with anything
I just get so nervous when I'm talking to you
All I think about everyday is just kissing you
An old feeling that feels refreshingly new
Kanske ar jag kar i dig
I offered you some chocolate
You declined so sweetly and commented on my jacket:
"Makes you look like a lumberjack
But are you man enough to wear it?"
I said: "It used to be my grand-grandfather's
What could I do but inherit it?"
My words are just c-c-c-coming out all wrong
I sure could use a little help
But I think I'm gonna drop my cool now
Best way to touch your heart is to make an ass of myself
Kanske ar jag k...
There's something about you
Tears me inside out whenever you're around
There's something about you
Speeding through my veins until we hit the ground
And there's something about this rush
Take it away
It made me feel so good
I get a feeling, you get a feeling, we got a feeling
Like we could die
Mother
We just can't get enough
We just can't get enough
Lover
We just gotta get it up
We just gotta get it up
There's something about you
That tears me inside out whenever you're around
And there's something about you
That makes me fly
You're a heart attack, just the kind I like!
And there's something about your kiss
Haunting and strange
That makes me feel so good
I get a feeling, you get a feeling we got a feeling
Like we're alive
Mother
We just can't get enough
We just can't get enough
Lover
We just gotta get it up
We just gotta get it up
This world ain't got too much time
But baby I'm fine because maybe you're mine
We just can't get enough
You better give up, come on and give up
Give up your life
It's you for me, and me for you
You make my dreams come true
Off the wall, I wanna say,
I gotta be with you now, baby,
You're on my mind all the time
I found a million dimes
I rolled the dice, and lost them all
And baby I just don't mind, mind, mind, mind--
Mother
We just can't get enough
We just can't get enough
Lover
We just gotta get it up
We just gotta get it up
This world ain't got too much time
But baby I'm fine because maybe you're mine
We just gotta get it up, we just gotta get it up,
Because Mother...
Woo, yeah
Social Security Number please
Credit card number please
Money please
Money please
Money please
Please deposit 85 dollars
For the next three minutes please
Aw yeah, all right, feel good tonight
You make me happy, whether you know it or not
We should be happy, that's what I said from the start
I am so happy, knowing you are the one
That I want for the rest of my days
For the rest of my days
You're all of my days.
You're lookin' so cool, you're lookin' so fly
I can't deny that when I'm staring
You down, right dead in the eye
I wanna try to be the person you want
The person you need
It's hard to conceive
That somebody like you could be with
Someone like me
I'm happy knowing that you are mine
The grass is greener on the other si-ide
The more I think, the more I wish
That we could lay here for hours, and just-a reminisce
Uh Ooh Ooh
You're lookin' so fresh
It's catching my eye
Why, oh why, did I not see this before,
The girl I adore was right in front of me?
And now I'll take a step back and look in your eye
And ask why it took so long to see
We're meant to be
I'm happy knowing that you are mine
The grass is greener on the other si-ide
The more I think, the more I wish
That we could lay here for hours and just-a reminisce
On the good, the bad, the ugly
The smiles, the laughs, the funny,
Or all the things we put each other through
It's for you, for you, for you.
You make me happy, whether you know it or not
We should be happy, that's what I said from the start
I am so happy, knowing you are the one
That I want for the rest of my days
For the rest of my days
You're all of my days.
I'm happy knowing that you are mine
The grass is greener on the other si-ide
The more I think, the more I wish
That we could lay here for hours and just-a reminisce.
Uh Ooh Ooh
spoken:
He went away and you hung around
And bothered me, every night
And when I wouldn't go out with you
You said things that weren't very nice
My boyfriend's back and you're gonna be in trouble

(La-day-la, my boyfriend's back)
Because he knows I've been true now...
I used to love The Tenderloin
Till I made some tender coin
Then I met some ladies from Marin
We took the highway to the One
Up the coast to catch some sun
They left me with these blisters on my skin
Don't know what I was on but I think it grows in Oregon
So, I kept on going, going, gone right through
I drove into Seattle rain, fell in love, then missed the train
That coulda took me right back home to you
I been high
I been low
I been yes
And I been oh hell no
I been rock 'n' roll and disco
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
Ooh ooh ooh, oh oh
Every day's so caffeinated
I wish they were Golden Gated
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away
So, wrap me up, return to sender
Let's forget this five year bender
Take me to my city by the Bay
I never knew all that I had
Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad
At least they'd have a hella fine merlot
If I could wish upon a star
I would hitch a cable car
To the place that I can always call my own
I been high
I been low
I been yes
And I been oh hell no
I been rock 'n' roll and disco
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
I been up
I been down
I been so damn lost since you're not around
I been reggae and calypso
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
To tell you the truth
I miss everything... everything
It's a wild, wide, beautiful world
But there's a wide-eyed girl back there
And she means everything... everything
I been stop
I been go
I been yes
And I been oh hell no
I been rock 'n' roll and disco
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
I been up
I been down
I been so damn lost since you're not around
I been reggae and calypso
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
Ooh ooh ooh, oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh, oh oh (Save me, San Francisco)
Ooh ooh ooh, oh oh
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
Ooh ooh ooh, oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh, oh oh (Save me, San Francisco)
Ooh ooh ooh, oh oh
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
On a Tuesday in the rain, I never thought there'd come a day
I never thought there'd come a day, yeah
If I put myself to the test, would I ever raise a fist?
Would I just shut my mouth, would I just block it out?
I've sworn a million times
Never to be left again with that feeling
Of hopelessness, left standing
Just nervous in the alley
I've sworn a million times
Never to be left again with that feeling
Of hopelessness, left standing
Just nervous in the alley
Just nervous in the alley
And when all is said and through, would I know just what to do?
Would I know just what to do, yeah?
If I put myself to the test, would I ever raise a fist?
Would I just shut my mouth, would I just block it out?
I've sworn a million times
Never to be left again with that feeling
Of hopelessness, left standing
Just nervous in the alley
I've sworn a million times
Never to be left again with that feeling
Of hopelessness, left standing
Just nervous in the alley
Just nervous in the alley
Just nervous in the alley
Just nervous in the alley
Is it a change of heart that keeps us apart?
You say it's true, know it's true, nothing left except for me and you
It's not that strange, when all I have to say
Is I wonder what I'm fighting for?
I've sworn a million times
Never to be left again with that feeling
Of hopelessness, left standing
Just nervous in the alley
I've sworn a million times
Never to be left again with that feeling
Of hopelessness, left standing
Just nervous in the alley
Just nervous in the alley
Just nervous in the alley
Just nervous in the alley
Just nervous in the alley
Always the true one, calm, selective, 
Staking a claim among the young defectives far off under the nighttime,
Baby, crawl into the wave.
Got to be cool now, unprotected.
You come around every day to collect me far off into the nighttime,
Baby, crawl into the wave.
Come on, give it to me.
Yes, those mystery hours,
Yes, those mystery hours.
But, officers, the rumbling!
The sound of the collective crumbling around to the ground.
Surrender the town. 
I call out the numbers, the rumble of collected thunder today.
The wages are down.
Come on, give it to me.
Yes, those mystery hours,
Yes, those mystery hours.
Mystery hours...
But, officers, the rumbling!
The sound of the collective crumbling around to the ground.
Surrender the town. 
I call out the numbers, the rumble of collected thunder today.
The wages are down.
Come on, give it to me.
Yes, those mystery hours,
Yes, those mystery hours.
There's an hour of sunshine for a million years of rain 
But somehow that always seems to be enough
When love falls from the sky nobody ever asks why
You just take it or you leave it where it was
But there's just one kind of love you can spend your life dreaming of
For the love of a sweet-lovin' man
Some have traveled far and wide
Some have given up and died
For the love of a sweet-lovin' man
Some have broken down and cried
Some have turned to dust inside
But I'll stay right here and hide 
In the arms of my sweet-lovin' man
Until you've had sweet lovin' there's no lovin' worth the name
But you can go blind from crying all the time
And who said life was easy and who said a man was fair?
Well I wish you well but keep your paws off mine
You can't buy one at the mall but he'll come if you just call...
You are missing that kissing when we're over
Boy what I'm feeling never feel it about another
I need you, why can't you come over
And you my lover
But I love you like a brother
Baby don't want at the end of the day
You are who you are
And I love it that way
Lasting love, if you know the difference
You had a little game on ya
Caught up in your feelings
We together like, oh
You know that imma do whatever I'm not gon' leave
This kind of love don't come easy
We don't care what they think
Promise we'll stay the same
Say that you stay right here for me
See I know you like being round chicks
Turn looking at hips, and a little outfit
What can I say
That's what I love about you babe

Make a nigga scream and shout, shout
Every time the lights go out out

On a bus stop bench sat an ancient lady
It was clear she was dead yeah we all could agree
And that death had arrived quite unexpectedly
Cause the poor wretch died with a book on her knee
Chrissy kiss the corpse
Chrissy kiss the corpse
David drew a mustache under her nose
Nick put a burning match between her toes
I put a cockroach in her pantyhose
Chrissy put on some lipstick
And struck a dramatic pose
Chrissy kiss the corpse
Chrissy kiss the corpse
Chrissy's such a pretty lass
As benign as broken glass
No one in her family knows
The vile hobby that she chose
Some cops came by so we hid behind a tree
I peeked out and they noticed me
And said fondling the dead is a felony
But you got nothing to fear
'Cause we only came to see
Chrissy kiss the corpse
To see Chrissy kiss the corpse
Chrissy's such a pretty thing
Gentle as a scorpion sting
No one ever would suspect
That her mind's completely wrecked
A wicked decision
We can agree
A wicked decision
Nothing's wrong with you and me
A week in the forest
A week in the fog
You'll be sad to hear that
I I I I I was robbed
And we're gonna own it
A fist to the voice
And we've found the music
Why did you try at the choice?
And decapitation
For failing to see
Nothing in this whole wide world saves us from this situation
(Nothing can save us)
Don't stop talkin' to me please
Baby cut me all to pieces
If you really want hell, hell
Ripped apart by the crows not the vultures
No one in this fair new world can talk us through this situation
Speak in the garden
You burn down the trees
I'll leave out the teasin'
While you are down on one knee
Never is heavy
And heavy is fine
But only in the street man
You ate your words wrong this time
It's wicked where you tread
Shot an arrow in your head
Since the apple wasn't there, yeah.
Ripped apart by the crows and the vultures
Ignore me in the parking lot
I'm petrified by conversation.
It's wicked where you tread
They shot an arrow at your head
Since the apple wasn't there, yeah.
We're ripped apart by the crow and the vultures
Ignore me in the parking lot
I'm petrified by conversation.
Lead on 
To keep our feelings strong 
And make me still believe 
Our page is one and the same 
Our ways will separate tonight 
You say if we were to wait 
Some things just might be changed 
I say that I don't have the strength 
To fuel a burning flame 
Speak to me 
What can I say, we just live too far away 
That's a shame that love can make you stay 
Sweet thing 
I hope that you know I'm wondering where you are 
You say this could work someday 
When you and I both know this is the end 
Leave me the way it has to be 
Excuse my poor excuse 
Tell me that insecurities 
Are what drove me to you 
And everyday I compare your face
From sweet beginnings to your bitter end 
Sweet thing 
I hope that you know I'm wondering where you are 
You say this could work someday 
When you and I both know this is the end 
Let me let go 
Sweet thing 
I hope that you know I'm wondering where you are 
You say this could work someday 
When you and I both know this is the end

Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture
'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie? Valerie? Valerie?
Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house up on for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
And are you shoppin' anywhere,
Changed the color of you hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay the fine
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?
'Cause, Since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie? Valerie? Valerie?
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water

Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie? Valerie? Valerie? Valerie? oh Valerie? Valerie? Valerie?
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
Logos is the king of life
Always under the bed
Spirits floating in the night
Will they ever find their way?
Logos is the king of life
Who gives us the drive
We need to stay
Anything we find out
Always drives us away
Spirits floating in the night
Will they ever find their way?
Spirits floating in the night
Will they ever find their way?
Spirits floating in the night
Will they ever find their way?
Logos is the king of life
Fights away all decay
Everything was bathed in light
Everything loved it's way
Everything makes sense when you
Look at it from another way
Logos is the king of life
Leads away decay
Logos is the king of life
Fights away all that decay
Spirits drifting in the night
Will they ever find their way?

Never be the lonely one so
Hold me tight tonight, tonight
It's you, you, you, you
Oh no
What it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right now
Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you, so
Hold me tight tonight, tonight
It's you, you, you, you
I can't tell what kind of life I've led today
All that's known is what's debatable again
Oh, I can't see where you are
Where is the problem?
Squared-off, all bother
We're not to blame
And I can't see the darker wood
Squared-off, all bother
Where is the problem?
We're not to blame
I can't tell what kind of life I've led today
All that's known is what's debatable again
And I imagine I will see you there
You will have long flowers in your hair
I imagine I will see you there
This is the blood that we're made of
So tell it like a chronicle
Who's dancing all around?
Let's give it to me, give it to me now
We're dancing all around
Let's give it to me, give it to me now
And I imagine I will see you there
You will have long flowers in your hair
The telegram said: are you gonna call our way home?
I imagine I will see you there
Can't you hear the laughter in the air?
The telegram said: are you gonna call our way home?
And I imagine I will see you there
I know it's stout but it's shallow
I'm not aware
The Taliban said: who rejuvenated your eyes, boy?
This is the blood that we're made of
Go tell it like a chronicle
Who's dancing all around?
Let's give it to me, give it to me now
We're dancing all around
Let's give it to me, give it to me now
This is the blood that we're made of
Go tell it like a chronicle
We're dancing all around
Let's give it to me, give it to me now
Going loco down in Acapulco if you stay too long
Yes
You'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong.
Feel the pressure
Your back's against the wall
Love is gainig on you
You're just about to fall.
If you're afraid to love
Afraid to take a chance
You better hide your feelings
Get out while you can.
'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
...
You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
Memories are lost and found
Leaving broken hearts all over town.
'Cause you'll be going loco down in acapulco if you stay too long
...
You'll be pulling out your hair
Drowning in despair
With a whole lot of nothing on your way to nowhere.
Your search for paradise will come to an end
When you realize what a fool you've been.
You'll be haunted by her face
Missing her warm embrace
Memories of loving her
Holding her tight every night.
Was that the best part of your life?
Hearing her voice soft and low
Begging you to please
Please don't go.
Don't go
No! Don't go! Don't go! -
You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
...
'Cause you'll be going loco down in acapulco if you stay too long
...
Going loco down in acapulco if you stay too long
...
Going loco down in acapulco if you stay too long
...

Baby you got me sick
I don't know what I did
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah
Got your voice in my head
Sayin' "let's just be friends"
Can't believe the words came out of your mouth, yeah
I'm trying to be okay
I'm trying to be alright
But seeing you with him
Just don't feel right
And I'm like
Ow!
Never thought it'd hurt so bad
Getting over you and ow!
You're giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do
'Cause you're all I ever wanted,
Thought you would be the one it's ...
Ow!
Giving me a heart attack 
Getting over you
Yeah
Baby now that you're gone
I can't stand dumb love songs
Missing you is all I'm thinking about, yeah.
Everyone's telling me I'm just too blind to see
How you messed me up, I'm better off now
I'm trying to be okay
I'm trying to be alright
But seeing you with him
Just don't feel right
And I'm like ow!
Never thought it'd hurt so bad
Getting over you and ow!
You're giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do
'Cause you're all I ever wanted,
Thought you would be the one it's ...
Ow!
Giving me a heart attack 
Getting over you
Oh, oh
Yeah every time you look like that, oh oh
You're givin' me a heart attack.
But seeing you with him
Just don't feel right
And I'm like
Ow!
Never thought it'd hurt so bad
Getting over you and ow!
You're giving me a heart attack
Looking like you do 
'Cause you're all I ever wanted,
Thought you would be the one it's...
Ow!
Giving me a heart attack 
Getting over you
You're all I ever wanted.
Ow!
Yeah
Everytime you look like that
You're all I ever wanted
You're giving me a heart attack
OooW!
Look both ways when you leave the building
The wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
While the children of makeshift hills
Let the code of silence repeat 16 times
When we get delayed can we cast a line towards anyone dismayed
Can we go it alone say say say
Caught me listening to water dripping
From those old lips to a town where its dry
When you leave don't say
That anyone here will be thinking in modern ways
Can we go it alone say say say
Look both ways when you leave the building
The wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
Here underwater we're down. Here underwater way down.
Heads up, heads up, heads up
You hold me up
You hold me down and up
And down and up
And up and down
Heads up, heads up, heads up
You hold me glad
You told me now and then
Every now and then
Every then and now
Not talking about holiday
Pretend my feet are running away
Well if my feet don't touch the ground
Well hot sick fat lip
Fall before I get out of it
Heads up, heads up, heads up
You hold me up
You hold me down and up
And down and up
And up and down
Heads up, heads up, heads up
You hold me glad
You told me now and then
Every now and then
Every then and now x25
I'm under attack again my dear
I'm in the way
Got no resolutions, no clever anecdotes to say
And still, if I yell at the top of my lungs
Will it be the same
I'd fly you a flag, I'd bury this pen into my veins
I want to feel through you tonight
But I won't make you, I won't make you
The telephone number I got from you says nobody's home 
The best thing I can think to do right now is leave it alone
And you had an apology in your mailbox since last July
It's funny when you find the words to say
You find no reply
I want to feel through you tonight
But I won't make you, I won't make you
Scream my name just one more time
But I won't make you, I won't make you
And it's been hours now, to be here like this
And just to lay you down
And just to taste your lips
And just to keep me up, God I'm so tired of sleeping
And just to lay inside you, and just to know this feeling
I want to feel through you tonight
But I won't make you, I won't make you
Scream my name just one more time
But I won't make you, I won't make you
Oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh
Oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh
Oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh
Oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh (Yeah)
We were born in the desert, we were reared in a cave
We conquered in the sun, but we lived in the shade
Yeah baby we were savage, we existed to kill
Our history is damaged, at least it was a thrill
But now we can see, now that our vision is strong
We don't need to admit, we were wrong
Now we can see, but the images don't stick
Our enemies lay dead on the ground and still we kick, hey!
Oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh
Oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh
Now we can see the warnings and the signs
Reading between the lines, like writing on the wall
Now we can see what do we need?
We should need nothing, nothing at all (Yeah)
We were born on an island, we grew out of the sand
Never saw another creature, never knew another man
Yeah baby we were nothin', we existed for less
Our present was empty, our history a mess
But now we can see, now we do as we please
Now we do away with our disease
Now we can see, now the image sticks
We still need the medicine quick
We still take the pill, but only for the fix, hey!
Now we can see the warnings and the signs
Reading between the lines, like writing on the wall
Now we can see, what do we need?
We should need nothing, nothing at all
Oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh
Oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh, oh way-ow oh-whoa-oh
Yeah now we can see
Bajando de la montana en seguida me puse a cantar una cancion sin motivo pero tu te tenias que quejar y siempre estas asi no puedes parar no puedes entender que quiero estar solo que no puedo ser como los demas que solo significa sin nadie alrededor y si me voy ya no se como vas a poder decir que lo que hago es cosa tuya y yo solo voy detras a repetir lo que digas tu como el loro al dueno si todos saben que soy el que te ensena las historias de naves espaciales los tambores y los pasos de baile y en vez de estar nadando juntos en el fondo del mar en una hoguera con los cuentos de noche me querias quemar y siempre estas asi no puedes parar no puedes entender que quiero estar solo que no puedo ser como los demas que solo significa sin nadie alrededor
She doesn't have the answer yet
The answer yet
I'm breathing down her neck
Maybe I should give her time
If it were up to me
She would know that 
She'll be the one
When I'm dead will use my bed
And she'll spend her life
Thinking of us and making a fuss
If it were up to me
She would know that our love (our love)
Is the best love (best love)
If it were up to me
Yes, our love (our love)
Is real love
So just let it be
I want you to know
I've done our charts and it says
That we work as one
Like the Jackson 5
And the Temptations
If it were up to me
She would know that our love (our love)
Is the best love (best love)
If it were up to me
Yes, our love (our love)
Is real love
So just let it be
Well, your mother likes my smile
And your father likes my lifestyle
Should I ask them what I asked you
To get the answer?
Yes, to get the answer?
It's easy (easy)
It's easy (easy)
It's easy (easy)
Oh, it's easy
Your mother likes my smile
And your father likes my lifestyle
Should I ask them what I asked you
To get the answer?
Yes, to get the answer?
'Cause our love (our love)
Is the best love (best love)
If it were up to me, yeah yeah
Yes, our love (our love)
Oh, it's real love
So just let it be
It's easy (easy)
It's easy (easy)
Oh, it's easy

It don't matter what you find
Or the way you find it 
Don't matter what you find
Or the way you find it
I'll take my eyes off the prize
And never was it your eye be
Sit you alone
At the trees they are...
Maybe I could fall
Baby, I could fall apart
To conceal, to protect, to serve and to reject
I'm turning into something
Go all the way to the right
I'm going past, I'm going past, I'm going past the next two lights
Hit the streets
They talk to me
A fickle beast who's nice today
It's such a waste, another day
Such a waste, But it feels great
But it feels great
It feels great
Everything has taken a turn
In disguise as what I want
I can leave her
I cantilever
But I keep coming back for more
I'm turning into something
Go all the way to the right
I'm going past, I'm going past, I'm going past the next two lights
But it feels great today
It may be a waste
Another day
It feels great
It may be a waste
Another day
But it feels great
It feels great

We turn it up, we turn it up.
We're coming up, we're coming up. 
Out in the streets, I hear the crack of thunder. 
People keeping low, people searching for some cover,
But in my room, I hear the sound of trumpets,
Meeting me through the field that keeps us in.
We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up. 
We don't care what you say
Message to the world, can you feel the heat is rising? 
From the heights of above the storm,
Can you see the lighting flashing?
From where I live, I can hear the voices joining.
Like trumpets, through the field they use to keep us in. 
We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up. 
We don't care what you say
If you're afraid, fear will only break your heart. 
If you're afraid, you know your walls will keep them away. 
We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up. 
We don't care what you say
When we're all in the crowd and you catch her eye
And then you both smile, I feel so good inside
And when I'm with her she talks about you, the things that you say, the things that you do
It feels so good to know two people so in love, so in love
They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something
It's so hard to find
They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something
You don't often find
And she takes your hand when the world stays outside
That's something to see, that's nothing to hide
And when I feel bad when people disappoint me
That's when I need you two to help me believe
It feels so good to know two people so in love, so in love
They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something
It's so hard to find
They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something
You don't often find
It feels so good to know two people so in love, so in love
They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something
It's so hard to find
They are friends of mine
They are friends of mine
And they've got something
You don't often find
I ain't ever gonna let you down
All you gotta do is trust me
I would never make you some clown
Baby, why won't you trust me
You give up so easily
I don't know why you can't see
I'm depending on you
Don't let me down
I'm depending on you
Baby, if you can't change the world
Maybe you should just change yourself
You used to be such a sweet young girl
Why you wanna be someone else
You give up so easily
I don't know why you can't see
I'm depending on you
Is it too late now
I'm depending on you
You give up so easily
I don't know why you can't see
I'm depending on you
Don't let me down
I'm depending on you
Yeah, I'm depending on you
Is it too late now
I'm depending on you
Yeah, I'm depending on you
I'm depending on you
Is it too late now
I'm depending on you
The summer's gone too soon
The winters coming now
And lives are falling and
I'm just brawling
You had me going out of my head
And I look stupid
The game was gruesome
We'll be for a while
And then it'd leave for a while
But there's no need for you now
Because I'm free of you now
You see I'm
Happy (happy)
Things are looking good now (good now)
I feel so alive (so alive)
I'm on overdrive (overdrive)
I'm killing it, I'm killing it
(Good, I'm good)
Don't try coming back
(Good, I'm good)
'Cause I will not be there
(Good, I'm good)
It's not like you ever cared
Smiles would die too soon
Our days were filled with frowns
My job was calling
My life was falling
My friends said I looked like I was dead
Did I look stupid
Damn you cupid
You were shooting at me instead of landing on her
If this is how it should be
We should have stayed how we were
Cause now I'm
Happy (happy)
Things are looking good now (good now)
I feel so alive (so alive)
I'm on overdrive (overdrive)
I'm killing it, I'm killing it
(Good, I'm good)
Don't try coming back
(Good, I'm good)
'Cause I will not be there
(Good, I'm good)
It's not like you ever cared
Damn you're stupid
How'd you lose it
You had it all but you treated it wrong
You got some things to resolve
So I requested this song
'Cause I'm just
Happy (happy)
Things are looking good now (good now)
I feel so alive (so alive)
I'm on overdrive (overdrive)
I'm killing it, I'm killing it
(Good, I'm good)
Don't try coming back
(Good, I'm good)
'Cause I will not be there
(Good, I'm good)
It's not like you ever cared
Just say what's on your mind
What'cha know about love
You said our love would be
You said you were my girlfriend
Some girl you turned out to be
I guess you know about leaving
Loving and leaving me
You left me for no reason
But you led me to believe
Sometimes your life can crumble
Sometimes your soul might make a stumble
But you can't drown in your sorrow
Cause you might be found
You might be found tomorrow
What'cha know about living
When you've been treated like a queen
But a queen don't know about giving
I ain't looking to receive
Sometimes your life can crumble
Sometimes your soul might make a stumble
But you can't drown in your sorrow
Cause you might be found
You might be found tomorrow
Sometimes your life can crumble
Sometimes your soul might make a stumble
But you can't drown in your sorrow
Cause you might be found
You might be found tomorrow
I said, you might be found
You might be found tomorrow
Well, you might be found
You might be found tomorrow (x3)
Good evening shuttle bus
Tell me where you're going to take us
Someplace that I have never been
It's chic transportation to new destination 
Where I leave my reflection on the glass
I'd ask but we don't know how far these interstates go
Or how deep the city roots go down
In chilly sub-depth railways
The weathered concrete stairways
Provide me with a means of getting home 
If I ever leave
On crystal sand we sleep hand-in-hand
While soothing words...
So many sights to see
So wake up like an early birdie
And we'll get a head start on the day
Stained-glass skyways and crowded 6 lane highways
If I look back when I begin to leave
Will they remember me?
Circuit flights bend the lights when I am spent
And tour guides make happy brides feel heaven-sent
On crystal sand we sleep hand-in-hand
While soothing words hover like hummingbirds
Happy with no teeth
Happy here in hibernation
Slurpin' on a peach
Starin' at the situation
Kitty at my foot
Meowin' out a conversation
Rockin' back 'n' forth
That's my only destination
Old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch
And that old man is me
Old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch
And that
Me, ow
Wow, wow, wow
Got a two string on my lap
Total subsonic vacation
Got chicken on the drums
Poundin' out a perfect prescription
Got twenty little worms
All plug into amplification
Got fifteen hundred bass drum luggin', bug-eyed monkeys
All arriving at the station
Old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch
And that old man is me
Old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch
And that
Me, ow
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Chris:
I'm sittin' on the back porch kickin' my legs back rockin' in my rockin' chair, just sittin' there
On the little back porch it's about to fall apart so I think I might repair it
Just as I'm thinkin about repairin' it some little friends come along
With some two string, one string, no string guitars (Hey, Chris, wanna jam?)
And they plug them all into the back porch
And they sit around playing all their favorite songs
And kickin back feelin' real good, real fine, real full of the wine
And everything's fine, everything's beautiful, everything's great
And I just feel so good; you know I'm seventy years old
And I'm slurpin' everything through a straw
Dave:
I'm sittin' here on the back porch just eatin' chocolate pudding
Through a straw
And I heated it up on a little Sterno stove
Tastes just like a warm body fluid goin' down
Little players comin' 'round
Pluggin' in their instruments feelin' good about themselves
Singin' original songs by the original masters
And I'm sittin' there on the porch
Rockin' back 'n' forth in my little old chair
But I'm an old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch
And that old man is me
Old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch
Old man on the back porch
And that
In the midnight moonlight I'll, be walkin' a long and lonely mile.
And every time I do, I keep seein this picture of you.
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it can come as no surprise to me, with another guy.
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.
You never walk alone, and you're forever talkin' on the phone.
I've tried to call you names, but every time it comes out the same.
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it can come as no surprise to me, with another guy.
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.
I'm still waitin for your heart, 'cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna start.
You'll be mine to hold each day, but till then, this is all that I can say.
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it can come as no surprise to me, with another guy.
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.
I don't wanna clear the cobwebs from my head
Time will bring them back I bet
So if you hear me say that I believe in love
Don't make me feel ashamed
I used to sing the saddest songs
And while in the meantime roaches used to climb my door
Falling back down to the floor
I used to read survival guides
When my world was full of seven legged cats
But here I am with eight more lives
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Ready to get it on
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Now that I'm not alone
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
You know it
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
You better not
Ignore it
I don't wanna look at fashion magazines
While someone does my nails
Sitting here watching other people live
Frozen by the fear to fail
Cause, everyday there's a war to fight
And if I win or lose, nevermind
As long as you're my shelter every night
I used to cry against a wall
But now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on
Swear to me you won't be gone
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Ready to get it on
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Now that I'm not alone
Cause, everyday there's a war to fight
And if I win or lose, nevermind
As long as you're my shelter every night
I used to cry against a wall
But now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on
Swear to me you won't be gone
Ah ha ha ha ha ha e.t.c
Instrumental
You and I are mortal, but rock and roll will never die.
Ha, ha
I never felt too good,
But in this world who would?
I was always thinking
Something wasn't right
But then you came along and
Helped me sing a song and
Now I feel okay
I hope it can stay this way
You know we've got a good thing going
And I don't want to see it end
Good thing
You know we've got a good thing going
And I don't want to see it end
Are these the good days
That I've heard so much about?
There goes the heartbreak
That I can live without, oh oh oh
I've been so frustrated
Bitter, mean, and jaded
I've taken for granted
All the things I've got
But now that you are here
This anger disappears
And I feel happy too
This is sappy, but it's true
You know we've got a good thing going
And I don't want to see it end
Good thing
You know we've got a good thing going
And I don't want to see it end
Are these the good days
That I've heard so much about?
There goes the heartbreak
That I can live without
Are these the good days
That I've heard so much about?
There goes the heartbreak
That I can live without
Heartbreak I can live without
Heartbreak, heartbreak
I can live, live without
One, two, three, ow!
Good thing
You know we've got a good thing going
And I don't want to see it end
Good thing
You know we've got a good thing going
And I don't want to see it end
Are these the good days?
You know we've got a good thing going
Are these the good days?
And I don't wanna see it end
Are these the good days?
You know we've got a good thing going
Are these the good days?
And I don't wanna see it end
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know we've got a good thing going
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoo!
And I don't want to see it end
Hey! Yeah, yeah, yeah
Good thing
You know we've got a good thing going
No no, no no, no no, no no, oh
And I don't want to see it end
Good thing
You know we've got a good thing going
And I don't want to see it end
Good thing
You know we've got a good thing going
And I don't want to see it end
While we have oceans
Rivers that still bring us life
Reasons to live in the moment
Hold onto your time
Let your heart go where the wind takes it
Pure like the raindrops of time
Follow the path where it takes you
Straight down the line
Ladies and gentlemen
Surely we're here in mind
Watching our spirits dance on the
On the backs of our lives
How can one sit back and dream it
I'd have no peace in my life
Climbing these walls in an hourglass
Prized in our strife
And I have seen worlds filled with wonder
Lost on my own lonely mile
Lessons I wish that I had mirrored
Time after time
Ladies and gentlemen
Surely we're here in mind
Watching our spirits dance on the
On the backs of our lives
While we have oceans
While we have oceans
While we have oceans
Rivers that still bring us life
Reasons to dance in the moment
Hold onto your time
Come fill up your souls with our blessings
Hold up your hands to the sky
Let the whole world know you're out there
High in our highs
Ladies and gentlemen
Surely we're here in mind
Watching our spirits dance on the
On the backs of our lives
I get the feeling they got you believing
It's better to be loved than left out
But it's like you told me
It's nothing to do with acceptance
It's all about escaping
Then you heard that there's always someone
Forget the wrong one
Disregard your past
But she came with feelings too complex to be amusing
You're gonna get in trouble with that
You're gonna get in trouble with that
You're gonna struggle with that
And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
You were always the one
And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
Yeah, you were always the one
I get the feeling they got you believing
It's better to be loved than left out
But yeah, like you told me
It's nothing to do with acceptance
It's all about escaping
I setenced myself now a long long time ago
And I hope to be free
But I guess that you've heard that before
So will you try and look surprised
When you find out I lied?
And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
You were always the one
And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
You were always the one
Force field super shield AA.
Junior high love affair is okay.
Jump on the big wagon 'cause I'm so cal.
I'm big in every way. I'm running as fast as I can.
She goes above and beyond her call of duty
She is a slut but her ex thinks it's sexy
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
I am wasted but I'm ready
If you wanna move it so, why don't you make it go?
Prove to everybody who doesn't understand.
All the nights, all the fights. You are out of sight.
Some say more with their hands. I'm running as fast as I can.
She goes above and beyond her call of duty
She is a slut but her ex thinks it's sexy
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
I am wasted but I'm ready
I am wasted but I'm ready
I am wasted but I'm ready
I'm running as fast as I can
I'm running a fast as I rock!
Why am I dealing with this feeling?
I'm maxed out like a credit card.
I'll continue to be my worst enemy.
It's easy but it seems so hard.
You're near but you seem so far.
She goes above and beyond her call of duty
She is a slut but her ex thinks it's sexy
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
I am wasted but I'm ready
I am wasted but I'm ready
I am wasted but I'm ready
I am wasted but I'm ready
Running as fast as I can ...
I got a little bit of hope,
Like a soap on a rope.
Sweeter than sour,
Getting thinner by the hour.
Falling fast,
And I'm running out of gas.
Mugging on your sister, smart as Bobby Fisher.
Still I couldn't get arrested,
Though I got more hooks than Madonna got looks.
Just like that AC/DC song,
"Come on baby, shake me all night long."
All I wanna do,
Is stay till early in the morning.
(You know I love you baby).
And all I gotta say,
Is your love's extraordinary.
You're extraordinary, baby
Somebody push me through the door,
I've been sleeping on the floor.
31 flavors, listen to the neighbors through the wall,
At the debutante ball.
Cumba lada vista,
Got a Mona Lisa.
So much for the late rent, cause your money's spent,
And it's cold inside.
Just like that Barenaked Ladies song,
I'm "hot like wasabi when" I'm next to your body.
All I wanna do,
Is stay till early in the morning.
(You know I love you baby).
And all I gotta say,
Is your love's extraordinary.
You're extraordinary, baby.
Ain't love such a sweet thing.
Ain't love such a sweet thing.
(Con fuego baby)
All I wanna do,
Is stay till early in the morning.
(You know I love you baby).
And all I gotta say,
Is your love's extraordinary.
You're extraordinary baby.
All I wanna do,
Is stay till early in the morning.
(You know I love you baby).
And all I gotta say,
Is your love's extraordinary.
You're extraordinary.
I went back, I went back to your love
And I felt so many wrongs
That I wasted on you by the crowd
And I called, you called me
And I whispered your name
I went home, we stared blank
To the pages I loved
Well, I just wanna compliment your soul
I just wanna compliment your soul
Yeah, I just wanna compliment
And I wasted tears, I let go
So many rights, so many nights
That I come and I go
I just wanna know, do you,
And I can't ever be shut out
You're meant to be the wrong gal
Tell it twice
'Cause I just wanna compliment your soul
Yeah, I just wanna compliment your soul
I compliment your...
I compliment your...
Yeah, I just wanna compliment your soul
Yes, I just wanna compliment your soul
'Cause I just wanna compliment your (Soul)
I just wanna compliment
And while the city sleeps
I won't weep because I didn't keep
My boyfriend and the summer's end is here again
And the leaves are golden
Under the grand silver birch tree
While we're thinking 'bout the people we meet
Dancing feet, wasters on the cover of a magazine
People you've kissed, people you lust
And the one's that you might not
Ever remember what's the use
I'm not what I was last summer
Not who I was in the spring
Tell me, tell me, tell me when will we learn
We love it and we leave it and we watch it burn
Damn these wild young hearts
Damn these wild young hearts
Now that the city's awake, my heart aches
Oh what a silly mistake it seems I've made
You left your keys under my bed
Left a thumpin in my head
I would say sorry, what's the use
Cause, I'm not what I was last September
And I don't wear the same robes in May
We know we shouldn't do it, but we do it anyway
We know we might regret it but it seemed ok
Damn this wild young heart
Damn this wild young heart
Damn this wild young heart
If now is forever then what's to prove
Cause it won't be the same next summer
And I guess I'll see you in the spring
Somebody tell me, tell me, tell me, when will I learn
I love it and I leave it and I watch it burn
Damn this wild young heart
I told you damn this wild young heart
Damn this wild young
Tell me, tell me, tell me when will I learn
Damn this wild young heart
Hey babe, thought maybe
Can't feel right today.
Wish it didn't faze me
Can't handle you their way.
Will I surround you, entombed and warm
Don't lie to her, no bones, no form.
The vast expanses, will leech you dry
You'll shiver all summer
Hey babe, can't do it.
Can't put you there again.
Can't deal, can't go through it
If there only was a when
Will I surround you, entombed and warm.
Don't lie to her, no bones, no form.
The vast expanses, the need to grind
They'll summon
Well maybe it's the common curse
Maybe things get bad before they get worse
I don't wanna become someone
Who can't live up to what I already done
Don't keep it just to figure it out
When it rains and pours and then it runs out
I was crying on the bathroom floor
And just when I thought I could take no more well
Here comes the comeback
The kid is back he's back on track
And there goes my hero
He's an underdog he's coming out on top and
Come on come on back that's my dog
It was a park through the trailer park
She went whistling through the graveyard
She came to raise the dead
And I was a stain on her unmade bed
I found a lover and then I lost myself
And now I'm nowhere she's somewhere else
And the boys with the brown skinny legs
They go on and on she sees but I say
Hey here comes a comeback
The kid is back he's back on track
And there goes my hero, he's a underdog
That's coming out on top
And everybody loves a comeback
So come on back now comeback comeback
Everybody loves the underdog
Singing that's my dog that's my dog
That's my dog
That's my dog
That's my dog
Hey
I've never been laid so low
Never been laid so low low low low
Why was I the last to know?
Why was I the last to know?
Yes I was
I've never been laid so low
Never been laid so low low low low
Don't let me be the last to know
Don't let me be the last to know
Here comes a comeback
The kid is back he's back on track
And everybody loves a comeback
So come on back now comeback comeback
Everybody loves the underdog
Singing that's my dog that's my dog
That's my dog
That's my dog
That's my dog
Na na na na that's my dog
That's my, that's my dog
That's my dog
That's my dog
That's my dog
That's my dog
Last night we had a rendez-vous
How d'you do? Comment allez-vous ?
We went to see a French movie
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il fait ? Mais qu'est-ce qu'il dit ?
You really got a hold on me
I wanna hear you say: oh oui !
Cherie, cherie, j'en reve la nuit
Cherie, cherie, comment ca va ?
Quelle heure est-il ? Je ne sais pas !
We hang around dans ton quartier
Like walking down Champs-Elysees
You let me get in dans ton lit
Best place in Paris to be!
Cherie, cherie, j'en reve la nuit
Cherie, cherie, comment ca va ?
Quelle heure est-il ? Je ne sais pas !
Then you said: Stop it! Ca suffit !
Won't let you get in dans ma vie
And anything I said or do
Wouldn't change your mind, non pas du tout
Cherie, cherie, comment ca va ?
Cherie, cherie, j'en reve la nuit
Comment ca va ? Je ne sais pas !
Last night we had a rendez-vous
How d'you do ? Comment allez-vous ?
We went to see a French movie
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il fait ? Mais qu'est-ce qu'il dit ?
I put my hand dans ton panier
You were not celle que vous croyiez
You really got a hold on me
I wanna hear you say: oh oui !
Cherie, cherie, j'en reve la nuit
Cherie, cherie, comment ca va ?
Quelle heure est il ? Je ne sais pas !
I've been trapped by love
Bonsoir Jacqueline, bonsoir a toutes et a tous. Pour toutes les zones de la mer du Nord et de la Manche...
(Woah, woah, woah, woahahoo)
(Woah, woah, woah, woahahoo)
Went to a show last Saturday night
The band was doing their thing
The moshpit started, and then the crowd parted
And there was Kiki Dee
Knew this girl back in junior high school
Where nobody gave her a look
But look at what we got, the girl got hot
Switched up and rewrote the book
Satin tights, boots so white
Leopard handbag out of sight
Used to mean a little
Now means a lot
Oh my goodness me
The girl got hot
Woah-woah, woah-woah
(The girl got hot)
Woah-woah, woah-oh-oh
The first thing I did when I got up the nerve
Was say, "Hey baby, what's up?" (What up?)
She kept on dancing, refused my romancing
And that's when I fell in love
I stepped to the floor with her best friend Jill
Tried to thicken the plot
The thing I finally found with these other girls in town
She got hot, and they did not, (hoh!)
Satin tights, boots so white
Leopard handbag out of sight (dynomite)
Used to mean a little
Now means a lot
Oh my goodness me
The girl got hot
(Nah nah nah...)
Satin tights, boots so white
Leopard handbag out of sight (dynomite)
Eagle feather in her feathered hair (hey)
Dash of rouge, buyer beware
What used to mean a little
Now means a lot
Oh my goodness me
The girl got hot
Woah-woah, woah-woah (the girl got hot)
Woah-woah, woah-oh-oh (the girl got hot)
Woah-woah, woah-woah (the girl got hot)
Woah-woah, woah-oh-oh (the girl got hot)
Satin tights, boots so white (the girl got hot)
Leopard handbag out of sight (the girl got hot)
Eagle feather in her feathered hair (the girl got hot)
Dash of rouge, buyer beware (the girl got hot)
Woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-oh-oh
There's no such thing
As a harmless joke
There's no such thing
As a gentle toke
There's no such thing
As panama jack
Who's got the crack 
Who's got the crack 
Who's got the crack 
Who's got the crack
I am a goat
In a moat
With a boat
Who's got the crack
Who's got the crack
Who's got the crack
Who's got the crack
I like it when
My hair is poofy
I like it when
You slip me a roofy
I like it when
You've got the crack 
Who's got the crack
Who's got the crack
Who's got the crack
Who's got the crack
I wanna be a hippie
But I forgot how to love
It's hard to be a garbage man
When a sailor stole my glove
I wanna be reckless
But I'm feeling so uptight
Put your mama in a headlock baby
And do it right
Who's got the crack
Who's got the crack
Who's got the crack
Who's got the crack
Who's got the crack
(Verse one)
We were talking together
I said "What's up with this weather?"
Don't know whether or not
How sad I just got
Was on my own volition
Or if I'm just missin' the sun
And tomorrow, I know,
Will be rainy at best
And the forecast, I know,
Is that I'll be depressed
But I'll wait outside
Hopin' that I'll catch sight of the sun.
Because on and off,
The clouds have fought
Their control over the sky
And lately the weather
Has been so bi-polar
And consequently so have I
And now I'm sunny with a high of 75
Since You took my heavy heart
And made it light
And it's funny how you find
You enjoy your life
When you're happy to be alive
(Verse two)
And the temperature is freezing
And then, after dark,
There's a cold frost sweeping
In over my heart
And we might break up
If I don't wake up to the sun
Because on and off,
The clouds have fought
For control over the sky
And lately the weather
Has been so bi-polar
And consequently so have I
And now I'm sunny with a High
Of 75
Since You took my heavy heart
And made it light
And it's funny how you find
You enjoy your life
When you're happy to be alive
Sunny with a High of 75
Since You took my heavy heart
And made it light (made it light)
And its funny how you find
You enjoy your life
When you're happy to be...
Alive
I got a bad flavour
I got dirty clothes
I got a strange neighbour
Who doesn't have curtains on her windows
I got a pet hedge-hog
Drinkin' yager all day
You got my Crate combo
And a baby on the way
But its ok
It's gonna take alot of time before I can cross that finish line
And when I can't take the fall I really wanna make that call.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ah ah
That's my new best friend
Anne Disaster's her name
We're passin' out on the carpet
And our attributes are the same
It's the slacker lifestyle
That we do so well
Bills are due on Monday and I
I'm oblivous - can't you tell
It's gonna take alot of time before I can cross that finish line
And when I can't take the fall I really wanna make that call.
My brain is super fried
It involves pain to look inside
It's gonna take a lot of time before I can cross that finish line
And when I can't take the fall I really wanna make that call
Take off, both your, shoes and clothes, I'll follow
Undo, corkscrew, drink from the half of a broken bottle
Lately we're running out of time, aren't we?
Smoking, often, and calling out our guilty pleasures
Let's keep, talking, anything to stop clockwatching
Lately we're running out of time, aren't we?
Crazy for running all the time, m-m-m-m-maybe
Let's forget we're running out of time
I'm off like an aeroplane
I'm licking your postage stamp again
I'm using my right brain and I'm praying that we don't crash
Who knew I'd cum so fast
Well, so what if a two pump chump can't last
But I made it to three, and I foreclose a five minute fantasy
On a short-lived flight, making love on economy
No jumping, conclusions
'An I don't think there's no solution
Let's get, backwards
And forget our restless destination
Let's live in the moment just this time, could we?
Just take one moment of our time, m-m-m-m-maybe
Let's forget we're running out of time
I'm off like an aeroplane
I'm catching my second wind again
I'm using my left brain
And I'm righting all my wrongs
I'm yearning to turn you on
I've been working on getting you off, so get on board, now
Well how can I guess by the subject of the best predicate that's left unsaid when the matter is too delicate
My loneliness is evident
And it's you
You're running through my mind and it makes me c-c-crazy cra-cra-crazy
La la la
La la la la la
La la la (ooh, it's so amazing)
La la la la la la
La la la
Laaaa oh oh
Laaaaaa lo oh oh oh
Lady, dreamer, you might be the soundest sleeper
Tonight, sleep tight, and build your nest upon my shoulder
I know you like her
Well, I like her, too
I know she likes you
It's not as if I'm being sent off to war
There are worse things in this world
There's still room in my wooden horse for two
I was Jonathan to your David
You're still king
Well, I'd thought about her
I dreamed she'd come, I'd make my escape
I thought she liked me but somehow I was wrong
I know you don't want it this way
But it's okay (It's okay)
It's not like we'll be parted
It's not like we'll never know love
And she'll smile for you (She'll smile for you)
She'll hold your hand (Hold out your hand)
You'll be in love, there's no other way
And I will make it someday
Well, I know you like her
Well, I like her, too
I know she likes you
It's not as if I'm being sent off to war
There are worse things in this world
There's still room in my wooden horse for two
I was Jonathan to your David
You're still king
Visions of love recollected
Have we ever been true?
I know that I have, it's time for you to go
It's all in the stones that you throw
I want you to know (To know)
It's not like we'll be parted
It's not like we'll never know love
And she'll smile for you (She'll smile for you)
She'll hold your hand (Hold out your hand)
You'll be in love, there's no other way
People say that
We'll never change
We'll never change
But I have
You and her in the local newspaper
You will be married and you'll be gone
Married and you'll be gone
When I was a movie star
An asteroid had hit the Earth
And prematurely ended my career.
I thought out loud, but no one heard me saying:
Nothing isn't nothing,
Nothing's something that's important to me.
That's right.
And everyone's a little nothing,
That is how it should be.
That's right. That's right.
Sha sha. Sha doo.
When I was an astronaut,
I bought a fancy charm.
I thought you liked it but you called it cheap
And at my feet, it fell, like:
So sue me,
It's up to me if I decide to be what I think is right.
And don't bother me when I'm watching 'Planet of the Apes' on TV
That's right. That's how it should be.
Sha sha. Sha doo.
So sue me,
It's up to me if I decide to be what I think is right.
The sound, it found, the ground, and it hid it for free.
That's right. That's how it should be.
Sha sha. Sha doo.
There used to be a lot of things,
That I didn't know,
And although they still exist,
I try not to let them show.
But I think that now you've seen me,
For my true colours,
I'm sure you recognise I'm more stupid than the others.
But I love you,
Oh I love you,
And I will love you,
Till the day I die,
There will never be a time when we have to say good-bye.
I've seen you try to laugh at all of my bad jokes,
And I've cooked you seven meals six of them of which you've choked,
But it has taken me a while,
To get used to this new feeling,
When I woke up with a smile,
Oh, I nearly started screaming.
That I love you,
Oh I love you,
And I will love you,
Till the day I die,
There will never be a time when we have to say good-bye.
Because I love you,
Oh I love you,
And I will love you,
Till the day I die,
There will never be a time when we have to say good-bye.
Never be a time when we have to say good-bye,
There will never be a time when we have to say good-bye.
It matters to me, took a long time to get here
But if it would have been easy I would not have cared
Like a tropical forest, like a cop on the beat
When all is in order you get lost in the heat
I feel so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel
I feel so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel
Doesn't matter to me, I could take it or leave it
I could learn from way back when and still live right now
With the sun on my shoulder and the wind in my back
I will never grow older, at least not in my mind
I feel so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel
I feel so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel
So wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel
I feel so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel
I'm going where there ain't no fear
I'm going where the spirit is near
I'm going where the living is easy
And the people are kind, a new state of mind
I'm going where there ain't no police
I'm going where there ain't no disease
I'm going where there ain't no need
To escape from what is only spirits at ease
Growing sleepy as the rain falls 
As children draped in flowers form a chain 
They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls 
As night falls into dust and it's day again 
I'm not afraid of a love parade in my daydream 
Old men with kazoos and beating drums 
But I awake and I see the streets are ice cream 
It's just you and me and oh dear, our life has just begun 
Everything is beautiful here 
It's spinning circles around my ears 
I'm finally breaking free from fear 
And it's fading 
Oh beautiful smiles, won't you stay awhile 
We could close the door and sleep all day 
It's a September sky with pretty pictures in my mind 
That's lost its feeling of so afraid 
Everything is beautiful here 
It's spinning circles around my ears 
I'm finally breaking free from fear 
And it's fading 
Grown sleepy now as the rain falls 
As children draped in flowers form a chain 
They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls 
As night falls into dust and it's day again 
Everything is beautiful here 
It's spinning circles around my ears 
I'm finally breaking free from fear 
And it's fading
Instrumental
Don't you misfire fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Don't you know honey that love's a game
It's always a hit or miss
So take your aim
Got to hold on tight
Shoot me out of sight
Don't you misfire fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Don't you misfire fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Your gun is loaded
And pointing my way
There's only one bullet
So don't delay
Got to time it right
Fire me through the night
Come on take a shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire
Misfire
Ja sei namorar
Ja sei beijar de lingua
Agora so me resta sonhar
Ja sei onde ir
Ja sei onde ficar

Keep your chin up when you're feelin' lonely
Don't let them get you down
Ain't no use in your sitting all alone
Hangin' around for someone to call
Ooh they won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide
Even if it hurts you inside
So I said
Give as good as you get
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself
Come on
Get up
You're feelin' good
Keep your fingers off my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're takin' me out to wine and dine me
Tryin' to wind me 'round and around
Invite me to your little contract Ha! Ha!
Rumour has it that you could play dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do about that
I'm playing at the wrong game yeah!
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
It's everyone for themselves
Move on out
I remember when I found out about chemistry,
It was a long, long way from here,
I was old enough to want it,
But younger than I wanted to be,
Suddenly my mission was clear.
So for a while I conducted experiments,
And I was amazed by the things I learned,
From the fine, fine girl with nothing but good intentions
And a bad tendency to get burned.
Oh, all about chemistry,
Won't you show me everything you know,
Ah wonder what you do to me Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh.
Some time later I met a young graduate,
When I had nobody to call my own,
I told her I was looking for somebody to appreciate,
And I just couldn't do it alone.
So for awhile we conducted experiments,
In an apartment by the River Road,
And we found out that the two things we put together
Had a bad tendency to explode.
Oh, all about chemistry,
Won't you show me everything you've learned,
I'll memorize everything you do to me so I can,
Teach it when it comes my turn.
Fine spring day, California waves,
Sweet Pacific scenes through,
The windows of aeroplanes and hotel rooms.
So when I find myself alone and unworthy,
I think about all of the things I learned,
From the fine, fine women with nothing but good intentions
And a bad tendency to get burned.
Oh, all about chemistry,
Won't you show me everything you know,
Ah wonder what you do to me  Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh.
Oh, all about chemistry,
Won't you show me everything you've learned,
I'll memorize everything you do to me,
So I can teach it when it comes my turn.
It's all about chemistry, (California waves)
It's all about chemistry, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh,
It's all about chemistry, (sweet Pacific scenes)
It's all about chemistry, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh.
Your pentagram is down below our floor.
Your naked body shimmers in the night.
Dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.
Your feet are dry with the ashes from dead babies,
Who have passed the test just like all the rest,
But never really understood the reasons why
They took it in the first place.
Ah, in the first place.
Your feasty eyes won't make me fall apart.
Your turquoise and silver won't weaken this old heart.
Yeah, dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.
I fell to the ground on a windy, windy night.
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest,
But never really understood the reasons why
I took it in the first place.
Ah, in the first place.
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest,
But never really understood the reasons why
I took it in the first place.
Ah, in the first place.
Hear ye, hear ye, friends and Romans, countrymen
Hear ye, hear ye, punks and skins and journeymen
Hear ye, hear ye, my sisters and my brethren
The time is coming near
Come ye, come ye, to soulless corporate circus tops 
Come ye, come ye, to toilet circuit touring stops
Come ye, come ye, to bedrooms, bars and bunker squats
The sound is ringing clear
Now who'd have thought
That after all
Something as simple as rock 'n' roll would save us all
Now who'd have thought
That after all
It was rock 'n' roll
Hear ye, hear ye, now anybody could take this stage
Hear ye, hear ye, and make miracles for minimum wage
Hear ye, hear ye, these folk songs of the modern age
Will hold us in their arms
Right here, right now, Elvis brings his children home
Right here, right now, you never have to feel alone
Right here, right now, teenage kicks and gramophones
We hold them in our hearts
Now who'd have thought
That after all 
Something as simple as rock 'n' roll would save us all
Now who'd have thought
That after all
It was rock 'n' roll
And I still believe (I still believe)
In the saints
Yeah, in Jerry Lee and in Johnny and all the greats
I still believe (I still believe)
In the sound
That has the power to raise a temple and tear it down
And I still believe (I still believe)
In the need
For guitars and drums and desperate poetry
I still believe (I still believe)
That everyone
Can find a song for every time they've lost and every time they've won
So just remember, folks, we not just saving lives, we're saving souls
And we're having fun
And I still believe
Now who'd have thought
That after all
Something as simple as rock 'n' roll would save us all
Now who'd have thought
That after all
Something so simple
Something so small
Who'd have thought
That after all
It's rock 'n' roll

I was walking along in the sun
Taking pictures of everyone
And there's something on the tip of my tongue
Oh oh oh oh
Well it's easy to see from the far
And it's easy to be on your guard
But it's harder just to be who you are
Oh oh oh oh
When all these people who will lead you down
The back of the track
They're on your back
They will try and tear you apart
But believe and you will see
That there's no reason to doubt
Then you will find
You can do much better than that
If you think of all the things that you feel
All the voices in your head that you hear
It's a mystery that we are all still holding on
When all these people who will lead you down
The back of the track
They're on your back
They will try and tear you apart
But believe and you will see
That there's no reason to doubt
Then you will find
You can do much better than that
If you see me hit the ground
Don't come near, don't make a sound
I was walking along in the sun
Taking pictures of everyone
And there's something on the tip of my tongue
I do my best
To find some kind of glow
I'm givin' it some heart and soul, now
From the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
Yeah, we see that fire
From the streets of Babylon
To the road that we've been on now
The kaleidoscope claims another
Whoa oh oh oh
Well this is life in color (color)
Today feels like no other (other)
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
Whoa oh oh oh
Well this is life in motion (motion)
And just when I could run this race no more
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color
You've seen my worst
Yet you see some hope in me
The black and white sets us free
Like the queen to the rook
Your decision is a sure thing
Honey yeah, a sure thing
No wonder I feel
Like I'm missing a heavy load
But no matter what daylight brings to us
We all know
Whoa oh oh oh
Well this is life in color (color)
Today feels like no other (other)
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
Whoa oh oh oh
Well this is life in motion (motion)
And just when I could run this race no more
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Yeah
This is life in color
Today feels like no other
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, cloud breaks
Whoa oh oh oh
Well this is life in motion (motion)
Just when I could run this race no more
The sun bursts, cloud breaks
This is life in color
This is life in color
Ooh ooh
(C'mon, c'mon)
The one that I came with
She had to go
But you look amazing
Standing alone
So c'mon c'mon
Move a little closer now
C'mon c'mon
Ain't no way you're walking out
C'mon c'mon
Show me what you're all about!
Yeah
I've been watching you all night
There's something in your eyes
Saying c'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
Yeah
The music is so loud
I want to be yours now
So c'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
The one that I came with
Didn't know how to move
The way that you let your hair down
I can tell that you do
So c'mon c'mon
Move a little closer now
C'mon c'mon
Ain't no way you're walking out
C'mon c'mon
Show me what you're all about!
Yeah
I've been watching you all night
There's something in your eyes
Saying c'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
Yeah
The music is so loud
I want to be yours now
So c'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
Every step I take
I feel it more and more
She's calling out
She's looking good
My heart is racing
She's turning around
I reach for her hand
And I say
Hey
I've been watching you all night
There's something in your eyes
Saying c'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
Yeah
The music is so loud
I want to be yours now
So c'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
C'mon c'mon
C'mon c'mon
C'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
It was a straight-faced lie I believed
It was a straight-faced lie
You would ever leave me
So for now I'll keep believing your words
And soon enough my strength will return
I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there
So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
Let me draw the blinds for you
You can watch the sunset from the bed 
In your hospital room 
Until you're sleeping 
And I'm sure I don't understand
How I found a love so pure
I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call on me
I'll be there
I'll be right there
So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there 
Don't lift a finger let me show you
The only way to let this go
Don't lift a finger, let me hold you
Hold you here until the pain has all gone
I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there
So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there
So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
Estas semanas sin verte
Me parecieron anos
Tanto te quise besar
Que me duelen los labios
Mira que el miedo nos hizo
Cometer estupideces
Nos dejo sordos y ciegos
Tantas veces
Y un dia despues de la tormenta
Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
De tanto sumar
Pierdes la cuenta
Porque uno y uno
No siempre son dos
Cuando menos piensas
Sale el sol
Te llore hasta el extremo
De lo que era posible
Cuando creia que era
Invencible
No hay mal que dure cien anos
Ni cuerpo que lo aguante
Y lo mejor siempre espera
Adelante
Y un dia despues de la tormenta
Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
De tanto sumar
Pierdes la cuenta
Porque uno y uno
No siempre son dos
Cuando menos piensas
Sale el sol
Cuando menos piensas
Sale el sol
Y un dia despues de la tormenta
Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
De tanto sumar
Pierdes la cuenta
Porque uno y uno
No siempre son dos
Y un dia despues
Y un dia despues
Sale el sol
Y un dia despues de la tormenta
Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
De tanto sumar
Pierdes la cuenta
Porque uno y uno no siempre son dos
Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
We proudly welcome Tony Orlando
The state fair marquee reads
Inside a thousand people with yellow ribbons sing
And clap on one and three
Watch him burn, he's dropping to his knees
Watch him burn, a medley, hits from Grease
Watch him burn, he never fails to please
Meanwhile in Tahoe outside Casa Tony
Wetting rags in gasoline
A jealous Frankie Valli says "Dawn, I want you back"
Lights a match and counts to three
Watch it burn, reluctantly he leaves
Watch it burn, acrid smoke making him wheeze
Watch it burn, humming "Sherry," splits the scene
Watch it burn, reluctantly he leaves
Watch it burn, acrid smoke making him wheeze
Watch it burn, humming "Sherry," splits the scene
We're sorry to inform you
Tony Orlando has been postponed
She's a simple girl.
She's governed by simple pleasures.
She wont ever let you meet her family,
But she'll show you pictures.
She's a simple girl
And she's got simple emotions.
She wont ever let you in,
But she wants to keep you in her corner.
I'm always looking for some kind of sadness,
Something more than this.
She's a simple girl
And she's got simple feelings.
No one ever let her know that she could get it out her heart, now.
I know you won't admit this
I am just a silhouette to you
You found comfort with my distance
But you never let me stray out of your view
Who really needs the past
With the allure of something new
So we split apart at last
Went back to places that I knew
Before you
And you never have to see
The light that wraps itself around me
And I never have to know
The faces there
The places you go
(That you go 4x)
When I can't bear the resistance
I bend in shapes and ways I never knew
So I'll try to postpone my existence
Yeah I'll stop or start my heart if you ask me to
I'll stop my heart and then I'll wait for you
I was sure I never would be sure we were in love
(Although it's dark and black)
I am sure I never would be sure of love to come
(There is one thing left to hold on to)
After you
And you never have to see
The light that wraps itself around me
And I never have to know
The faces there
The places you go
(That you go 4x)
As the descent began I got the distinct impression
Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades
I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum
To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel
The tundra under us cracked and ruptured
To reveal palisades
Made of blades of gray, gray bristling grass
And papulose lichen
I was so frightened
As my grip on you tightened
Your skin got slicker
I am a deserted bus depot
Though our approach suggested
An American hazy sea
Like the one I found inside
After driving you home once
Still half high
I-90 through utter desolation
I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well-lighted home
I close my eyes and see cellar stairways
Vermiculated with delicate animal bone
Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets
Spattered with plasma on a bus in Indiana
I called you and screamed
Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light
Well it's that time
It's that time again
Well it's all coming back around
There she sees me
Oh my god, this is who I've been
And I'm branding each day
Go on and lose it
Go on and lose it all
Go on and lose it
Go on and lose it all
(Go, go)
Go on and lose it
Go on and lose it all
Go on and lose it
Go on and lose it all
Immediately we find out then
That I can be blamed for this
Well then you just figured out today
And you're so sweet, you say...
Go now and get your own life and live it your way
And I hear you say...
Go on and lose it
Go on and lose it all
Go on and lose it
Go on and lose it all
(Go, go)
Go on and lose it
Go on and lose it all
Go on and lose it
Go on and lose it all
Hey
Hey hey
Whoa
Hey, hey, hey
Well and if we find another then
We will get ours
And if we find another then
We will get ours
She's picking up her clothes
She's off and she's running
She says to me
'Go on and lose it'
I think she means well but
Man I can't tell as she says to me
'Go on and lose it all'
Go on and lose it all
Go on and lose it all
Go on and lose it all
Go on and lose it all
Once upon a time, not too long ago, we took a day out in Manchester
We all fall down, there's not enough hours in the day
Played a bit of football, fell into the union
Barged our way into the toilet with a kung fu kick
There's not enough hours in the day
I remember seeing someone dressed in a suit, looking like a lunatic
And we all fall down, there's not enough hours in our trip
Well, academy cogwheels breaking your hand
But we got lovely posters for sale
And we all fall down, there's not enough hours in a day
We like loving, yeah, and the wine we share
We like loving, yeah, and the wine we share
Finally made our way back to the train, rolling into Sheffield tonight
And it all falls down, there's not enough hours in our life
So try and guess my weight, waiting at the station
Whippin' Piccadilly tonight, and it all falls down
There's not enough hours in our life
We like loving, yeah, and the wine we share
We like loving, yeah, and the wine we share
This is the song that reminds me of my trucker hat
That I used to wear not to block out the sun
With a john deere logo and a stain on the back
From where you laid me out flat one look I was done
And all these things mean nothing to me
When I'm with you I've got everything
I can walk and I can need
Even god he would agree
You and I were meant to be
It's easy to see
I'll never go out of style on you
And nothing really feels the way you do
Nothing in the world could ever make me look as good
When you fit me like you do
This is the verse about the Parachute pants
That I learned to break dance in and thought I was good
So much for believing the fat guy doesn't win
Get the girl in the end I never thought that I could
And all these things mean nothing to me
When I'm with you I've got everything
I can walk and I can need
Even god he would agree
You and I were meant to be
It's easy to see
I'll never go out of style on you
And nothing really feels the way you do
Nothing in the world could ever make me look as good
When you fit me like you do
I'm not the perfect guy
A little slow but I've
Got perfect timing with you
Take a look around
Outside the in crowd
There ain't nothing we can't do
(3X)
I'll never go out of style on you
And nothing really feels the way you do
Nothing in the world could ever make me look as good
When you fit me like you do
The guys were feeling good about their liquor run
The girls were kinda flirting with the setting sun
We all kinda fumbled through the Jitterbug
We were all powered up on some new upper drug
Everyone was funny and everyone was pretty
And everyone was coming towards the center of the city
The dance floor was crowded, the bathrooms were worse
We kissed in your car and we drank from your purse
I had my mouth on her nose
When the chaperone said that we were dancing too close
We had some massive nights
Every song was right
All that wine was tight
And your friends were pretty cool
And my friends were acting cool
And there weren't any fights
There's usually one or two (there's usually one or two)
Some guys they get a little bit uptight
Some girls they got something to prove (there's usually one or two)
We had some massive highs
We had some crushing lows
We had some lusty little crushes
We had those all ages hardcore matinee shows
I was down on my knees
When the chaperone said that it was time for me to leave
We had some massive nights
And every song was right
All that wine was tight
Your friends were pretty cool
And my friends were acting cool
And there weren't any fights
There's usually one or two (there's usually one or two)
Some guys they get a little bit uptight
Some girls they got something to prove (there's usually one or two)
We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights
And every song was right
All that wine was tight
Your friends were pretty cool
And my friends were acting cool
She had the gun in her mouth
And she was shooting up at her dreams
When the chaperone said that we'd been crowned
The king and the queen
Living next door to challenge
Things will never be the same again
I close my eyes and remember
A place in the sun
Where we used to live
Now death is in my yard
It's sneaking around out there
Hoping that I step on out
It longs for me, and someday we
Will go downtown in his car
Ask someone who knew me
They will never be the same again
They tell their lies and something dies
Inside us all, it makes me cry
Even though I know
This ship will still sail on
Long after I'm gone
Gone... I'll be gone
In this world of wisdom
No one never really has a clue
They kill their lives every day
With what they say and what they do
But heaven knows I know
That the ship will still sail on
Long after I'm gone
Gone... I'll be gone
I had a hole in the middle where the lightning went through
I told my friends not to worry, my wife would know how to fix it
Hole in the middle, I'm seeing less of you
Now I'm not going anywhere and I don't know what I'll do
It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy
I never tell my decisions to the ones I adore
I just show up like a Bible-breather outside the door
But when I look in the window I see girls on TV
Living and dying in LA and it means nothing to me
It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy
It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy
So I walk through the streets I love
And I'm led to the house I built
And I walk through the streets I love
And I lay in your bed again
Wake up your saints, Jenny, I need them
Jenny, I need them today
Wake up your saints, Jenny, I need them
Jenny, I need them today
I didn't have to explain to her that I wasn't dead
She sat me down and lit some colored candles over my head
She said, "You're right, it's a living, but you're wrong for the life
You know you never should've listened to my father's advice"
It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy
It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy
So I walk through the streets I love
And I'm led to the house I built
And I walk through the streets I love
And I lay in your bed again
Wake up your saints, Jenny, I need them
Jenny, I need them today
Wake up your saints, Jenny, I need them
Jenny, I need them today
If she lived in space, man
I'd build a plane
Out of luck, so beam me up
To hear her talking again
She painted pictures
That never dried
Always tried to keep
The feeling alive
Need a crystal ball to see her in the morning
And magic eyes to read between the lines
I take a wrong direction
From a shooting star
In the love dimension
Fading fast from taking this too far
That summer feeling
Is gonna fly
Always try and keep
The feeling inside
Need a crystal ball to see her in the morning
And magic eyes to read between the lines
I took a wrong direction
From a shooting star
In the love dimension
Fading fast from taking this to far
Need a magic ball to see her in the morning
And crystal eyes to read between the lines
Need a magic ball to see her in the morning
And crystal eyes to read between the lines
Mayla, long time
Mayla, sunshine
Mayla, know I'm
Tryin' to see it through
My future to the new horizon
Mayla, long time
Mayla, sunshine
Hold up, we're tryin'
Our hands are bleeding through
We're building us a new horizon
Mayla, long time
Mayla, sunshine
Mayla, we're tryin'
Our hands are bleeding through
And messses up with you and falling
Ah
And all I have to do to rise
Is look into your eyes
Mayla, long time
Mayla, sunshine
Mayla, know I'm
Tryin' to see it through
My future to the new horizon
Mayla
Mayla
Mayla
Mayla
Mayla
So I shook hands with you freely
Made a promise not to clean the slate
And I didn't need you till melody
Drew a line between love and hate
And I know I can be self righteous
And we both like to stretch the truth
But there's never been a song or a melody
That reminds me less of youth
Hey there hey there
Debbie down debbie down
And I felt my head exploding
So I left it beside the road
In the tall grass where
All the deer despair
At the thought of being stuffed in my home
And first we were antisocial
Till we tried hibernating through
All the seasons where you dye your hair
In a failed attempt on blue
Said the fibber to the snake
There's an opportunist dude
Watch his mouth its open wide
And he trying not to eat you
Hey there hey there
Debbie down debbie down
Say yeah 
Don't say no 
Because I'm ready now 
And I want to go 
What if I cry cry cry wolf 
So I die die die alone 
I want to know 
Please say it isn't so 
It's now 
And we're too late 
There's no time for a debate 
But if you swear you'll never leave 
Then I promise I'll be the one 
Who stays there all along 
So shut shut shut your eyes 
It sounds so good right now 
And gave us a big surprise 
Stay close 
Don't get up 
You're starting now so please stay off 
What if I shout shout shout my name 
You'll always remember my name 
I want to know 
Please say it is so 
So shut shut shut your eyes 
It sounds so good right now 
And gave us a big surprise 
So shut shut shut your eyes 
It sounds so good right now 
And gave us a big surprise
We get it on most every night
And when that old moon gets so big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody here is outta sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep things light
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
We like our fun and we never fight
You can't dance and stay uptight
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight
Dancin' in the moonlight 
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody here is outta sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep things light
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight (Everybody)
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
(everybody)
Everybody is dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight (Mmm, everybody)
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight (Everybody)
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
All the girls in the bathroom, talking
Who they gonna take to the Sadie Hawkins?
My ears are burning, but I kept on walking
Smile on my face and an air guitar rocking
The Sadie Hawkins Dance
And my khaki pants
There's nothing better
Oh, oh, oh!
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothing better
Baby, do you like my sweater?
Sitting in the back of my next class, napping
Got up, gave a speech, then bowed to the clapping
Told a funny joke, got the whole class laughing
Think I got a tan from the light which I was basking
The Sadie Hawkins Dance
And my khaki pants
There's nothing better
Oh, oh, oh!
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothing better
Baby, do you like my sweater?
The Sadie Hawkins Dance
And my khaki pants
There's nothing better
Oh, oh, oh!
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothing better
Baby, do you like my sweater?
Scanned the cafeteria for some good seating
I found a good spot by the cheerleaders, eating
The quarterback asked me if I'd like a beating
I said, "That's one thing I won't be needing"
And since I'm rather smart and cunning
I took off down the next hall, running
Only to get stopped by a girl so stunning
Only to get stopped by a girl so stunning
She said, "You're smooth
And good with talking
You're going with me
To the Sadie Hawkins"
The Sadie Hawkins Dance
And my khaki pants
There's nothing better
Oh, oh, oh!
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothing better
Baby, do you like my sweater?
The Sadie Hawkins Dance
And my khaki pants
There's nothing better
Oh, oh, oh!
The girls ask the guys
It's always a surprise
There's nothing better
Baby, do you like my sweater?
True ring, true ring
Gonna make this crystal sing
Other ways, other ways
Otherwise, we're just going backward
True ring, true ring
Gonna make this songbird sing
Get a load, get a load
Get a load, get a load of it
True ring, true ring
For the one that's listening
Sound advice, sound advice
Empty hands and tired eyes
True ring, true ring
Giving up and giving in
Little arms, little arms
Little arms on a big body
And I hold you to the light to see
And keep you safe inside of me
Oh
Restore this crack so
I want nothing tonight to hold but you
I keep this pillow, it's such a poor substitute
For a soul, a soul
For a soul, a soul
Truth told, truth told
Tear the tear, and fold the fold
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up when it's yours to hold
Truth told, truth told
When you hit the ground just roll
Bend your knees, bend your knees
Bend your knees when you're lifting these
And I hold you to the light to see
And cotton wool you safe in me
Oh
Restore this crack so
I want nothing tonight to hold but you
Keep close the cold compress, such a poor substitute
For a soul, a soul
For a soul, a soul
(Fergie)
Look through the tree
Past the sky
Beyond the northern light
You will see my delight
Back the in your eyes
And I won't let go if you wait for me
Whenever whatever
And you select the destination
Whatever whenever
I walk through
Whatever whenever
I walk through
I wa-I wa-I wanna
Love forever love forever baby
Whenever wherever you wanna go one day
To do whatever do whatever baby
Whenever wherever forever together whenever
(Will.i.am)
I fell asleep
Don't know why
You let me come alive
You and me
We collide
Ignite the starry fire
(Fergie)
And you warm me up and you wait for it
Whenever whatever
And you
You wake me up and you wait for it
Whenever whenever
I wanna go
Whatever whenever
I walk through
I wa-I wa-I wanna
Love forever love forever baby
Whenever wherever you wanna go one day
To do whatever do whatever baby
Whenever wherever forever together whenever
Whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever
(Will.i.am)
I love you forever and ever for always I love you
Whenever you need me
I'll be there right by you
Whenever you call me
I'm there when you call
Whenever your falling
I'm there when you fall
Whenever you going
I'll be right there showing
Our love's always growing
And growing and growing
I know that you know it
There's no need for guessing
When I am requested
I'm there with no questions asked
I'll go wherever whenever
If ever you need me
I'll be there forever
Don't, don't, don't let's start
This is the worst part
Could believe for all the world
That you are my precious little girl
But don't, don't, don't let's start
I've got a weak heart
And I don't get around how you get around
When you are alone
You are the cat, you are the phone, you are an animal
The words I'm singing now
Mean nothing more than "meow" to an animal
Wake up, smell the cat food in your bank account
Don't try to stop the tail that wags the hound
D, world destruction
O, for an overture
N, do I need
Apostrophe
T, need this torture?
Don't, don't, don't let's start
This is the worst part
Could believe for all the world 
That you are my precious little girl
But don't, don't, don't let's start
I've got a weak heart
And I don't get around how you get around
No one in the world ever gets what they want
And that is beautiful
Everybody dies frustrated and sad
And that is beautiful
They want what they're not
And I wish they would stop singing
"Deputy-dog-dog-a-ding-dang-depadepa"
"Deputy-dog-dog-a-ding-dang-depadepa"
D, world destruction
O, for an overture
N, do I need
Apostrophe
T, need this torture?
Don't, don't, don't let's start
This is the worst part
Could believe for all the world
That you are my precious little girl
But don't, don't, don't let's start
I've got a weak heart
And I don't get around how you get around
I don't want to live in this world anymore
I don't want to live in this world
Don't, don't, don't let's start
This is the worst part
Could believe for all the world
That you are my precious little girl
But don't, don't, don't let's start
I've got a weak heart
And I don't get around how you get around

"Step up"
Yeah, yeah, yeah
"Come on"
I'm all right
"You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall"
"Step up"
"Come on"
"Step up"
Be all right, be all right
"You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall"
Well I've strolled across some dance floors
Filled with girls all dressed in red
Pulled my foot from my mouth answered back to things I've said
Wandered through the valley of the shadow of the dead
Stumbled round this old sundial, there these words I read
I've only count the sunny hours, brightest hours of day
I never count the gloomy hours, I let them slip away
And I realize I'm away
"Come on"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm all right y'all, I'm all right y'all
You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall
"Come on"
"Step up"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm all right y'all, all right y'all
You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall
"Come on"
You gotta walk tall y'all, y'all, y'all
Y, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well I woke up in too many beds with girls I didn't know
I've seen lots of brothers act tough,
And I've watched them come and go
And tell me why I'm not dead with them in the valley down below
I give thanks everyday for these words that save my soul
I only count the sunny hours, the brightest hours of day
I never count the gloomy hours, I let them slip away
(Don't slip away yo)
And I realize I'm away
"Come on"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm all right y'all, all right y'all
You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall
"Come on"
"Step up"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm all right y'all, all right y'all (I'm all right)
You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall
"Come on"
It's like the wise man said,
"Relax yourself
When its moving too fast you set ya down
When the going gets tough then get to going
If you really wanna speak than make the sound
Keep your eyes on the prize and realize
That the struggles gonna come in all shapes and size
But you gotta stay strong, don't let your knees buckle
Gotta keep the hustle, keep hustling"
Do it, Do it, Do it
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it back to me
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it back to me
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it, come back to me
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
"Come on"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, everything's gonna be all right)
I'm all right y'all, all right y'all
You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall
"Come on"
"Step up"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Everything's gonna be all right now, everything's gonna be all right)
I'm all right y'all, all right y'all

(I'm all right y'all, I'm all)
I'm all be e e, be e e be all right y'all
Its all right in the sunny time with the Black Eyed Peas,
Rocking it straight down from Long Beach
I got the, oh
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm all right y'all, all right y'all
You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall
You gotta walk tall
Long Beach Dub Allstars, Black Eyed Peas, Will I Am
I'm all right y'all, all right y'all
You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall
When the going get tough, the tough get going
And I'm out
Every day, I'm away from you
Shakes me up inside
I wanna be near you
Know that you are here
Lyin' just next to me
How happy we'd both be
I say it all the time
You don't pay no mind
When I tell you that I love you
Now do ya?
I wanna be clear
All I wanna hear is your voice
Have your face to see
How happy that would make me
Do-do-do-do-do (repeat)
I alway seem to make
Something out of nothing
But I can't make you appear
While I'm away
Just know I'll play this song
For you and wait
Wait for me now (Do-do-do)
Wait for me now (o-oh)
Oh wait for me now (Do-do-do)
Wait for me now
Wait for me now
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Oh Lord, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Oh Lord, I think I heard you
So all of a sudden I'm facing the raging river that passed me by
Do I turn around, do I turn my eye to the sun
In the apex of the high, high noon
I'm on a flatbed yellow pickup underneath the half moon
Cut me, cut me, cut me some slack, Jack
And jump on the back, if you can handle the candle
Then you can't handle the wax
Your just going to get sacked
It's as simple as that.
But before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
In a boat a little bigger than a bath tub
My bones begin to shiver 'cause I'm aching to deliver
This water that I must give her, can I get some?
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Oh Lord, I think I heard you
(I think I heard you, yeah)
Down by the railway station
People move a new direction
Take a ticket from who you can
And then drive that train
She was a black Thai bombshell out of Bombay
She was easy on the eyes so I had nothing to say
Said take your water to the Leprechaun man
You got to the bell rings three, do you understand?
Little piece of me wants to go (I don't know)
Turn around and what do ya do? (I don't know)
Look at me, what do ya do? (I don't know)
Ding dong ding
(That's the bell!)
And I know you know I know I don't know you very well
But if I did I would groove, and hit the ground running
But I don't, and I won't, so you've got another thing coming
He kicked up the river with a flick of his wrist
I popped him in the kisser 'cause I couldn't resist
I said to my sidekick, I'm up to my high wick
And now I'm getting a little homesick
So before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
In a boat a little bigger than a bath tub
My bones begin to shiver 'cause I'm aching to deliver
This water that I must give her, can I get some?
Before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
In a boat a little bigger than a bath tub
My bones begin to shiver 'cause I'm aching to deliver
This water that I must give her, can I get some?
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Oh Lord, I think I heard you
(I think I heard you, yeah)
Down by the railway station
People move a new direction
Take a ticket from who you can
And then drive that train
Drive it, Drive it
I said now, Drive it, Drive it.
I said now, Drive it, Drive it.
You've got to drive your train
Ride it, Ride it.
I said now Ride it, Ride it.
I said now Ride it, Ride it.
You've got to ride your train
Yeah Yeah, (now ride it, you've got to ride it)
When I come home, you won't be there any more
When I come home, you won't be there any more
And you will tear off your clothes and kiss the floor
When I come home, home, home
When I see land, you will conjure up a storm
When I see land, you will conjure up a storm
And I will tie your hand to the highest mast
When I see land, land, land
And we will hustle, hustle, hustle to be free
Free from all the happy thoughts and smiles across the sea
In favour of the mean, mean moves
And back doors to the heart from where we always, always fall apart
And you will slide on the back of my bike
And you will slide on the back seat of my bike
And I will ride you home drunken in the rain
And you will win again and again
Now it's your turn you will tie me to the tree
Now it's your turn you will tie me to the tree
And you will sing and sing forever you and me
But in the dark I wonder what you see
And we will hustle, hustle, hustle to be free
Free from all the happy thoughts and smiles across the sea
In favour of the mean, mean moves
And back doors to the heart from where we always, always fall apart
And we will hustle, hustle, hustle to be free
Free from all the happy thoughts and smiles across the sea
In favour of the mean, mean moves
And back doors to the heart from where we always, always fall apart
I used to think it glad while at my country seat
Now I'm peaking in so many ways
The gloom is in retreat
Yeah the dark epoch is over I've found my efeblum
Then passed Ernst's mausoleum defended by a rook
Who shot a look so virulent it pierced me like a hook
The palaver of Solipsists exploding in my skull
Yeah and we both despise all of the academic swine
Who made the author of "Discus Ulysses" benign?
So what if Wednesday finds us
Wearing rabies parachutes
Foaming like the melody of sea foam fairy flutes
The atmosphere is viscous we're sticking to the brine
Yeah and we both despise all of the academic swine
Who made the author of "Discus Ulysses" benign?
When the lanterns fill with finches
So begins the brawl
Their brains are like porcupines
And mine's a paper ball
When the lanterns fill with finches
So begins the brawl
Their brains are like porcupines
And mine's a paper ball
I know they don't understand they don't get us at all
Their moss mangles polyanthus
And mine's a paper ball
I hope my little brother puts a call in today
I hope he don't forget where he came from
I hope he never has to deal with wronging someone
'Cause I lived with many ghosts when I was younger
And I will live with many ghosts until I go
I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
Even if he has to wrong someone
I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
Even if he has to wrong someone
And I hope his guardian angel puts a gun in his hand
If ever they get ambushed or pursued
I hope she sticks around when he does dirty in this dirty, dirty duel he has brewed
And though the names will get changed to protect the innocent
He said, "I hope the names will get changed to protect me."
I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
Even if he has to wrong someone
I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
I hope he's right in the head
Even if he has to wrong someone
'Cause I lived with many ghosts when I was younger
And I will live with many ghosts until I go
When I'm caught in a net and I haven't a clue
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you
Climb the Ladder
When there are ghosts in my coat
And everything is askew
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you
Climb the ladder to you
All of these faces are crowding around me
With mouths open wide to devour
But they have no impact no I do not cower
Knowing I'm safe in your tower
When my pencil tips broken and my brain is too
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you
Climb the ladder
When I feel like an oar in a sunken canoe
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you
Climb the ladder to you
All of these faces are crowding around me
Like grey paint caked on a flower
But they have no impact no value no power
Knowing I'm safe in your tower
Having an argument with myself down Elizabeth Street
Bumping into backpackers and
Struggling with the parameters
And the basic construction of my feet
Kicking beer cans and rubbish along the concrete
Crossing the street and crossing galaxies of taxis and
Backseats and drunk suites and half-Greeks
Shut up, no, you shut up!
What's the matter, take a number, Buttercup!
Every time I hear you say "Fuck it"
I would remind you of the photo in your pocket
How long it's been there, two years, I bet
Have a sniff, it smells like a cigarette
When was the last time you smoked a cigarette?
And more importantly, who did you smoke it with?
Having an argument with myself down Victoria Street
Passing the market now, the windows in neon illuminating my path to defeat
Your grinning face scaring a poor parakeet
Your heavy breathing scaring the wind
So rich on Summer and so sweet
Fuck you, no, you fuck you!
You didn't come here for nothing, did you?
I know that's what you've been saying lately
But let me draw attention to a exhibit B
A honeysuckle in a plastic envelope
And put the flower underneath a microscope
See what's written on the petals
Look closer, that's her initials
And now I'm walking by Bev and Mick's backpacker hostel on Victoria Street
Where it's reggae night tonight
And the backpackers are pouring out like a tidal wave of vomit
I have to sit down on the curbside and count the coins in my pocket
See if I have enough cash to take a taxi home
...No
All right, yes, can we just try to figure this out?
Can we just talk about this, please?
Nah, I don't wanna talk to you
OK, you wanna keep fighting?
Yeah, I wanna keep on fighting
All right, fair enough
1, 2, 3, here we go!
Having an argument with myself down Queensbury Street
The lonely light from the town hall clock tower
Chime of the bells striking
1, 2, 3
And it took shape in the form of an image in the form of a living memory
The way her shadow used to walk by your side
In a different time, in a different city
Oh please, no you oh please!
I wanna see you drop down on your knees
I wanna see your hand waving "Farewell"
Why you hittin' yourself, why you hittin' yourself?
"History repeats itself twice," said Marx
First as tragedy, then as farce
But where did I find the source
To make history of a love, a love like ours?
For about four years I've hated this town
Yeah, so much I just wanna get out
Since graduation was long ago
Please somebody get me out of this hole
'Cause I don't want to get stuck in here
When I am thirty-four just talkin' 'bout high school years
No I don't wanna be there, and feel so stuck right here
Back and forth, side to side, oh my dear
My foot to the floor I will drive to the place
Where I can kick it with friends through the night
A place we'll talk about now and the past what the future holds
Hanging out with not much to do
Just aimless with each other - is what we do
Cause this ain't where it's at
My friends will second that
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But it's like were our own brat pack
We're always kickin' back nobody can take that
And that is that it's like it's all we have
Whoa! Whoa!
Come on say "Oh! Oh! Get on the floor!
Dance till you got no more!"
I know its there somewhere
Don't worry I'll be there to rock the party all night
To rock it till there's light our fists in the air
Fightin' the good fight
Cause' we were singing along to Peter Gabriel's "Sledgehammer" song
You know it's clear that tonight we belong in this place
So I step back to reflect in this town I hate
And at least just for a second I think I might stay
This ain't where it's at
My friends will second that
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But it's like were our own brat pack
We're always kickin' back nobody can take that
And that is that
So I'll run away to the hopes that I have
But still I fall asleep in the arms of my past
And when I wake so helpless and thinking of that
I just lay back down
Again, everyday
So maybe later today I'll know
What I will do with my life as I know it
Maybe for now I'll drive back to that place where I belong
And hope to God it hasn't changed
This ain't where it's at
My friends will second that
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But it's like were our own brat pack
We're always kickin' back
Nobody can take that no no no
This ain't where it's at
My friends will second that
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But it's like were our own brat pack
We're always kickin' back
Nobody can take that
That is that it's like it's all we have
Diamonds shine like stars beneath the ground,
Little rivers run in rings around the town,
And everyone's a soldier just marching towards the ocean.
Then we know we've packed up all we had to move from '93.
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
And nobody will love them, and nobody will love them.
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden.
And we took a train into the town,
And stuck another needle in the ground,
If we never get another sound
Then we know we've packed up all we had to move from '93.
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
Nobody will love them, nobody will love them.
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden.
And they can't lift you up.
We gathered around the school
To hear just what they found,
But they told us they had tried,
Still the little boy had died.
We gathered around to hear just what they'd done,
Yeah, they shine like stars under the ground,
And everyone's a soldier just marching towards the ocean.
Then we know we've packed up all we had to move from '93.
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
Nobody will love them, nobody will love them.
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you.
Build high, build high
Build high, build high
Cause my old man is bleeding
And my poor dog needs feeding
And this time I'm really broke
So let me feel your leg of hope around me
Build high, build high
Build high, build high
I said build high, yeah, build high
Build high, build high
Build high, build high
Hold me up with pride
'Cause I'm not beautiful and
I don't have no pretty friends, can't pretend
I'm tired of believing in the things that go on here
Lately it makes me feel just like someone's forming in the air air air
Build high, build high
Build high, build high
I said build high, yeah, build high
Build high, build high
Build high, build high
Hopeful days and stormy nights
I ain't got much to win, not much to lose
Under the burden of my loneliness
It feels so hard to win, so hard to lose
I won't enjoy my collection of stamps
When I'm six feet under the ground
Lonely streets and dusty roads
Lord it's a long way to go back home
Under the burden of your heart of stone
You shrug your shoulders as I decompose
Please keep a eye on those red haired boys
Someday they'll play drum with my shinbones
Now your chewing-gum on my coffin
Take me where I long to be
I can't believe that you want me to wear
The evening tails that will fit my corpse
I don't need a tuxedo
There's no bouncer in the after world
I only just left my dying bed and
Your making curtains out of my shroud
Don't you dig my grave with some excavator
Use a blood stained sword and a snow-white horse, please
A last ride in the city's hearse
Few miles away from heaven above
A few more minutes till they bury me
A few more weeks till worms lick my bones
I won't enjoy my collection of stamps
Now I'm five feet under the ground
Stormy days and lonely nights
Lord it's a long way to go back home
All the boys raise your hands up in the air (yeah)
Now all the girls raise your hands up in the air (yeah)
Everybody one more time (yeah)
Let's all have a real good time together
One, two, three, let's go
Funky squaredance, funky squaredance, funky squaredance
Tonight's the night girls, yeah
Come on, let's get all antsy
Funky squaredance, funky squaredance, funky squaredance
Funky squaredance, funky squaredance, funky squaredance
Funky squaredance, funky squaredance, funky squaredance
Funky squaredance, funky squaredance, funky squaredance
Funky squaredance, funky squaredance, funky squaredance
Funky squaredance, funky squaredance, funky squaredance
Funky squaredance, funky squaredance, funky squaredance
Funky squaredance, funky squaredance, funky squaredance
Funky squaredance, funky squaredance, funky squaredance
You seem so glad my place is free
Now you're dancing on my grave
What a cruel way to treat a friend
Live my life in dignity
Well I must confess
Looking for a place
Everybody has to demonstrate
And everybody has to see you wait
Thinking of a real way to see
What matters is the love that you give
Remember all the thing that you've seen
Does another go and never seen
Nothing in my forgotten years
Life got a little serious
Give me real self-esteem
It's buried in my P-A-S-T
Give a lot, a whole lot received
Heaven-sent T.N.T.
Uh, can't go further, losing
I can't go losing my mind
Remember all the game have I tried
Buried in my P-A-S-T
We call love late at day
Late at night I dropped in hate
Dropping in a heaven fantasy
Heaven knows what I'm gonna do
Living in a lonesome avenue
Done in the P-A-S-T
Go without the love I receive
K-A-R-I-E E-L-E-I-S-O-N
Mmm, everybody, has got to demonstrate
Everybody has a T-I-U
He has things you'd never do
Thinking in a real avenue
What matters is the love that you give

Fall down the stairs
It's been a long time since
I got my hands on your teenage poems
It's the only poison that I like
I'm throwing rocks at broken windows
Picking locks with footprints from the snow
And I don't believe you live in a library
(That sails the sea)
Sleeping with a book-blanket out at sea
(Like the girls told me)
My little bird flew away from me
She made her home in a poor country
You're breaking branches
On your way down
Just some one new
To throw your arms around
The next time I wake up, I want it to be
In a rabbit hole to the sound of you
(Making coffee)
With the warm, salty sea
Its waves crashing over me
Look what you done
You punched a hole in the sun
(Now it won't shine)
Look what you done
You punched a hole in the sun
(How did you know?)
Look what you've done
You punched a hole in the sun
And now it won't shine for anyone
Well I can't wait to tell you all about her, all about my new girl
(He can't wait to tell you about his new girl)
And I can't wait for you to hear me shout it, all about my new girl
(He can't wait to tell you about his new girl)
When we were together you tried to break my heart
Said you always did your best at keeping us apart
Said now you're dead and gone and I've got a new thing going...
I can't wait to see your face when you and your friends show up
So I've got a - I got a new girl (repeat 4 times)
Something makes you think that you're some kinda winner
Said you wanna get married and cook somebody dinner?
Said you're making fun of me 'cause I'm young and got no money
I've got no time for school books 'cause I got no time to study.
Well I can't wait to tell you all about her, all about my new girl
(He can't wait to tell you about his new girl)
And I can't wait for you to hear me shout it, all about my new girl
(He can't wait to tell you about his new girl)
So I've got a - I got a new girl (repeat 4 times)
Hey!
You're the type of girl that any guy would die for
That's the way it looks and I'm really glad you think so
So concerned with friends and your popularity
That you never even took the time to see the real me
Well I can't wait to tell you all about her, all about my new girl
(He can't wait to tell you about his new girl)
And I can't wait for you to hear me shout it, all about my new girl
(He can't wait to tell you about his new girl)
So I've got a - I got a new girl (repeat 4 times)
He can't wait to tell you about... (Repeat 4 times)
This one -
New girl
Don't admit you're sick
Let your fit body bury it
The faintness that you feel
Is nothing permanent
Don't buy the sickness on TV
You want your help, they want the fee
You see the ads and start to think
"I feel it coming on"
No, no, target market, television
Telepharmevangelism
Symptom finger
I'm going to shut it off
Down all the power
I'm a doctor today
I'm curing viewers by thousands
Don't admit you're sick
Let your fit body bury it
The faintness that you feel
Is nothing permanent
You open up and let them in
It's nothing conscious
What is this?
I feel a burning in my eyes
It's from the television lies
Slow, slow it down, wait
Now decide
Ok, I'm going to shut it off
Down all the power
I'm a doctor today
I'm curing viewers by thousands
Don't admit you're sick
Let your fit body bury it
The faintness that you feel
Is nothing permanent
You've got to get the shit they sell
The pills that fix the way you feel
Now that they've shown you what to get
You feel it coming on
Low, low, low down, high paid
Prime time, capsule maker
Sickness lover
I'm going to shut it off
Down all the power
I'm a doctor today
I'm curing viewers by thousands
I was buried alive
I came back to haunt you
Are you dying to believe
I can't go on without you?
All we are is too fast for love
We're too young
I hate to love you
The night's gone
And you're gone too.
But you can't be missed
If you never go away
It's the end of a broken heart
I went on without you
I was lost from the start
I did what I had to
All we are is too fast for love
We're too young
I hate to love you
The night's gone
And you're gone too.
But you can't be missed
If you never go away
You don't know what I've seen
You can see that I've been damaged
Without you
And I don't know where you've been
I can wash your sins away
We're too young
I hate to love you
The night's gone
And you're gone too.
But you can't be missed
If you never go away
It's the end of a broken heart [x4]
Lately I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend
But that's one thing you've already got
He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He'd kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would
Back in my head we were kissing
I thought things were going all right
With a sign on my back saying 'kick me'
Reality ruined my life
It feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
He's got 27 tattoos
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would, I would
Would he please you?
Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would?
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would
Would he please you?
Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would?
Would he touch you?
Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would, I would
We took a trip down in '87
We were looking for a place where we don't fear heaven
Yeah, we got some guns, got some dogs
But just like them dogs, well those guns just get bigger.
Looking to the town to show us what they got,
We'll take it to the cabin and we'll show ya what we got.
We got space to do what you please.
If you'll ever make it out.
If I never stand at another corner trying hard to be a father
Let's be, let's be love.
If I never need again I'll find that sleep again,
Let's be, let's be love.
We took a trip down in '87
We were looking for a place where we don't need heaven.
Oh, once you crawl in you'll never come back again.
Oh, once you crawl in you'll never come back again.
If I never stand at another corner trying hard to be a father
Let's be, let's be love.
If I never need again I'll find that sleep again,
Let's be, let's be love.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
And if you catch us coming up about around the bend.
And if we step a little higher will we find it then?
There's gotta be something roaming up around the bend.
Oh, once you crawl in you'll never come back again.
Oh, once you crawl in you'll never come back again.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
Though I never pray God reigns today.
I am a blue blood
I will admit that
I dance in blue shoes and wear a blue hat
Live in a blue house
On a blue street
In a blue town
By a blue creek
I write my blue songs
With my blue pen
I sing the blue notes
To my blue friends
Now I don't that much about you
But I like you
Because you're true blue
I had a blue dream
About a blue star
In it I drove there
In my blue car and when I got there
I met a blue dog
With a blue tongue
We had some real fun
We bounced a blue ball
It broke a blue glass
We banged on blue drums and call it blue grass
I guess the thing I'm trying to tell you
Is that it's best, kid
If you're true blue
Once I had gangrene
I got it real bad
So the doc came with his black bag
I said 'You know, Doc, I don't feel swell,
If you had a blue bag, I think I'd get well..'
So he came right back
With a blue sack
He said 'Will this do?'
I said 'Why not, Yeah"
That's why I'm here today
To tell you
That it's best, man
To be true blue
Out on the blue sea
I sailed a blue ship
I had a first mate
Always had blue lips
His name was Bluebeard
He had a weird twitch
He flew a blue flag
On a big stick
And we ate blue gill and we ate blue chips
Oh I felt real blue, eating that blue fish
Because there ain't much that I won't do
Unless it keeps me from being true blue
Once in a blue moon
There's a blue sky
I wear my blue jeans and fly my blue kite
Thing's like a bluebird, until the wind dies
And then the tears pour
Out of my blue eyes
If it's your birthday
We'll bake a blue cake
And then we'll eat it off these blue plates
'Cause kid I don't know much about about you
But I like you
Because you're true blue
Yeah I don't know much about you
But I like you 'cause you're
True!
Blue!
So you're standing on a ledge
It looks like you might fall
So far down, or maybe you were thinking about jumping
Now you could have it all
If you learned a little patience
For though I cannot fly
I'm not content to crawl
So give me a little credit
Have in me a little faith
I want to be with you forever
If tomorrow's not too late
But it's always too late when you got nothing
So you say
And you should never let the sun set on tomorrow
Before the sun rises today
If I am another waste of everything you dreamed of
I will let you down
If I am only here to watch you as you suffer
I will let you down
So you're walking on the edge
And you wait your turn to fall
But you're so far gone
That you don't see the hands upheld to catch you
And you could find the fault
In the heart that you've been handed
For though you cannot fly
You're not content to crawl
And it's always too late when you got nothing
So you say
But you should never let the sun set on tomorrow
Before the sun rises
If I am another waste of everything you hoped for
I will let you down
If I am only here to watch you as you suffer
I will let you down
So you're standing on the ledge
It looks like you might fall
If I am another waste of everything you dreamed of
I will let you down (I will let you down)
If I am only here to watch you as you suffer
I will let you down (If I am)
The answers we find
Are never what we had in mind
So we make it up as we go along (I won't let you down)
You don't talk of dreams
I won't mention tomorrow
We won't make those promises that we can't keep
I will never leave you
I will not let you down
I will never leave you
I will not let you down
Unfolding, enveloping missiles of soul
Recall senses sadly
Mirage like soft blue like lanterns below
To light the way gladly
Whether whistling heaven's clouds disappear
Where the wind withers memory
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away
(White hot glistening shadowy flows) Feel flows
(Black hot glistening shadowy flows) Feel goes 
Unbending, never-ending tablets of time
Record all the yearning
Unfearing, all-appearing message divine
Eases the burning
Whether willing witness waits at my mind
Whether hope dampens memory
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side
(White hot glistening shadowy flows) Feel flows
(Black hot glistening shadowy flows) Feel goes 
Encasing all embracing wreath of repose
Engulfs all the senses
Imposing, unclosing thoughts that compose
Retire the fences
Whether wholly heartened life fades away
Whether harps heal the memory
Whether wholly heartened life fades away
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away
(White hot glistening shadowy flows) Feel flows
(Black hot glistening shadowy flows) Feel goes 
(White hot glistening shadowy flows) Feel goes 
(White hot glistening shadowy flows) Feelings to grow 
White hot glistening shadowy flows
White hot glistening shadowy flows
White hot glistening shadowy flows
The buttons on my phone are worn thin
I don't think that I knew the chaos I was getting in.
But I've broken all my promises to you
I've broken all my promises to you.
Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this so easily?
You make it hard to smile because
You make it hard to breathe
Why do you do this to me?
A phrasing that's a single tear,
Iis harder than I ever feared
And you were left feeling so alone.
Because these days aren't easy
Like they have been once before
These days aren't easy anymore.
Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this so easily?
You make it hard to smile because
You make it hard to breathe
Why do you do this to me?
To me, to me, to me...
I should've known this wasn't real
And fought it off and fought to feel
What matters most? Everything
That you feel while listening to every word that I sing.
I promise you I will bring you home
I will bring you home.
Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this so easily?
You make it hard to smile because
You make it hard to breathe
Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this so easily?
You make it hard to smile because
You make it hard to breathe
Why do you do this to me?
To me, to me, to me...

(Whoa, babe) I don't wanna lie
I'm gonna take what you're giving
'Cause I know you're willing
To take me all the way, you got me right here
Combustible, and I can't wait to finally explode
The big big bang, the reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside
The big big bang
The big big bang
The big big bang
Some people like to talk. but I'm into doing
What I feel like doing, when I'm inspired to
So, if we take a walk down, the beach tonight
I bet that we could light up the sky
The big big bang, the reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside
The big big bang
The big big bang
The big big bang
Take it from me, I don't wanna be, mummified
Sometimes I feel so isolated
I wanna die, and I'll take it from you, if you got it
Every time, so baby
Bring your body here, next to mine
Next to mine!
When I don't wanna dream!
I just wanna live it!
So baby, let's not miss this thing!
The big big bang, the reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside
The big big bang
The big big bang
The big big bang
Hit the big big big bang
Whoa, babe
Whoa, babe
Whoa, babe
Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been "When it's right, it's right."
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?
When everything's a little clearer in the light of day?
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway?
Thinkin 'bout you's working up my appetite
Lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
And the thought of loving you is getting so exciting
Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught that didn't bite
But you got some bait a-waiting and I think I might
Like nibblin' a little afternoon delight
Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun goes down
Thinkin' of you's workin' up a' appetite
Lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
And the thought of loving you is getting so exciting
Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Every time it's the same old thing.
You heat me up like a burning flame.
I don't mind if you play your game,
'Cause I know I'll make you scream my name.
Scream my name. scream my name.
Scream my name. scream my name.
In the club doin' my thang,
At the bar just sippin a drink.
You walked by in those tight ass jeans,
Gave me and my homies a wink.
When I see that booty poppin' out,
It do somethin' strange to me.
Like a full moon to a werewolf,
You drivin' me crazy.
Now I can tell by your attitude
That you know that your fine as hell.
The way you walk, the way you talk,
It's like you got somethin' good to sell.
I respect your hustle girl
But don't try to hustle me
'Cause I'm a straight pimp with a gangsta limp
And it runs in the family.
And the way your shaking it at the club,
Tryin' to make a brother fall in love.
You dirty dance me all night long
Then you leave me hanging. Girl, you're wrong.
Every time it's the same old thing.
You heat me up like a burning flame.
I don't mind if you play your game.
'Cause I know I'll make you scream my name.
Scream my name. scream my name
Scream my name. scream my name.
Girl your hot, your body's on fuego.
We fit together like if we was two Lego's.
We on the floor and we grind to the beat.
I love the way your body's moving when its grindin on me.
We got the drinks by the dozen and mo' bottles coming but
I don't care, all I want is your lovin'.
I'm a sex machine,
And girl you turn me on.
I get you off till the break of dawn.
And the way your shaking it at the club,
Try to make a brother fall in love.
Be dirty dancing me all night long
Then you leave me hanging. Girl, you're wrong.
Every time it's the same old thing.
You heat me up like a burning flame.
I don't mind if you play your game
'Cause I know I'll make you
I'm gon' make you. I'm gon make you.
I said I'm gon' make you scream my name.
You know I want your body. Your body wants me too.
You say I'm acting naughty but girl you're naughty too.
Your girls wanna leave, I hear them calling you.
Its either them or me, girl who you wanna do?
Girl come with me, it's plain to see.
We can have a fantasy.
Come with me, it's plain to see.
You can have your fantasy with me.
You know I want your body. Your body wants me too.
You say I'm acting naughty but girl you're naughty too.
Your friends they wanna leave girl they're calling you.
Its either them or me, girl who you wanna do?
To the gods in the sky
There's one thing you can do
You can send us some sun
And we'll play you this tune
Because sitting in our room
Lying down with a scoob
And the sunshine
Through our window
It's days like these
That make us happy
Like a puppy getting lucky
With Lassie hassle-free
Hours passing by
With the beat one two
Said it's days like these kicking back
Just doing what we do
Number one I'd find some
Loving in the sun
With someone that can make me
Growl and hum say hmmm...
A boom boom shak
And the beat that she throw at me
Knocking me flat
Number two
I'd cruise where the grass is smooth
And the sound of the sea
Is a dreamy melody
Snooze all afternoon
Till the night time wake me
'Cause shakedown soon
Number three
I'd be dancing like a monkey up a tree
Find sweet simplicity
By kissing my honey
Get funky like Bond
When he's played by Connery
And get crafty
Like Don Corleone
Four
Watching Oliver jam a little more
Remember the night when I saw
What I never never never seen before
Lavender wrestling a rich wild boar
It's days like these
That make us happy
Like a puppy getting lucky
With Lassie hassle-free
Hours passing by
With the beat one two
Said it's days like these kicking back
Just doing what we do
Whack
Beats splat
Woke up on the attack
Work myself frantic to the moon and back
Now it's evening and the sausages are frying out back
I write my rhyme for this track
As the sky fade to black
Now I remember earlier in the day
As I was swimming through the bay
A bass player I know swum my way
He said g'day
Hey, you wanna go see some reggae
Starts at 8 and plays through to sunrise the next day
So 9 O'clock sees me heading out towards the tabernackle
Hardcore reggae beat bring my feet out of these shackles
Hardcore reggae DJ I Salute you
Crackle crackle crackle of the vinyl
Now I'm high
Now a spectacular night ahead
I met a Mexican called Juan
(There's a party on the hill would you like to come?)
Yeah
(And bring a bottle of rum)
Can't afford it, but I bought it
And then I sung:
It's nights like these when you know that your alive
Nights like these when you know that you got fire
Nights like these when don't have to try
Fall in love and kiss and smile from every girl walking by
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And my eyes want to cry
'Cause the night and the sky is so high
And my life is sublime and it's mine and it's time
(Is now one)
It's nights like these when you know that your alive
Nights like these when you know that you got fire
Nights like these when you laugh until you cry
Nights like these when I'm drowning in your eyes
It's nights like these when you know that your alive (I feel like I've been living)
Nights like these when you know that you got fire (My life from the beginning
Nights like these when you laugh until you cry (And all the songs I'm singing)
Is all the love I'm giving
It's days like these
That make us happy
Like a puppy getting lucky
With Lassie hassle-free
Hours passing by
With the beat one two
Said it's days like these kicking back
Just doing what we do
And dirty hands
I like them see
They make the music that we play
Sound oh so sweet
And my mother always made me eat broccoli
And now look at me
I'm as strong as can be
So put some spice in my sauce
Honey in my tea
An ace up my sleeve
And a slinky plan b
And most importantly
My mad family
They named me lucky
And for that I'll sing about
Days like these
Take my home
Take everything I own
Take it, take control
You will feel better
You will feel whole
You're so good
You stopped me where I stood
And let me look at love and I feel better
Oh I feel good
I just wanna give it all to you
I wanna share this with you
Make you mine and mine will be all yours
Whatever you want and more
What I'm anticipating
Everything else would be overrated
Baby it's for you it's all for you
You speak kind
Oh if you were mine
What would we be like
We would be liked
We would be
I just wanna give it all to you
I wanna share this with you
Make you mine and mine will be all yours
Whatever you want and more
What I'm anticipating
Everything else would be overrated
Baby it's for you it's all for you
Everything else would be overrated
Everything else would be overrated
Open up
Let me fill your cup
I can really pour it out
It will be like
I will be enough
I just wanna give it all to you
I wanna share this with you
Make you mine and mine will be all yours
Whatever you want and more
What I'm anticipating
Everything else would be overrated
Baby it's for you
Baby it's for you
Baby it's for you 
It's all for you
You came in to my life
You cannot separate yourself
You came in to my life
You cannot separate yourself
And I found that 'round here
In this city
That I won't disappear
In this city
I got nothing to fear
In this city
In this city
And I found that 'round here
In this city
That I won't disappear
In this city
I got nothing to fear
In this city
In this city
Close those doors
Close those doors now
Now, now, just keep 'em open
Keep 'em open, yeah, keep 'em open
I'll keep on, keep, keep on going
Taking it in so, so heavy
Take it easy son, this ain't so deadly
Got keep on, gotta go on, gotta go on
Take it all with what we've done
Gotta push it, push it, push it
To the top of the building
Even when no one is feeling
It might bother you, don't let it
If these people just don't get it
They can't express it
They won't accept it
She said it's okay that they
May never give you that credit
And I found that 'round here
In this city
That I won't disappear
In this city
I got nothing to fear
In this city
In this city
And I found that 'round here
In this city
That I won't disappear
In this city
I got nothing to fear
In this city
In this city
I've been down here
Down these roads
People pass through
Some stay some go
Standing here broke
Not a penny to my name
But she says she loves me all the same
I try my best and you do to
And all you want is something you can move to
Everybody's gotta get their kicks somewhere
Everybody gotta fit in somewhere
There's an open road
And I'm traveling down
Don't know where to go
But I lock and load
Shoot that sky 'til the moon explode
Moon explode
Now we're laying in a field
White flowers on our backs
Talking 'bout home
But we can't go back
I guess that's why we left
So we could take a step
Keep moving and forget the rest
You came in to my life
You cannot separate yourself
You came in to my life
You cannot separate yourself
And I found that 'round here
In this city
That I won't disappear
In this city
I got nothing to fear
In this city
In this city
And I found that 'round here
In this city
That I won't disappear
In this city
I got nothing to fear
In this city
In this city
And I found that 'round here
In this city
That I won't disappear
In this city
I got nothing to fear
In this city
In Babylon on the boulevard of broken dreams, my will power at the lowest ebb.
Oh what can I do?
Oh buccaneer!
Can ya help me put my truck in gear?
Can ya take me far away from here, save my soul from sin?
"You wanna get away? You've had it man? Nothing's going right so come sit on the sands of the island! Island of lost souls. No luxuries. No no! Amenities? Too dull! Your senses? Oh oh! Only primitive! Hey hey! Really get away!" is what he said...
Where did he go?
I'm tired of waiting here for him.
Where can he be?
He's not with me!
Where did he go?
What will I do alone?
Why did he run, run away from me?
"The sky is blue, the sea is warm and clear, and golden sands are calling out to you. Inviting. Make a new man outta you! You can come for a while, come with a friend, forget about work, start all over again, let the real you through! Here's what we do..."
Where did he go?
I'm tired of waiting here for him.
Where can he be?
He's not with me!
Where did he go?
What will I do alone?
Why did he run, run away from me?
Oh-oh oh-oh!
Oh buccaneer!
Can ya help me put my truck in gear?
Can ya take me far away from here, save my soul from sin?
"No luxuries. No no! Amenities? Too dull! Your senses? Oh oh! Only primitive! Hey hey! Really get away! Island of Lost Souls!"
Eee ya ya ya ya ya! Island of Lost Souls. Iya iya iya iya island. Iya island.
Island of lost so oh oh oh oh. Iya iya. Island of lost souls. Forget about work.
Forget about work! Start all over again! Oh oh oh oh. Island of lost souls.
Isla Isla Isla Isla ah. (?) Ayayayaya.
Island of lost so oh oh oh oh. Far away from Babylon. Oh oh oh oh oh. On the boulevard.
Oh oh. Of broken dreams iyayailan. Island of lost so oh oh oh. Oh oh!
Go
One, two, three, four
Rejoice, rejoice, God's ears are stitches
Oh rejoice, his eyes are big X's
Oh rejoice, his arms are burning witches
Oh rejoice, his hands perform hexes
Rejoice despite the fact this world will hurt you
And rejoice despite the fact this world will kill you
And rejoice despite the fact this world will tear you to shreds
Rejoice because you're trying your best
And rejoice, the bed you sleep in is burning
Oh rejoice, the sky's fucking falling
Oh rejoice, the world we know is turning
Oh rejoice, your father's been calling
Rejoice although this world will devastate you
And rejoice although this world will penetrate you
And rejoice although you will not survive
Rejoice you'll never make it out alive
And rejoice, your hair it smells like burning hair
Oh rejoice, your nails all got chewed off
Oh rejoice, and holy fuck you're bleeding there
Oh rejoice, you burned your whole beard off
Rejoice despite the fact this world will hurt you
And rejoice despite the fact this world will kill you
And rejoice despite the fact this world will tear you to shreds
Rejoice because you're trying your best
When your heirloom's wilted brown
When the devil's pushing down
When your mourning has a sound
And you hesitate to laugh
How quickly will your joy pass
How quickly will your joy pass
And when you walk inside I feel the door
I'll never let it push your arms no more
And when your legs give out just lie right down
And I will kiss you till your breath is found
And when you walk inside I feel the door
I'll never let it push your arms no more
So do you think I came to fight?
And do I always think I'm right?
Oh no I never meant to be a pest to anyone this time
Oh no I only meant to be a friend to everyone this time
Solo tu sabes bien quien soy
Y por eso es tuyo mi corazon 
Solo tu doblas mi razon 
Y por eso a donde tu quieras voy
No creo que el mar algun dia
Pierda el sabor a sal
No creo en mi todavia
No creo en el azar
Solo creo en tu sonrisa azul
En tu mirada de cristal
En los besos que me das
Y en todo lo que digas
Solo tu sabes bien quien soy
Y por eso es tuyo mi corazon
Solo tu doblas mi razon
Y por eso a donde tu quieras voy
Si hablo demasiado
No dejes de lado
Que nadie mas te amara asi
Como lo hago yo
No creo en Venus ni en Marte
No creo en Carlos Marx
No creo en Jean Paul Sartre
No creo en Brian Weiss
Solo creo en tu sonrisa azul
En tu mirada de cristal
En los besos que me das
Y hablen lo que hablen
Solo tu sabes bien quien soy
Y por eso es tuyo mi corazon
Solo tu doblas mi razon
Y por eso a donde tu quieras voy
Si hablo demasiado
No dejes de lado
Que nadie mas te amara asi
Como lo hago yo
Quiero ser tu firmamento
De tu boca una cancion 
De tus alas siempre ser el viento
Tu terron de sal
Un rayo de sol
Que a donde digas que tu 
Quieras que yo vaya voy
Eres mi desliz, mi pais feliz
Mi primavera
Mi escalera al cielo si
Por eso sigo aqui y camino
Contigo a ti nunca podria decirte que no
Solo tu sabes bien quien soy
Y por eso es tuyo mi corazon
Solo tu doblas mi razon
Y por eso a donde tu quieras voy
Tu terron de sal
Un rayo de sol
Que a donde digas que tu quieres
Que yo vaya voy
Eres mi desliz, mi pais feliz
Mi primavera,
Mi escalera al cielo
Si hablo demasiado
No dejes de lado
Que nadie mas te amara asi
Como lo hago...
Translation
Only you, know me well
and because of that, my heart is yours
Only you, bend my reason 
and that's why I'll go anywhere you want me to.
I don't believe that the sea, 
will someday lose its salty flavor, 
I still don't believe in myself, 
I don't believe in chance.
I only believe in your blue smile, 
in your crystal stare,
in the kisses that you give me 
and in everything you say.
Only you, know me well 
and because of that, my heart is yours
Only you, bend my reason 
and that's why I'll go anywhere you want me to.
If I talk too much 
Don't set aside
that nobody has loved you,
the way I do.
I don't believe in Venus nor Mars 
I don't believe in Carl Marx 
I don't believe in Jean-Paul Sartre 
I don't believe in Brian Weiss. 
I only believe in your blue smile, 
in your crystal stare,
in the kisses that you give me 
and no matter what they say. 
Only you, know me well
and because of that, my heart is yours
Only you, bend my reason 
and that's why I'll go anywhere you want me to.
If I talk too much 
Don't set aside
that nobody has loved you,
the way I do.
Oh, I want to be your firmament, 
a song from your mouth, 
always be the wind from your wings.
Your clod of salt, 
a ray of sunlight 
That wherever you say you want, 
Me to go, I'll go
You're my slip, my happy country 
My spring, 
My stairway to the sky, yeah
That's why I'm still here and walk with you
and I could never say no to you. 
Only you, know me well
and because of that, my heart is yours
Only you, bend my reason 
and that's why I'll go anywhere you want me to.
Your clod of salt, 
a ray of sunlight 
That wherever you say you want, 
Me to go, I'll go
You're my slip, my happy country 
My spring, 
My stairway to the sky...
If I talk too much 
Don't set aside,
that nobody has loved you,
the way I do.
A young boy
Chasing his prayers
Upstairs
A white lie
A red light
And her thighs 
On his mind
Hey!
Gotta let it
Hey!
Gotta let it
Hey!
Gotta let it out, let it out, let it
Hey!
Gotta let it
Hey!
Gotta let it
Hey!
Gotta let it out, let it out, let it
She was a young girl
Whispers her prayers
Laid bare
At midnight
An invite
It's pitch black
And bride white
Hey!
Gotta let it
Hey!
Gotta let it
Hey!
Gotta let it out, let it out, let it
Hey!
Gotta let it
Hey!
Gotta let it
Hey!
Gotta let it out, let it out
Take me somewhere new
Take me somewhere new
And the shoes you've grown into
Will soon start wearing you
Hey!
Gotta let it
Hey!
Gotta let it
Hey!
Gotta let it out, let it out, let it
Hey!
We gotta let it
Hey!
Gotta let it
Hey!
We gotta let it out, let it out, let it
Young boys
And young girls
Upstairs
Somewhere
Why's it so strange when they say that the world's movin' upwards?
Why's it surreal when my hands feel they can't roll the dice?
Why's it so great just to wake every day alive and by your side?
It's a mystery, I guess
There's lots of things that I can't find
Not the way that you look
But your move that catches my eye
Why's it so soft when the cannons unload on the others? 
Why are we so loud when we say it won't happen to us? 
Why does my mind blow to bits every time they play that song?
It's just the way that he sings
Not the words that he says or the band
I'm in love with this soul
It's a meaning that I understand
Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll
If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind
If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me
Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
And he's mean talking beanstalking icey man
My feet are walking over him
My sneakers in his hand
And with a picket for a knife
And a rocket to depart in
My life had barely started since you jumped all my heart
And now we're lazy
Lazy ooh lazy
In a galaxy of stars with nothing in the middle
'Cept the planet that we own and its playing 2nd fiddle
And we're playing 2nd fiddle
And we're bogged down in a delta of glee
My mouth has sprung wide open
We got tickets they were free
And can you keep sleeping metaphysical girl
Since the stars predicted something new would reconnect our worlds
And now we're lazy
Can we grow out?
And he's mean talking beanstalking icey man
My feet are walking over him
My sneakers in his hand
And with a picket for a knife
And a rocket to depart in
My life had barely started since you jumped all on my heart
A gente somos linda
A gente somos inteligente
A gente somos o trio mais foda

My baby's always dancing
It wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no loving, and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
My baby just can't take her eyes off me
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, woo
I just can't
I just can't 
I just can't control my feet
I just can't 
I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't
I just can't 
I just can't control my feet
I just can't 
I just can't
I just can't control my feet
Sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
This magic music grooves me
That dirty rhythm fools me
The devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever
A fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, ow
Sunshine (whoo)
Moonlight (yeah)
Good times (mm)
Boogie (you just gotta)
Sunshine (yeah)
Moonlight
Good times (good times)
Boogie
Don't you blame it (sunshine)
You just got to (moonlight)
You just want to (good times)
Yeah, oh (boogie)
Blame it on yourself (sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault (moonlight)
But yours and that boogie (good times)
Oh, all night long (boogie)
Yours and that boogie (sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault (moonlight)
But yours and that boogie (good times)
Dancin' all night long (boogie)
Blame it on yourself (sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault (moonlight)
But yours and that boogie
He was a bore, a true chore and I still wonder why I ever wanted
To see him more
I know it's useless to complain all these years after, well
Thanks for asking now I'm fine
I should have muffled my obsession but I was all too pure
And so blindly sure that he'd always have the satisfying hug I needed
Stay just a little bit more
Don't let my heart turn sore
He was kind, polite and divine in public, tender as a sleepy child
But when we got slightly more intimate, it wasn't that bright
Yes he was kind, polite, sound and sublime, in theory
But in practice believe me, there was a nasty fire burning
Stay just a little bit more
Don't let my heart turn sore
And when my curves came into play
Oh what a hopeless tumbling down
When his desire was stuck in plaster
I was young but I believed in no tales!
So in the desert of the bed I looked hard for an oasis
But all I could find was a dead camel in pieces
And I got so scared I tried to lure him back to bed
Whispered "stay just a little more"
But now I'm grateful to the camel
'Cause all the lazy boy could do was RUN, then I knew for sure
That he would never be the satisfying shag I needed, no no no no
Baby I don't know
Just why I love you so
Maybe it's just the way
That God made me this day
Ay oh ay oh ay
Ay oh ay oh ay
Honey I need you
And I'm feeling for you
It wont be too long till
That I ask what again
Ay oh ay oh ay
Ay oh ay oh ay
Ay oh ay oh ay
Ay oh ay oh ay
(Let's go)
(Let's go)
Ay
Oh ay
Ay
Oh ay
Baby I don't know
Just why I love you so
Maybe it's just the way
That God made me this day
Ay oh ay oh ay
Ay oh ay oh ay
Ay oh ay oh ay
Ay oh ay oh ay
Ay oh ay oh ay
Ay oh ay oh ay
Ay oh ay oh ay
Ay oh ay oh ay
Sha la la la la la la, 
Mmm, uh-huh
I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know she dances while his father plays guitar
So she's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the mornin'
Sha la la la la la la la yeah, 
Uh-huh, yeah
Curl up, Maria! Show me some of that Spanish dancin'
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me, help me believe in anything
'Cause I, I wanna be someone who believes, yeah
Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
"She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me"
Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely
Well, I'm gonna paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful
Yeah, well you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday, if I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play
Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
"She's looking at you. I don't think so. She's looking at me"
Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely
I will never be lonely, son, I'm never gonna be lonely
I wanna be a lion
E-Everybody wants to pass as cats
We all wanna be big big stars
Yeah but we've got different reasons for that
Believe in me 'cause I don't believe in anything
And I, I wanna be someone to believe
To believe, to believe, yeah
Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
"She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me"
I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, oh, son
That's just' bout as funky as you can be
Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
When I look at the television
I wanna see me staring right back at me
We all wanna be big stars
But we don't know why and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I wanna be just' bout as happy as I could be
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars
La la la
La la la
La la la...
I got on a boat on a hot sunny day
To get out of this town
Cause the tarmac was melting and the people seemed to sway
Stuck in the underground
To the islands, the black kites, the wishing tree
I wanna be with you
On the slow boat to Lan Tao, the misty seas
I wanna be with you
I crawled out the harbour with recession behind
And I'm feeling the love of you
So you better get a charge 'til I see you again
You know just what to do
If you're caught up in the gales on the junk boat seas
I wanna be with you
With the pilgrims, the mountains, the high trapeze
I wanna be with you
If you're a landlord, the social on BST
I wanna be with you
On an island with red kites and verdant seas
I will be there with you
La la la
La la la
La la la...
I wanna be with you
La la la
La la la
La la la...
I wanna be with you
I love Love
I love being in love
I don't care what it does to me
Take these tattered boxes
That used to hold your clothes
Break them down
Build them back up with your bones
All you did was construct a mess
You're good to me when only flesh
You're a memory with nothing to show
When we would take trips
We swore we'd never take pictures
Pictures only prove you can't convince
Now I wsh those photographs
Could convince you that what we had
Would only turn out a negative
Well
Well
Well
If fingertips are relationships
Then I could barely carry your weight
If fingers are mistakes
Don't use this one to point the blame
Just sing
Sing
I love love
I love being in love
I don't care what it does to me
These pills are fine to pass the time
Till I find my new drug
Then
We'll take our chances
We'll last a month
We'll never speak again
How I love being in love
And don't pick up the line
You're dressed to have a good time
You don't need him, you need to be seen
So someone else can treat you wrong
So you my love can sing this song
I love love
I love being in love
I don't care what it does to me
These pills are fine to pass the time
Till I find my new drug
Then
They'll take advantage
I'll claim that's what I want
To be the new statistic
How I love
How I love
How I love being in love
Take these tattered boxes
That used to hold your clothes
Break them down
Build them back up with your bones
All you did was construct a mess
You're dead to me if love is death
You're a memory with nothing to show
WELL
WELL
WELL
If fingertips are relationships
Then maybe I could use a break
She smiles
She points at me
She's says:
Baby I love how you sing
So just
Sing
I love love
I love being in love
I don't care what it does to me
These pills are fine to pass the time
Till I find my new drug
Then
We'll take our chances
We'll rise above
We'll last until the end
How I love
How I love
How I love being in love
Sometimes the sun shines on us
Sometimes the rain goes and a rainbow's all that's left
We got lucky, hey, didn't we, baby?
'Cause I like your head on my shoulder
I like the way you smile, the way you smile oh oh
We both think the weather's getting better
So let's get lucky, let's go all the way
I found you seaside in the fog
I hadn't tried a lot of looking for anything at all
The cloud cover of fog
All the hearts I'm gonna' love in the morning
And I like my head on your shoulder
I like the way you smile, the way you smile oh oh
And we both think the weather's getting better
So let's get lucky, let's go all the way
All the way, get lucky
The weatherman says it's wet and cloudy
Stay indoors, sit out the storm
It looks like this might be a quickie
Hey handsome, we got it good
Hey mister, we gone and done it
Just because we could
Because it's cloudy out there
Staying in like we should
'Cause I like your head on my shoulder
Me I like the way you smile, the way you smile oh oh
And we both know the weather will get better
So let's get lucky, let's go all the way
Let's get lucky, come on, go all the way
Across the night
It was the moon that stole my slumber
Across the night
I fell in love with people sleeping
I fell tired
Asleep in a golden ocean
Eyes perspired
A spike in my fascination
I don't mean to make you cry
But these feelings run right through the night
And I'll only make you cry with these feelings
Across the night
It was the moon that stole my slumber
Across the night
I fell in love with people sleeping
Across the night
Across the night
Across the night
I hugged a man's arthritic shoulder
Sleepless, untamed
Without a leash on the light around me
I don't mean to make you cry
But these feelings run right through the night
And I'll only make you cry with these feelings
Across the night
It was the moon that stole my slumber
Across the night
I feel in love with people sleeping
Across the night
Across the night
Across the night
I hugged a man's arthritic shoulder
I hugged a man's arthritic shoulder
So let us be married
And have another baby
'Cause I don't want to be lonely
I just want to be alone
Yeah, let's just get married
Shouting, Bay, bay, babies!
Oh, you'll never sleep at all
I don't want to be lonely
Oh, you'll never sleep at all
I don't want to be lonely
I just want to be alone
Never seen the sun shine
From higher points than sunrise
I don't want to be lonely
Never seen the sun shine
From higher points than sunrise
I don't to be lonely
I just want to be alone
Alone
Alone
You call me up in the mornings
We'll stay on the phone until dawning
You tell me secrets I actually keep
You call me up around noon and
Bring me all the good gossip
You hold my head when I throw up
I hold your hand when you weep
And we talk about friends and we talk about records
And we talk about life and we talk about death 
And we dance in the living room
We dance on the sidewalks
We dance in the movies
We dance at the festivals, 
And dance, dance
No men ever really dance like this
Damn, I wish I was a lesbian
Damn, I wish I was a lesbian
Damn, I wish I was and that you were too
Damn, I wish I was a lesbian
Damn, I wish I was a lesbian
Damn, I wish I was, so I could fall in love with you
You call me up in the evenings
And tell me what they did this time
No matter what, I'm by your side
When it's raining, we'll go to the video store
We even like the same movies
No damn jedis or hobbits this time
And you laugh at my jokes
And I laugh at your jokes
And I even like the birthday presents you get me
We dance in the living room
We dance on the sidewalks
We dance in the movies
We dance at the festivals
And dance, dance
No men ever really dance like this
Damn, I wish I was a lesbian
Damn, I wish I was a lesbian
Damn, I wish I was and that you were too
Damn, I wish I was a lesbian
Damn, I wish I was a lesbian
Damn, I wish I was, so I could fall in love with you
So I could fall in love with you
Why don't, why don't I fall?
Why don't, why don't I fall?
Why don't I fall in love with you?
Why don't, why don't I fall?
Why don't, why don't I fall?
Why don't I just fall in love with you?
Why don't, why don't I fall?
Why don't, why don't I fall?
Why don't I just fall in love with you?
Hey!
What do you know about the song and the dance in your mind
That boy is looking at you and he says that he knows your kind
I see you dancin' but you never ever mark your words
Hey! what do you know I think you've done it to yourself again
Have you ever, felt so lonely
In this cold, world so cold
Have you ever, felt so lonely
She's got me dancin'
She's got me dancin'
She's got me dancin
And she's always one step behind
(Repeat)
Hey! You! I moved to the side.
Just-a live a little least of your life.
That ex got a bullet aside and she likes what you did before
You see me dancin' but I never ever like to talk.
Hey! what do we know I think we've done it to ourselves again
Have you ever, felt so lonely
In this cold, world so cold
Have you ever, felt so lonely
She's got me dancin'
She's got me dancin'
She's got me dancin
And she's always one step behind
(Repeat)
Have you ever, felt so lonely
In this cold, World so cold
Have you ever, felt so lonely
She's got me dancin'
She's got me dancin'
She's got me dancin
And she's always one step behind
(Repeat)
Our time is ever on the road,
The ride is in what we make.
I walked a year to hear a howl in this give and take.
But hear it this way- hear it this way.
All right!
And war is in our hearts,
And blood is in the land we love.
We keep breaking our backs,
Hoping that it gives enough.
Oh! But what do you need?
What do you need?
Oh man, it's ladders to the sky,
Building up a high-rise.
Oh man, we won't last long,
But we're giving it our best try.
Don't you know you're alive? (ah)
You know you're alive.
And none of us stay, (ah)
The day we're born till then we-
And tonight I'm in love with everybody on the city bus.
I feel the push and pull,
Keep saying that it doesn't mean much.
Oh! But what do you see?
What do you see?
And everybody on the street is singing like it's Sunday.
But we keep inside and our looks stay at bay.
Ah, ah,
And we don't know what's left,
But we feel it's coming back soon.
And so we're standing in the street staring at a blood-red moon.
We are the tide. (ah)
We are the tide, and none of us stay, (ah)
The day we're born till then we
Oh, I still remember "Regulate" with Warren G
Could that have been back in the sweet summer of 1993
It was a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
Oh, the sound of distant carnival drums
The Spanish guitar someone strums
It's a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
My heart goes like,
Bom-a-bom-a-bom-a-bom-bom-a-bom
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Bom-a-bom-a-bom-a-bom-bom-a-bom
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Bom-a-bom-a-bom-a-bom-bom-a-bom
Oh, the memories come a-streamin'
When I'm walking 'round day-dreaming
It's a sweet summer's night in Hammer Hill
Oh, the memories come a-streamin'
When I'm walking 'round day-dreaming
It's a sweet summer's night in Hammer Hill
My heart goes like,
Bom-a-bom-a-bom-a-bom-bom-a-bom
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Bom-a-bom-a-bom-a-bom-bom-a-bom
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Bom-a-bom-a-bom-a-bom-bom-a-bom
Oh no! Oh no!
Oh no! Oh no!
Oh no no no
Oh no! Oh no!
Oh no! Oh no!
Oh no no no no no
Oh no! Oh no!
Oh no! Oh no!
Oh no no no no no
Oh no no no no
It's coming back to me
Oh no no no
It's coming back to me
Oh no no no
It's coming back to me
It's a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
My heart goes like,
Bom-a-bom-a-bom-a-bom-bom-a-bom
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Bom-a-bom-a-bom-a-bom-bom-a-bom
Oh, can you hear the beat of my heart?
Bom-a-bom-a-bom-a-bom-bom-a-bom
"You and me are the world", she said
"Nothing else is real
The two of us is all there is
The rest is just a dream
Always meant to be, I can feel it
Like a destiny thing written in the stars
Inescapable fate, yeah, it's out of my hands
Falling into your arms"
"And I don't want to get innocent
But I would love you to take my time
We're on the edge of a beautiful thing", she said
"Come on, let's stay here for a while"
Oh, girl
He is the one for sure
Oh, girl
He is the perfect boy
"Yeah, me and you are a world", he said
"But not the only one I need
The two of us is never all there is
That doesn't happen for real
If it was meant to be us, it was meant to be now
Don't see the sense in wasting time
If you're so sure about this Laurel Kismet Hardy thing
You know tonight you're mine"
"And I don't want to get obvious
But I have to be gone by three
We're on the edge of a beautiful thing", he said
"So come on, jump with me"
Oh, girl
He's not the one for sure
Oh, girl
He's not so wonderful
Oh, girl
He's not the one for sure
Oh, girl
He's not the perfect boy at all
"You and me are the world", she says
"Nothing else is real
The two of us is all there is
The rest is just a dream"
And her heart may be broken a hundred times
But the hurt will never destroy her hope
The happy ever after girl
One day finds the perfect boy
I'm moving to Tokyo
'Cause I'm tired of San Francisco
My contracts are finally void
And I am getting out
On houses and building tops
I swallow the beams and sun drops
If my echos could reach your ears
Then I could save my calls
What happens when I'm above
The east river when you are in love?
We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind
Fill all of the Navy yards
With hard working security guards
'Cause the numbers are wearing off
My plastic access cards
How can I begin to say
I feel better off when we stayed
In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?
Content like a panda bear
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank
And sing when I inhale
Cross my heart, hope to die
I swear I won't say what happened that night
So starting today things are gonna be all right
Your best you tried, yeah you did fine
No, better than fine, perfect in my mind
In fact, I wish your heart was mine...
And I can hear the memory in my ears
Back to the years and all of those tears
But hear me when I say I'm glad we steered that way
'Cause now we're here.
Do you wanna get away? Get in the car we can leave today
Do you wanna celebrate our just made little holiday?
'Cause now today is your day
And all that stuff you used to take
I'm glad you threw all that away 'cause now you look so great
You never need to be afraid just know you went the right way
'Cause even though we never get things right
And it gets so old just saying we'll keep trying
But its mine to decide when I'll be all right
I know you're going crazy (crazy)
But happy is all that you make me (all you make me)
And now things are gonna get better baby
I know everything went wrong OK (OK)
But now its time to get some better days (some better days)
'Cause I don't want to keep acting this way
'Cause man I know we never get things right
And it gets so old just saying, "We'll keep trying"
But its mine to decide when and if I'll be all right...
And that's just a thing that takes time.
So keep going till you know when it's time, when it's right
Keep showing yourself in that light
'Cause back in school, man that gets cruel
But one thing is true is man now look at you
Your heart is big enough for two.
Because I can hear the memories in my ears
Back to the years and all those tears
But hear me when I say I'm glad because we're here.
I know you're going crazy (crazy)
But happy is all that you make me (you make me)
And now things are gonna get better, baby
I know everything went wrong OK (OK)
But now it's time to get some better days (better days)
'Cause I don't want to keep acting this way.
'Cause man, I know we never get things right
And it gets so old just saying we'll keep trying
But it's mine to decide when and if I'll be all right...
And that's just a thing that takes time.
All those things that go to make heaven and this
Where midnight was, were splashed across the canvas
Midnight, who was a girl
Midnight, who lost control and found this world
With matter removed of divine dimension
Our time reduced to an honorable mention
This world, which time forgot
This world, it lost control and then saw God
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth
Put your new weight in gold and see what it's worth
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
All of the things that go to make heaven and this
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Did you think of something He didn't think of?
Crashing into horizons, on the brink of success, hurrah
Success which was survival gone too far
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth
Put your new weight in gold and see what it's worth
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
All of the things that go to make heaven and this
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
All these rocky mountains
To play five songs and drink some more and fall asleep
Getting taped by locals
Don't have the nerve to ask for food and die of thirst
In the back seats of rented wrecks
Let's hope these wheels got what it takes to carry us home
Backdrops made of denim
T-shirt salesmen and the followers it brings
Single package systems
Soul DJs and you know the riot that that brings
I wanna turn all their dance floors
Into a burning inferno of ba baa
I play the piano and I play the guitar
I've played it in clubs and I've played it in bars
I visit your city and I've slept on your floors
I borrowed your swings and I've heard your hardcore
All the scores of the C to the A of the youth of today
And it's beautiful
Still I can't get enough of it
Did you see me eating Frosties from your fridge?
And the rice cookies you never ate
Were all gone when you went into the kitchen
I know I can't come near you 
Every time I do 
I get shaking inside and the sun in my eyes 
So I'll stay away
I'd rather be here 
Than anywhere with you
I've been dancing with your ghost 
Toasting note to note 
So here's to the passing of all that could be 
Between you and me 
I'd rather be here 
Than anywhere with you 
I know I cannot see you 
Even if I wanted to
Because your light is the light of ten sunsets 
Circled by eyes burned blue and open wide
I'd rather be here 
Than anywhere with you 
I'd rather be here 
Than anywhere with you
Hey!
What ya wanna do about this thing?
Be careful with that game you're tryin' to bring
I'm trying so hard just to ignore
But all of my thoughts just seem to form around you
And the subtleties you start to sling
Like, "I don't care about the songs you sing"
And now I can't take this any more
But I've never seen your type before
Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on
Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on
Baby!
I'm not like the other guys you see
You need to handle me so gently
I'm putting my heart out on the line
To see if the same thing's on your mind
Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on
Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on
(Heartbreaker)
Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on
Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on
You broke my heart, you broke my mind
GIrl, you done broke me down inside.
You broke my name, you broke my will
I can't believe I love you still.
Can't go back
Can't move on
Any other girl I'd be long gone
Don't know what to do
Can't get over you...
Heartbreaker!
And all the kids now
They come running
It's the weekend
It's the weekend
And all the parents
They keep calling
But there's no answer
'Cause it's the weekend
Working class to the bone
And I know you're tired of hearing it
It's the weekend
It's the weekend
This right here is the D.O Proletariat
It's the weekend
Come on the weekend
Hell yeah I just got paid
It's time to get this started
Wait till I stake my claim
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Tonight I might just loose my way
But I'll never get down hearted
Good friends keep enemies at bay
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
And all the kids now
They come running
It's the weekend
It's the weekend
And all the parents
They keep calling
But there's no answer
'Cause it's the weekend
Hell yeah I just got paid
It's time to get this started
Wait till I stake my claim
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Tonight I might just loose my way
But I'll never get down hearted
Good friends keep enemies at bay
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Rest when we're old
Should do as were told
But I just can't help it
I'll reach for the stove
The night closes in
Now for the second act
Tell our friends go ahead
'Cause we're hanging back
Youth like a spark
It lights up the dark
We unlock the mystery
I knew that you'd miss me
My mouth on your neck
Your touch on my check
Let hands guide the way
As we play hide and seek
Oh baby please stay true
What you gonna do when I come for you uh oh
Oh baby please stay true
What you gonna do
Yeah my arrows shoot for you
My arrows shoot so true
These arrows shoot for you
My arrow shoots so true
Hell yeah I just got paid
It's time to get this started
Wait till I stake my claim
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Tonight I might just loose my way
But I'll never get down hearted
Good friends keep enemies at bay
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Hell yeah I just got paid
It's time to get this started
Wait till I stake my claim
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Tonight I might just loose my way
But I'll never get down hearted
Good friends keep enemies at bay
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Careful when you open, it's easy to be broken
In the strangest fashion you start a chain reaction
When you look my way, something's pounding away
And I wonder if I ever felt this before
And all this time oblivious to what you make so obvious
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
You are reaching something that is beating
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
Over and again, racing out of my skin
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
At least it was never until I noticed
You and your ways capture what I've misplaced
In the perfect fashion; just watch my heart's reaction
This point of view is nothing that I'm used to
But I won't close my eyes, 'cause they're onto you
And all this time it was staring me blind
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
You are reaching something that is beating
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
Over and again, racing out of my skin
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
At least it was never until I noticed you
Whoa, oh-oh
The only time I ever noticed my heart
Is when I noticed you, yeah
The only time I ever noticed my heart
Is when I noticed you, yeah
You, yeah, you yeah!
One, two, three!
You are reaching something that is beating
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
Over and again, racing out of my skin
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
'Til I noticed you, yeah, I noticed you, yeah
When I noticed you yeah, you, yeah
When I noticed you yeah, you, yeah
I noticed you yeah, you, yeah
That's the only time I ever noticed my heart before
Jesus wrote a blank check
One I haven't cashed quite yet
I hope I got a little more time
I hope it's not the end of the line
Yeah, Jesus wrote a blank check
Ah, one I haven't cashed yet, all right
Well, if I had to choose a number
I'd want it to be number one
I don't want to be number two
Yeah, I don't want to be number four
Yeah, but I can hear a knock on the door
Jesus wrote a blank check, all right
If Jesus saw me dying
Would angels come a-flying down?
I hope I got a little more time
I hope somebody lends me a dime
Now, Jesus wrote a blank check
Ah, one I haven't cashed yet, uh-huh
Still I build my towers high
I watch them pierce the blue, blue sky
Still I wallow in the mire
Still I burn this earthen fire
Still I build my towers high
I watch them pierce the blue, blue sky
Still I wallow in the mire
Still I burn this earthen fire
Still I burn this earthen fire
Still I burn this earthen fire
Still I burn this earthen fire 
Ah, still I burn this earthen fire
Still I burn this earthen fire
Still I burn this earthen fire
Still I burn this earthen fire
You'll rescue me, right?
In the exact same way they never did.
I'll be happy, right?
When your healing powers kick in
You'll complete me, right? 
Then my life can finally begin
I'll be worthy, right? 
Only when you realize the gem I am
But this won't work now the way it once did
And I won't keep it up even though I would love to
Once I know who I'm not then I'll know who I am
But I know I won't keep on playing the victim
These precious illusions in my head
Did not let me down when I was defenseless
And parting with them is like
Parting with invisible best friends
This ring will help me yet
As will you knight in shining armor
This pill will help me yet
As will these boys gone through like water
But this won't work as well as the way it once did
'Cause I want to decide between survival and bliss
And though I know who I'm not I still don't know who I am
But I know I won't keep on playing the victim
These precious illusions in my head
Did not let me down when I was a kid
And parting with them is like
Parting with a childhood best friend
I've spent so long
Firmly looking outside me
I've spent so much time
Living in survival mode
But this won't work now the way it once did
'Cause I want to decide between survival and bliss
And though I know who I'm not I still don't know who I am
But I know I won't keep on playing the victim
These precious illusions in my head
Did not let me down when I was defenseless
And parting with them is like
Parting with invisible best friends
These precious illusions in my head
Did not let me down when I was a kid
And parting with them is like
Parting with a childhood best friend
This a number one champion sound

He said, "Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya"
I just met this 5-foot-7 guy who's just my type
I like the way he's speaking, his confidence is peaking
Don't like his baggy jeans, but I'ma like what's underneath them

La la-la, la-la dee-ah
La la-la, la-la dee-ah
La la-la, la-la dee-ah
If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
You've dreamed a thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
Two points for honesty
It must make you sad to know that nobody cares at all
I want to be where I've never been before
I want to be there and then I'd understand
Know I'm right and do it right, could I get to be like that
I don't know what I don't know with nothin' more to gain
Will I get better or stay the same
I find I always move too slowly
Can't lift a finger, can't change my mind
I never knew till someone told me that...
If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
You've dreamed a thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
Two points for honesty
It must make you sad to know that nobody cares at all
And all the people who've seen it all before
And all the people who really understand
Know they're right, and have done it right, could I get to be like that
I don't know what I don't know, it's harder everyday
Can't lift a finger, can't hurt a fly
I've found I always move too slowly
One thing's for certain, I'm insecure
I never knew till someone told me that...
If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
You've dreamed of thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
Two points for honesty
It must make you sad to know that, nobody cares at all
Nobody cares at all
They never care at all...
Stop.
Aw, look at him. So delectable. So chewable.
Be still!
Call me animal!
Call me animal!
Smile
Like you've got nothing to prove
No matter what you might do
There's always someone out there cooler than you
I know that's hard to believe
But there are people you meet
They're into something that is too big to be
Expressed
Through their clothes
And they'll put up with all the poses you'll throw
And you won't
Even know
That they're not sizing you up
They know your mom fucked you up
Or maybe let you watch too much TV
But they'll still look in your eyes
To find the human inside
You know there's always something in there to see
Beneath
The veneer
Not everybody made the list this year
Have a beer
Make me feel tiny if it makes you feel tall
But there's always someone cooler than you
Yeah, you're the shit but you won't be here for long
Oh, there's always someone cooler than you
Yeah, there's always someone cooler than you
Now that I've got the disease
In a way I'm relieved
'Cause I don't have to stress about it like you do
I might just get up and dance
Or buy some acid-wash pants
When you don't care then you got nothing to lose
And I won't
Hesitate
'Cause every moment life is slipping away
It's ok
Make me feel tiny if it makes you feel tall
But there's always someone cooler than you
Yeah, you're the shit but you won't be it for long
Oh, there's always someone cooler than you
Yeah, there's always someone cooler than you
Oh, there's always someone cooler than...
Life is wonderful
Life is beautiful
We're all children of
One big universe
So you don't have to be a chump
And you know (you know)
That I won't (I won't)
Hesitate (hesitate)
'Cause every moment life is slipping away (away)
It's ok (it's ok)
Make me feel tiny if it makes you feel tall
Oh, 'cause there's always someone cooler than you
Yeah, you're the shit but you won't be it for long
But there's always someone cooler than you
Oh yeah, there's always someone cooler than you
Because there's always someone cooler than you
Cooler than you (boy)
Cooler than you (girl)
Cooler than you (sir)
Cooler than you (my lady)
Oh
Nerds go wild
Yeah Yeah
I got it in the mail one morning 
There was no return address 
Just my name in gold leaf on the front
There was no time or location 
There was really no info at all 
No date, no place, no time, no RSVP
But it said
You are invited by anyone to do anything 
You are invited for all time
I didn't think much about it 
It seemed like a really dumb joke 
But later that week it was Friday once again
So I took it down to a disco 
That wouldn't have me in a million years 
I flashed it once and I was inside with a drink 
I really didn't stay too long there 
'Cause no one was having much fun 
I made my way to a party all the way 'cross town 
It was thrown by the friend of an ex-thing 
I wasn't sure if I should go 
But when I got up in the place there were smiles all up and down 
I grabbed my ex in the kitchen 
I told her I was sorry I came 
But she looked at me with a glazed smile and said
You are invited by anyone to do anything 
You are invited for all time
You are so needed by everyone to do everything 
You are invited for all time
I headed for home kinda early 
The party wasn't all that great 
I saw my neighbor out crying on his front porch
I stopped to see what his deal was 
I didn't catch much through the sobs 
Something about a party and he didn't go 
I thought about it for a second 
With the invite in my hands
I threw it down at his feet and I said
You are invited by anyone to do anything 
You are invited for all time
You are so needed if you really want to go 
You are invited for all time 
For all time
For all time
And I'm up, down, I'm spinning around
High and dry and kicked to the ground
I'm lost and I'll never be found
My lips were much too shy
The lines about you, they never rhymed
You said I never get things right
(I never said I was the best thing for you)
But baby, where'd you go?
I need you here tonight
Singing myself to sleep
You're still my favorite melody
It's been three weeks
How long can this go on?
Singing myself to sleep
You're haunting every memory
Get out, goodbye
Get out of my life
Goodnight
And you're hot, cold, you're battering my bones
You run wild, I lose control
I miss you, forever you'll stay gold
And you know I'm not getting by
I've lost it, you've ripped my mind
And every day's the darkest of my life
(I never said I was the best thing for you)
But baby, where'd you go?
I need you here tonight
Singing myself to sleep
You're still my favorite melody
It's been three weeks
How long can this go on?
Singing myself to sleep
You're haunting every memory
Get out, goodbye
Get out of my life
'Cause I'm drowning (When I close my eyes)
And I'm falling (I can't breathe tonight)
End of story, I fade to black inside (I never said I was the best thing for you)
'Cause I'm drowning (When I close my eyes)
And I'm falling (I can't breathe tonight)
End of story, I fade to black inside
Singing myself to sleep
You're still my favorite melody
It's been three weeks
How long can this go on?
Singing myself to sleep
You're haunting every memory
Get out, goodbye
Get out of my life
'Cause I'm drowning when I close my eyes
And I'm falling, I can't breathe tonight
End of story, I fade to black inside
Don't you go,
Away, I know,
Without your love,
I'll never find my way back home
'Cause you and me,
So happily, 
Make all our dreams of make believe reality
La la la La la la La la la la la
Troubles, never find us there
Oh, bubbles, float through the air,
Float through the air
Float through the air air air air
La la la La la la La la la la la
So don't you go,
Away, I know,
Without your love,
I'll never find my way back home,
I'll never find my way back home,
No, no,
I'll never find my way back home,
No, no,
I'll never find my way back home.

You are the morning
I am the night
I was the only one left at the right time
And only I still call you mine
Only I'm still hanging on
Blown by strong wind, but it/here we fear (?)
All that you said to me is still so very clear
So take my hand
The players in the band
They can always find
Always find some number that we know
You'll miss me when I'm gone
But the happy music will carry on
You are the morning
I am the night
I was the only one left at the right time
And only I still call you mine
Only I'm still hanging on
Did the ironing in a cowboy hat
Felt as fresh as the paint in this new flat
I will never tell you what to do
Have ambition simply to see things through
Did you know I could be a lot of fun
I'm aware that friendship can die young
As the glow from the street light bled
Down the Langlands Road we set off the best of friends
I know where I stand (I know just where I stand)
I don't need you to hold my hand
Well, I've tried to get along with you
I have asked myself what are we gonna do?
I'm coming round to take a stand
Going to put us together with glue or an elastic band
I know where I stand (I know just where I stand)
I don't need you to hold my hand
I am softer than my face would suggest
At times like these I'm at my lowest ebb
And now I can confide in you
If I cry to set the mood oh please could you cry too
Happy New Year, you are my only vice
What if we compromised? I am open
Happy New Year, you are my only vice
(Do you have to wear a frown like that?
You could have hit me with a baseball bat)
What if we compromised? I am open
(Do you have to wear a frown like that?
You could have hit me with a baseball bat)
Do you want to? (Yes I do) Do you have to? (So do you)
Do you want to? (So do you) Do you have to?
I bought you a fur coat
When you were 15
You wore it to the disco
When everyone was in jeans
But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your low-cut dresses threw stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?
You left for London
When you were 19
Had to pawn all your nice clothes
Just living on dreams
A man in a bright light
Took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom
For a taste unknown
But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?
Hey little rich girl
You've been away for so long (oh)
And now little rich girl
I wrote you in this song (woo woh)
Hey little rich girl
Baby love has gone
And now little rich girl
I know where you belong
At your dad's office party
All the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache
'Cause the 'screen-star' was you
You left for London
When you were 19
Had to pull off your nice clothes
Just living on dreams
But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?
All the energetic people they all sparkle as they're walking down the street
Can't see their faces but I've noticed that they seem to have big hands
The stage is set, is there glamour, who's got my Etnies?
Now you know that I can see you and you know that it is easy
To see me something has been on my mind, something has struck me
Kind of odd, look out for quicksand, there is high ground
Who wants this rockscene?
We sing
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
Now the time has come and yeah the show it must stay strong
And are we all part of the latest craze or is this how we mend our ways
And I can hear the taxi calling, telling me we haven't left yet.
As the lights go on with emptiness and how you seem to stand out
In a crowd you raise the tempo in the disco as you make this place your own
The stage is set, is there glamour, I'm in this rockscene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
House on the rock
Surely it will last forever?
House on the rock
Don't you know it's now or never?
House on the rock
Surely it will last forever?
House on the rock
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
When when when when whenever, rock scene! (repeat)
I feel like Superman
They gonna remember me
I think I know I can
Who says it's hard to reach?
Who's gonna stop me on the road to success?
I don't know
They tried to break me down
But I'm still on my feet
This city's full of life
So why is it hard to breathe?
Oh why did God create this world so unfair?
I don't know
Sometimes I feel like I can't run, I can't crawl
And sometimes I feel like I ain't nothing at all
Life is a journey where you stumble and fall
But I'm okay
When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
I feel like moving back
Sometimes it's hard to dream
The life I chose is past
It's moving without me
Who doesn't want a machine so they can go back in time?
I don't know
My time went by too fast
There's no one left but me
I've got a nine to five
And it gets the best of me
This is the life I'm gonna live to the end
But I'm okay
When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
Sometimes I feel like I can't run, I can't crawl
And sometimes I feel like I ain't nothing at all
Life is a journey where you stumble and fall
But I'm okay
When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your arms
Too many noises
Too many voices
Invisible wires keeping us apart
So many choices
But they're all disappointments
And they only steal me away from you
Climb into our private bubble
Let's get into all kinds of trouble
Slide over here let your hands feel the way
There's no better method to communicate
Girl stop your talking
Words just get in the way
I'll be your man
So baby come over
From the end of the sofa
I'll be your man
I'll be your man
So many faces
Staring at their shoelaces
When all anyone want is to be seen
So tonight let's be honest
We all want to be wanted
And darlin' you've got me wantin' you
Everything that I'm trying to say
Just sounds like a worn out cliche
Slide over here let your hands feel the way
There's no better method to communicate
Girl stop your talking
Words just get in the way
I'll be your man
So baby come over
From the end of the sofa
I'll be your man
I'll be your man
What are we all looking for?
Someone we just can't ignore
It's real love dripping from my heart
You've got me tripping
What are we all looking for?
Ooh...
Slide over here let your hands feel the way
There's no better method to communicate
Girl stop your talking
Words just get in the way
I'll be your man
Slide over here let your hands feel the way
There's no better method to communicate
Girl stop your talking
Words just get in the way
I'll be your man
So baby come over
From the end of the sofa
I'll be your man
I'll be your man
I'll be your man
I'll be your man
I'll be your man
We are what we're supposed to be
Illusions of your fantasy
All dots and lines that speak and say
What we do is what you wish to do
We are the color symphony
We do the things you wanna see
Frame by frame, to the extreme
Our friends are so unreasonable
They do the unpredictable
All dots and lines that speak and say
What we do is what you wish to do
It's all an orchestra of strings
Doin' unbelievable things
Frame by frame, to the extreme
One by one, we're makin' it fun
We are the Cartoon Heroes - oh-oh-oh
We are the ones who're gonna last forever
We came out of a crazy mind - oh-oh-oh
And walked out on a piece of paper
Here comes Spiderman, arachnophobian
Welcome to the toon town party
Here comes Superman, from never-neverland
Welcome to the toon town party
We learned to run at speed of light
And to fall down from any height
It's true, but just remember that
What we do is what you just can't do
An opera of craziness
A bunch of dots that's chasing us
Frame by frame, to the extreme
One by one, we're makin' it fun
We are the Cartoon Heroes - oh-oh-oh
We are the ones who're gonna last forever
We came out of a crazy mind - oh-oh-oh
And walked out onto a piece of paper
Here comes Spiderman, arachnophobian
Welcome to the toon town party
Here comes Superman, from never-neverland
Welcome to the toon town party
You think we're so mysterious
Don't take us all too serious
Be original, and remember that
What we do is what you just can't do
What we do is what you just can't do
What we do is what you just can't do
What we do is what you just can't do
What we do is what you just can't do
We are the Cartoon Heroes - oh-oh-oh
We are the ones who're gonna last forever
We came out of a crazy mind - oh-oh-oh
And walked out onto a piece of paper
There's still more to come
And everyone will be
Welcomed at the
Toon - Toon
Town - Town
Party
This is a story and you are not in it, uh huh
Flock of pages torn out
Here is a bedroom that you've never been in and
Here is your shovel, there's the ground
Look, two lovers covered in covers, uh huh
I can put us to bed tonight
I am bruised but she is dressing my wounds
Night nursing a broken man
She was not the cure for cancer
And all my questions still ask for answers
But there is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you
After waking up post-operation
I found I??ve come in a dream again
All the pain, almost as painful as ever but
Something in me was not the same
At night during dreams of submission
I could claw back my heart and soul
As the size of the tumor diminishes
Slowly fill that black hole
She was not the cure for cancer
And all my questions still ask for answers
But there is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you
She was not the cure for cancer
And all my questions still ask for answers
But there is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you
There is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you
There is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you, whoa
I am stuck in L.A.
Through the week and can't get away
And you're alone on the pier
In West Palm Beach on your holiday.
Stormy nights re-awake
The stomachache that I've acquired
From feeling down; things look grim
And I'm so sick of being tired.
Apartment lights go dark
And it's depressing, but what can I do?
The midnight streets feel dead
When I am so used to driving with you.
Brighter lights fill the night
And bluer skies reflect in your eyes
As I inspect and analyze
All of these dreams I don't recognize.
If you're still up when the ships
In the port prepare to set sail,
Comb the beach and put those blue 
Flowers up in your ponytail
Inside my head, your voice
Is still resounding, but what can I do?
The empty rooms feel cold 
When I am so used to being with you.
Count the stars, watch the waves
Absorb the summer sun and think of me
When you explore hidden coves
And tiny island chains throughout the sea.
Can you still hear my voice
When I'm outside from over the phone?
For what it's worth, darling dear,
I wish you were here, 'cause I feel alone.
When you were home, we'd sing,
But since you've left, I don't hear anything.
And though I feel so sad,
I can't believe things are really that bad.
Old captains and brand new cruise ships
Sailing over the briny sea.
When I crash my beloved desk job
And swim through the debris,
I'll cut loose and leave this madhouse,
Bound for the Atlantic blue.
I'll stroll down your tree-lined driveway
And sail the ocean with you.
Are you out of love with me?
Are you longing to be free?
Do I drive you up a tree?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
Do I drive you up the wall?
Do you dread every phone call?
Can you not stand me at all?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
Though I need you more than air
Is it true you just don't care?
Are you having an affair?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
When we met I thought money was everything
So I let you buy the house, the car, the ring
But I can't take your perpetual whining 
And you can't sing
I though if we live apart
We could made a brand-new start
Do you want to break my heart?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
I've enjoyed making you miserable for years
Found peace of mind in playing on your fears
How I loved to catch your gold and silver tears
But now, my dear
What a dark and dreary life
Are you reaching for a knife?
Could you really kill your wife?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
Oh, I die, I die, I die!
So it's over, you and I
Was my whole life just a lie?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always
Made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look
Oh baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart?
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
Tryin' to live without your love
Is one long, sleepless night
Let me show you, girl,
That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around
(Go)
(Yeea, yeah)
(One, two)
All these games you play you're messin' with my head
(You're messin' with my head)
And I don't know why I stay, I should leave instead
(Should leave instead)
When I speak from my heart you laugh like it's a game
(Well this ain't no game)
Yeah we make great friends but it just isn't the same
And I know this is not the way it should be
And I know you treat him like me
(Bedu, bedu, bedu, bedu)
But I don't
I wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
No I don't need you to buy me pretty things
(You don't pay for me)
Pay for my tattoos or buy me diamond rings
(We don't want those things)
But all I know is that I'm happy to see you smile
(Wanna see you smile)
And it make my day if you would just stay for awhile
(Won't you stay with me?)
And I know this is not the way it should be
And I know you treat him like me
(Bedu, bedu, bedu, bedu)
But I don't
I wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
Don't wanna stop
This gone on for way too long
And I'm tired of movin' on
This gone on for way too long.
This gone on for way too long
And I'm tired of movin' on.
This gone on for way too long
And I know this is not the way it should be
And I know you treat him like me
(Bedu, bedu, bedu, bedu)
But I don't
Wanna stop
Said "I love you", said "I like you
And I want you to see when the sun goes up"
So I wrote you and I told you
"I want you to see when the sun goes up"
But the streets are still white, been this way for so long, yes I know
But pretty soon it will happen, the sun will go murder the snow
So now I tell you
"Before it happens, I want you to know that I'm here for you
So take my advice, before it happen
I'm the one that you want and you want me now"
So cut the crap, stop that shit, don't be dumb, I will love you forever
I'm the stalker, the funeral face that will follow wherever and ever you go
I'm the one that you want and you want me now
But the sheets are still dull, been this way for so long, yes I know
But pretty soon it will happen the sun will go murder the snow
Now I tell you before it happens
"I'm the one that you want and you want me now"
Do you want it to be outside in the cool night
Where the stars gravitate toward you?
Do you want it to be outside in the cool night
Where the fog wraps itself around you?
Do you want it to be outside in the sunshine
Where the clouds take their places for you?
And the wind and snow and the rain that blows
None of those would matter much without you
And as long as it's talking with you
Talk of the weather will do
Do you want it to be outside in the cool night
Where the stars gravitate toward you?
Do you want it to be outside in the sunshine
Where the song repeats itself inside you?
And the wind and snow and the rain that blows
None of those would matter much without you
Nobody's hoping for better days
No one knows what to do
You're okay in your secret place
No one bothering you
It might save time if I meet you there
But I don't care, I'd rather wait for you
When no one's home and the weather's fine
I'd rather wait for you
Where no one's home and the weather's fine
I'd rather wait for you
You're so delicious
You're so soft
Sweet on the tip of my tongue
You taste like sunlight
And strawberry bubble gum
You bite my lip
You spike my blood
You make my heart beat faster
Own me, you own
You rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Till I can't control myself
Make me a liar
One big disaster
You make my heart beat faster
It's the way you swell, slow
Pushing right out your seams
It's the way you smile, baby
When you've got me on my knees
Your all night noise
Your siren's howl
You make my heart beat faster
Own me, you own
You rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Till I can't control myself
Make me a liar
One big disaster
You make my heart beat faster
'Cause I jump back, crash, I crawl
I beg and steal, I follow you
Yeah, you own me
And you make my heart beat faster
(I can't get enough
Because it's on like
I guess this world is over to me)
You own me, you own
You rattle my bones
You turn me over and over
Till I can't control myself
Make me a liar
One big disaster
You make my heart beat faster
"Won't you miss me?"
You said inside grand central station
And your eyes grew red and wild before the chasin'
I felt your body move through my coat
I felt you footstep silent but heavy, you followed me onto the shuttle
Tapped my shoulder one last time
That was all
Hmm
I miss winter just because I miss when I knew you best
I miss the typewriter in the basement
I miss making your room a mess
I miss not being misused
I miss it all, so I guess I lose
Sea green, see blue
Hmm
September 2nd to April 13th, but who's counting?
Song after song after song after song amounting into mountains
He told me you beat her up
Behold the "Super Keith" on the cup
What's up, enough's enough, where's my morning coffee?
I regret every single thing I ever said, I said those things too softly
Hmm
There was you, there was me
In the room with the alcoholic guest
You asked if we should sleep on these cardboard sheets
I said: "Yes, okay, let's,"
The sculptor we hardly knew
His limbs were lying askew
Sea green, see blue
Hmm
You tossed your phone fifty feet in the air, I can't believe you caught it
You said whatever you wanted to as long as you thought it should be true
You dream, you make movies, you dance
You moved to Montreal to be closer to France
How's that working out? How's the music, how's the food?
I know you won't stay there forever
I know you're gonna move again, and again and again...
Hmm
This is crazy, but I know I left you to be with your art
You always put me first, and somehow that broke my heart
'Cause it's not my place to choose
My first love, and my only muse
Sea green, see blue
Hmm
Today I watched the boats
Moving through the harbor
Walking on water
In your arms I'd stay
Forever if I could
Forever if I may
Keep me in your thoughts, don't disappear
I am on your side
And so alive
So alive it isn't real
If this is how I feel
Then nothing now is true
And nothing now can ever be taken away from you
Sinking in the past
The things that shouldn't last
Just put to bed and stand beside me
Stand beside me
Always on your side
I'm on your side
And so alive it isn't real
I am on your side
And so alive
And so alive
And so alive
I am on your side
I am on your side
I am on your side
And so alive
So alive
I am on your side
I'm on your side
I'm on your side
On your side
Gonna wash the dust off my soul
Gonna listen to some rock 'n' roll
No cares, come what may
I'm making a beautiful day
Gonna drive my car to the sea
Swim out far 'cause I believe
That waves will wash the grey away
I'm making a beautiful day
Let me hear you say
Ooh, oh oh, my my
I'm learning to fly
Hey, hey, what's that you said
Let's not forget we're alive
Gonna climb that hill behind my house
See what this place is all about
Cause from above it all, you can't help but say
It's gonna be a beautiful day
It's gonna be a beautiful day
But let me hear you say
Ooh, oh oh, my my
I'm learning to fly
Hey, hey, what's that you said
Let's not forget we're alive
Gonna turn my enemies into friends
What's broken gets stronger when it mends
When we all come together, this song will play
We'll sing, it's a beautiful day
It's gonna be my beautiful day
Oh oh, my my
I'm learning to fly
Hey, hey, what's that you said
Let's not forget we're alive
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high
If I had a day that I could give you
I'd give to you a day just like today
If I had a song that I could sing for you
I'd sing a song to make you feel this way
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high
If I had a tale that I could tell you
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
If I had a wish that I could wish for you
I'd make a wish for sunshine for all the while
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost all the time makes me high
Sunshine almost always
See, here's the thing
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're actin' like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me?
Hmm, that sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
I'm quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's all right
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your mom and 'em
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to "Did He Really Just Say That Shit?"
Yep
I'll take a mile if you let me
6-5, 200 plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's all right
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Good god girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidote's under my tongue
Whoa
We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
It's all right
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's all right
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Damn
Over hill
Over dales
I run with you
If it works
If it fails
I run with you
Since fifteen
I have ran
Everywhere
You can run
But together is much better
So let's run let's run let's run
Empty hands
Tired feet
I run with you
On the sand
Over concrete
I run with you
Since fifteen
I have ran
Everywhere you can run
But with you
It's much more fun
So let's run let's run let's run
It doesn't matter that they say we'll never make it
It's so strong that nothing can ever break it
You and I can tackle anything of any size
All anyone can ever want is a co-pilot
Someone to leave this town and
Up and start a secret
And when you sneak out at night
I'll kiss you right between your eyes
Over hills, over dams
I run with you
Down the mountain
Through the trails
I run with you
Since I was fifteen
I have ran
Everywhere you can run
I'm not done with my traveling
So let's run let's run let's run
I'm not done with my traveling
So let's run let's run let's run
I'm not done with my traveling
So let's run let's run let's run

You can gamble everything for love if you're free
You gotta gamble everything for love
Baby, are ya cold, are ya cold, baby?
I could wrap you up, wrap you up in my love

In the places that you never knew to get through?
Tell me, are you gonna cry all night?
Tell me the truth, and I'll tell you the truth
If you gamble everything for love
You're gonna be all right, all right
Make a list of things you need, leave it empty
Except for number one, write "love," gamble everything 
Keep it under lock and key
If you wanna, you can gamble everything for love
Love me with an open heart, tell me anything
We can find a place to start to gamble everything
We can set this thing apart, 'cause we're gonna
Gonna gamble everything for love
Tell me, do you lose your way each day?
Are there people you don't recognize, do they lie?
Tell me, does it make you feel too real?
Tell me the truth, and I'll tell you the truth
If you gamble everything for love
You're gonna be all right, all right
Ooh, you can go your own way
Ooh, you can go your own way

You're gonna be all right, all right
All right
The first day with the jar you find
Everyone lies
The first day with the jar you find
Everyone lies
Nobody minds, everyone lies
Where is the man you respect?
And where is the woman you love?
Where's the woman you love?
The third week with the jar you find
Everything dies
We won't vote conservative
Because we never have
Everyone lies, everyone lies
Where is the man you respect?
And where is the woman you love?
Where's the woman you love?
I used to dream and I used to vow
I wouldn't dream of it now
We look to Los Angeles
For the language we use
London is dead, London is dead 
London is dead, London is dead
London is dead, London is dead
I'm too much in love
I'm too much in love
Confide in me
Sustain on my apathy
You're such a mess
You can learn not to confess
You will not find it in me
Simply because I can't
Wake up and find it in me
I'm in a coma
You will not find it in me
You'll reveal all your pains again
We'll fall asleep
So deeply out of reach
For years feeling dead
We can fall right out of bed
You will not find it in me
Simply because I can't
Wake and find it in me
I'm in a coma
You will not find it in me
You'll reveal all your pains again
Hey such a mess but I don't care
Simply because I can't
Wake and find it in me
I'm in a coma
You will not find it in me 
You'll reveal all your pains again
Instrumental
Yeah
In the womb of winter, summer seems a myth
In my desperation I throw my faith into the wind
Born to a world where it is a fight just to fit in
From the cradle to the grave, it never ends
Someday, someday in a cloud of gray
I will, I'll make my great escape
So many ways to walk upon the earth
I trace my footsteps to the place of my birth
So what do you do with all your precious time
So many ways in which to reach for the sky
Someday, someday in a cloud of gray
I will, I'll make my great escape
Someday, someday in a cloud of gray
I will, I'll make my great escape
Say, little bit by little bit, someday
I may be weary but I am not weak
I can sing a song of suffering
Maybe a song unsung is dancing on the tip of your tongue
My salvation's ahead of me
I can feel it calling me
I know that I, I know that I will be ready
Someday, someday in a cloud of gray
I will, I'll make my great escape
Someday, someday in a cloud of gray
I will, I'll make my great escape
Tie my shoes and zip my jacket
I lock the door and check my pockets
I'm leaving the light on just for the sight
Might make someone think that I'm still around
Sold my bed, no need to sleep these nights
Walking rounds in search for stars these nights
The sky is perfectly brown instead of black
Let my shoes lead me forward, please bring me some luck
It's ok, hey come on, no time for education so let's go
I can't stand all these rules,
I'm gonna turn my back to everything I know
It's ok, come on, I won't do the things they learned me
I pick up stones 'cause I might need them
You're gonna throw'em, aren't you
I tried with books but I'm not pleased yet
Come on and read it for me, read it for me
Sold my bed, no need to sleep these nights,
I'm walking rounds in search for, doesn't matter
It's ok, hey come on, no time for education so let's go
I can't stand all these rules,
I'm gonna turn my back to everything I know
It's ok, come on, I won't do the things they learned me...
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I needed the shelter of someone's arms, there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs,
There you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I just want to stop (stop) just to thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) just to thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I just want to stop (stop) just to thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) just to thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop (stop) so I could thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) to thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is...
And it feels just about right
Oh...
Just to be loved
Just to be loved by you, baby, yeah
Could it be I'm alive after all that?
Picking pennies off the floor with my cold, cold hands.
Look at me no hands, ain't it cool yeah?
Look at her falling out of a taxi cab.
If you really want some understanding,
You will learn it can be quite frustrating.
If you really want to understand it,
You will learn it can be quite demanding.
You and me trying hard to remember,
How we ever started out with our sights so high.
Looking down, seeing your yellow fingers,
And if you don't understand then at least that's why.
If you really want some understanding,
You will learn it can be quite frustrating.
If you really want to understand it,
You will learn it can be quite demanding.
Could it be I'm alive after all that?
Picking pennies off the floor with my cold hands.
Look at me no hands, ain't it cool yeah?
Look at her falling out of a taxi cab.
If you really want some understanding,
You will learn it can be quite frustrating.
If you really want to understand it,
You should talk to Mr Understanding
Honey
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
All that you do
Don't you think of me too
Lady
Where you've been for so long?
I don't mean you no harm
Had to write you this song
Well I long to be alone with you
And if I couldn't have you, I don't know
What I would do
I guess I would leave (I would leave)
This world alone (this world alone)
'Cause without you I'm just bones (bones)
Well, I dream
Of you so much
Love you so much
Thoughts of love
Well I speak
Only of you
So what else is new?
What am I to do?
Well I long to be alone with you
And if I could have a door knock
What I would do?
I guess I would leave (I would leave)
This world alone (this world alone)
'Cause without you I'm just bones (bones)
Days go more and more I see
That your love is all my soul needs
That you're gone and now I'm fallin'
Fallin' to my knees
Well I long to be alone with you
And if I could have a door knock
What I would do?
Well I long to be alone with you
And if I could have a door knock
What I would do?
I guess I would leave (I would leave)
This world alone (this world alone)
'Cause without you I'm just bones (bones)
I guess I would leave (I would leave)
This world alone (this world alone)
'Cause without you I'm just bones (bones)
I guess I would leave (I would leave)
This world alone (this world alone)
'Cause without you I'm just bones
Oh, my God
It's green, the fire
Go!
It's that time to transform,
To come around
I'm changing
There's an angel knocking on my window
Trying to tell me where to go next
This small town, without you,
It feels cold, it's creeping
I'm moving on, I'll look ahead instead
Spirit divide
Drift along
I waved her goodbye
I carried on
Trams pass
My black dress
Folded on a big mess
I'm changing my next flight to Paris
The hourglass it tic-toc too fast for our destiny
I got a full drawer of letters
Remember it was Paris you said we were gonna meet?
Why your answer machine's still on?
It's the oddest feeling since you're gone
A part of me drift away with you and will never return!
Spirit divide
Drift along
I waved her goodbye
I carried on
Trams pass
My black dress
Folded on a big mess
I'm changing my next flight to Paris
Spirit divide
I waved her goodbye
Trams pass
My black dress
Folded on a big mess
I'm changing my next flight to Paris
La Suede est ou je vis
Mais c'est a Paris que je me sens en vie
Je sens que je pourrais m'y poser
Des vacances
Et ne jamais rentrer
Omaha, Omaha 
Where you been? 
When we meet we can talk awhile 
I can sleep in your dreams 
The night alone I've been waiting 
Omaha, Omaha 
The saddled streets, the burro beats down my door 
When you say it's no love affair 
I will know and when we go 
I'll be the only thing who cares 
I've been waiting awhile 
I've been waiting awhile 
I've been waiting awhile 
I've been waiting awhile 
Here I come, Omaha 
Hiding out 
I got hot head, hot eyes, hot ticks, hot mouth 
Each howl, I get bigger 
I can't stay, I can for the night, for the night 
For the weekend and the night 
I've been aiding my fall 
Aiding my fall, aiding my fall 
I'll be long gone 
You shouldn't wake me awhile 
You shouldn't wake me awhile 
You shouldn't wake me awhile 
You shouldn't wake me awhile
Windmills cut through
The void dividing the imagined and true
The eyes neglect to see what the heart pursues
But my heart finds a dream in these unseen hues
In the untouchable
That's not to say
That I don't feel the limitations and the
Drop from the expectation
It's not naive
But the heart of creation
It's the only
Thing proven true to me
When the fire's burnin' from sky to ground
Swing my weight around
Begin the windstorm
When the fire's burnin' from sky to ground
Swing my weight around
Begin the windstorm
Time past has thrown
Shadows over my shoulder that as ghosts owned
Movement of my desires lost like a stone
Cast as a wish into a well with no sound
No answer at the end
How can I say
It's wrong to feel the limitations and the
Drop from the expectation. it's not naive
But the heart of creation. it's the only
Thing proven true to me
When the fire's burnin' from sky to ground
Swing my weight around
Begin the windstorm
When the fire's burnin' from sky to ground
Swing my weight around
Begin the windstorm
Fur soft as fur.
Taking the rough with the smooth.
I know it hurts
Me more than it ever would you.
Fur soft as fur.
Fresh strawberries and cream.
Sometimes at work
I feel like a machine.
Dreams don't always come true
The way you want them to.
I suppose this'll have to do
For the time being.
Fishes and worms
Frozen under the ice.
Sometimes it hurts
So much it feels nice.
I'm afraid of growing old
And being on my own,
So I'm putting my country shoulder
To the wheel.
I'm afraid of letting go
Of everything I know.
So I just sadly float
Away down stream,
Smiling at the leaves,
Chewing butter beans,
And wondering what dreams
Are made of fur.
Fur, fur soft as fur.
Fur so soft it hurts.
Fur too soft for words.
Fur soft as fur.
I bruise like a peach
I mumble when I speak
I'm in the gutter
Lookin' at the stars
I've always been in love with you
I look tough enough
But if you hold me up to the light
You can see my broken heart
I've always been in love with you
They're just paper cuts
I'll sellotape them up
And bandage them with cotton wool and glue
Paper cuts
I shouldn't beat myself up
Over little things the way I do
Nothing stays the same
I wish I could remain the color
Of the cherry blossom tree
I've always been in love with you
I always used to leave before I went to sleep
But now I just pass out watching TV
I've always been in love with you
They're just paper cuts
I'll sellotape them up
And bandage them
With cotton wool and glue
They're just paper cuts
I shouldn't beat myself up
Over little things the way I do
Just be careful when you shine
Because if you throw a light
On something magical
It disappears
Paper cuts
I'll sellotape them up
And bandage them
With cotton wool and glue
They're just paper cuts
I shouldn't beat myself up
Over little things the way I do
I bruise like a peach
I mumble when I speak
I'm in the gutter
Lookin' at my scars
I've always been in love with
We all need to feel secure
We're so middle class
But I'm still waiting for next week's chemical blast
Don't go feeling insecure, no feeling sad
With an M-16 you'll feel the surge of your American past
But are you afraid?
You always said the world would never last
And lola I'm not afraid
If you star-wipe all your past away
And the sun burns one more day
Lola, lola, will the world end me and you
Lola, lola, no we're never gonna make it through
Can you take me back to that place where stars glow
Comets swarm like fireflies outside your window
But are you afraid?
You always said the world would never last
And lola I'm not afraid
If you star-wipe all your past away
And the sun comes one more day
Lola, lola, will the world end me and you
Lola, lola, no we're never never make it through
Lola lola lola lola ooh
Our eyes meet all the time.
Your eyes permanent on mine.
Oh, tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
You've been looking at me for days.
I don't go for secretive games.
Oh, tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
I need a kind, and honest man. (honest man)
So come and talk to me. (If that's your plan?)
You could be mine.
If you want me, baby, that's fine.
But don't keep up this old line.
Oh, tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
I need a kind, and honest man. (honest man)
So come and talk to me. (If that's your plan?)
You could be mine.
Oh, a kind, and honest man. (honest man)
So come and talk to me. (If that's your plan?)
You could be mine.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
You could be mine.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
You could be mine.
My debut is coming soon and you already know what I'm gonna do
You got my time on the dotted line but you show up invited
But before I sign it
Someone say I'm not making mistakes and please don't be fake
My debut comes today and my feelings have all run away
With the man that I am but understand if I don't keep going
It just goes to show that
I've been beat by an industry I've never seen
This is me on my knees
Singing take it all from me
Take it all
Speak to my needs, my needs
Take it all, take it all
This is me
So the crowd gets quiet I start to play
And I think they're buying what I've got to say
But to my defiance the music fades
And we all sit silent and I crawl back inside
Because it wasn't supposed to go this bad
This is me on my knees
Singing take it all from me
Take it all
Speak to my needs, my needs
Take it all, take it all
This is me
When you grow silent I start to fall...
This is me on my knees
Singing take it all from me
Take it all
Speak to my needs, my needs
Take it all, take it all
This is me
And though we did not believe in God
The gray skies fell, we felt the pressure drop
And we were feeling down
Some eyes were looking down at us
The souls that made the call
They judge, but when they spoke said, "Not at all"
The words that came made not a sound
A mouth said, "Not a sound at all"
What surely said, "We wrote a book"
And rearranged the size and forms to look like something understood
Like something we had seen before
And waiting pent, save, sad, and look 
Up to the stars and counting all the suns and all the moons
How sad it was that we could not believe
And everyone who believes
And everyone who believes
And they say,
"We all said hallelujah"
"We all said hallelujah"
And everyone moves around with ease
And everyone move with ease around and then,
"We all said hallelujah"
"We all said hallelujah"
"We don't want answers anyway"
Still we could not conceive the call
The midnight fell, we felt the measure fall
And we were feeling down
Some eyes were looking down at us
And waiting pent, save, sad, and look
Up to the stars and counting all the suns and all the moons
How sad it was that we could not believe
And everyone who believes
And everyone who believes
And they said,
"We all said hallelujah"
"We all said hallelujah"
And everyone moves around with ease
And everyone fell right to their knees and then,
"We all said hallelujah"
"We don't want answers anyway"
"We don't want answers anyway"
Senorita, I can't forget your eyes
Your hair, your Spanish ass
I don't care what you tell the other guys
Hear me out
I'll do what you say
Just
Say what you want, say what you mean
Girl all I need is for you
To be the one that I believe
Can I believe you?
Say what you want, say what you mean
Girl all I need is for you
To be the one
Don't lie, lie, lie
Diamond girl,
I wanna wrap you around the world
I'll never let you touch the ground
I'll be your Biggie, you'll be my Lil' Kim
Inquitita, mira que yo quiero decirte
Lo que no sabes
Y vos, solamente contame la verdad
Vas a ver que yo te la guardo
Just
Say what you want, say what you mean
Girl all I need is for you
To be the one that I believe
Can I believe you?
Say what you want, say what you mean
Girl all I need is for you
To be the one
Don't lie, lie, lie
Diamond girl,
I wanna wrap you around the world
I'll never let you touch the ground
I'll be your Biggie, you'll be my Lil' Kim [x3]
When the train rolls by
I'm gonna be ready this time
When the boy gets that look in his eye
I'm gonna be ready this time
When my momma said I look good in white
I'm gonna be ready this time
Oh yeah...
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love?
I feel the wind blow through my hair
I'm gonna be ready this time
I'll buy a ticket to anywhere
I'm gonna be ready this time
You see, it feels like I'm starting to care
(And) I'm gonna be ready this time (ready this time)
Oh yeah...
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love?
Ready To Run
Ready To Run

All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love?
Ready To Run

Ready To Run
Ready To Run
Ready To Run
Ready To Run
I'm Ready To Run
I'm ready
Oh, I'm ready to run
I'm ready
Ready To Run
Ready To Run
This is a song that came upon me
One night
When the news it had been telling me
About one more war and one more fight
And 'aeh' I sighed but then
I thought about my friends
Then I wrote this declaration
Just in case the world end
Our guns
We shot them in the things we said
Ah we didn't need no bullets
'Cause we rely on some words instead
Kill someone in argument
Outwit them with our brains
And we'd kill ourselves laughing
At the funny things we'd say
And bombs
We had them saved for special times
When the crew would call a shakedown
We break down a party landmine
Women that so sexy
They explode us with their looks
Ah we blowing up some speakers
Jumping round till the ground shook
And missiles
They were the roadtrips that we launched
T-t-tripping across this island
Starting missions at the break of dawn
Yawn and smile say
'What direction shall we take?'
'Somewhere where it warm and wet'
This be the route we'd always take and
Our weapons were our instruments
Made from timber and steel
We never yielded to conformity
But stood like kings
In a chariot that's riding on a
Record wheel
And our airforce flying
When the frisbee in the sky
Have a session while we're smoking
Now we're feeling extra high
And we'd sneak into a carpark
With the skaties on our back
And we're flying down the levels howling
'On the attack now on the attack'
And battles
They happened in these dancehalls
See we'd rather fight with music
Choosing one the rhythm war
Battle at these shakedowns
And we battle at these gigs
We do battle in our bedrooms
Made some sweet love to the beat
Then our allies grew
Wherever we would roam
See whenever we're together
Any stranger feel at home
In a way we are an army
But this army not destruct
No instead we're doing simple things
Good loving find it run amuck
This be a declaration
Written about my friends
It's engraved into this song
So they know I'm not forgetting them
See maybe if the world contained
More people like these
Then the news would not be telling me
About all that warfare endlessly and
Our weapons were our instruments
Made from timber and steel
We never yielded to conformity
But stood like kings
In a chariot that's riding on
A record wheel
It's difficult to see from the surface.
But everything goes in and it stings,
Like a spider hit it's you deep inside and
I know that you are just like me, oversensitive.
We're an ordinarily breed.
Taking everything for much more than it means.
Well it's dangerous, and it's sweet.
Cut us and we bleed.
All these words that we speak casually.
Well maybe I'm just weak, but it hurts me.
Everything you said
Everything you said
Everything you said
Well it cuts, like a knife
It hurts me deep inside and
I know that you are just like me, oversensitive.
We're an ordinarily breed.
Taking everything for much more than it means.
Well it's dangerous, and it's sweet.
Cut us and we bleed.
I should put on my armor the next time I see you
So I won't be harmed. But I know I can shoot my own arrows.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I know that like me you can be oversensitive.
Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba
Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba
Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba
Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba
I know that you are just like me, oversensitive.
We're an ordinarily breed.
Taking everything for much more than it means.
Oh well it's dangerous, and it's sweet.
Yeah it's dangerous and sweet.
Don't you know it's dangerous and it's sweet?
Cut us and we bleed.

One, two, three, four
Great morning light splits through the chain
Another day older and closer to the grave
I'm closer to the grave and come the dawn
I woke this morning shackled and drawn
Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn
Pick up the rock, son, and carry it on
Trudging through the dark in a world gone wrong
Woke up this morning shackled and drawn
Whoa!
Alright, yeah!
I always love the feel of sweat on my shirt
Stand back, son, and let a man work
Let a man work, is that so wrong
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn
Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn
Pick up the rock, son, and carry it on
What's a poor boy to do in a world gone wrong
Woke up this morning shackled and drawn
Freedom, son, is a dirty shirt
The sun on my face and my shovel in the dirt
The shovel in the dirt keeps the devil gone
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn
Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn
Pick up the rock, son, and carry it on
What's a poor boy to do but keep singing this song
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn
Whoa whoa whoa!
Whoa whoa whoa!
Whoa whoa whoa!
Gambling man rolls the dice, working man pays the bills
It's still fat and easy up on bankers hill
Up on bankers hill the party's going strong
Down here below we're shackled and drawn
Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn
Pick up the rock, son, and carry it on
Trudging through the dark in a world gone wrong
Woke up this morning shackled and drawn
Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn
Pick up the rock, son, and carry it on
What's a poor boy to do but keep singing this song
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn
Whoa!
Whoa whoa-whoa!
Whoa whoa-whoa!
Whoa whoa-whoa!
Whoa whoa-whoa!
Whoa whoa-whoa!
(I want everybody to stand up)
(I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight)
(You know we got to pray together)
(I want you to stand up)
(I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Ask you once, ask you twice now
There's lipstick on your collar
You say she's just a friend now
Then why don't we call her
So you want to go on with someone
To do all the things you used to do to me
I swear, I know you do
Used to take me out, in your fancy car
And make out in the rain
And when I ring you up
Don't know where you are
'Til I hear her say your name
Used to sing along, when you played guitar
Just a distant memory
Hope she treats you better than you treated me, ha
I'm onto you, yeah you
I'm not your number one
I saw you, with her
Kissing and having fun
If you're giving all of your money and time
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you
Ciao adios, I'm done
Ciao adios, I'm done
Ciao adios, I'm done
After three, after four times
Why did I bother?
Tell me how many more times
Does it take to get smarter?
Don't need to deny the hurt and the lies
And all of the things that you did to me
I swear, I know you did
And now you take her out, in your fancy car
And you make out in the rain
And when she rings you up
She know where you are
But I know differently
Now she sings along, when you play guitar
Making brand new memories
Hope you treat her better than you treated me
I'm onto you, yeah you
I'm not your number one
I saw you, with her
Kissing and having fun
If you're giving all of your money and time
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you
Ciao adios, I'm done (I'm done)
Ciao adios, I'm done (no, no, no, no)
Ciao adios, I'm done
If you're giving all of your money and time
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you
Ciao adios, I'm done
And now you take her out, in your fancy car
And make out in the rain
And when she rings you up
She know where you are
But I know differently
Now she sings along, when you play guitar
Making brand new memories
Hope you treat her better than you treated me
I'm onto you, yeah you
I'm not your number one
I saw you, with her
Kissing and having fun
If you're giving all of your money and time
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you
Ciao adios, I'm done (I'm done)
Ciao adios, I'm done (you get on with your life, I'll get on with my life)
Ciao adios, I'm, I'm done
If you're not giving all of your money and time
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you
Ciao adios, I'm done
Lost in the Milky Way
Smile at the empty sky and wait for
The moment a million chances may all collide
I'll be the guiding light
Swim to me through stars that shine down
And call to the sleeping world as they fall to Earth
So here's your life
We'll find our way
We're sailing blind
But it's certain nothing's certain
I don't mind
I get the feeling
You'll be fine
I still believe that
In this world
We've got to find the time
For the life of Riley
From cradles to sleepless nights
You breathe in life forever
And stare at the world from deep under eiderdown
So here's your life
We'll find our way
We're sailing blind
But it's certain nothing's certain
I don't mind
I get the feeling
You'll be fine
I still believe that
In this world
We've got to find the time
For the first time
I don't mind
I get the feeling
You'll be fine

In this world
We've got to find the time
For the life of Riley
Although this world is a crazy ride
You take your seat and hold on tight

We'll find our way
We're sailing blind
But it's certain nothing's certain
I don't mind

You'll be fine

For the first time

Okay, Coconut Man, Moonheads, and Pea

When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?

And guess what, in thirty seconds, I'm leaving to Mars (Mars)
Yeah, we leaping across ('cross) these undefeatable odds

Everybody shake it
Time to be free amongst yourselves
Your mama told you to be discreet
And keep your freak to yourself
But your mama lied to you all this time
She knows as well as you and i
You've got to express what is taboo in you
And share your freak with the rest of us
'Cause it's a beautiful thing
This is my sexual revolution
Everybody shake it
Time to be free amongst yourselves
Your mama told you to be discreet

Especially when I take my clothes off

Especially when I take my clothes off
Sexual revolution
Got to do them before I die
Got to do them before I die
When we all had finally washed ashore
It was clear there was no one else around
We declared a national holiday
A chance to build it from the ground
So far away from everyone
And everything starts today
Keep it together
Can we keep it together
We're singing a new song now
And everything starts today
Can we rise? Can we get along alright?
Can we miss the storm that sucked the whole world in?
And the boats went out at night
And the choppers in the sky
They searched but they could find no trace of us
So far away from everyone
And everything starts today
Keep it together
Can we keep it together
We're singing a new song now
And everything starts today
The thunder struck, the clouds appeared
Our fearless crew was not prepared
And pretty soon the boats came for us
Half a million strong
We gathered arms and fired shells
We built a wall around ourselves
And pretty soon the spirit was a lot like
What it used to be back home
So far away from everyone
And everything starts today
Keep it together
Can we keep it together
We're singing a new song now
And everything starts today

And for all of the sweet loving that
I have received
In the sun in the rain
By the moon by the sea
There is one time that I'm thinking of
One time where one woman
Did knock me off my feet
And my knees were shaking
And my jaw was dropping
And my eyes were squinting
And my smile was growing
And my pants were bulging
And my hands were sweating
And my chest was beating
So I cry 'excuse me,
What is the secret to your song?'
'Cause when you're walking along
When you're walking along:
Your legs are a melody my hands
Would like to play
And your hips are a note
That does take me away
And your face and your eyes and your hair
And your waist and your smile
Drive me to distraction
She turned and she gave the evil eye
'Why thankyou' she said
Then she sigh 'ah there's one thing
I think you failed to mention:'
'What?' I said then she said
'It's the rhythm you forgot'
And right then I knew what was what
And she snuck to my lips
And she kissed them
Said 'young man
I'll show you some rhythm'
And she'll show you some rhythm
And since then ha
The rhythm's been running through my veins
In my thoughts in my eyes
In my head it's insane
It's the thing that does drive me
To scream
On the street when I think of some
Places it's taken me
I feel horny when I thinking of some of that rhythm in my mind
What she gave what she gives to me
All of the time
Say a little bit of sweet loving in your day
All my friends know it keeps the
Bad thoughts away
So sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place
And continue to:
Say sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place and
Continue to -
She said I'll show you some rhythm
And she'll show you some rhythm
We've waited so damn long, we're sick and tired
I won't leave any doubt or stone unturned
I've got a collar full of chemistry from your company
So maybe tonight I'll be the libertine
Oh, show me your love, your love
Gimme more but it's not enough
Show me your love, your love
Before the world catches up
Cause there's always time for second guesses, I don't wanna know
If you're gonna be the death of me, that's how I wanna go
You've got it all worked out with so little time
Memories that I'd black out if you were mine
You've got a pocket full of reasons why you're here tonight
So, baby, tonight just be the death of me
Oh, show me your love, your love
Gimme more but it's not enough
Show me your love, your love
Before the world catches up
Cause there's always time for second guesses, I don't wanna know
If you're gonna be the death of me, that's how I wanna go
Oh, show me your love, your love
Gimme more but it's not enough
Show me your love, your love
Before the world catches up
Oh, show me your love, your love
Gimme more but it's not enough
Show me your love, your love
Before the world catches up
Oh, show me your love
Show me your love
You can see there's something in the way
I've tried to show you, my door is open
I don't know how much more I can take
Since you've chosen, to leave me frozen
Am I the only one, who see's what you've become?
Will you drift away?
We're running out if time, two wrongs can make it right
Could I make you stay?
People making choices they can't fake
Sacrifice it all and maybe say
Something extraordinary
Something real (something real)
To fill my days and nights with something
That I can feel (I can feel)
I'm not gonna compromise
Surely you can sympathize?
Say you feel the same
You've wondered down a path I can't explain
Have you seen her, the grass is greener
To let me pass you by would be a shame
If she's your only then why are you lonely?
'Cause I'm the only one, who knows the things you've done
I'm so good for you
We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
Could I make you do
Something extraordinary
Something real (something real)
To fill my days and nights with something
That I can feel (I can feel)
I'm not gonna compromise
Surely you can simplify?
Say you feel the same
Just don't say it will be all right
You're not holding yourself in your arms tonight
Don't say it will all be fine
In only a moment you'll say goodbye
I, i, i, i, i, iii, iii
I, i, i, i, i, iii, iii, iii
Something extraordinary
Something real
To fill my days and nights with something
That I can feel (I can feel)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (I, I, I, I, I, III, III)
(I, i, i, i, i, iii, iii, iii)
Something extraordinary
Something real
To fill my days and nights with something
That I can feel
Just don't say it will be all right
You're not holding yourself in your arms tonight
Don't say it will all be fine
In only a moment you'll say goodbye
I better rest my eyes because I am growing weary of
This point you've been trying to make
So rather than imply why don't you just verbalize
All the things your trying to say
I guess well turn out so well
But I'm beginning to see that instead its trouble
Into a pattern we fell
Of prolonging the inevitable
Why don't you come right out and say it?
Even if the words are probably gonna hurt
I'd rather have the truth than something insincere.
Why don't you come right out and say it what it is your thinking
Though I'm thinking it's not what I wanna hear
I better check my pride because
I'm was starting to think I was onto something good
But things started to slide and thinking in retrospect
Understanding that I misunderstood
Thought I could make up your mind you had a decision locked up so tight 
It couldn't be touched
Thought you were being so kind by keeping your mouth sealed shut
Rather than just open it up
Why don't you come right out and say it?
Even if the words are probably gonna hurt
I'd rather have the truth than something insincere.
Why don't you come right out and say it what it is your thinking
Though I'm thinking it's not what I wanna hear
And now try to guess what goes on in your head
'Cause in your mind I just might find
All those things you left unsaid
And now try to make you not regret anything
And later on, after I'm gone, you'll wish that you had listened to me
Listened to me
Why don't you come right out and say it?
Even if the words are gonna hurt were better off this way
Why don't you come right out and say (Come right out and say it)
What I know your thinking anyway
Why don't you come right out and say it?
Even if the words are probably gonna hurt
I'd rather have the truth than something insincere.
Why don't you come right out and say it what it is your thinking?
Oh, what is it your thinking
Why don't you?
What it is your thinking
Though I'm thinking it's not what I wanna hear
Caminhando contra o vento
Sem lenco, sem documento
No sol de quase dezembro
Eu vou
O sol se reparte em crimes
Espaconaves, guerrilhas
Em Cardinales bonitas
Eu vou
Em caras de presidentes
Em grandes beijos de amor
Em dentes, pernas, bandeiras
Bomba e Brigitte Bardot
O sol nas bancas de revista
Me enche de alegria e preguica
Quem la tanta noticia
Eu vou
Por entre fotos e nomes
Os olhos cheios de cores
O peito cheio de amores vaos
Eu vou
Por que nao, por que nao
Ela pensa em casamento
E eu nunca mais fui a escola
Sem lenco, sem documento
Eu vou
Eu tomo uma Coca-Cola
Ela pensa em casamento
E uma cancao me consola
Eu vou
Por entre fotos e nomes
Sem livros e sem fuzil
Sem fome, sem telefone
No coracao do Brasil
Ela nem sabe ate pensei
Em cantar na televisao
O sol e tao bonito
Eu vou
Sem lenco, sem documento
Nada no bolso ou nas maos
Eu quero seguir vivendo, amor
Eu vou
Por que nao?
Por que nao?
Warm panda cola by the mountain the in the sun
I need some clean air in my lungs
Warm panda cola by the mountain the in the sun
I need some clean air in my lungs
Air in my lungs, air in my lungs
Warm panda cola by the mountain the in the sun
She was once mine
That smile that shines
From the glossy magazine that's stuck inside the Sunday Times
She was so sweet on Christmas Eve
With the snow set deep
When we went walking through the pines
I'd just been fired and her first offer had arrived
And the new year would see her flying far away from me
Though I didn't know it at the time
With outstretched hands
Now she commands
A famous figure for every picture
And she stands up strong and she demands
And they deliver
Yeah, she's a fixture
And it's a mixture of dumb jealousy and fear
That I might feel should she appear
Just like it hasn't been three years
And there's a distance to her voice over the phone
And that's because she stands alone
While I'm still sitting here
Girl, you see me here on another quiet night
I will wait until another indistinguishable day arrives outside
Where the light's even and bright
Where my life's sweet as it's slightly disappointingly just gliding softly by
Girl, you won't wait for me in some secluded stand of trees
Some Christmas Eve some God was kind enough to set aside
Although I'd love you too, I'm proud of you
God knows I'm feeling really stupid now
For ever having said goodbye
During the fight
I said, "Yeah right"
When you insisted that I'd visit, that you'd write
Now, I know you're working hard
So I never hear from you, and that's fine
You look the same on TV as when you were mine
I walk in from the kitchen
And I finger the remote control
I watch you from the distance
You go walking through the terminal
I remember every instance when you stunned me
Oh, you're so lovely
Oh, you're so smart
So, go turn their heads, go knock them dead, go break their hearts
Go break their hearts
Baby, break their hearts
And I know you will
Little bunny foo foo hopping through the forest scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head.
Down came the good fairy and the good fairy said,
"Little bunny foo foo I don't wanna see you scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head"
"I'm gonna give you 3 chances then I'm gonna turn you into a goon!"
Little bunny foo foo!
Nobody can tell you
There's only one song worth singin'
They may try and sell you
'Cause it hangs them up
To see someone like you
But you've got to make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along
You're gonna be nowhere
The loneliest kind of lonely
It may be rough going
Just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do
But you've got to make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along
So if you cannot take my hand
And if you must be going, I will understand
You've got to make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind of music
Even if nobody else sings along
You've got to make your own kind of music
Sing your own special song
Make your own kind music
Even if nobody else sings along
When you look in the mirror, wish you were somebody else
Just a perfect reflection, you and no one else
Minutes run into hours, hours run into days
You're still waiting for someone who never ever came
Fa fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Never be the same again
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Never be the same again
You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again
You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Never be the same again
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Never be the same again
Go and run through the hallways, find your way to the door
You will end up like always back where you were before
Then you look in the mirror, wish you were somebody else
But it's still your reflection, you and no one else
You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again
You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Never be the same again
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Never be the same again
No matter where you go, you'll never find your way home
You'll never find your way home, no matter where you go
You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again
You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Never be the same again
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Never be the same again
Finally I'm where I wanna be,
I didn't think this life was gonna be for me
I love you baby, do discover was I here
But now I'm caught up in a dream, don't wanna leave
See I can't give one for wish or not at all
When you least expect it's creepin' up on you
No confiding nor bite it to my rose
And now I'm counting knowing I'm here with you
Right here, you got me where you want me
Now I'm right here, waiting for your calling
Now I'm right here, you got me where you want me
Now I'm right here, right here!
Ooh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah
Ooh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah
Ooh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah
Ooh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah
Infatuation took a hole of my mind
I wouldn't change it for the world
Now you're mine
You played me hard to get for a while
Still got me deeper every day with your smile
See I can't give one for wish or not at all
When you least expect it's creepin' up on you
No confiding nor bite it to my rose
And now I'm counting knowing I'm here with you
Right here, you got me where you want me
Now I'm right here, waiting for your calling
Now I'm right here, you got me where you want me
Now I'm right here, right here!
Ooh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah
Ooh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah
Ooh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah
Ooh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah
You know I'm contained
Oh yes, I'm up on that thing
Right here is what I'd be
I'm not complaining
Finally I'm content
Oh yes, about that thing
Right here is where I'd stay
But I'm not complaining
Right here, you got me where you want me
If you want me!
Right here, you got me where you want me
Now I'm right here, waiting for your calling
Now I'm right here, you got me where you want me
Now I'm right here, right here!
Right here, you got me where you want me
Now I'm right here, waiting for your calling
Now I'm right here, you got me where you want me
Now I'm right here, right here!

Dave Matthews:
A don't stop stop your dreamin'
Let yourself float upon the notion
We can work it out, we gon' work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now
Marc 7even:
Hey, we live and we learn, we crash and we burn
Right now my only rhyme is this lesson I learned
You talk about trust, I talk about lust
It's not appealin' as you truly speak your feelings
I'll be lookin' at the ceiling, so concealing
I shoulda put my heart on the table
Knowin' I was good and able but instead I fed your fables
If I could have you back best believe it'd be forever
Cause each and every day you would hear those four letters
Dave Matthews:
A don't stop stop your dreamin'
Let yourself float upon the notion
We can work it out, we gon' work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now
Chali 2na:
Hey, these are different times but we feel the same pains
The blood of mankind runnin' through the same veins
We'd like to make it right some which it remain tame
Same crimes even though the names changed
And we like different minds workin' off the same brain
Passengers on different cars steppin' off the same train
In the end, makin' it right's the main aim
Different parts of the picture highlight the same frame
Dave Matthews:
A don't stop stop your dreamin'
Let yourself float upon the notion
We can work it out, we gon' work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now
Akil:
Yo, now if you know what I know you need to work it out
If you ain't happy with yourself you need to work it out
You havin' problems with your family then work it out
The things we go through just to work it out
I work it out when the situation seems unworkable
Un-reversible but God is most merciful
Many works, Many men converse
With soul searches sweat it out
when they tryin' to work it out 
Soup:
With the constant complaint, we either gonna make it fly
Or we ain't, I already know what some of ya think
I'ma talk a hip hop and how bad its got
Then tryin' pull a brother, I'm not lookin' for nobody to judge
You said you ain't I never thought you was
I'm just tryin' get with ya and pose in the same picture
So this mic thing can move the right thing and do the right thing
Made for your life gain, plus my man might sing (1, 2)
Dave Matthews:
A don't stop stop your dreamin'
Let yourself float upon the notion
We can work it out, we gon' work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now
A don't stop stop your dreamin'
Let yourself float upon the notion
We can work it out, we gon' work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now
I'm just a penny on the train track
Waiting for my judgment day
Come on baby girl, let see me those legs
Before I get flattened away
I wait, yeah I wait
For something good, for something great
Stopping in somebody's old hometown
Gotta get that midnight meal
If you can't get behind your own life 
Get behind the driving wheel
And go, just go
Find a place that you don't know
Ran into a friend just the other night
Got a badge, he's a local cop
Haven't seen that boy in over seven years
Since outta high school I dropped
I see, I see
All the things that I should be
Even lucky man has a bad day
And pretty girl has a scar
After that train comes and takes me away
Pick up that guitar
And play, just play
Play that rock and roll for me
He's in the yard just washin' his car
Thinking about his pretty wife
Makin' lemonade with the kitchen aid
Makin' him a perfect life
And it's grim, so dim
When you wish that you were just like him
I'm just a penny on the train track
Waiting for my judgment day
Come on baby girl, let me see those legs
Before I get flattened away
I wait, yeah I wait
For something good, for something great
And I try, oh I try
I can't stop, I don't know why
Riot on the streets, the touch beneath the sheets
It's only gonna make you love me more
The cops they got the guns, the night destroys the sun
It's only gonna make you love me more
This old world, well, it was mine to take
Faith can keep you warm, but I'll teach you how to shake
And I'll come to you like a little girl
It's only gonna make you love me more
Moonlight on the beach, sweet amphetamines
It's only gonna make you love me more
Bottles and the cans, the idiots go dance
It's only gonna make you love me more
This old world, well, it was mine to take
Faith can keep you warm, but I'll teach you how to shake
And I'll come to you like a little girl
It's only gonna make you love me more
They say love is hell,
But I've only been laughin' ever since I fell
It's only gonna make you love me more
The lord will have his way but I'm just a call away
It's only gonna make you love me more
This old world, well, it was mine to take
Faith can keep you warm, but I'll teach you how to shake
And I'll come to you like a little girl
It's only gonna make you love me more
Well Kim's got the answer with her watermelon gun
And all the celebrities want permission, but she won't give it to them, till they learn how to love... And Kim's got her watermelon gun, 'cause it's the consciousness of love
And wouldn't it be dumb if all their atrocities were just forgiven
But she won't give that to them, until they learn how to love.
And Kim's got her watermelon gun, 'cause it's the consciousness of love. She won't give it to them, she won't give it to them...
Magpie comes a calling
Drops a marble from the sky
Tin roof sounds alarming
"Wake up child"
"Let this be a warning,"
Says the magpie to the morning
Don't let this fading summer pass you by,
Don't let this fading summer pass you by.
Black hands held so high
The vulture wheels and dives
Something on the thermals yanked his chain
He smelled your boring apex
Rotting on the train tracks
He laughed under his breath
Because you thought that you could outrun sorrow
Take your own advice
This thundering and lightning gets you rain
You run an airtight mission
A Cousteau expedition
To find a diamond at the bottom of the drain
A diamond at the bottom of the drain
(And here I go)
Mocking bird sings
In the middle of the night
All his songs are stolen so he hides
He stole them out from whippoorwills
And screaming car alarms
He sings them for you special
He knows you're afraid of the dark
Come on sorrow
Take your own advice
Hide under the bed
Turn out the light
The stars this night in the sky are ringing out
You can almost hear them saying
"Close your eyes now, kid"
"Close your eyes now, kid"
"Morning's teeth are lit"
They are waiting, waiting
Oh, they are waiting
Where do all the lovers meet with one another,
In an effort to uncover what has happened to their salad days? 
The sprite ones on the corner, dream of something warmer
A semblance of their old ways, what has happened to our handmade days?
Oh no!
Way back when, we were the latest around
We lined and we painted this town
Their faces are green and they don't know what they've done.
We can pull a map out detailing the direct route
Young ones grow anxious to proclaim their advances to the fray
If you don't wake up and the truth never comes up 
We will never have our old way; we will never have a right of way
Oh no!
Way back when, we were the latest around
We lined and we painted this town
Their faces are green and they don't know what they've done.
Won't you show us where you heart is?
I am a lady in Spain
I'll sing a haunting refrain
I am a lady from Mars
And I can unscrew the stars
I can be anything that I see
I can be anything that I, anything that I see
I am in love with a boy
Manufactured to destroy
So I shall unravel my love
Like an old red woolen glove
I can do anything I want to
I can do anything I want anything my heart tells me to do
Tells me to do 
Tells me to do 
I can be anything that I see
I can do anything I want to
I can do anything I want to
I can be anything that I, anything that I see
I have weapons and battle plans,
But in my heart I know
I can't ever protect you from
Things I don't understand.
And when I hold you in my arms
It scares me just to
Think that something so beautiful
Could just come apart in my hands.
I've always been chasing rainbows
Staring out of classroom windows.
I don't think I'll ever be happy,
Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge.
I was too dumb to settle down,
So I packed up and I left town
On a sunshine bus
Wondering where it all went wrong.
On a flimsy wing and a prayer,
I followed my heart everywhere
'Til I ended up
Right back where I started from.
I've always been quietly dreaming.
I don't know when I've been beaten.
I don't think I'll ever be happy,
Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge.
I've always been chasing rainbows
Staring out of classroom windows.
I don't think I'll ever be happy,
Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge.
I've always been quietly dreaming.
I don't know when I've been beaten.
I don't think I'll ever be happy,
Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge.
The moment has come to face the truth 
I'm wide awake, and so are you 
Do you have a clue what this is? (I don't know) 
Are you everything that I missed? (Don't hope so) 
We'll just have to wait and see (Wait and see) 
If things go right, we're meant to be 
The surface is gone, we scratched it off 
We made some plans and let them go 
Do you have the slightest idea (No, I don't) 
Why the world is right when you're near? (Oh, is that so?) 
Stay a while and wait and see (Wait and see) 
If things go right, we're meant to be
Oh, what a world this life would be
Forget all your technicolor dreams
Forget modern nature, this is how it's meant to be
The time is here for being straight
It's not too early and never too late
People say I should watch my pace (What do they know?)
Think how you spend all your days (They all say so)
They'll just have to wait and see (Wait and see)
If things go right, they'll have to agree
Oh, what a world this life would be
Forget all your technicolor dreams
Forget modern nature, this is how it's meant to be
Do-dum-dum, do-do-do-dum
Da-do-dum-dum, do-do-do-dum
Do you have the slightest idea (No, I don't) 
Why the world is right when you're near? (Is that so?) 
Stay a while, we'll wait and see (Wait and see) 
If things go right, we're meant to be
Oh, what a world this life would be
Forget all your technicolor dreams
Forget modern nature, this is how it's meant to be
Forget modern nature, this is how it's meant to be
I need a little space in my mind
I need that little hope I can find
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
I need to feel my soul come alive
I need to feel the strength to get by
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
To ask for, too ask for, to ask for?
I need a little space in my mind
I need that little hope I can find
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
I need to feel my soul come alive
I need to feel the strength to get by
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
To ask for, too ask for, to ask for?
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
To ask for, too ask for, to ask for?
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
To ask for, too ask for, to ask for?
When I was a young boy I pretended I had a job
My daddy said 'Pretty woman, Mama married into the mob'
I dreamed one day I'd be livin' off the system for free
But dreams come true, honey; welcome to my reality
And I sleep all day and wake myself in the shadows
(Time to get up, gotta get up)
Gotta catch that train by midnight for the
Night work
Gotta do the night work
Punch that clock and break all the numbers
Night work
Gotta do the night work
Weekday 9 to 5 shift is over
I didn't have a penny
No, I couldn't cut a check with a blade
I used to have the shakes
But now they're good at getting me played
I sleep all day but I break my back in the moonlight
(Never enough, it's never enough)
Gotta cash that check by midnight for the
Night work
Gotta do the night work
Punch that clock and break all the numbers
Night work
Gotta do the night work
Weekday 9 to 5 shift is over
Night work
Gotta do the night work
Punch that clock and break all the numbers
Night work
Gotta do the night work
Weekday 9 to 5 shift is over
And when the whistle blows
And your body can't take it no more
You gotta keep on movin', remember
This is what you asked for
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-night work
Na-na-na-na-na-na-night work
Night work
Gotta do the night work
Night work gotta do the night work
Weekday 9 to 5 shift is over

Danke Schoen, Darling, Danke Schoen.
Thank you for all the joy and pain.
Picture shows, second balcony, was the place we'd meet,
Second seat, go Dutch treat, you were sweet.
Danke Schoen, Darling, Danke Schoen.
Save those lies, Darling don't explain.
I recall, Central Park in fall.
How you tore your dress, what a mess, I confess.
That's not all.
Danke Schoen, Darling, Danke Schoen.
Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane.
I can see, hearts carved on a tree.
Letters inter-twined, for all time, yours and mine, that was fine.
Danke Schoen, Darling, Danke Schoen.
Thank you for seeing me again.
Though we go on our separate ways,
Still the memory stays, for always, my heart says, Danke Schoen.
Danke Schoen, Oh Darling, Danke Schoen.
I said, Thank you for seeing me again.
Though we go- on our separate ways,
Still the memory stays, for always, my heart says, Danke Schoen.
Danke Schoen, Auf Wiedersehen, Danke Schoen
Tall, dark, and Superman
He puts his papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mothers eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yeah
And you'll smile and say, how are you?
I'll say just fine
I always forget to tell you I love you
I'll love you forever
I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watched Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
Tall, dark, and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday he'll take me away
And save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me singing
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they said
And you'll leave, got places to be
And I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day
I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watched Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love struck, and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the car was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day
I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around, forever and ever
And I watched Superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
When you come back down
Well, the little things you say and do
Make me want to be with you
Rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
I know it's got me reelin'
When you say I love you, I say rave on
I said rave on
I said rave on
My, my, my, rave on
I said rave on
And the way you look when you say good night
The way you make up when we fight
Rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
And I know it's got me reelin'
When you say I love you, I say rave on
I said rave on
I said rave on
My, my, my, rave on
I said rave on
I said rave on
I said rave on
My, my, my, rave on
Oh, my, rave on
Rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
I know, oh, it's got me reelin'
I'm so glad you're revealin' your love for me
Rave on, oh, rave on and tell me
Tell me, tell me not to be lonely
Tell me, tell me you love me only
Rave on to me
Oh, rave on to me
Rave on
I said rave on
My, my, my, rave on
I said rave on
My, my, my, rave on
This is a world of dreams
And reverie
Where I felt the stars explode
Around me
A grass blade flashed with a gleam as it slashed open a moonbeam
And I stared back breathlessly
As mountains of fruit tumbled out
I barely had the chance to shout
Oh strawberry avalanche crash over me
Staying awake that night
Was rather hard
Deep in a sleeping bag in your backyard
When we woke up buried alive
Beneath the fruity landslide we both laughed hysterically
It could have been just another dream
But I swear I heard you scream
Oh strawberry avalanche crash over me
Hope is a citrus constellation in the galaxy
Scratched on the back of both my eyelids
That I've been dying to see
If you were a beautiful sound in the echoes all around
Then I'd be your harmony
And we'd sing along with the crowds
Beneath the candy coated clouds
Oh strawberry avalanche, please crash over me
This is a world of dreams
And reverie
Where I felt the stars explode around me
There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Michael's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right
There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh huh
There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Michael's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right
There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's going to say goodnight
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh huh
There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's going to say goodnight
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh huh
Say goodbye
Lose your friends
Make them go
Don't need them around
'Cause it's time
Lose your friends
Make them go
Was never supposed to be like this
They were too weak
Too prone to break
Their needs too deep
Their skin too thin
By now you took what was to take
Tear it apart and start again
So go on
If this'll make you happier
It got you this far
Did what you had to
You've wasted every moment
Of your Saturdays
And your Sundays
You're wasted from the boredom
It was never supposed to be like 
Your father said
"Just do what was done unto you, always"
In your father's steps
You'll do what was done unto you
It won't be hard to start again
So go on
If this'll make you happier
It got you this far
Do what you have to
And you're gone now
(Well you knew this would come)
(And you've left me alone)
And did it make you happier?
(And you're lost and you're gone)
(Don't take it so seriously)
It wasn't that hard
(Go on, get going)
(I'm fine on my own)
Did what you had to
(And we got me this far)
(Finally got it figured out)
One more inch
You son of a bitch
You've been wasting my time, always
And now you're half awake
You bend 'til you break
And make the same mistakes, always
So go on
If this'll make you happier
It got you this far
Do what you have to
And you're gone now
(Well you knew this would come)
(And you've left me alone)
And did it make you happier?
(And you're lost and you're gone)
(Don't take it so seriously)
It wasn't that hard
(Go on and get going)
(I'm fine on my own)
Did what you had to
(And we got me this far)
(Finally got it figured out)
Found something crying, it was my soul
I fed it milk so it wouldn't grow old
We crossed the borderline at dawn
And woke up in a field of corn
The farmer told me I was late
I better start oiling the gate
Said that those who rush will fall
But I don't wanna wait for waves
I don't wanna wait at all
Oh, Annie, let's not wait
Let's cross the river now
We could sit for years
Staring at our fears
Oh, they're such pretty things
They're so cute
But our dreams are all we really need to know
Found something dying, it was my light
It had resigned itself to night
So I threw it out a fishing line
Said catch your reel and then catch mine
Oh, Annie, let's not wait
Let's cross the river now
We could sit for years
Staring at our fears
Oh, they're such pretty things 
They're so cute
But in the end they're just a suit
Oh, Annie, let's not wait
Time's not on our side
Well it never was
We know that deep inside
Oh just look at you
With your ruffled hair
Oh I love you and that's all you need to know
Annie, Annie...
He made an enemy then, he made an enemy of all of you, it's him, not you
You never heard it from me but there's a breach in the hull where the truth and the water's too deep to prove
He made an enemy then, he made an enemy of all of you, it's him, not you
It's a little red sea let the miracle worker go free
See the paddle go up and the paddle go down
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down
And the man falls in the sea
He was a man of many nations, had a hundred souls and a hundred to go
He was a man of many nations, two hearts, two hands, it's a slippery slope
He had a fear of being naked, but you're any other man in another man's clothes
He was a man of many nations, with revelations, oh revelations
He wrote a book about the Bible and he, he wrote a book about men in the sky
He wrote a book about the smell of winter in two, a little less simple to decipher
Saying, "I am the water at the foot of the palms or I am sand and wind and a shitty mirage
But either way, I'm a man of many nations!"
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running it around?
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running, and the running it around?
She had a name, she had a spirit, she had a line in the play if you waited to hear it
But a master of disguises, her demise was her design, they said
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running, and the running, and the running it around?
She said my name and my spirit are both corrupt and if you hold me close, you gotta hold me up
It was the tender mending of this slender gown that brought me bending to the ground
Now you'll wear any old thing, oh you'll wear any old thing
So she left herself in swallowing up the fever to the air to a broken wing
It's an act, I think she's just pretending, it's an act, I think, she's just pretending
If you burn the virgin flags, then I will shake, (shake!) as the heat waves in the sand
This one's for Maggie (This one's for Maggie) this one's for Sam (This one's for Sam)
This one's for Maggie (This one's for Maggie) this one's for Sam (This one's for Sam)
Or any other random spirit lover busted, I have lusted after you
The way bloodsuckers do, the way bloodsuckers do, the way bloodsuckers do!
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running it around?
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running and the running and the running and the running it around?
It was the tender mending of this slender gown that brought me bending to the ground
But this ship was built to go down
See the paddle go up and the paddle go down!
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down!
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down!
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down!
Baby, I'm stuck in the middle, and I don't know why
Find the words you sing to be
Sweeter than the words of the bird in the sky
Oh, the days you came around
I feel so good for me
I can take most anything
'Cause what you bring
I find it to be magical
I feel like I'm loving you in 1963
Flowers in my hair
Little bitty hearts upon my cheek
Baby, you'll be on my mind
'Til I kiss you next time
Baby, come on, take a ride in my little blue bug
Keep the windows down
Don't forget to celebrate the radio's up
Oh, the way you hold my hand
There is no other way
We could take a thousand walks
And laugh all day
I find it to be magical
I feel like I'm loving you in 1963
Flowers in my hair now
Little bitty hearts upon my cheek
Baby, you'll be on my mind
'Til I kiss you next time
Up and down through what you thought would be your future
Became the dark reminder of
What a rash and inconsistent faith you had
In loving your true self and your true love
Clowne towne no shelter
Clowne towne no anything
Clowne towne single angel
Clowne towne no exit
Your true father smashed his hands through the glass
And failed out of the priviledged life of his dream
Your true love has drunk herself into not being able to pay her rent
Or keeping her own word to her own self
Your true brother has betrayed you over and over
And looked you in the eye
Your true self has become weak and alone and annoying
And a true ridiculous dumb-ass
Clowne towne revealing nothing
Clowne towne a flock of coots
Clowne towne a single beauty
Clowne towne a big dumb kid
Everything that rises

Everything that rises
Everything that rises

Everything that rises

Look up child
The world is born
Shoe's untied
And your soles are worn
Windows are rolled down
Sun is setting high
Windows are rolled down
I'm fixin' to die
Corn rows have companion feel
This rocky road and this steering wheel
Who do you call to ease your pain
I hope for you to get through this rain
Windows are rolled down
Moon is hanging low
Windows are rolled down
I think it's time for me to go hey-ay-ay-a...-ay
Is it what you dreamed it'd be
Are you locked up in this fantasy
Oh this miles that have
Torn us apart
My new found faith
And my broken heart
Windows are rolled down
Sun is rising high
Windows are rolled down
Feel that wind rushing by hey-ay-ay-a...
Windows are rolled down
Do you want to dance and hold my hand
Tell me baby I'm your lover man
Oh baby do you want to dance?
Do you want to dance under the moonlight
Hold me baby all through the night
Oh baby
Do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance?
Do you want to dance under the moonlight
Kiss me baby all through the night
Oh baby
Do you want to dance?
Do you want to dance under the moonlight
Squeeze me, squeeze me baby all through the night
Oh baby
Do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
'Everyone feels good in the room,' she swings
'Two chord cool in the head,' she sings
'A-buzz, a-buzz, a-buzzing like them killer bees'
Tell me this is not for real
Please simply this is not for real
From time to time her eyes get wide
She's always got them stuck on me
I'm surprised at how hot honey-colored and hungry she looks
And I have to turn away to keep from bursting
Yeah, I feel that good
She slips from the stage a foot no more
But it seems to take an hour for her to reach the floor
And the two chord cool still grooves
As she slides towards me smooth as a snake
I can't swallow, I just start to shake
And I just know this is a big mistake
Yeah, but it feels good
Do it to me, do it to me
Do it to me, do it to me
'If you want I can take you on another kind of ride'
'Believe me, I would but'
Deep inside the 'but' is 'please'
I am yearning for another taste
And my shaking is 'yes'
'You will be all the things in the world you've never been
See all the things in the world you've never seen
Dream all the things in the world you've never dreamed'
But I think I get a bit confused
Am I seducing or being seduced?
Oh, I know that tomorrow I'll feel bad
But I really couldn't care about that
She's grinning, singing, spinning me round and round
Smiling as I start to fall
Her face gets big, her face gets small
It's like tonight I'm really not me at all
And it feels good
Do it to me, do it to me
Do it to me, do it to me
It feels good
I watched it all come crashing down
On the verge of a world profound.
Standing on unstable ground
Adding insult to irony.
I think it's really gonna happen this time,
Our calls on the company dime.
Reluctance ties up the line
With irresponsibility.
No matter save for a friend
No argument can amend.
Irreplaceable but in the end,
One star player doesn't save the team.
Now you're open to attack,
Our burden rests on your back.
Replace, re-track
Responsibility.
I'm still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this.
Still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this.
Still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this.
Anonymous until the ending,
Spent a long long time pretending.
And a longer day spent accepting
What the world ahead would store.
You only learn but not believing
That the industry is unforgiving.
Everything that you've been giving
Isn't what it was before.
I'm still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this.
Still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this.
Still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this.
Replace, re-track
Replace, re-track
Replace, re-track
I'm still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this.
Still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this.
Still waiting for
(I'm still waiting for)
You to get over this.
Try, try, try to arrange me
But there's no romance in my blood
Try, try, you'll never persuade me
My only tears fall with the rain
My father had a dozen wives
And a child by every one
I am from about, umm, number five
So don't expect me to stay with anyone
Try, try, try to arrange me
But there's no romance in my blood
Try, try, you'll never persuade me
My only tears fall with the rain
My mother never takes a break
From her pining after furniture
Every moment on her feet is torture
And I share her love of wine and cake
And taking advantage of amateurs
Two winters gone in a blur of sleepless nights
Day in, day out, I worked through the same old plight
By then I'd stopped looking for my way out
Somehow I thought I wasn't worth the fight
It's safe to say, saving you, saved me
All those times I'd hung my head to keep the peace
I had buried all my strength and will down deep
When you came I woke from many sleeps
One day I'll tell you what you did for me
It's safe to say, saving you, saved me
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I've broken every law
All the words come out my broken jaw
I don't know anything
But then I act like I know everything
Don't want to talk about it
What do you see when you dream about it?
I had been broke down from my enemies
I'm drifting farther from my memories
And then you take it away
Everyday I'm fighting 'cause I can't read you
Lost in the moment, then I come back down
Lost in the sight I try to reach out
Just a little bit closer, then I come back down
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You tell me, "What's my name?"
I'm the same, I've just been rearranged
Smile through a joke inside
Yeah, I've been hiding with nothing to hide
Don't want to talk about it
What do you see when you dream about it?
Well, I had been broke down from my enemies
Just holding a piece of what's been left of me
And then you take it away
Every day I'm fighting 'cause I can't leave it
And then I feel the weight and then I come back down
I watch from the sides and try to reach out
Just a little bit closer and then I come back down
Yeah, you're pushing me, pushing me, I can feel it, yeah
Just a little bit higher, then I come back down
Climbing over people 'cause I've been blinded
And I'm waiting, I'm waiting around
Sometimes you find yourself waiting
Waiting for someone to come around
And it's hopeless, hoping to be found
Then it arrives and says, "You're perfect, my love"
And I
I know why
I know why
I know why
But you said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know, you don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know, you don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know, you don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
Just take it away, yeah
What you find and heal my broken jaw, yeah
Lyin' here, and I've slain my hero, yeah, yeah
What you need is higher than your shame
She's a perfect ten, but she wears a twelve
Baby keep a little two for me
She could be sweet sixteen, bustin' out at the seams
It's still love in the first degree
When he's at my gate, with a big fat eight
You wanna see the smile on my face
And even at my door, with a poor poor four
There ain't no man can replace
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes
I love her body, especially the lies
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
Promise me this, take me tonight
If he's extra large (That's me) well I'm in charge
I can work this thing on top
If he's XXL, well what the hell?
Every penny don't fit the slot
I get anorexic chicks, who model six
They don't hold no weight with me
Well eight or nine, well that's just fine
But I like to hold something I can see
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes
I love her body, especially the lies
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
Promise me this, take me tonight
I've bought a watch, to time your beauty
But I've had to fit a second hand
I've bought a calendar, and every month
Is taken up by lover man
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes
I love her body, especially the lies
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
Promise me this, take me tonight
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes
I love her body, especially the lies
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
Promise me this, take me tonight
I know I'm fucking moody
And I know I'm quite unkind
I know I'm kind of distant
But you're always on my mind
And you will imply that I am apathetic
Right to the bone
And I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo
I guess I'm quite controlling
And I'm insecure
And I know you'd like it better
If I opened up some more
But I don't even know if I could look you
Straight in the eye
Oh my
And I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo
Ooh, ooh, no
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo
I know that I'm neurotic
And I'm hard to please
And I'm disobliging
And faulty by design
Not withstanding I think we could work out
Work out just fine
And I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo
No, ooh, ooh
You question me even though
You know I'm not a weirdo
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo
Ooh, ooh
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo
People take pictures of the summer
Just in case someone thought they had missed it
And to prove that it really existed
Fathers take pictures of the mothers
And the sisters take pictures of brothers
Just to show that they love one another
You can't picture love that you took from me
When we were young and the world was free
Pictures of things as they used to be
Don't show me no more, please
People take pictures of each other
Just to prove that they really existed
Just to prove that they really existed
People take pictures of each other
And the moment could last them for ever
Of the time when they mattered to someone
Ay nye nye
Ay nye nye nye
Ay nye nye nye
Nye nye nye nye
Ay nye nye
Ay nye nye nye
Ay nye nye nye
Nye nye nye nye
People take pictures of the summer
Just in case someone thought they had missed it
Just to proved that it really existed
People take pictures of each other
And the moment to last them forever
Of the time when they mattered to someone
Picture of me when I was just three
Sucking my thumb by the old oak tree
Oh, how I love things as they used to be
Don't show me no more, please
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Say what,
We should start somethin' simple,
Gonna push this beat till it hits the top,
Then rock it, dance right till it falls,
Grab that beat, by the balls,
Stand tall, that's right, be proud'a yourself,
You could give me heat but I'd never tell,
Do somethin', uh-huh, somethin' great,
If you try to stop this, you're just too late,
We just won't be defeated,
We'll fight until we drop,
You can knock us all down,
Try to mute the sound,
But we'll climb back to the top,
We just won't be defeated,
We'll fight until we drop,
You can knock us all down,
Try to mute the sound,
But we'll climb right back up!
What?
We should start somethin' simple,
Gonna push this beat till it hits the top,
Then rock it, dance right till it falls,
Grab that beat, by the balls,
Stand tall, that's right, be proud'a yourself,
You could give me heat, but I'd never tell,
Do somethin', uh-huh, somethin' great,
If you try to stop this, you're just too late
I'm feelin' groovy, kickin' down the cobblestones
And there is music in every sight and every sound
No need for headphones
I'll tip my cap to the world even though I don't wear one
Grinnin' at the women in the salon gettin' their hair done
On the outside looking in like an aquarium
Spinnin' with the stars in the planetarium
Deliriously, mysteriously I'm feelin' curiously marvelously
'Super Duper' like Joss Stone
My heart melts like ice cream cones
Grinnin' like a dog diggin' up dinosaur bones
I used to be fossilized but now I'm out of my shell
And I'm happier than whores with chivalrous clientele
This can't be real, I must be dreamin' could somebody slap me
I'm feelin' so mischievous, original cheeky chappy
It must be ages since I felt satisfied
Just to be Just Jack and just that, still intact
It's just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
It's just another one of those, just another one of those
Just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
It's just another one of those glory days
I'm so warm, new dawn, reborn, new forms
And I'm thinkin' about my boys Joelly chic and Freshly Sean
And I know you're underrated but one day we'll all make it
And walk around naked with our bullocks platinum plated
Anyway, I'm off track gotta stop that
And get back to the high street, I need somethin' to eat
Stop at the cafe, coffee and a salt beef bagel
Yeah, I know I'm Cain'd but now I'm feelin' Abel
I used to get so paranoid In places like this
Stayed in my house for days with my weed psychosis
My neurosis was thinkin' everybody's staring at my red eyes
And shifty expression but now I'm past carin'
And I can feel that destiny is on my side
And by the looks of things, fate came along for the ride
Behind green skies, I can see my girl's eyes
Damn it, I'm in love with this planet, you gotta realize
It's just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
It's just another one of those, just another one of those
Just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepare to be amazed
It's just another one of those glory days
It's time to look to the future
Just when I was gettin' used to the humdrum
I realized in the depths of my depression
That I really wanted to be someone
So let's smash the past like a tacky figurine
On the back page of a supplementary magazine
But for the time being, bump your head to the beat
Sit back, put your feet up and relax
It's just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
It's just another one of those, just another one of those
Just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepare to be amazed
It's just another one of those glory days
La
La lune est libre je crois
Qui rayonne au-dessus
Rayonne au-d'sus des toits
La lune est libre
Bien plus libre qu'on ne le croit
Elle fluctue de ca et la
Les parties qu'on ne voit pas
C'est pas grave ca reviendra
Et quand elle est plongee
Dans la froide obscurite
Donne l'impression qu'elle se noie
Bien vite reprend pied
Avec ses apparences instables
Y en a qu'elle fait douter
Bien plus fidele qu'on ne le croit
La lune est libre
Receptive et absorbante
De la lumiere qu'elle renvoie
Elle rayonne au-dessus des toits
Et fluctue de ca et la
Changeante, fascinante
Parfois meme eblouissante
C'est ainsi qu'on l'apercoit
Disque parfait, disque lumineux
Ne vous rappelle-t-elle pas l'hostie/le style
De ceux qui levent la tete
Dans l'espoir de s'elever un peu
Transitoire, unique, symbolique
De quelques visions imaginaires
Elle en impressionne plus d'un
Qui prennent peur et delirent
Elle est au-dessus de tout ca
Elle est au-dessus de tout ca
Elle est libre de tout ca
Elle est au-dessus de tout ca
Elle est libre de tout ca
Elle est au-dessus de tout ca
La lune est libre je crois
Qui rayonne au-dessus
Rayonne au-d'sus des toits
La lune est libre
Bien plus libre qu'on ne le croit
Elle fluctue de ca et la
Les parties qu'on ne voit pas
C'est pas grave ca reviendra
Disque parfait, disque lumineux
Ne vous rappelle-t-elle pas l'hostie/le style
De ceux qui levent la tete
Dans l'espoir de s'evader un peu
Transitoire, unique, symbolique
De quelques visions imaginaires
Elle en impressionne plus d'un
Qui prennent peur et delirent
Elle est libre de tout ca
Elle est libre de tout ca

You're needing someone older
And though I've been warned to live day by day
There's something taking over
Did you expect to kiss me one time
While looking at me with the same eyes ever again?
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are
Your mother complains that you need a man
You haven't mentioned me yet
And all of your friends don't know who I am
I've been your best kept secret
I understand I wasn't part of the plan
A dollar short, a minute early
But I am your man
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are
Let's bypass the bullshit and move on because
The minute hand moves faster than you think it does
And by no fault of yours and by no fault of mine
The bottom line is laying in the bed that we've been playing in tonight
I'm calling it love soon
I'm calling it love soon
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are
One, two, three, four!
Went out with the guys
And before my eyes
There was this girl she looked so fine
And she blew my mind
And I wish that she was mine
And I said hey wait up
'Cause I'm off to speak to her
And my friends said
You'll never get her, etc...
But I didn't care
'Cause I loved her long blond hair
And love was in the air
And she looked at me
And the rest was history
Dude your being silly
'Cause your never gonna get that girl
And your never gonna get that girl
We spoke for hours
Took off my trousers
Spent the day laughing in the sun
And we had fun
And my friends they all looked stunned yeayeah
Dude she's amazing
And I can't believe you got that girl
And my friends said
She's amazing, etc...
It gave me more street cred
I dug the book she read
And how could I forget
She rocks my world
More than any other girl yeayeah
Dude she's amazing
And I can't believe you got that girl
And I can't believe you got that girl
She looked incredible
Just turned 17
I guess my friends were right
She's out of my league
So what am I to do
She's too good to be true
One, two, three, four!
(Guitar Solo)
But three days later
Went 'round to see her
But she was with another guy
And I said fine
But I'll never asked her why
And since then loneliness has been
A friend of mi-i-ine
And my friends say
Such a pity, etc...
I let her slip away
They tell me everyday
That it will be OK
Yeah she rocks my world
More than any other girl yeaa
Dude it's such a pity
And I'm sorry that you lost that girl
And I'm sorry that you lost that girl
I've got problems,
I'm gonna use them.
I'm gonna keep them from you 'til you cry.
I've got machine guns,
I never shoot them,
I only borrowed them in case we die.
Late nights, play fights,
I'm freezing and you're leaving me here.
Blue and red up I'm fed, you're upset almost dead, tongue twisted.
35 nightmares and 94 days since I got near you and your anxious ways,
Hey darling, let's steal it,
I'm certain you're sure, 
Spell it to me love.
And as we planned there's fireworks, stage right,
They're swallowing the brains of all in sight,
It's 1am, that's the evening your time,
We're counting sheep,
Sell it to me, love.
Leave it while it still smolders,
So I'll have to say I told you, 
I carved our names in a tree there,
I meant the letters to be bolder, bolder,
Around the angles there's a race,
Where silver never gets golder,
And baby when we get older,
We don't have to get colder
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell for the company
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell seems like fun to me
There's something in the sun this day, I feel it
Or maybe it's just my hay fever
The weeds are green, the sky is shining
But it'll soon be night which is nicer
But then cracks peel back and hell bends the room
And the devil gestures to you
You've never seen such a Beelzebee
And he's telling you to make up your bean about what's left of your evening
About whether to flake out or fecking stay out
What do you make of this doubt?
The devil wants to know if you're going down or up
Easy - I know what my speech should be
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell for the company
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell seems like fun to me
The devil beams a big beaming grin
The sort which leads you up the streets of sin
He holds up paperwork - sign the line
Let's clash with madmen, grime is fine
It sounds all hectic, you're having cold feet
Things are getting out of hand, you make an embarrassing retreat
Let's ride the valkyrie, commit a bit of sin
Turn rock to rubble, punch me in the chin
I simply, Lucifer, refuse to wind up on fire with low-life liars
Then you're destined for the world without chores and sweating -
The eternal hell of boredom in heaven
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell for the company
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell seems like fun to me
You tell the devil in no uncertain terms
You'll never be evil, you'll never be turned
What is this evil? And who decides this?
When left to devices some humans try shit
This is the reason we should all be tied up?
We're just normal people exploring our minds
We don't go around here putting poison in wine
But we enjoy what we like which is not always right
People are intricate, people aren't swines
Let's screw the rules up and rely on our minds
Sign on the line
You sign on the line
He clutches the wine and tips it in cyonide
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell for the company
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell seems like fun to me
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell for the company
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell seems like fun to me
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell for the company
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell seems like fun to me
Oh Darci, Darci don't look so sad
Don't let the daytime get you down
Because we will be wild like children 
Once the black has veiled this sky
No pushing buttons, no telling lies
No pointed fingers trying to keep you quiet
Just you and I misbehaving
Oh, trying our best to feel alive
We won't ever let them win
When we are younger oh, our hearts are so much bolder
Oh, the pressure's not as great
We floated weightless through the tops of trees
But as we get older oh, our vision becomes blurred
And then the fog it slips right in
Now you're wondering how oh yeah, you're wondering how you ended up here
How you end up here
The hateful, hateful tough little boys
That move their lips whenever you're around
So smart just shouting answers (shouting answers)
I guess their fathers taught them well
So sit real still, they've got to size you up
Don't move your mouth, they don't like when you talk
They're trying their best to define you (to define you)
They're trying their best to keep you down
But we won't ever let them win
Because this world you know it can get so crazy
All these people talk a lot
They know this, they know it all
What a drag
But you know there will always be some oddball singing
Just remember to sing along, yeah you better start singing along
This place could be just so beautiful
You just can't let them pull that cloth over your eyes
Just keep on screaming
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Bop bop ba, bop bop ba
Take time for your pleasure
And laugh with love
Take the hand of another
And sing for the wings of a dove
Whoa whoa for the wings of a dove (x2)
Look up at the rooftops
When you're walking round
Don't think for a moment
Of looking down
Whoa whoa yeah yeah yeah
For the wings of a dove
Whoa whoa for the wings of a dove (x3)
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Look up at the rooftops
When you're walking round
Don't think for a moment
Of looking down
A room at the top
Where we're not allowed
Don't cheer to the echo
Can you hear the sound
Whoa whoa yeah yeah yeah
For the wings of a dove
Whoa whoa yeah yeah yeah
For the wings of a dove
Whoa whoa for the wings of a dove (x2)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (x3)
Whoa whoa for the wings of a dove (x4)
No more tears
No more cryin'
No more sighin', lyin' or dyin'
No more HIV
No more tweakin'
No more drugs or immune systems being weakened
Just happy times and half assed rhymes and mimes
Because mimes are dears
But most of all I want no more tears
No more bad times
No more bummers
No more SUVs and no more Hummers
No more racism
No more discrimination
No more fat dumb fucks keeping people out of our nation
We're all one big band across this land and we should sing in tune
Let us grow the balls to break the walls
We've got to do it soon
But most of all I want no more tears
No more cryin'
No more sighin', lyin' or dyin'
I don't wanna tell her
No don't want to tell her
I lie awake in the dark
Lost in the beat of my heart
Well baby look over your shoulder
You're not alone in this life
I don't wanna tell her
No don't want to tell her
That I've been thinking of you
Lost in the things that you do
Maybe it's over
But over is not a word that you know
And if it hurts me baby you know why
I go it alone
Hurt me baby if you like
It's already gone
I don't wanna tell her
No don't want to tell her
I've been calling your name
Each time it feels its in vain
Maybe it's over
But over is not a word that you know
I don't wanna tell her
No don't want to tell her
I've been falling apart
Broke every rule from the start
Baby look over your shoulder
You're not alone
And hurts me baby when you try
To go it alone
Hurt me baby if you like
You already gone
This is a song
And these are the words
I don't wanna hear it
Don't wanna hear it
This is a song
And these are the words
I don't wanna tell her
No don't want to tell her
I lie awake in the dark
Lost in the beat of my heart
Well baby look over your shoulder
You're not alone in this love
Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Honey lookin' perfect
Now you aren't so in step
In step
In step
In step
You had your photograph, in a magazine
Such a pretty boy, only nineteen
But now your twenty-three and it's all gone now
You ain't all that, you wanna be somehow
Maybe it was only a dream!
You just thought you could be anything that you wanted to be
Sadly, it all went wrong so
Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Honey lookin' perfect
Now you aren't so in step
In step
In step
In step
Still just go to the same old clubs
But the new kids have got one above
Music tastes change like the wind
You're doin' now what's already been
And you still think that you're so it
Cause you know so and so, and you made a hit
But you can't hear it being played
Cause you my friend have had your day
Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Honey lookin' perfect
Now you aren't so in step
In step
In step
In step
(Feat. Carina Andersson)
Will somebody wear me to the fair?
Will a lady pin me in her hair?
Will a child find me by a stream?
Kiss my petals and weave me through a dream
For all of these simple things and much more a flower was born
It blooms to spread love and joy faith and hope to people forlorn
Inside every man lives the seed of a flower
If he looks within he finds beauty and power
Ring all the bells sing and tell the people everywhere that the flower has come
Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness is gone
Throw off your fears let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born
It's never gonna work, I don't know what I'm doing in here
My evenings go beserk every time your voice gets near
But when I get under control, I see you ache for it and all
I've got some sugar for your bowl
I've got some loving for your soul
Some twinkle for your eyes, I
Getting sick of being just alone
They think it's not right, fine
Each to their very little own
I want you now, I don't care how
We're both too young to be sitting around
I want you now, I want you now
You make me sure, you make me live
And that's worth more than I ever could give
I don't know how, I want you now
So Timmy goes to school and Timmy goes to work all day
But we just hang around and think of clever things to say
You deserve to get your wish 
But you don't know what it is
First it was that and now it's this
But there's one thing that you missed.
Together we'd be fine, fine
At least we can say we won't be lonely
Fine, Fine, I never want to be alone
I want you now, I don't care how
We're both too young to be sitting around
I want you now, I want you now
You make me sure, you make me live
And That's worth more than I ever could give
I don't know how, I want you now
I want you now
I don't care how
We're both to young to sit around
I want you know
Yea Yeaaa, Yea Yea Yea Yea
I want you now, I don't care how
We're both too young to be sitting around
I want you now, I want you now
You make me sure, you make me live
And That's worth more than I ever could give
I don't know how, I want you now
Yea Yea Yea Yeaaaaaaaa
I'm a mess,
I guess.
It's what I asked for, it's what I needed.
Well, you know me better than that, or at least you did and something happened.
But once again something's happened.
The confidence you held in us is the rope we almost hung ourselves with.
At times I wonder if we really took the steps to break right through it.
I know that there were better days, but to see the light and to feel the rays.
Life was always back and forth and we were idling or making useless ruckus.
Waiting for the rain to stop.
Destination: beautiful.
Seems that I'm still waiting for the sun.
Someday will come back to us,
If you're willing let it go.
Why won't you just let this be your sun?
It seems like yesterday we had the world our way.
But some say we're headed for destruction.
I'll ask you
What in the world should we do?
The light is green our break is through.
Are we not trying or are we trying to hard?
Well, you know I never want to miss,
I hold on tight and reminisce.
But it's bittersweet to me.
When time stands still as it's trapped inside the letterbox you gave back to me.
But I'm the one who keeps on reading... reading
But I'm the one who wants to let it go.
I'm the first to speak.
You're the last to know.
Another scene that we're creating,
I need to know if we're still making useless ruckus.
Waiting for the rain to stop.
Destination: beautiful.
Seems that I'm still waiting for the sun.
Someday will come back to us,
If you're willing let it go.
Why won't you just let this be your sun?
It seems like yesterday we had the world our way.
But some say we're headed for destruction
Waiting for the rain to stop.
Destination: beautiful.
Seems that I'm still waiting for the sun.
Someday will come back to us,
If you're willing let it go.
Why won't you just let this be your sun?
It seems like yesterday we had the world our way.
But some say we're headed for destruction
Ten thousand stories and two lovers disguised
You've seen the future, now a love that is blind
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
You've dialed that number now, so where's the surprise?
Temptation's callin' you, a secret reply
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
All along the path, feelings I can't tell
Makes me want to kiss and not tell
You say in evidence, they won't take you alive
But when the sun goes down you can't realize
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
You've got the elegance but it's weighin' you down
And sometimes you just need a night on the town
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
All along the path, feelings I can't tell
Makes me want to kiss and not
And all I want is to come right out my shell
Makes me want to kiss and not tell
Oh
Never find a love like this
Well we go back so far,
Swinging in your backyard,
All the things that we used to do.
We were cool back in high school
Ooh I really liked you,
Must've been your attitude.
And that's why you keep on runnin'
In and out of my mind.
As the years they all roll by,
Baby now I know why
I keep comin' back to you.
You're the only one that knows me,
Love it when you hold me,
I'll never find a love like this.
Let me hear you say
Now we'll never be lonely,
Look at whatcha showed me,
I'll never find a love like this.
When this life tried to keep us apart,
You keep callin' me back to your heart.
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me,
Wrap your world around me,
You'll never find a love like this.
All the guys tried to take me,
You're the one who saved me,
I feel like I owe you my life.
And as strange as it may seem,
I'll go if you take me,
I'm willing to sacrifice.
That's why you keep on runnin'
In and out of my mind.
As the years they all roll by,
It's not hard to know why,
I keep comin' back to you.
You're the only one that knows me,
Love it when you hold me,
I'll never find a love like this.
Let me hear you say
Now we'll never be lonely,
Look at whatcha showed me,
I'll never find a love like this.
When this life tried to keep us apart,
You keep callin' me back to your heart.
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me,
Wrap your world around me,
You'll never find a love like this.
Me never find a lo lo lo love like this,
That still make me think about my middle school kiss.
I sit here in this chair and I wish,
For you not to leave me now.
My friends they always told me
Not to make you my wifey,
Man they was puttin' you down.
And now they see we rollin',
Me and you we strollin',
They don't wanna come around.
Let me hear you say,
You're the only one that knows me,
Love it when you hold me,
I'll never find a love like this.
Let me hear you say
Now we'll never be lonely,
Look at whatcha showed me,
I'll never find a love like this.
When this life tried to keep us apart,
You keep callin' me back to your heart.
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me,
Wrap your world around me,
You'll never find a love like this.
Oh Never find a love like this
When this life tried to keep us apart,
You keep callin me back to your heart,
Let me hear you say,
Oh Never find a love like this.
Oh Never find a love like this
I never had a sister
That you didn't like
You had three ugly brothers
But still turned out all right, yeah
I never had a girlfriend
Longer than three months
You never had a boyfriend
But married on a hunch
So let's ride bikes into the sea
And catch a bus outside the reef
Drive so deep that we can't see a thing
So we have to get off
The bus driver laughs and he shakes his head
Says, "You're okay, I drive this route everyday"
You're uneasy and you say you're scared
And if I die at least you'll die too
I never had a sister
But you, you look swell
Wearing your matching shorts
As often as the mail comes
You look like Audrey Hepburn
When you get all dressed up
I have seen all your movies
'Cause Audrey's a stone fox
So let's ride bikes into the sea
And catch a bus outside the reef
Drive so deep where we can't see a thing
So we have to get off
The bus driver laughs and he shakes his head
Says, "You're okay, I drive this route everyday"
You're uneasy and you say you're scared
And if I die at least you'll die too
Another night out
Another girl on the scene
Tart with a heart
You know the kind I mean
Tell me why it is they all study art
Underage and overdressed
I can't tell them apart
This one other 'ere's got a little something else
All of daddy's money and she fancies herself
Says she's 21, she's probably 16
Got a dirty mouth
At least her teeth are clean
Jack from Tennese
Makes me think that every girl I see
Is my cup of tea
Fit for a fortnight
She ain't no good for me
Fit for a fortnight
Its such a shallow scene
Well I've got the same phrase
For any of the boys
Who line up girls
Like nothing for the choice
Come to the club girl, I'll get you on the list
I'll get myself a new one when I get you on the piss
Think we stand out from the clique
Think we're ooh so unique
But the clothes that we wear
Are getting mirrored everywhere
In the morning light
She will realise
That I'm not the kind of boy that she needs
Fit for a fortnight
That's what she said to me
Fit for a fortnight
Its such a shallow scene
Turns out that I'm not to her taste
Her fickleness was thrown back in my face
14 days since we first met
She's stopped replying to my texts
Only fools fall in love
She served up my heart on a plate
She said I passed myself by day
Guess it serves me right
For all my reckless nights
Calm has come to take me out on a date
Fit for a fortnight
That's what she said to me
Fit for a fortnight
Its such a shallow scene
Turns out that I'm not to her taste
Her fickleness was thrown back in my face
Fit for a fortnight
Fit for a fortnight
Fit for a fortnight
Fit for a fortnight
Fit for a fortnight
Well, she's not bleeding on the ballroom floor
Just for the attention
Because that's just ridiculously odd
Well, she sure is going to get it
Here's the setting
Fashion magazines line the walls now
The walls line the bullet holes
Have some composure
Where is your posture?
Oh, no, no
You're pulling the trigger
Pulling the trigger
All wrong
Have some composure
Where is your posture?
Oh, no, no
You're pulling the trigger
Pulling the trigger
All wrong
Give me envy, give me malice, give me your attention
Give me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break
When I say "Shotgun," you say "Wedding"
"Shotgun," "Wedding," "Shotgun," "Wedding"
She didn't choose this role
But she'll play it and make it sincere
So you cry, you cry
(Give me a break)
But they believe it from the tears
And the teeth right down to the blood
At her feet
Boys will be boys
Hiding in estrogen and wearing Aubergine Dreams
(Give me a break)
Have some composure
Where is your posture?
Oh, no, no
You're pulling the trigger
Pulling the trigger
All wrong
Come on this is screaming "photo op"
Come on, come on
This is screaming, this is screaming
This is screaming "photo op"
Boys will be boys, baby
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys, baby
Boys will be boys
Give me envy, give me malice, give me your attention
Give me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break
When I say "Shotgun," you say "Wedding"
"Shotgun," "Wedding," "Shotgun," "Wedding"
Boys will be boys
Hiding in estrogen and boys will be boys
Boys will be boys
Hiding in estrogen and wearing Aubergine Dreams
You ready Mase?
Party people
In the place to be (Uh huh)
It's about that time
For us to (Yeah, uh huh)
Yo, what you know about goin' out
Head west, red Lex, TV's all up in the headrest
Try and live it up
Ride true, a bigger truck
Peeps all glittered up
Stick up can, they go what?
Jig wit it 'cause ship crisp, split it all
Ho's ride, get your nut till I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I'd a hit everything, from Cancun to Grant's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall?
Hand on your balls
Lighting up drugs always fightin' in the club
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my French clothes
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, baguettes in my Rolls
Wreck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy the E, get a key, to the Lex to hold
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
Millions, the only thing we in a hurry to make
Are the friend that act's friend in a Lex or a Benz
Let's begin, bring this BS to an end
Come on
[1] - Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could
Ah ah
You can't understand we be Waikiki
Sippin' DP to the TV, look greedy
Little kids see me, way out in DC
With a Z3, chrome VB's, they wanna be me
Nigga's talkin' shit they ought to quit
I'm fortunate they don't see a fourth what I get
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Just stylishing cars 'cause they all true Nig'
So while you daydream my Mercedes gleam
And I deal with ho's that pose in Maybeline
One time you had it all I ain't mad at y'all
Now give me the catalog, I'll show you how daddy bought
Six cars and power to fire big stars
Sit up, CEO style, smokin' on cigars, nigga
It's like y'all be talkin' funny
I don't understand language of people with short money
Come on
(Repeat 1)
Ah ah
Do Mase got the ladies?
Do Puff drive Mercedes?
Take hits from the 80's?
But do it sound so crazy?
Well me personally, It's nothin' personal
I do what work for me, you do what work for you
And I dress with what I was blessed with
Never been arrested for nothin' domestic
And I chill the way you met me
With a jet ski attached to a SE
Smoke my Nestle, no mad rap-ass cat
Where my check be?
Problem with y'all I say it directly
Went from hard to sweet, starved to eat
From no hoes at shows to menage in suites
Now I be the cat that be hard to meet
Gettin' head from girls
That used to hardly speak
Come on
(Repeat 1 until fade)
Mase
Harlem World
Bad Boy
Goodfellaz baby
Yeah
And we won't stop
'Cause we can't stop
Mason Betha
Yeah
Owwwww, come on
I don't wanna work all night and day on writing songs that make the young girls cry
Or playing little solos on the keyboard so the kids will ask me how and why
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna elevate myself
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna elevate myself
And maybe for a little get to where I find it really hard to hate myself
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna elevate myself
I don't wanna stare at stacks of paper all the while while the world goes by
Tradin' out the weather for a clever lyric written by an Ikea light
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna elevate myself
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna elevate myself
And maybe for a little get to where I find it really hard to hate myself
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna get up off the shelf
And elevate myself
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
I don't wanna be a part of all the quality that falls apart these days
I'd rather make an honest sound and watch it fly around and then be on my way
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna elevate myself
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna elevate myself

Run along, run a long way to find a one
Find a one who could turn you on
Underneath a cloudless sun
I certainly hope that you are happy
With your new change of company
Surrounded by your enemies

I want to be I would be you see

I will turn you away as easily as I turned you into me

Any minute you will feel the chemistry
Vibrations in the brain can't ever be explained
Slip away and out of sight, feel the magnet of a night
The circus that you see is where you have to be
If I've seen it all before why's this bus taking me back again?
If I don't need anymore why's this bus taking me back again?
Feel the weight letting go, feel more lightness than you've ever known
You can't see when light's so strong, you can't see when light is gone
If I've seen it all before why's this bus taking me back again?
If I don't need anymore why's this bus taking me back again?
"Look at Twisterella, she hasn't got a fella"
To be the best, we got to pass the test
We gotta make it all the way
To the top of the mountain!
We can do it again!
To feel the high, we got to learn to fly
We got to take it to the sky
On the wings of an eagle!
You're the best in the world!
You are the best, but you say you don't know
You've got the touch, now come on let it show
You call the shots
But you know that you gots to believe in
The things that you dream in
Your search for the meanin'
Is very revealin'
The power of bein'
Is what you're feelin'
You gotta believe!
That you're simply the best!
I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And she's already workin' on my brain
I, I only looked in her eyes
But I picked up something I just can't explain
Man, I'm pickin' up
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's givin' me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Oom bop bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations
(Oom bop bop, excitations)
Good, good, good, good vibrations

Good, good, good, good vibrations

I, I bet I know what she's like
And I can feel how right she'd be for me
It's weird how she comes in so strong
And I wonder what she's pickin' up from me
And I'm pickin' up 
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
(Oom bop bop, good vibrations)
She's giving me the excitations

(Ahh)
(Ah, my, my, what elation)
I don't know where, but she sends me there
(Ah, my, my, what a sensation)
(Ah, my, my, what elations)
(Ah, my, my, what)
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her

Oh my God!
You can go out dancin'
And I'll write about you dancin' without you
And I'll shed a tear between my legs
When you were here I missed you
Now that you're away I'm out there without you
And I shed a tear between my legs
Though we live in the same city
You live in another state far away from me 
And all of my unfaded charms
But when the rocket ships all fall
And the bridges they all buckle
And everybody's packin' up their station wagons
There's a number you can call
Like a breast that you can suckle
And we quietly will exit as it all is happenin'
Again I'm afraid of one thing
Will I walk away from love knowing nothing
Wearin' my heart between my legs
But when I know you're naked
Lyin' on the bed while I'm at the piano
All I can say is I can't fake it
When the rocket ships all fall
And the bridges they all buckle
And everybody's packin' up their station wagons
There's a number you can call
Like a breast that you can suckle
And we quietly will exit as it all is happenin' again
'Cause there's a river runnin' underground
Underneath the town towards the sea
That only I know all about
On which from this city we can flee
There is a river running underground
Underneath the town towards the sea
That only I know all about
On which from this city we can flee
On which from this city we can flee
We can flee
Two scientists were racing for the good of all mankind
Both of them side by side so determined
Locked in heated battle for the cure that is their prize
But it's so dangerous but they're determined
Theirs is to win if it kills them
They're just humans with wives and children
Upwards to the vanguard where the pressure is too high
Under the microscope, hope against hope
Forging for the future but to sacrifice their lives
Both of them side by side so determined
Theirs is to win if it kills them
They're just humans with wives and children
Theirs is to win if it kills them
They're just humans with wives and children
You don't understand, you don't understand
What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be, but a twist of fate
Made it so you had to walk away
'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
Yeah, we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
(1, 2, 3)
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on
Baby be with me so happily
It's 4 AM, and I know that you're with him
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin
And if he feels my traces in your hair
I'm sorry love but I don't really care
'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
Yeah, we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
(1, 2, 3)
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on
Baby be with me so happily
So happily
(1, 2, 3, 4)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
We're on fire now
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
We're on fire now (We're on fire)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
We're on fire now
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on
Baby be with me so happily
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on
Baby be with me so happily
Hey Eugene do you remember me?
I'm that chick you danced with two times through the Rufus album Friday night at that party
On Avenue "A"
Where your skinhead friend passed out for several hours on the bathroom floor
And you told me
You weren't that drunk, and that I was your favorite Salsa dancer you had ever come across in New York city
Eugene
Eugene
Eugene
I said hello
Eugene
Are you there Eugene
Hey Eugene, then we kissed once we lugged your friend into the elevator and went to write my number on a soggy paper towel
And the car went down
And when we were finished making out we noticed that your skinhead friend was gone. Long gone.
And you looked into my bloodshot eyes and said is it too soon if I call you Sunday
Eugene
Eugene
Eugene
I said hello, Eugene
Are you there, Eugene
I said hello (hello), Eugene (Eugene)

I said hello (hello), Eugene
Are you there, Eugene (tell me are you there)

Eugene (Eugene)
Eugene (tell me oh)
I said hello (hello), Eugene (Eugene)
Does any of this ring a bell Eugene?
I was not looking for arty farty love
I wanted someone to love completely
Someone more than weekly
I was looking for a decent boy
For a tender glance, ohoho
For a safety dance, ohoho
The wuthering heights
And the stormy nights
You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
But I will give them all back to you
'Cause you're so ooh (Tootootoo), so ah (Tootootoo), so cool
You came like a thief in the night and stole my heart
Ooh, like a solitude erasure
Like an elevator
And I know we'd do anything for love (Oh yeah)
And it is you and me, ohoho
For all eternity, ohoho
The wuthering heights
And the stormy nights
You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
But I will give them all back to you
'Cause you're so ooh (Tootootoo), so ah (Tootootoo), so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)

And baby, baby, you're irresistible and I'm insatiable (Ooohooohooohooohooo)
Yeah, love is an ocean of sweet emotion (Sweet emotion)
You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
But I will give them all back to you

And this week the trend
Is not to wake up till 3PM
I picked the few conscious hours
That I chose to spend
And slept away the rest of them
And this week the trend
Was to crash and burn
And then return again
To practice the life
That I pretend
Provides enough to
Get me through the weekend
So I say
Give me a solution
And watch me run with it
And then you gave
You gave me a solution
What have I done with it
'Cause I was absolutely sure
I had it all figured out
Way back then
And now it's this minute,
This hour, this day
And this week the trend
Was to backstab
Every single one of my friends
And leave a voicemail message
Trying to make ammends
All while hoping things
Work out in the end
And this week the trend
Was to borrow all the strength
That you could lend
To keep my head above
The water and not descend
Back to where I said
I'd never go again
So I say
Give me a solution
And watch me run with it
And then you gave
You gave me a solution
What have I done with it
'Cause I was absolutely sure
I had it all figured out
Way back then
But after this day
It's this week
All over again
And I just want to
Get mugged at knifepoint
To get cut enough
To wake me up
'Cause I know that i
Don't want to die
Sitting around
Watching my life go by
And what we take from this
Is what we'll get
And we haven't quite
Figured it out just yet
Because all of us are
All too stuck
Strapped to a chair
Watching our lives blow up
Stuck watching our lives blow up
When I am fast asleep
I dream and see you floating high above me
And I awake at dawn
Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn
From on the bedroom floor
I watch you sailing far above the seashore
In deep Atlantic skies
You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise
Above the avenue
I search among the clouds trying to see you
But you are just a blur
In the sky when you parachute over the harbor
I can see
You above with the ocean around me
If I could only stay
Overhead in the airway
You sail through
Endless sky with the evening around you
When I'm out on the bay
You're aloft in the airway
When I'm alone at night
I dream you paint the stars against the twilight
Suspended in the air
I wish your silhouette would always stay there
When I am on the beach
I watch you held aloft way out of my reach
But I cannot take flight
Or float upon the air the way that you might
When I am in the sea
You gaze down from the sky trying to see me
But I am just a blur
Through the waves as I scuba dive below the harbor
The airway
You and I in the airway
Aloft in the airway
In love on the airway
I can see
You above with the ocean around me
If I could only stay
Overhead in the airway
You sail through
Endless sky with the evening around you
When I'm out on the bay
You're aloft in the airway
Some people call me the space cowboy
Some people call me the gangster of love, yeah
Some people walking round calling me Maurice
'Cause I speak of the pompitous of love
People talk about me, baby (People talk about me, bad to)
They say I'm doin' you wrong, (doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong)
Well, don't let that worry you baby (oh baby...)
'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home
(Everybody Singing Along)
'Cause I'm a picker
I'm a grinner
I'm a lover
And I'm a sinner
I play the music in the sun
I'm a joker
I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I give my lovin' on the run
You're the cutest thing
That I ever did see
I really love your peaches
I want to shake your tree
Lovey-dovey, dovey-lovey, dovey all the time
Ooh-eee baby, I'm gonna show you a good time babe
'Cause I'm a picker
I'm a grinner
I'm a lover
And I'm a sinner
I play the music in the sun
I'm a joker
I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I sure don't want to hurt no one
Come on and follow me
You know I really want you for your company
Even though I'm attached to you physically
My computer mechanism wants you mentally
(Shoo be doo be doo shoo be)
You know I really want you for your company
(Shoo be doo be doo doo be)
'Cause I'm a picker
I'm a grinner
I'm a lover
And I'm a sinner
I play the music in the sun
I'm a joker
I'm a smoker
An I'm a midnight toker
I give my lovin' on the run
There doesn't have to be a reason
There doesn't have to be a why
And any moment could be magical
It could be this night
You've got an energy
Burnin' like I've never seen
Bringing me to life
And I
Can't beat the feeling
That I get
When I'm
With you
My heart plays a rhythm in my head
I can't help
But move
Two people synchronized
It's like a power
Brings you closer
Right inside and
I can't beat the feeling
That I get
When I'm
With you
Feel the force of the reaction
Let it take you on a ride
And all resistance is illogical
When your love slides
We got an energy
Fast revolving 'round our feet
Bringin' us to life
And I
Can't beat the feeling
That I get
When I'm
With you
My heart plays a rhythm in my head
I can't help
But move
Two people synchronized
It's like a power
Brings you closer
Right inside and
I can't beat the feeling
That I get
When I'm
With you
We've got an energy
We've got an energy
We've got an energy
We've got an energy
We've got an energy
(We've got an energy)
(We've got an energy)
(We've got an energy, energy, energy...)
We've got an energy
