Out in another under tow
Never ending war 
So I suggested she move out fast and not be the last
Not like when I was young
But I'm flesh and I tear
huoneeseeni lentamaan
In order to see it
Now through the lines of the cheap Venetian blinds
To the huge illside
Go, don't stay, you know, you know that it will be all right
I be the new generation of slaves
But it s worth it I love the thrill
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
But she doesn't love you
The mightiness of trees  that you can feel
I number yourself among them
Oh I really know
Alabama freezes, 
I'll let you win I won't even put up a fight
Close your eyes
Come into the light ������
But you came here with my best friend Jim
Into darkness from an empty room
Leading us forward where destiny may be
I'll show you what you want to hear
There's trembling and there's desire
I'm in a passionate study
Who will know
No I'm not in love
Stranded in a snowstorm in a town that you forgot
And I don't think that you know
Soon you'll wandering away your fears
And the scene was done
Baby why stop and cling, to some fading thing 
Please just let us go insane
Red, blue and yellowgreen I love you
With the ripples and their stories
Where I see the sleepiness creeping
So much longer wind on the phone
A carnation, 
And I don't think I need much more than that
All in one breath
When you lose everything you ever knew
But it's just not there, fair
Young hearts will still be clean
A Hiding place beneath blue skies
So in the name of her lord let's do what we shouldn't some more
And we both love rain
Especially when I 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
On your skin, on your skin
She said that she was leaving home
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
Many who think they better and they'll walk right past ya
Well I know how you need your sleep,
Across my neck
di amarti subito un po
No one, no one, no one has won the race
I'll let you know
Every rose has its thorn
The street lamps
It's just a matter of time
So look down to the street below 
I got dirty habits like a nun in a pig pen
Everything she does is beautiful
They say that all in love is fair
Who kissed the neck of a pretty woman named Grace
Your loneliness says, that you've sinned
Are the wonders of my world
Back in the days, I'm the clown prince
Punchdrunk, snowblind, as though the whole thing were a bad dream
Into the stars
No ending No ending
The albatross flies to the stern
Shimmering fields of gold
Each time we start to speak
This book will take a lifetime
Breaking at the edge of day
It was a lovely day
And if we turn around can we ever get back
Lost highway way too fast
Heat gives way to sweat My body's soaking wet We slide and slip From hip to lip
Rise from the slough of despond, find the pathway
But it's gone just for a minute,
I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days
That turned love into hate 
hakki, se tyhja on, vartijaton
Like the first time I saw KRS live, rockin' it
It's fleeting like light from a room
Always running away and running back
Should've listened when you said beware
When I lose every time I win, 'cause
Then he can come back to me
I don't know if they saw that
First time you feel it  it might make you sad
We could live together
A teen age lover who said
Whatever happened to strength in numbers uh
Your ideals, I find amusing
And knowing we are not alone in fear
Was good for a while 
Sometimes I get so tickled I can't talk
Even risking our hearts
Is there somewhere we can go
Gotta fall with a clear head does it make you cry 
I can sway
Lying and cheating
I could remember from way back in the day
You look around 
And things go fast
I'm just tryin'  get U  think about doin' things
That sound when
You know the kind that I like
From Peru to Cebu, feel the power of Babylon
Overcome and flay all fears
And no matter, how long I try to get it
Long search is over, the soul is uncovered
Fiberglass funny face up on the wall
'Cause it don't matter to the moon
You just made new friends
I didn't mean to hurt you
High on the moonshine bodies entwine 
I still need a quiet place to go
I can get you out of your body
Royal is royal in thy xenoscene
Neither real nor pretend
Anna Rose it's time to dream
Staring at you in the moonlight
It's a case of cruel to be kind
And let your hair down
I turn around to talk
It was about six am
She brought me a fever
Dream of sleep take troubles far away from me
With rivers of sun glow just beyond the plateau
It's the season of bowing our heads in the wind
He was standing
Out in somebody's bed
A fallen angel
To one safe place
While you're away
E quando eu me considerava limpo
Because you and I
It's time  send your company home and turn off your cell phone
The sun sets
She curls herself up, rests her head on the window
These shins are cracked and splintered 
Oh, you are so pretty
But you'll see, don't say I didn't warn you
When the good will come out 
What are you about
My niggas love when they bust bust, they steady buck and you duck duck
Oh and when you're gone
"Glaubst du denn wirklich, fur solchen Frevel ich der Lohn
Like I bleed but wait
'Cause it ain't gonna stop the world no
I say what's wrong and all along
Everything This is the beating of the clock 
Og eg f�� blo��nasir En eg stend alltaf upp
Footsteps on the ocean bed
All those pictures float there happy just for a little while
One day you'll just up and quit
Chasing stardust
Yo, it kinda make me think of way back when
Never be mean to ya
Kontrahenten schlagen sich, mit Worten sie sich reizen
You took my hand
Be happy my love
Tears the seal
So this is over and out, this is goodbye
When you look down
Something longs to grow  won't let go
And all I pray
Dry your eyes, face the dawn
I'm the one who gets the run around
I'm doing this for another ten years
It's a pattern as old as it gets
Washed away the empty space inbetween my ears
Their hands are never steady
Honey come a little closer now
Ridin' with my trues, humbly united gathering souls
Girl who will stay and won't play games behind me
Your eyes held a tender light
Broken sky, heartaches that flowers won't mend
And I'll be singing a song
Don't say a word, don't say anything
She drove herself around the block
Reach out and hitch a ride and float on by
And you're a fool to satisfy
Inside the hurricane her mind gets blown
She's taking a sick day soon
Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same
But now in a parking lot in Washington
The fat secretary, the lunchtime lover
We have no time for another song
In new days to remember, always and forever
Seattle  you've got to love the rain
The last rose of summer
Her moon
That some of you don't understand
I get so sick of the telephone
About the end of the world
I should take a good advice
One for it, one for out the grave
But I need you to make that change
And stand in sunlight
Quiet down
Shadows of night disappear
Drift on, mm hmm stay strong,
Murder all around the whole world is nauseatin'
To let the temperature from the very heart of the sun
Each day's the same
Can you make this last
I can't remember half an hour since a quarter to four
I was dealt from the bottom and pulled a flush
Deep inside of me  I know there's got to be
The next night he's over and over and under
My throat hurts, I think I should stay in bed
It takes you further every time
I can't stop laughing, can't stop laughing
The way you hold me
I can't tell you what you already know 
So much work
And threw me down upon my back
It's a fitting end for where this began
Time you start to grab your pride
If his mother said Ted be good, he would 
Take a picture of everyone
That I wanna get you satisfied, oh yeah Satisfied
Empower myself and be my own authority
Like remind my soul remind my soul, yeah
Wherever you hear  the wind in the canyon 
Cause you reached in your pocket
Give me another waking moment
The sunset heavy
Red walls looking for distraction
I'm too scared to move
'Cause when I ride
What will we find inside of the wreck
Way back, yeah
The wallpaper's peeling
There's no real letter to write,
God makes the man
Why keep a poor man alive in a job he hates
The parts of me
We are like birds of a feather 
I won't fight it
Sunday night is long and cold
Now what'll I do living alone
She's my oblivion  it's to her I run 
Liggligg my tired one, rura sleeping one
As she smiled her golden tooth glinted in the light,
Those are the soaring kind
She said it feels so good to me
Surrounded by dry clouds
Let it push us apart if we wish to stay
When the rain had left the sky
From the sea, from the sea
You've got to tolerate
You got here too late, it's often so
It's just life
Your smile is just a careless yawn
But this hope that sorrow bleeds
Or maybe that's me
There's just no mercy in your eyes
In the dream, oh yes I do
Woman Singing
And the light rains down
I remember too
There's nothing new that I could tell to you
Today I saw the strangest thing
Who will hang his head
I agree with what the dread had to get off of his chest
How deep down, my love will go
Thinks up ways to make the day go faster
Like it did me
No, leave on the light
Of what life can bring to us
And the greeneyed goddess got ready for all out war
Taking good care of you 
I'm on my way looking up today
I don't know how they got there but I'm sure it's the fuckers in their ships
Save the work till the afternoon
No one crosses the street that way
Escape to the water
Your kisses are now so blase
That there's gold in them hills
Couldn't sleep
You can try to pretend nothing's wrong
Yeah, c'mon
All along the white line
We missed 'cause we were running late
Of the time we were great before the self hate
Astride my horny horn
It's all I know
Come on come on come on yeah
Well I'm cruisin' El Paseo
Stay with me, baby, and we'll make it to
I have a dream, no I have a wish
And make this song complete
The whole scenery reminding me I should rhyme
And be carried from here
Balloons down below blooming colors of the rainbow
And it hurts to hear you feel
And you love to let me down
Every other time your head looks down
The danger of love
Something's going to break on the inside 
The cars come and go
I know you love me, if it starts to sting
I'm losing sight and hold of home
I need your loving every day and night
In an old order hush
Many have followed the footsteps you're on
Everytime I hear the strum
So, next time that I see you in school
Going on  we've got it going on
Ich sah die Gesten, ich fand die Briefe, sah den Kuss
And swallowing your dirt
Zeit versucht zu trosten
While you write you trials of life,
And I'll keep on reminding me
And all that was holy just slowly disappeared
Exploding outward
And I want a leather jacket
'Cause I'm about  get openhearted
Cast on the covers of your bed
I don't remember how
And this machine won't stop
You're not exactly what I'm looking for
And all I heard were sighs from that shotgun
And besides it would still be all right
And I'm backing through the open doorway
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
Darling you let me know
And we'll race to the bottom of the glass
I know that you try but
I don't need anyone else
Listen to records in my room to escape
Just show me how to love you
Forever after
A cidade sutilmente estremeceu
Have you ever felt like you were dyin'
Bad dreams are nothing special
Don't you know this government ain't vote for me and you
Common
You'll never be defeated if you fight with might and hope"
From the future that's here
And I said mercy me be patient please
As you died in the night
You got burnt
Still she takes me back
And we'll do as you command,
Just then the stripper stopped in a coughing fit
Wish I could conjure up the shoots and ladders to bring me back
And I can't stand it, but I'm all right
And just to be with you, I've done everything
Of my living room
One minute right beside me, another you're a thousand miles away
I see your breath in the air, it's shaped like words
The taste of cold steel on my lips, and a second later silence fills the January air
Ga nu, jag vill att du ger dig av
And stood still beside eternal flame
You will travel a thousand miles without leaving my sight
Ah, is just what I need
Faced down you can see the ground turn
We knew we wouldn't last
But not fast, fun filled with laughs
Tell me you always go before me
Wake me up in time for California
And round
Left to cry out in the rain
All I hear is what's playing through the in flight radio
With you tonight
With our heads above the waves
A babushka and bare feet
Life did the rest
Well I'll comb my hair like Elvis
The twilight leaning
Everybody wanna know what's goin' on with the Thuggish Ruggish
You'll learn one day, won't you
My brain's in a swirl over you
Rickshaw, disco, goodnight kiss
Let the wind blow through your heart
Won't cry, won't cry, ooh no
And became another sun
Ja ich hab' alles, was ich brauch', was ich nicht hab', hab' ich auch ich hab' 'ne scharfe Braut, immer Gras zuhaus' und morgens schlaf' ich aus DJs legen unsere Platten auf, und in Magazinen steht meistens sowas wie "Der Topf, der hat es drauf" Und wenn's um Burner geht, ich nehm' gerade ein' auf Und wenn's mir dreckig geht  nehm' ich 'n Bad im Applaus Und wenn's nicht besser wird, bin ich oft tagelang blau, high wie'n Astronaut und's stort gar keine Sau Ich dachte, mein Job am Mikrofon bleibt kohlema��ig fur'n Arsch, vom Geld her wird's sich niemals lohn' Ich dacht' nur Schrott wie Dieter Bohlen geht in Deutschland in die Charts, doch heute sind wir large Wir haben Freigetranke bis zur Invasion, Videobeamer, Studio und Spielkonsolen, immer'n Auge auf die Anderen wie beim Turspion und machen weiter wie gewohnt Nehmen Beats und flown bis der Schei�� hei�� ist wie gluhende Kohlen Und weil's zur Zeit so geil ist, fuhl' ich mich wohl
I will toil for years and years
I love you more than you could know
Show me your kind love
He moved around and we kept
The whole world endin' up the buck buck, pow
Well, I've never climbed the highest mountain
Pick up the receiver
That's one of my worst fears
New tears to cry
That day in November
Mommy don't worry now Teddy boy's here 
You say that I'm your beautiful
I number myself among them
You want me, all to yourself; you've got me now
The veiled mist reveals the wandering ship upon the reef
'Cause the fortune teller didn't talk about stars
She poisoned me like a virus
Like, don't covet your neighbour but watch him closely
Ein leichtes leises Sauseln
Is it your voice that is too weak
That way we can fuck and watch TV
But every time I try it it won't turn for me
Or just appeared in parking lots of truck stops
The furthest star
Pouring down your gaping mouth
Sometimes perfection can be
I'll always side with you
Through the windows in the fading day
Like the whispering wind you sent to me
I can't get off
And here is the man pushing paper past her
Cowboy boots
Buried beneath his haunted memories
You're smart and kind and easy on my eyes
Sitting on the sidewalk
Sounds of white  people
Watch who's knocking on your front door
Wenn Du alles verlassen hast, 
Law as well spit in the eye
Like when my parents first split up
I will watch the sky come following me
I was but a sad breath
dentro questo sogno da buttare via
Don't try to get close to
All night
Anna Rose dream well tonight
With lonely gauze and lace
You need to send it to me again
Playing your games with your innocent eyes,
As you walked away
My pulse is racing while 
Father your failures are so grave,
Of feeling the full weight of our burdens
Lord let Your blessings begin
How to reach your love ooh yeah
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
And that's the only thing that we have in common
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Though our troubles seem like mountains
On your skin
You're the one who made my dreams come true
I'm willing to try to forgive and forget this thing
I take my pills, the babies cry
That they'd forget you too
You say you have forgotten me
They don't know nothing about love
Sunny day no one is here
So come closer
We're all on the same side 
Seven percent own eighty four percent of all the wealth on earth
Just say it
My nigga let me hit it, niggas we thuggin' immortalized, let's get high
You know it's true
If you'd ever unwind
Blurry lines between love and sin
Crimes committed are unintentional
It's mine and yours, let's guard the block
Finger sudden legacies
Now I could make this obvious,
My forever silhouette
Fear makes us critical
But for tonight forget it
ich spur' ihr Zaudern, und sie des Nachts sich mir entzieht
Round and round 
And you stagger in headwind all day
I've got my things
And we'd see the new sun rising
Don't turn on the lights
Chandeliers and seizures
And I'll roam for every more,
The candle wax of melted dreams
Just don't blow this motherfucker up
Let's get two more beers and try to make a plan
'Cause my rent's always a month late
I examine my heart
All the things you say get back at you
Here come the darkest birds
And I love to tie you up
When she left her home
I raise a black fist but won't say nigga in the things I write
He's just a friend
She needs something
Deine Augen nicht feucht sind
What do I know Oh
When the white eagle of the North is flying overhead
As a younger child
For my love is like the wind
lauf' nicht fort Ich werd' nicht kommen, dich zu schonen 
I never had a clue
Every time you say a word
Your secrets are spilling from your mouth
They're making heroes out of fall guys
The universe
And tell the whole story to an answering machine
It has never been done
Washed out of season
Everything This is the slowrush hour 
It's funny how life is seldom what you plan
What are we fighting for
If I could have one wish
We've found ourselves back where we started from
Why everybody actin' agitated
Or talk on the phone all night
Because they're already numb from damage already done
To lie around
Who's going the right way down a wrong way street
I don't need anyone else
I ain't talkin' 'bout nothin' physical
Whipping at the tune
I said I don't think you know what your missing
Knew what I was doing
King size, passenger size
And disarray your every stone
You know last night, remember when I tried to choke you
At the tips of our feet where the waves stun the rocks,
To see my songs can be retold
Clear and serene in the love I've discovered
And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind
Even when we are apart
Now there's kids to tend
The headlights all sparkled, blending into the sky above
My brain's in a swirl over you 
You look at me so slyly 
Swim a lil' bit, dance when we back on land
Lookin' for cheese, that don't make her a hood rat
Yes, I gave my life away, yeah
And you bent down on your knee and picked an apple from the ground
But I know they're just memories
Where does this story go
Here forever in your loving flame
Head out of sight
They won't help me now
It's funny when it's not funny at all
Your body's sending questions to answers,
Raisin' hustlers, thieves, and prostitutes
Don't get offended by the rubbish that we pump in the street
Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way
And as we watched for Christmas ghosts
And neither sin nor evil
Honey, I want it my way
A little girl, he gave
On you I can depend, yeah, yeah
I know it feels good, that's why we shouldn't tonight
Now I cry but I can't complain
Sein Versagen nicht langer Uberzeugung zu nennen
Where time begins to fade
How many dreams you've chased
Just to be with you, I'd give anything
And then love pulled out the heavy artillery
But you force yourself to look away
Yeah they change
To know you're with me
Special, sidewinder track through sand
Come back to the air 
Would you lie with me and just forget the world
I've been pushed far aside
From a compound, to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom
Oh, I want you
Put some hope in the bottom of the box for me
There's nothing to stand on
A fire comes and you can't strike back
I'm not so strong out of my shoes
All your lies were sweet like a childs
Are we too selfish to even bless the kids with jewels
As in the fairytales
I'm starting again,
Well, I've been where you're hanging
Run down the beach kicking clouds of sand
Sleep makes you possible
To help and humankind me
So gentle the sea breeze,
Das ist, was wir kennen
I can't go out and I can't stay in
You text me back but hold on
'Cause we found ourselves in the sea
Spill it all and hope you find a way to make it through it
Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never seen
How many dreams we've chased
Till I'm nothing more than
Crazy people know a special place to go when the pressure's on
We will always have Zack Rice 
End up in the closing time choirs
I'll give 'em back to you
Cause this is meant to be
Now we are one, I'm not afraid
Put some home in the bottom of the box
I want this
She's quite content to sit there listening to what he says,
We're traveling with spiders legs
And lovers wait patiently
And everything was orange
A mind full of cheering lies
View from another land
I'm digging holes, into my heart, trying to find the very end
This old world just keeps spinning round, spinning round
Traveling caravans left me enchanted
Some other purpose for stayin' in touch
I watched your dreams all slip away
I write this moment down, 
You will have to fight alone 
That you can not love me anymore
And we swam the evening away
And she's taking her time
And each one of course is
Where was I when you lost all your dreams
How could it be that it was
Back to work, just like you said
and him disrespectin women so him disrespect himself"
We could be we should be in love
There'll be blue skies, there'll be true love
Everything 
I'd always let you get your way
They are not departed or gone
There's just no mercy in your eyes, child
And I'll let you know, yeah
There's little more for us to say
To where the story ends
You're the measure of my dreams
All things to me
I don't want to lose you
And I'll go oustide
Along the way the colors ran
Eleven stories up
Monday morning
Looking for a ride in and out of town,
And like a fool I believed myself
But the neon's 
And after he's finished, she lies there and wonders
Woo the sleeping one, r' the crying one
But in my heart I knew I
It was a rainy day
If you don't believe
We've laughed too loud, and woke up everyone
Laid him six feet under the clay
"Make It Up" We can make it
And half the time half my crew could drink the bar
The day is turning to night
And young children play;
Ain't a region on water
And if she feels like dancing, no one will know it
We fall
End of story
Something to jock, but it wasn't no thing
That a love like yours is hard to find
You've changed
Such a wide, wide chasm of faith to leap
You'll get by
You could be the one to chase my blues away
A million miles away
'Cause, see, boys they have a tendency of running from me
Come inside
Alone in Miami
Comforts me and shows me
We move in circles day to day
Oh, I know we shouldn't take sides
Ten thousand miles away
Wild, embroiled, young hearts depend on me
That a good thing is hard to find
With wise men and tramps,
Oh, It's been getting me down
I don't wanna rush you now
That's just life
I feel as we're drowning in the deepest sea
But I walked the hill of Calvary
Past the women and the men
We said to us from our families
Better we can bring it on up, we can
She said, "I see you cannot speak
The place was all crowded but
Everyone except me
And I wanted so desperately to say
Permita que eu possa adormecer
Help the needy and show them the way
I don't wanna wait for
I follow to the edge of the earth and fall off
Bring up praise from Mecca, make a phrase for the better
Well I'm here till close with fingers crossed
Throw all on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
Out past the forest where the Saint Lawrence lies
Wait for the tone
He was a charmer
I followed them down to the well
I bend to your shape
When it comes, just when it comes
It ain't no stoppin' us now, 'cause we can prove this shit
Your love makes me see things so clearly
Is a wind that has lasted
It's a monumental big screen kiss
But the shit didn't clear
Hidden in a lonely place
Never growing old
Sail away, sail away, sail away
I'm just a painful reminder
I bet Harriet Tubman would be turnin in her grave
To know that this is
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
You won't know 
Come to witness spring's new hope, born of leaves decaying
This is goodbye
A bright young thing
They almost didn't find her,
He said, "respect me, not seen that around here yet,
As we stand together on this hill
That sparkle in your eyes has gone
We climbed up a latter that leaned against the hay
Well I guess you feel the same way too
Sun dappling through clear water
Your hair is a strawflower that sings in the sun
So punch drunk they don't understand at all
Took a while but you hittin' me back
The rd time I saw you
Live handinhand and together we'll stand on the threshold of a dream
The water's rising
Cause maybe my mom's right,
To cover your lips 
Thinking about letters, lights and lamps
And me and all of the people with nothing to do
And leaves from my fingertips, unfurl
Ich sah euch tanzen, ihren Blick wenn sie dich sieht
This is a place where young lovers meet
I knelt by the water like a doe by a stream
Has broken your wings
I was strummin' the guitar
Would you wanna see a movie with me
Don't need money, don't take fame
A model beauty
'Cause I'm as dead as you
Goodbye yesterday and goodbye me
One bone and blood mass we fuse
But you're still waiting on the moment breath is bated
Oh wild is the wind
Our minds
We can be together then
I surrender
We still have a while to go
Tender dreams, shadows fall
Crack the seals of last year's arguments they don't hold a candle to the one
Yeah, that's awful close but that's not why
Titties representing the city that I grew up in
Still born again into golden dreams,
Somewhere that we could speak
How the son has gone to seed
The fault to each our families
We're on the top of the world
One phone call, my world alone
Way much harder to stay clear
Tin soldiers playing our tune 
My brother under the sun
Got a head full of you
Here across your face
Speed kills, but beauty lives forever
And start the healing 
Teddy turned and ran 
We run along easy at periscope depth
So little knowledge known to me
Let it shine all around them
There's room at the bar
Laughter and crying 
I was properly insane
For ever
Like broken glass, we damage
You know what's in the water that you drink
Deafened by the sound
But I'm not afraid of all that space
If it should rain, we'll let it
And when you come to see me, 
So don't lose faith
"You've never really known
Oh, sing me to sleep
But it was useless to see it without you around
Sees her face in the trees suspended in limbo
It sure helps if you can see the funny side
Ooh, you know you rock my world and
From the days of the slave choppers, to the new age of prophets
Kisses on my forehead we can fall into it
You will ride the lights alone 
And I'll begin again tonight
Knowin' not a thing can change with me, singin'
And let the children sing
I'll let you know I'll let you know
I look at the clock and I'm feeling the rhythm of love
If the waters cool, I might just swim
I know you fight against the shadows
And he new he could 
And deep within the earth you heard the sound
Do they intrude upon your private reveries
Show me that secret light
As new life will come from death, love will come at leisure
You say my name each time you cough
And act like a man
But it made her sad and she cry, oh my 
You were beside me all around
We looked out across the long horizon
I never can tell what's inside me
It's so rare she ever sees him,
Seattle  I want you just the same
I don't have a real reason why
Now if we wait and do nothing
A doctor or a lawyer man
Half Bboy, half Zboy, the street lights watch
But that was years ago
And love lies dying all on the ground
Please bring me down
I'm still in love
Tell them, tell them I always knew why
Before this sleep in the oceans
Bring us some food and some bullshit TV
Like the fear of unskilled labor in the nuclear family 
As the night begins
And decapitate a rodent or a mouse
It's a lie in the end, you only satisfy your friends
You're a rainbow
Decoding you has proved the hardest thing
When the music's over now
Or will they get programmed how to behave
But the rhythm of their steps is like a heartbeat
Write with my right, bat with my left hand
Now I can't work out what I'm supposed to do
A ghost of a roar, from the dry floor
You be boy and I'll be girl and
You just had a new guy
And the hope I had is dying
Going back in some time
Answers come when we don't want to hear
But it might just save your life
Give me more than one caress
I make no noise
I see that your imagination knows no bounds
Around the world we say make a beter day
I know the world is upside down is upside down
Behind the waterfall, that's where your lost loves have all gone
I gave my life away
Change a heart to a little white dove
Let it rain now
Deflowering my baby, are you my baby mate
Cause nothing blows in the faraway
I am your brother  under the sun 
"You better hang on to your benchseat
Through her eyes 
I've been losing so much time
In my mind
So who are we to worry at any rate
You've got to believe it
The faded pictures
Now belonging to the past
She's gonna keep you inside
Desire is burning me inside out
I may already know
And I've waited, forever, to know
As free as a bird in the trees
You couldn't make it
They are
So meaningless it seems absurd
No navigation system Beyond our eyes
There's something that I wanna say
The water was clear
Will you make a smoother landing
There is a world to go through  but there's so much more to do
I'm writing the words to this song with a poison pen
Jeste handlarzem, co jab��ko z robakiem
Till I fall
I promise to tread more lightly
Can you see the light 
Where the moon was coming up, and I knew that's all there was
It doesn't matter what you see
As she's tossing a dime
And their hearts will broken if you can't decide between them
The freedom will ease your pain
We damage our pasts with romance and hatred,
And when the curtains close, open up the door
Revolves around 
Standing up against the light on the TV
Live a lil' love
We've drunk too much, and woke up everyone
I could feel that you were gone
No one, no one, no one has won the war"
She counts the clouds for hours
Oh, at least put some hope in the bottom of the box
She gonna make youy stay 'round
A lovely day eh
And I lay you to rest
Drank all the orange juice
You're still so young
That could understand
There's someone like you
It's a wind that will keep on
I don't know how they got there but I have a plan now
That turns ivory into kerosene
There will be tomorrow
Wonder if it's still in safe hands
Is there something I should know, my love
For the whisky I had drunk
How much I love to be with you
If love is a danger, should we avoid it
For we're like creatures of the wind
And that's real gay, so keep your eye on the ball
I know I'm prone to rushing 
Anyway
The th time I saw you
A disagreement used to be a speed bump on a highway going eighty
Someone is lost outside,
The parts of you
And I love to share the cost
You don't have the time for a long flirtation 
Like snowflake crystal
Her tenament yo, is rat infested
Makes the power the danger of love
We can make it beter
All the things I say
I don't know why
And the day has barely begun
She is working to earn her own dollar
These squinting eyes just sting me 
You know it's taken a long time to realize
The last time I saw you
Leave worldly things behind
Yet all we think is I'm gone lead us
If you need sometime to think
And the whole mass was ran under one master plan
And everything you want you don't have
Their rhymes are designed to dis us, but why dis us
It feels as black as the thoughts I had
Lifeline
Just like it did poor me 
I scream out into the mouth,
Out on the boundary  she smiles 
Another part of another ritual
I'm fake to all these hardcase kids
I like the way you talk
Oil is the spice to make a man, forget man's wealth
On the strand of pure silver,
I remember all the summer days
I've been steady pulling for you
I may be wrong, I thought we said
Oh yes, I would give my life away
I want you inside out
Nape of his neck
Set your clock by your heart
I blow 'em through battlezones with chrome for chaperone
The songs of twilight
I can feel the air redesign my hair,
I met him when I was a
Snowflakes falling
And no matter how this ends
I can't believe I said that out loud
Power of love will keeps you home at night
Now I breathe on
You just can't keep gnashing your teeth forever
Ga nu, glom bort det som sagts ikvall
This is the end, my friend
You're just the kind of kid I could grow old with
And laughing at the voice on the crackling radio station
I hope I get old before I die
I thought we graduated back in the saddle
And this would help
The earth and the stars
Oh my you look awful
And I'll sail till morning
"The edges of our love are in the stars" choir 
Would you still feel the same
Songs for life's lost lovers 
Will you carry all my weakness,
You're not the anges I once knew
The wind that will bring me
And now I'm tied tighter than the races
Baby you're no train, you're the silence behind
Sometimes elections depend on the absentees
The fire was all that was left
You took the train with heavy tickets
I do not love you anymore
Everybody hatin' everybody overrated
Son, won't you come along
I love you
I followed a sound
So it's goodbye Saturday and hello week
And it's always in fun
Like used software
When there are clouds in the sky
May you never change
No, I have no desire 
If I wait for long enough
Cursing the wealthy
If the waters cool I might just swim,
Than what I can't do 
Zag��usza mnie znow miejski gwar, czytaj z ust
Home to the home where we all sleep alone
'Cause when she's flying around
I was in the desert waving planes and burning phone books
So as cold night fades into darkness
To leave and be free
All steady hot beers, sorrowful monkeys
All for the love of Raymond
�� one two 
Above the bar the TVs are showing the game
The sunshine of my life's been burned 
We laid the path so you got a way in
Got some wood and a knife
But you can raise a sinner
Text me but you need a call
With ginseng and fresh squeezed juice
And you said the truth's like corn and lies are like weeds
Feels like I'm strounded in an ocean of grave uncertainty
'Cause you see I require love that's made of fire
The danger of love Drive me crazy
Think I should stay in bed today
I've got your words in me
Gives yourself away
You and I have the rest of our lives to see
Making this shit actually happen
All I know is that we need us
Or at least put some hope oooh, put me on top
Round and round and round 
I get eaten by the worms and weird fishes
Now it's looking like a dream shot down
The everbeating heart that it wasn't
So darling don't cry
Carry on, when I'm gone
Pulling the weeds from the ground
And what we had has come undone
The gingerlady by my bed
Feel free to kiss me on the cheek even though I'd
Other Voice garbled I just wanted to call to say hi, and um, I think I might bring Marissa and Tracy up to Topeka garbled
And I think I been gettin' better every passin' day
Sometimes it feels as though I have a key
Let down your bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
It shines onto us tonight 
But I don't mind
Wie man fruher einmal war
And shower in the deep
I'm learning to live with the guilt of remembering
And I would give my life away, yeah
Carrying words as strangers exchange pleasantries
Three in the morning closing in
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieu, ooh
Hopefully new york city will lose you
In touch through his friend Mike
I stay clever, long as the planet stay together
We'd see the blessings in disguise
You start to trust the things that deeper comfort brings,
And all you have is gone 
We broke up and got back together
You don't remember but I was there
Won't remember, won't be asking
I get on the bus
Go down the backroads 
I'm still searching for what you can give,
So come inside my room tonight
None of my men were down in the fight
I drift away in a sunken state
If I can get him outta the streets
Should have known there was no escape
Brings you back to see the lights
It ain't so easy to love you true account of all the rattlesnakes and all that makes you blue
Undo the locks and throw away the keys
Then she got lost
And I know that you don't realize how much that I give you
First time that I ever saw you
But you're a bird in a cage 
Didn't you know
Wide awake
And she knows that she loves him, but does he love her
But your voice was full of hope
Give them shelter from the storm
And among the schemes
For the first time in your life you're coming home
You supposed to fight for freedom not just the end of slavery
We can have a good time
Your eyes couldn't hide
Unsung unseen
There is a long way to go  there is a high place to know
Leave us in emotional peace, take a walk, taste the rest
I couldn't want you
When you called my name
So went the dream of the drowned submariner
But behind something hides
I had a dream  that we flew on golden wings 
But it was my dream to kick flows to put my people on another level
And the things that she cares
Then something good just might come crashing
In all the things they have that we don't
I have held my arms gracefully from my side
And I been tryin' to play the cowboy to rustle in the dough
Before we're thrown back in the wheel
Coney Island beaches, 
Wedding rings and children
In a cryogenic freeze
I start to feel the pain again
Don't take it too slow 
And the crosstown horns
There's something everybody knows
I mean every word
My mind was on other things
Deep under water
You see I feel so heavy without you
There's no more to say to let you know it's alright
In orbit
Evidence
All you have left is hanging on you
Look at the skies up 
Why should I stay
Think of me before I'm gone
Shine down on another day
Times are hard, spirits weak
She still counts the minutes that I am not there
And we will be as one god
And I stepped into your arms
Can you hear my voice break
An ear pinned down on your chest
Cause it's only black and white and not a lot of each
But back home I hope she knows how much I care
Messin' up stuff and doin' things wrong
Where all new wonders will appear
Don't stop don't stop
Hold your breath, dear 
Out through the window of the day
I wanna be as big
Getting back up seems impossibly grand
But yet, like a lil free Red Corevette
From down in the vault, down in the grave
Back slapping drinkers cheer the heavyweight brawl
Remember spending all those winter nights
You're my sweetness, my baby, my love for all time
And breath in all that's Autumn,
Yeah, everybody leaves if they get the chance
Past borders with waters as clear as your glass, so
Maybe you could getaway
Is like a drive in movie screen that is pressed against the sky
Thought she roll with bad boys forever in many ways
'Cause I cannot paint pictures with my tongue
Let me get my David Bowie on real quick, check it
Do you ever look at me and see another man
Fuck it; no MC can ever better me no one man
I'm a cabaret, a champaign cafe
When it feels like fear
Living in the piece of ever after
I've got glass eyes that have dined
Save me from the movies and someone else's dreams
We done changed the world world, ghetto voices bein' heard and felt
We're all becoming one again
Are the wonders now
Take me down to where you think I belong
I'll see you some other time
I'll welcome each day,
Let me reach, let me beach far beyond the Yellow Sea
Makes a one man weep, and another man sing
So tell yourself again that help is on the way
With those blocks, the ones that you see through
Think your on Pressure's level Only thing tight bro
To the ground
Our love's never coming back
You don't have to walk alone
If your not in my life
Waltzing Matilda, Carey loves a kinkatchoo
To help you see clearly, then get back to me
Every country city and borough, sidestreet and ghetto
When I was young the neighborhood watched
Love in some way you choose
I don't want anyone
But if you stay,
Come down with me
Last Saturday
It's a crazy world
And love's the sweetest taste
Up the minds of the lines of dimes and fine
He bought her a ring and the flowers on her bedside table,
Wild is the wind
And hope it never comes to the best in nine
To the door
Sweet on the streets, worth less when it's wrecked
To speak my life through mics, and I never take it lightly
And pretend that everything is all right
See through money like it's paper with faces I remember
From the mind which is one of Allah's best designs
When you've got nothing worth healing 
To the lady by the sea
It's dumb  I know what I want to say
Highway men
You're constantly twisted
The future blows into my eyes
Baby you're no train, you're the track
And you say that I don't have this down
Belinda was mine till the time that I found her
Cooking up a storm
You touch me
una verdad se inventa con suma precision
What day is it And in what month
That scream I got to get mine x
Beware of what come natural
Won't prepare you for what's in store
And she closed her eyes and said
They expectin, the next testament by the God
There must be things to do if I wanted to
Anything 
You hoped that if you'd forget your memories
So when life be stressing me
When you got your new number
I did try hard to burn my eyes
Everybody taking different sides
And I wonder what she wished for I just wished for you
Good deeds won't save us, just true faith in Jesus
A million stars formed into one
In the arms I'll lick ya spirit with my miracle whip
How about sex on the beach Right
Of the time we were great before the self hate yeah
We'll have to, we'll have to, I want to
Hearing of a blind cat, vision of a deaf man
So we could descend in the dark
I was so used to bein' alone
Just put everything on some song on the radio
And the hood fell off her head
Everything looks the same
Something to be thinking this
All the rain coming down
Wherever you see  the buffalo run 
There's a hopeless place inside my heart
He'll have turn around
Get a collection of all the music and everything we've ever done
Guiding us forward through pastures of dream day
Leaving for work Monday morning
You were right, I was wrong, so wrong
Don't know another girl
Dass man wei��, dass man druber hinweg kommt
Skar the fire son, pet the smiling one
Where ocean meets the shore
And you said, "Just 'cause we can't see them doesn't mean that they're not there
You and me will be together
Reminding rewinding
Eventually, I knew I'd run into HiTechnology
You said forget about me and you
Was illuminating a face
Face the world on your own
I think my kids would mind
In his right side
Then it changed
In the morning rain there are no clouds
But there's no going back from this point now
From Kentucky well water to whale watchin off a back porch
I can wait another year
In a window on a train
Now take a rest
I'm waiting to feel
And I can hear you singing
Get past times we cuss through
Calma, todo esta en calma
One day
When I thought I knew you
You're smart and kind and you're too easy on my eyes
And start nothing you think you'll continue
You should see it before there's nothing left
You know the reason why 
A friend of the priest say she chewed out the captain
No ending
But don't stay up for me
I wanna fly, I wanna fly
Precious things unsaid
But I can safely say I ain't never played a woman
Like black is beautiful, names from the seventies
Now that you'll stay by his side
Let's take a ride
Oh, can anybody else see what I do
Keep them safe, keep them warm
Memories of light and laughter
I'm digging a hole with my hands six fee in the ground
While I tried to stop with cigarrettes
Can't tell me to stop when I begin
I can wait
For true love we pay the price
Turntables we spin off but the needles never skip off it
On hands and knees
So I gave up and said alright
She don't like me 'cause I can't speak
All the wasted tears forgotten
On the ground
To you I dedicate this song
For me too, there was nothing I could do
Shine a light into it
Who gon' make it better for the thugs and Ps now
It doesn't come as a surprise
She puts on her face, makes it a brave one
Speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
To the sweetest death I ever had
She yelled out "Why you do this to black men"
I don't want to change your mind
But I can't think where you should stay
So as we angle to the new
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
Watch how your fingers twist and change
Wear feline masks, we'll go
And a head like snow that can never be still
That you could trust me, but I was lying anyway
When I tumbled out of the place
Take, take, take, take my arms
I was always the flower, I made waves for Noah
No somos lo que quisieramos ser
Go ahead each day
Up with the sunrise you'll be staring
So don't lose heart
Reaching up to the light on the waves
The right place
And the trees for their hundred years
Ovi on parempi avata jotta karkaa vartija
And you got to try and get it right
I wait for her now and then
Save the work for the afternoon
Like it's the end of the world and we'll make love
Cover your mouth
Power of love is a curious thing
So get out, get out of your house
The times are changing fast
Ingrained in good
Ain't no turning back
You feel the same way I do
Every wounded soldier
Manche ham'n Problem mit mir, erzahlen mir ich rede Stuss, der politisch mal so korrekt ist wie ein Negerkuss Aber hey, da schei��' ich drauf, denn ich strotz vor Lebenslust und kenn' nur Schmerzen, weil ich mir fast nie die Zahne putz Ich fuhr' jetzt schon 'ne Weile ein Leben auf der Sonnenseite, denn auf meinem Weg nach oben nahm ich die Stolpersteine Jetzt seh ich die gro��en Scheine fur meine Bombenreime und kauf' mir mein hei��geliebtes Gras nur noch tonnenweise Wenn die Socken schmutzig sind, geht's barfu�� und im Drogenrausch mir einfach ein paar neue kaufen in das feinste Modehaus  Oh der Herr sieht aber komisch aus  Ja ich hau' die Kohle raus und gibt's mal was zu tun, steck' ich den Kopf in den Sand wie Vogel Strau�� Denn ich schwimm' oben auf, ganz genau wie Fettaugen, die hubschen Madchen stehen auf mich, Dir bleiben blo�� die Schreckschrauben, doch wenn ich jetzt mal ehrlich bin, wurd' ich am liebsten weglaufen, denn ich hab echt genug vom nichts tun und Sekt saufen
What are you waiting for
I never like what you say 
Sometimes her forehead gets hot
I'll be gone by the morning, it strikes daylight
We watched our friends grow up together
If I find that they've sweetened your night
Tired of playing games
All the roads lead after you
I turn inside instead  of wondering
They strain to slang sling, I'm trained to bring game
Twist the drama of the play to get us by
Look outside, and all I see
The owl on the roof has got it right
"The king was right We fought with hope and might
Let's put our hearts together
And stumbled through your world
Just to be with you, I gave everything
Our bubble's got it covered
Everyone can see
Her eyes are staring at me
You said "hold on to dreams", yeah
When she only talks about her son
It just might keep me alive a couple days
Then a man drove off in a bright white Cadillac
It's not like when she was young
Am carried to you tonight
You know I fooled around playing the field
Sometimes I get so tickled I just can't talk
As heavy as hiphop is I'm always ready to drop it
Lookin' back it seems I always been a step behind
Spirits 'round my head  are whispering
She's a hell of a girl
The accidents know you by name"
Now you are mine, now I am yours 
Took a plunge into my past to share with my son
Despite this noose around our kiss,
This is a story of a boy named Ted 
You'll find this chemistry could move
Malcolm X must be turnin in his grave
What other people wouldn't do
Everything This is the slow rush
Bluest water falling down on your skin
The day is night, departed alive
I leave my debts but no regrets  except I wish I'd took the train
Ever after, ever after
See them shine
What does this story know
When my life is through
There among debris find casual in casualty
You've got to have no credit cards
She's been dancing in a topless bar
And all the lies you said I told
black man kill himself for limited amount of wealth
With you now, don't you know, can't you see I got over *you*
But I wouldn't mind my own
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Oh baby, baby You'll always make me hot Come on and gimme all you got
Scattered all over like the sun in our room
Go to practice, with tactics, when the track hits, theatrics
Where a river sings
I feel bad for you
A different kind of truth  that sets the spirit free
I won't tell anyone
I can admit to being wrong
Away to the westward
No reason to complain and nothing to fear, they always will be
Something you won't tell me
Wine and forgiveness are all that I need
I don't want to think about your mind
They happen all the time
Give a lil' love
Parts of Arkansas
He tells her he's sorry, she tells him it's over
The th time I saw you
I can't forgive you anything
That the seasons tear off and condemn
You know damn well what is in store
Timing's everything 
And I love them for that
Say something secret
When in day light leaves you staring
Head full of trouble
Listen to the hammers falling in the breaker's yard
When the winter came around
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieu, ah
I wanna know why it falls off and on
Remember then, the summer birds with wings of fire flaying
We can't look after ourselves
And you'll turn with every change 
She smiles 
On my mind, all of the time
And he never knew
So if you can't forget
Found some things I could relate with and wore out the tape
The time we were great
Intro Evidence + Iriscience
It was all fake
And we spent four days on an island
Suites your taste of bitter ends
Nigga tryin' to go platinum around  years old
Followers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary
And I know that you lied
To show yourself your weaknesses
How to fly
You've said, that's right, your dead 
Her hands all over me 
Anything
With a golden key
Finally dived into the sea
Ooh that I'll never perfectly phrase
And with these explosives, I split seas for Moses
This one is her fault
I'll be dead and gone
We were shown it's only time
I'm a master these until it's hard to breath
Silver starlight breaks down the night
Some day I'll be an old lady
Just to be with you, well I'd do anything
Far away 
Shower me whit your love
Nothing to lose
Praying for just one kiss
I don't expect to talk in terms of sense
Well I know that you want more from me,
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
And he complicates their problems telling complicated lies
All our words go into the wire
Catch your breath,
Now I'm standing at the station with a lonely ticket in my hand
I know how you tell it
So late at night that I
Face by face, unwords behind
Well, they lay down beside me
All you could wish for and all you could dream
And walk in the sand
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
No lesser your treasure
What can I bring to you
A quiet place and nature's way,
Why not call it a day, the sensible way
They are, they are
Wash away, wash away
The world was young and he knew
And you know there was nothing I wouldn't have done for you
So wait for fate to find me
Through the rain we hear them cry
Her room mate won't listen but I 
Seeing you buzzing from flickering signs
What my flesh would not
I want a station of my own
Water was running, children were running
We believe that we can't be wrong, yeah
They're stuck in the walls, go pull them down
Oh that magic curtained canyon where lovers dreams can lie
Born to be in love with a no good man
Why won't you touch me
I'm missing you
I know I'd throw it all away,
Walk away, walk way
She asked to herself what had she done
Your soul in your eyes
No one or nothing comes near
Shimmering straight ahead I see
You haven't shown your face here since the bad news
In orbit always
Let it rain
But it just looks so cold there from the bottle
I was , alone with nothing to do and I couldn't sleep
You'll have to wait a minute 'cause it's an instamatic
Ooh and I don't think I need much more than that
I want to keep you
Check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
I can't carry on for long
And our bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
Cause even the Reverend would tell ya
Well a train blows a whistle before it pulls away,
I'll get along
Lay me down
You're everything I like and everything I despise
Pyramids and starlight
Just to cast away the ghosts
Whip, 'cause what I'm hearing's all shit on the lyrical tip
Everything 
A day when you silence
He gave me his shoulder
So what can I say
I loved you then and from now on
With you I am blessed
I just need a little more of what you've got a little bit
You've got her
A neighbor one time pounding on the wall now lulled to sleep by lowered voices
Like its just another night
We've had a good time tonight  I'm tired there  I'm tired
And you don't heal if you won't don't bring it home
Sky scraping on backs of mantaray
And there's your girl
As furniture with glass upon my head
Through endless skies
But true love is priceless
Smile, though your heart is aching
Delowering my baby, are you my baby mate
Line by line, and shade by shade
We can still close our eyes if this goes south
But you can't find the window
The sun just wont break through
The truth will be the same  for evermore
It just keeps on keeping time
Well I feel like I'm lost in time,
All the wasted years forgotten
You call me to play me the sound
Too late for us to change
To a tune that was famous the year I was born
And spreads among the sheets
At the exit have a smoke
All the love surrounding me
He's no saint Heaven knows that's what he ain't
They say it wasn't professional this time
Happy end �� �� �Ӭ� 
We'll split the side off the bed
That she hides so well, so well under that dress
And backsteps were things you've denied, 
She says, "Wake up, it's no use pretending"
Don't tell me of those mirrors
As siamese songbirds
Losing speed 
The sun sets soon
So with a sense of terror and bewilderment,
I can't make you feel what you already feel 
Don't make me read about it babe
I can wait I can wait I can wait
You set the rivers on fire 
With all grace
Why should I stay here
This place is not for me
Oh cool water washing over me
Men not devils have claimed us 
B we get started, r we all alone
Churns out pain instead of love
A lovely day
When it was one mass of land, with one nash' of man
I dreamt I was a letter
Don't know if I will but until I can find me
, pounds of hope,
It's such a shame
The last rose of summer is gone
Light their way
How I longed for the journey, and those far distant lands,
Simply because you're near me
We crabs in a barrel, you ain't gettin out until I do first
The converter remains faithful to the drugdealer priestess
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
I wish they'll let us stay
Du mich verloren und auf immerdar den Sohn"
But I would rather wallow
I can't forget the glamour
But I hopped a couple trains, mom would cry if she knew the halfs
I'm shaken by my sight
We swam the evening away
Now the song is nearly over
And your eyes, they were not here
I don't want anything else
The honeymoon, the wedding ring
They were waiting for me
Let me sail, let me sail, let me crash upon your shore
To see her son louis leaving home
You'll tend to me as glory verse
To the walls, a crude set of stairs
Before we get back in the wheel
I ease the seat back and start to pray
Blast beats with saxophones one of the baddest rapper's known
I been all 'round cape Gigardeau
HiTek beats became my favorite
There are still bodies thrown on my bedroom floor,
Men tro mig, vad som an vantar, ga
Light up your face with gladness
As free as you wanna be
And I've got to be dumb
From the North to the South, Ebud�� on to Khartoum
Broken love, crash and fall
You never bothered to explain
Come into the light �������᪸����
Climb the mast, 'cause I know
Where I left my toysingers
Sometimes the world's a scary ride, it's hard to hang on
You were one of god's children
And I know that this hurts
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Broken noses hung up on the wall
I should be knocking on the door of the pearly gates
With a mouthful of sex, like drugs
Horizons come to sip wine there
I smeared myself with pennyroyal to keep the hounds at bay
From the diner up the road
Should have known
And pulled out a pass
So narrow your eyes
Why do you leave notes at my door
And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind
Tracey Gold  where have you gone girl
Crush my bones tonight
Solomon Grundy, Raggedy Andy
It was like I was gonna die
And I could hear you singing
I heard them singing
You turned when we heard them, your breath hung in the air 
Running down 
I'll be waiting, get home
I need you now
End of a perfect day
Who's making a mistake each time our mouths meet
Just take comfort in knowing that
I had a dream  of the pale morning sky 
I just want to freewheel
Yeah we both know it's all just washed away
Everybody's telling me
This is New York City and the ice is thin
Any move and I could fall
When you need some kind of guarantee that you're protected
Product of an East German black
You got shot with a bow
They went off with years of clothing
How he didn't like to be alone
It rains in the fountain
Questions swim around your head
You will feel, late at night
We walked through the blackness, felt the endless space around
A couple times she walked to the train tracks
That was a long time ago
The mountains may reach past the sky
I could see my name in lights
no quiero estar en manos, de un gran simulador
Narrow my eyes
We are surrounded by such history and change
Been living my life
And I hope you run into them soon
And leave everything to the long, long road
Sitting in the back seat of my car
You are safe here you know now
If you don't go get what you need 
When the checkered flag comes down
Springtime, springtime can kill you 
Of a candle in the night
Past name tags and shaking hands
The streets start trends and end them  be cautious
She gave me something cool to drink
There goes an angel and there goes a steeple
If you would draw a picture into which we could both drop
You don't have to answer, have to walk alone
I know that I'm ready
Mommy don't worry Teddy boy's here 
No reason left for living
Find the right moment to stop the show
Turn on your radio
Feelings come and go  I've never known
You got cursed
We swim hand and hand
Hold on don't you say goodbye
You can leave me in orbit
We both try to cover it up
It's Hilltop we're the first to come last to leave
From the round sweet apples that are rotten on the inside
I guess you've gone under again
Soaring majestically high and then
And maybe this good thing's gonna happen today
I thought you won't be coming back
Could change how I feel inside
That sings for everyone
My skin shrinks against my body bones
The danger of love
Leaves a man with nothing
And you know
When I ride
Take back
For the first time
Fall on me when you come down
I can really feel safe
I przykrym migotem zastawek, powiek co dry
So now still burning silently away
I may be wrong, but I thought we said
Orchestrated midnight
You were always on the outside looking far beyond your destiny
I'll load the back and you can drive
When the road was as dark as my fears
And I can hear you voice ringing
This one's gonna bruise
kommt das allein sein 
Of course, it doesn't matter what you see
Full of rhetoric and doubt
If there is time, could we still find,
I really am a lucky man
Where there's no price I would not pay, no
Appealing like the naked truth and the truth is for sale
I remember you
Ich werde heftig von unten an den Wurzeln reissen
Houses slip by, the cloud are so low
No the moon will just keep hanging round, hanging round
It's hard not to sing
Starfire tonight
Drinking down my chances to ever return to anyone
Ich bin auf der Flucht 
And in his arms I find always get that kind
The moon is round 
Walk a windy weather day, feel your face blow away
Sailing through the moons eye
Like Columbus sailing over the sea
Two one two
Young hearts remain unseen
They'll put you deep in the dust dust, my niggas creepin' on ah come up come up
Got a broken car yeah got a selfish heart
Making love is wrong
My love shall never die
Or trouble is gone
And not floss but invest in mine
A ghost of a roar, from the sea shore
The price of solitude 
I just know what I'm like and I'm like what I see
We don't need
With a jukebox in my head
Like when my people understood their prominence
'Cause I don't know a goddamn thing about the birds and the bees
Nothing to prove
We started to put songs together like 'What'
A cidade simplesmente me odeia
And if anyone will try to tell you that
All on a beautiful sky, I'll be
Like it did the day before
Get up girl, heard you sing
On his face
The stars exploded,
I text you back but where is that
It's all so very sweet
Sinking ships around us
Lost in circles 
Papapapa
It gets right to me
Just to be with you, I'd do anything
Power of our day the danger of love
I'm not an early bird, plus the feathers are black
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightnin'; but
I had the devil in my blood
Have you lost your breath
She needed cheddar and I understood that
Me in my pictures
Special times we had
Why do you come around my door
Eyes forward
Spends his time aracing
I'm so hard done by
Friday evening and the drinks we pass around
I don't even know me
If I married your mother you still wouldn't be half of me
Against your lips
We've got it going on
You used to take me up I watched and learned
It's a rainy world
Gimme just one chance you will realise
Clings to the tree
Regina Spektor I was hoping you could keep me company for the ride home, but it's okay if you're sleeping
Around the world wa say make a beter day
Or at least put some hope in the bottom of the box
Uderza potwornym w mej y��y falochron
And I'm the one to forget all about you
We were chosen by fate 
The wind was whistling all its charms
Das ich nicht wage zu lesen
Oh, but you got me at "Paris"
So I start again, turn the wheel,
She lays among the flowers
Until you're down 
Darlin', whatever floats your boat
If this is what you want, then I'll leave
And you wanna be free
Sleeping in the sun
How many times has he broken that promise
The crickets cry tonight
That all the rain clouds are fountains
Saving all your money like a fool
But soon it comes around to your soul
But I won't lose your love without a fight
Eine Stimme verschwebten Schweigens
In fact she's a queen to me, her light beams on me
Take my heart, take all of me
The words that fall from your mouth
Cause baby you're so good to me
The sands of time will blow my mind
You've gotta pay for all the things you've ever lost
Can you turn this pale water to wine
Of compassion that comes through the night
Ooh no I cannot paint pictures with my tongue
Groove zu dem Beat, den Sepalot gemacht hat
Let's change the world
And then you let me make it right
Like someone took your breath away
With my niggas right next to me
am Ende angekommen
They stab ya neck with a feather until you've bled in my quill
Alot of cats out here ain't playin'
Hopes and dreams they won't last long now
Nobody ever warns you
I know my boy struggled with that for over half his life
All the lights in Paris
But it keeps coming out as lies
This old mountain side
You said life ain't a highway
Slowly I stretch out my arms freely
Oh now Yeah Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah I, I, I, I, I See you lyin' here You're so close You're so near
I've heard that good things will come to he who waits
All around cape Giradeau
Follow your dreams  but always, remember me 
And ornaments of shattered glass
Get it wrong and it makes you sore 
He climbs out of sleep
I narrow my eyes
Let's ride
You said that you were gonna stop
'Cause I saw a man
Way slow
Your car is pulling off of the curb, hey
She took the midnight train to nowhere
Gone from the heart
Looking for one safe place
Yesterday, remember how clear it seemed
Man makes the money
Headlights burnin' all my laughs
Dos Equis Right, under red light
Ondas amarelas no contorno cheia
Stop at the warning light, see it flash brightly
And tries to hold back a silly tear
Ich hab' doch auch meine Sorgen, doch gerade sind keine in Sicht Ich hab' zuviel Zeit fur Stress, darum beneidet man mich Hab' ein Dach uber'm Kopf und mein Madchen im Herz und bin echt alles andere als von meinem Leben entnervt Ich mein' meine Gesundheit ist doch im grunen Bereich, bisschen Husten und Kopfweh, naja der ubliche Schei�� Nicht dank Gemuse und Reis, oder dank Kuhmilch und Saft, sondern dank genugend Schlaf, denn in der Ruhe liegt die Kraft Wenn das Wetter mich langweilt bleib ich im Bett einfach liegen, hab' noch nie 'ne Bewerbung, sondern nur Texte geschrieben Jetzt hab' ich keinen Abeits, sondern einen Plattenvertrag, und wenn ich die Burner bring' genugend Asche am Start ich mein' es reicht fur mein Leben, bin noch nie pleite gewesen und hab' eh nicht vor, den ganzen Tag nur Scheine zu zahlen Hab' ein gutes Publikum und dafur danke ich Euch, weil ich sagen muss, dass ohne Euch das Ganze nicht lauft
Should have known again
Then I will tell them I remember you
With a blank, blank stare
Old songs to sing
How can we look in to there eyes
No one gets off without paying the ride
And the morning sun must rise
Come what name in
On clear mornings
Relief from all your suffering'
Take my life and let it be
Ice upon the water
Your thoughts will curl
She smiles, she shuts her eyes,
You won't cry, won't cry, I know
The Lord knows, we can do this shit
I can't show you what's in front of you 
Leaving home was the best thought that she had
Stay for a while
All the industry boys were still laughing and drinking
You're just a single malt swamp clown preparing for splashdown
Thought you was a queen
I was still burning
For every rose, one big stone
Maybe she's gone
And like the ancients we are spirited away
Can you hear my heart bake
Making everything look beautiful
Let us start a revolution
So read your books and stay out late some nights, some nights
Like remind my soul
I'll stay right here till you get back
From the sun
I can't believe she even found a way inside to drown us
Let's pretend that we never met 
Hatin', and our enemies to hell I'm sendin' 'em
I had it to here being where love's a small word
Cause you didn't know her
It has its downs
I wanna go home
Don't you be a fool
To ever be reborn
And it looks like the sinnin' won't end
Stellare regions cry everything has its season
Partiot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
We can one, two, three, yeah
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile
There's not a chance of going down, but then we just might
You've stolen my heart and I want you to remember
As strong as that wind
Let a whisper come touch you, come touch every thing
Hinter all diesen Fenstern sitzen Menschen
Speed along the highway,
But maybe it's the perfect day
Or anyone else
And this one is different
You're a face in the distance I hope to recognise
Nigga pin it, nigga fi'in' to descend into a dawn of a new millennium
And we never came up for air
Now every word of every song
No and thank you, please madame
Don't say a word, I'm not even listening
It's not so hard to say
Oven avaimenreiasta
y la labor inmensa de la imaginacion
Around me again
"Oh, let the father of the baby gather cherries for you"
But I know it's something you can't steal
Just like a ghost
Let's waste time 
It was true cinemaaclef
I met him at a party and he told me how to drive him home
You don't know no better,
And it's about time that I told you everything You put resin on my heartstrings You make 'em sing
Everyday the devil at me
Where you may find some peace
That I die in front of each night
I'm richer through all the things I'm rejecting
As they break your head all is silent
And the smell of the cold, wet dirt reminds me of home
Not all the strength of the ocean
I'm your beautiful love
I know it's been so long x
'Cause all those cold days returned with their old ways of causing
But only if I have the time
My eyes fall from my head
Cause in his head he said 
Refrain
So many times with thighs and sighs
So the cherry tree bowed low down, low down to the ground
You got lost
Undertake the toil
You'll be first to spin your story
Flip nickels, the weather
To stand in your glory
Give them love
Some good and some bad
Our dignity and injured innocence
You're kinda lovin' makes me feel all right
The ring bearers, the flower girls, the I Thee Weds
And the cold stars shine
Yeah we tried to understand it
I didn't paint it
Right upon our lives
Don't let the panic bring you down
You know, you know
Tell you all my secrets
Women that look like actress the status of Cleopatra's
True gem of the Herbrides,
It said that she was just a normal girl, Like a dream, dream dream
He says "sorry I woke you but I just had to talk
Uncomfortable as a centerfold, yeah
The danger of love Makes the power of your day
If you're the one
Just wish that I had something to show for it
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
And it's just not fair
It's easy to love you
And he was my first
With you doday girl
I came to realize my lackluster dreams
When it comes, when it comes
Don't forget
The voice from my sleep
My hair's in a twirl over you
But don't forget my Oohhs
Surely the sky'd be different
See we're losing this world we love
I run and dive into the blue,
Picked over by the worms and weird fishes
But that karma's a bitch, you steady asking God why
I had a dream that we were robbed
Every detail in my head is
And I could hear you voice ringing
Amen  Amen
Your eyes caught mine, and at a glance
For the storm to break
They're all that's left of your design
Bless the beasts and the children
I guess you have a reason girl
And they brought me their comfort
All words of forgiveness useless
We were shown
You have all that I ever need
You know what
Forget what we're told 
Broke the ring around it
Du wirst Dinge sehen, von denen du dachtest
Never right 
Something good will come our way
Just one more plane ride and it's done
It's them niggas you most desire
In hotels and not your home
Ta det som kommer
Go say your prayers now
She left a scar
In the place where we could meet
Around the world you feel the love that we say hey
You won't be back
It's time for us to fade
I'll keep on reminding me
With a party to arrange
Across the never
Slow down, darling you don't need to fake anymore, no
Meet this friend indeed
I wait for you at the end
Anything can happen in life
Have I got you a river view
Nevermind your heart
That day that his phone
When Joseph and Mary were walking one day
I have stood here in this garden
The oilclouds see it's only time
That's been closed up for the night
I was out in Coolidge with my head on a counter
But oh your city lies in dust, my friend
Pretty weak to have let it go on this long
Focus on unbiased lines
I don't need to know
Cross the street very still
Especially nothing, mainly nothing
You said that you was gonna stop
But she wouldn't say anything
Because I love a man
There's nothing to declare but us
That the walls cave in
To live my life in the shade 
I don't want anyone else
Let's make the music right
But I'm onto you, boy
To find the way to you
What do I know
Confused about how as well
The same wind comes rushing
Don't you see it's better this way 
Forsta mig, det ar klart att du angrar dig
And take off your shoes and socks, and run you
du ziehst nicht damit vorbei
And it's the same sad song coming back again
He could be twice as good 
They've got their reasons
I've been looking everywhere I go
And the browns, reds and golds of autumn lie in the gutter, dead
And I'll say the three words
And I'd count my blessings,
My eyes are on your hands I'm helpless when I'm looking at you
And all about the pretty careerist the next cube over
Bathed in a cool breeze
Into darkness crawling after you
Oh honey I just wanna let you know
Let me fly away with you
And the weary eyes are clear
Propeller seeds, corridor scene
In my bedroom mirror
Let's go down Mexico, where the
And I wanted so desperately to prove
If you stay here close to home
For the next few hours
Forgetting, Forgetting, Forgetting
We can say we were late in arriving
She comes back haunting me
Do you love me like you say
A beaten dog in anguish
Wait, we still great but
With everything I see it could take a while
The more I love, the more I grow
Blood on your hands
Covered in a cloak of silence
But we will be as one god
She's got the facilities
Som jeg er som jeg er
Wasn't the only one
Evers on TV, you know what I mean
I heard Resurrection by Common Sense
What will you show me now
Fading in and out and I can remember mother telling me,
Still there's a light I hold before me
We will take the ways of sin
I try hard to smile through all of your lies,
Keep it simple man you're gonna make it out
Here with all my vices I
Her love is running through my veins
Ashes 'round the yard
Running out of topics of conversation
H'hviss my little one, r'r' my crying one
Oh my darling cling to me
It doesn't matter what they say
Shatters the scene and brings chaos to beauty
Flowers are nice, flowers are pretty
When there no nowhere, no place anywhere they can go
Below the trees
I'll show you what you want to see
If you walk out that door
Together, together
The time we were great before the self hate let's bring it back
Your loss of hope
If you turn back the clocks, 
And I despondent turned and left
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
Still the same I beg to differ
I stay out when I want to
It's Hilltop; we're three stars like a Holiday Inn
'Cause I'd sure like to
Wearing different sizes
There goes a cop car and there goes an eagle
Till the new day breaks
See, I kinda acted like a fool
One chilly afternoon, you drew the blind
Looks to the sky for intervention
When you're not feeling holy
Spilt up all the things and move ahead
Oh, cold shower
We are a billion fragments
Fire burns in me eternally time's eternity
We looked very fine
You might be waiting for a long time
Their prayers prayed under covers 
Wherever you go  I'll be there beside you 
To know how good it feels
In some gone story of old 
Bright before me the signs implore me
'Cause now there is no other
Now the river may grow wider
I spoke for everyone
They say it's good for business
But only Jack Frost saw the kiss you gave him in return
I freak with word power, my man speak with beats
But tomorrow never came for Jayne
Shhhhhhh, Goodnight
The hurt was so demanding
Now, when no one knows me,
Of wheat grass oh and some hot chicken soup
Reflection is a collection of memories
Come into the light �������ͣ into the light
To honor the pale gibbon moon
And then the temperature goes from unbelievably high
A noite passada
Und die Zeit versucht zu trosten
Well my name is Badu and I rock your world, I'm also known as the
Then came the day she found herself a man 
Anything you want
Slow day but I pass the time
Falling this deep wasn't part of my plans
I'm gonna hold on to the love we have togther
And then love summoned up the infantry
Definitely this is how hiphop was meant to be
That I, that I never, never gonna let you go
I just can't bare to tell you some lies
No I haven't treated you so right
No one seems to care
That brought us some peace
Is it your tongue that is to blame
Now you know that they're watching
And when you take the controls from me
The children
When it feels like you've been cancelled
Every night go out full of carnival desires
That I've been living in a dream
 Never thought I'd be afraid to trust
I ever heard that made me want to stay
And it feels like fear
What did you think I'd find
Till I discover baby, the land beyond expertise and chastity
But it matters to me
And I really don't care
Out on the sea
But true love is give and take
Cool water washing over land
On the hillside 
They didn't understand
LoweMorriconeTennant
Come into the light ��������
Don't stay out too long
Away, away, will you fall away 
Is there anyone I could call
With nothing in our plate
Across sand and sky and gravel
Everything happens for a reason
Is there anything I can do for you, dear
The smell of rain
Autumn leaves
I remember when mom and dad brought you home
Yes, I'm on the road tomorrow
Where the beauties of heaven
Are the wonders of this world
And I've heard it said that a man would swim the ocean
We'll take back everything we've said
But that's miles away like your smile today
Before you turned your back on me in the end
Lasting beyond ever after
Life, living in Flatbush and going to house parties
I learned a way, I learned away from you
I'll hear you curse my name 
Well, I've never swam the deepest oceans
Hide every trace of sadness
I ain't lost, just wandering
You don't have to settle
I see it sway as you come for me
In his right side, oh
And puts a pillow over the phone
Fly away to a land
I'm busy lappin' it up, I might be here all day
Ornaments reflected light
I'm thinking of you in someone else's arms,
I can't realise you ever cared
So, come down with me
Remember our first love 
You can't slow me
Just wanna talk to ya
Well put that book down
He couldn't stand to see his mother in love 
Us because there's nothing
In my offwhite coupe back '
I never planned in my imagination
Pause when they come in a
I'm lost into the weight of gravity
It makes me wonder how a black man could ever raise a child out here
Don't forget I love
As free as a bird in the breeze
Now I got a baby boy by the name of Jake
It's the nightmare of digression that engulfs a history 
To speeches at the altar on, now we get our party on
I feel as I'm falling, and I see
Please someone blind my eyes
Don't bring that stuff to bed don't hide those tears
To the barge that is waiting
Under the mountain, a golden fountain
It was  am and the light was grey like it always is in paperbacks
Through all fear and sorrow
So as not to be ripped off in ways to which they're not apprised
Before they're swallowed up in the vastness of the open night
Just know that these things will never change for us at all
All you discover
Who wants you
Then did wave goodbye
Man, I just recline and mind my business
Glom allt, lamna kvar det du minns som bra
Anticipatin', life without Satan
Her boss; the silly things he says,
'Cause life is on the outside babe
And stare up at the stars and moon and sky
Everyday is torture
Kissed him once you kissed him twice 
'Make a wish and they'll come true'
Soft as a summer's breeze
I'm waiting to see
Still in pain
But she could see what I was then
The edges of our love are in the stars 
Something's lost when I translate you
They wanted me to be respected as
But the musical box continues to turn
And weed through the black
Honeysuckle vine shine shine 
Someone had died
Your fingernails drag across the walls as you unlock the door
But reaching never meant less
God bless the king, for being our guide"
We made echoes off the green house walls
What a thing to choose
Refrain
Coming to the end of my road, but I never wanted it like this, not like this
And to the edge where shadows meet
My Arms wound around you tight
The grim faces that you're passing
I couldn't catch my breath laying there
But you got burned by the flames 
A cidade levemente flutuou
I'll find my way again I guess
When love cuts the strings
There's no telling how the day might end
Move it on and let fate decide
Whatever happened to that old song
I'll hug you and kiss you and love you
Actually, nothing's new under the sun
A girl came in the night
Light, a child with his own fantasmagoria 
'Cause without it girl I'll just lost my mind
We weren't lovers like that
Closed circuit, checking the street
The stars are dancing on the carpet of the sky
Then what have we got
Crossing the mountains of truth, see them
And I don't know why
If the sun shines right I might be here all day
And a bird you would've loved the sight of
Darts
You need a message, you could love our rappin'
Your eyes fall like plum flowers
Danger I never think of danger
We heard the cargo ships go pushing through the ice
Just give your heart and your love, to whom ever you love
Another verse in the doormat serenade
I don't want to be the one that's left behind
For all the people
Fall on me when you come 
If you go or if you stay
Put the rope around my neck
On my heart
Would you like to be my new best friend
Sound of monkey voices
And later they brought me this song
And listen to her daddy's song,
But anyway, That's after words are said
And the crows come 'round
Utsukushiki mononi tuite katarimasho
I stand in the way of the things I can be
Now take a walk, take a rest, taste the rest
But the layin' in a grave, poor boy
And just to be with you, well, I'd give anything
She found a message on her typewriter, It's like a dream
In fact we are closer to each other
Strolling around and all about,
As just a few of the many things
Don't come back here again
Ride on a roller coaster upside down
I just concertina and wrap around the world
I'll shut up and let you rest
Would never come my way
Tin can at my feet
And turn back the clocks, 
So just bounce, like you're banging in the back of your car
And Mary gathered cherries while Joseph stood down
My elders all feel the same, there's no bravery
Always running away, always running back
Like rain out of the blue
So I'ma say it, and convey it when the world play it x
My heart is beating
All things you wished you had done, so put on your shoes and
Shine permanently only my mind's concernin me
Who's waiting for answers from a boy who can't speak
Through foggy glass or windows, it was them
Als der neue Tag erwacht, die Klingen kreuzen
But all your lies were sweet like a child's
For the right moment
But I don't even know what the word blessing means
But there's nothing can keep me from lovin' you
Something inching past the edge of reserve
Well, I'll be gone tomorrow
I don't know why"
Let these babies have somethin'
But now upon that Christmas scene
Duplicate, and then you wait for the next Kuwait
I swear I didn't mean for it to feel like this
Sacrifice is all we have
There's always trouble
Like the other day
You see the sign that this was time
I been livin' with my chips all in and I'm still in, see
Whispering me to sleep
You won't feel nothing until you feel
With all the friends who told you
Oh, can anybody else feel the way I do
Na, I ain't feeling ya kid, we gave you
For we was only hiding,
Devotament a de'u pregau
'Cause secretly I'm timid
I spend time just trying to forget, 
So many lives around I guess that it was just your time
Are we the soul
The wheels that round the ground 
Some say it's stupid but violence really lives where I come from come from
You better watch your step
Very brief in the night
If you had half a mind
What's this odd game that's all over the airwaves
Will be holding their breath until their blue in the cheeks
I want you anyway
Your eyes, they turn me
Tonight see you in my dream
As you disappeared
Somewhere in the back just watching the bands
Your molten bodies blanket of cinders
But I don't think we should let 'em go
I have none left to ease your load
What did you think I'd do
huoneessa on pian kaksi lintua
Please don't take me lightly
To make amends
And I say this not from hate;
On boarders towers in flames 
Won't you put me on top or change the odds
It matters to me
Seven moons for seven seas
Whenever I got lonely
I told him that I knew Julia Roberts when I was  at summer camp
But the tide came in
We rock tonight
And we'll remain friends
Afterall, I'm the princess of Hollywood way
Even though the bills are piling
All the souls that I've known
And there are leaves from my fingertips, unfurling
Or put everything on a song
I see the skull beneath the skin
Be very, very careful not to
And they won't be making a sound
And turns them into sheep
On a night breeze so free lovers must collide
Your love bring the sun in me
Living in pain, living in sin
True love is sacrifice
Is slowly recalling
She's alone in the world
We will be forever as one 
Won't let them get the better of me
I was the portrait of the artist as a young man
Your lips Your undulating hips Squeeze me oh so tight Fulfill me through the night
And all I'd pray
Last words I heard 'em say
Just to be with the one he loves
I'm about to relay what's going on
Of your name
I said I don't think you know
Finish nothing you start
You'll take it back
Hey, lush, have fun
You were running out of time
I've been there  believe me
All of this wasted time
Kick without sight
There's no turning back
The danger of love Makes the power of your way
Show a lil' love
How could we have let this go
I never dared to speak from my heart
That is really sad and sweet
You know it can happen
I am free from all despair
You poked your head out of an alley half a block away
I knew I'd remember
We're going down, we're out of sky
'Cause that's the time you must keep on trying
Can get together
So shape up for your own sake
There's a fine door that you open
Somebody that I loved so much
I call you back but what's that
And all the plans I had inside
Alone and
The nighttime gets weary of implecations afterglow
 seconds till we smash into the ground
Where do you wanna go
Voce ate parece um vicio
Let the dreams of sleep take troubles far away from me
Your smiles at the wake and
But a hole that peasant left with his cannonball fun
And I'm afraid I've lost the fight
I ought to hate him but still I love him so
'Cause I'm up here running behind you
I saw you and some foreign guy
This is the end
And at home on Wednesday morn
I love the cars and everything, the diamond rings
But it'll be the end of mine
I know the world is upside down
Can give you all you need  just listen still
The things we discovered inside
No, the sun is gonna rise, gonna rise
So we spent the day submerged
You know it's funny, got my guns better arm yourself
Vindurinn og utilykt af harinu ��inu Eg lamdi eins fast og eg get me�� nefinu minu
See you in my dreeeeeeeam the danger of love
So she did run to him over the grass
Always free
Must be things to do if I knew how to
Unfold by the sea;
Someday I'll hold you again
Leaves no place to begin
Picture you kissing me as were falling asleep
To hang around each corner
To see her son Louis leaving home
Be my bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
They're in the business of inventing saviors
When the fire comes you can't strike back now
Oh, I hope you run into them
Next Saturday
In haunted airs
All along, thought that we still had a chance
It was always you x 
Had to give you away
C'mon through c'mon you come dig right into my heart
Of the midsummer dawning,
Knowing now you'll never fake it
We will find illumination in unnatural light
And pointed full of pain
The earth was frozen
Anna Rose sleep well tonight
We can make it happen
But some brothers get those millions and forget how to behave
There are streets paved in gold that shine so bright
I'm waiting for you
And a bird in a hive sang no song
Everything's so rushed This is the slowrush hour 
And you won't make me jealous
He said he liked to do it backwards and I said that's just fine with me
I've got your voice on tape
Misused
Why did none of them dream of trying
But if I were raised to fight, that would be me,
Like thoughts out the back of my mind
I'll show you somehow
Because this bubble, that you call home
Brought the sky down
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
We're learning slowly
Determinely advance technology better than Germany
Brosandi Hendumst i hringi Allur heimurinn oskyr nema ��u stendur
You've got the saddest face
I don't wanna freak but the tongue erodes
I miss you darling
The speaker's distorted through the phone
It's my legacy, we can't let it stop us uhuh not now
Or I'll sail till I
Will be burned to dust
She's gonna make you do right
High on a golden crested wave she sits
It's written on the back of your hand
Share your light
I sing this song
So I can kick my feet and bang my head silently
We will know that be a part is to be truly whole
'Cause you are my brother  my brother under the sun
The deeper I swim the more I know,
Here in those eyes you hide it well
That blew us round the island
Stay the way,
We will find we never knew hatred ran so deep
Cast away on the water
Don't wait up for me if I'm not home, yeah
And they supposed to be bougious, so they got white friends
Try to stay entwined
To the two red holes
But it's worth it I love the thrill
Whichever way you'd like to place them
We watched the city skyline from the ferry deck
The clouds at rest
Eu sonhei com voce
I'll be feeling blue
She says, "If I leave before you, darling
Fly alone
Between keeping the peace and arresting police
There's water and there's fire
She could never see him
The whole world wanna be rappin' with me
It's so nice to rest her aching head,
I love forgetmenots, fluffernutters, sugarpops
It looks more like a coincidence to me
Talk down the girl
Caught in a trap of desire
Till I was burning up
This ship is going down 
It was all you
And I think in lines in rhymes, the rhyme stitches
That ripples the bay,
And they are raising quite a stink
If what you believe in, is so sacred
'Round my hometown
No crying fields, no sins of man
I can barely start to even wrap my head around it
I count my blessings, but you can only be expected to count so high
And when I ride
There must be a time 
Didn't see me catch the Doomtree fame
lauf' nicht fort Ich werde nicht kommen, dich zu schonen 
Cause every inch you see is bruised, yeah
A situation so heavenly
When she woke up on the back seat of a studded car
I don't know where I'm going
What you want's bad for the souls
I can't be with the man I love, 
And you're the best thing I ever knew
Each memory that we've shared
Just leave it all behind, 'cause it will be all right
I've never swam the deepest ocean
I text you back but what is that
Is a wind that gets singing
They also felt she was a human being
All the evidence points in one direction
We smelled the cold bark in the air and the sweetness of 
But my skin's crawlin
Do you need some company
Pick up the phone and call me lover
This ain't the way it works
Um tiro certeiro, modelo que vende mais
And don't fly fast
The stars have all stopped shining
Won't cry, why wouldn't you
All around
And I'm still the same
But I'll spend the night out on the sea
I rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese, with soldiers
Hang me, oh hand me
We talked of looking just out of town
Please pick up the phone
So get out, get out of your house 
Cause every inch you see is bruised
Living off somebody's life
It's like the whispering wind in the top of the trees
My eyes are smaller than my stomach is
All the songs of Belfast
While angels make their music and give my spirit wings
Undertake the spoil
That he feels so much older than he was
His mouth is open
She knew right then
Jag vet nog, jag vet nog vad du tanker pa
A desert rose cascading waterfalls
It will not bring you
If I don't wanna know  what's written inside me
Help me to discover what it is you're thinking of
Or this world we love so much
Oh, has anyone had a good time tonight
All you take from someone else
To assassinate the sun
How I yearn for the cries,
We cannot tell for how long we'll be able to stand this vicious fight"
But you know what to do
Does he know that I call you at all
The th time I saw you
For the first time in your life you'd make a home
Uch a night, it's such a night
Simple simple man you're gonna make it out
It's mine and yours Let's guard the block
The spaceman, spaceman
Well down on Venice Beach, you had to jet before dark
You were still breathing
Calalily, will you still love me come tomorrow knowing that I've done nothing
Life is ending
I look for her out on the porch
Afraid of the dark 
Where's my bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
Oh I'll give you all the colors that are left here in my box,
We'll go and fight them back
As they clean up every corner
Choking on the dirt and sand
They get to watch your step
Try to put me to shame 
Mesmo sabendo que a vida nos engana
And be forever
The ceiling is the sky
You don't have the time for the least hesitation 
There ain't no time for selling lies
A page from truelove stories
Feel a little outta place
Night made a day like this
It was only a matter of time like centuries
Is there something I should know
Shows that we are united
Reason why i need to fly, hide away
Forever blind
Happy end �� �� �Ӭ� �� �ެ�
If I found a payment to be made
We can move
And whether or not you feel the same
I wanted to be a star
A bottle meant for two a glass that's full of legs but free of any fingerprints
I can't stand the thought of you alone
We have no sea, child
Is now the dream
An hour ago I felt so low I almost drowned
What is the body if not a place were you store all anger and happiness and pain
Thugs like me where I come from come from, come from, come from
Gets herself a seat on an interstate greyhound
Broken heart find your way
You promised to keep me out of the rain
I got them hazel eyes that'll hypnotize
To lead us down
Parttime thing
And each time I hear who's to part
Yeah, this year we put in work and got some other plans
Autumn came again and everyone scattered
If you, my darling, just, just smile
It's a good thing you can swim 
You're the one who said I love you too
From old metal chairs
All them teenage dreams of rapping
Take in time to shout
Though others I've tried I just can't deny
A lil tequila, some kissin' and burnin
I know our love will last forever
Million different pieces
The things you said I did so well
Nothing's all right without you, without you
You're frozen from skating too far out on the ice
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone
Then the light came bouncin' up, from stony ground
Till the PATH train finally comes
And wake up alone
You'll go crazy by the hazy sea
From the second floor
The further I wander, the less I know what it is
Hot dam and I can't be stopped 'cause I'm lyte MC and I'm light as a rock
They carried our boots past the naked little trees
They touched both my eyes
Vielen Dank fur die wei��en Lilien und das gute Buch
But she must want to show me
Time stands too still
And here I am, tryin' to steal you away from him
Eu nao entendo a sua indecisao
I miss my girl
Tell me the season is almost over
She was too well read
When the world closes
You can read their address by the moon
I asked would you wait for me
His words were very nice
I'll be the bright side of your bad day
With sweetness that you lost to me
"Deinen Sohn getotet hast du, wie geblendet kann man sein
Like it was on better days
Like the whispering wind it makes you all mine
Dim the lights home
On a rainy night in Soho
What does this story hold
I look at the light and it sends a lonely shiver down my spine
If I didn't know
Just sing a song and feel all right
Pay no mind to those voices
Walk away, walk away
I love your halfass accent you stole from the foreign movies
Bye, I send you all my regards
She fell in his arms and he caught her
You feel the power of love
Over by the barn in the dark, we heard the geese
A homespun clapboard blackstrap thrush
That U've always wanted, but could never find
And age is welcome home
Restless minds have searched  long before
The laser lights are pretty,
It's time to leave
Why everlasting love is everlasting
Then running and sweating
Crawling to work six feet under
Love ends just as easy as it's begun
That follows the night;
And empty heart
And the rain brings me out
A body laying on the floor
I can't say if this fucking subject should be dropped
This moment together
But listen to her daddy's song,
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
And she likes to say hey good lookin'
I held my part
Knew that I'd come from city lights
The passengers have lost their smiles
They have begun
You'll learn some day, won't you
A mind full of vintage skies
I lay smiling like our sleeping children
You're a couple, especially when your body's doubled
Friends made you sensitive
All at the same time 
That's why I'm standing right here
Du bist den ganzen Weg gerannt
You can't, you can't hurt me causes I don't care about you
I'd never leave ya
'Cause I've got some kind of disease
Until it's over, it will be
But I'm sure it's only lies
You are my friend yeah
But for now, emotional ties, they stay severed
I never like to land
With a promising career
And half these cats ain't half of what they think they are
Thresh a crop defiles
Oh, she says carry on, carry on
Of my world, yeah
And those watercoloured memories
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
And if I don't die today
It said that she was just a normal girl, It's like a dream
I'm not talking of the fist time
And up on the wall
While you hit trees and coast I spit flows that be ferocious
History that I arranged been regained by King James
They're bored and waiting for you, so put on your shoes and
Me I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes
We didn't bring the bodies, we didn't throw them on your floor,
"How the hell did I get here"
Hands in the pockets of my coat
'Cause play starts in the mind In the mind
I see it all like a fly on the wall
Looks pretty good from where I stand
He'll fall all the way down
It will be a lovely night
And say we love our children
There's so much sun where I'm from
And now that I've got you all strangely compelled
Come come come
Would you take away my weakness,
Empty as the sky
I don't want to shake your father's hand
You've gotta pay for all the things you've ever thought
The lights are going out
I'd tell you everything
Poison in the very air we breathe
Ted used to tell her 
Where the sun steals the sand,
Bring you back to see the lights
So tell me how, how to reach your love
And I'm a keep at 'em, crossing my fingers that eve
And when we funk, we'll hear beats
And we drove away
Light of the night
And I remember all the summer nights
Sky stayed grey
I try to stand tall
I took shelter from a shower
Facing the wall
As night falls I hear voices on the radio
I'm just tryin', tryin', I'm just tryin'  get U
Notice new found courtesies
I guess I never told you
Bestas e janelas, extase no breu
Tracks that make you relax and recline
Third Day  album version
So I took a ride away from the city
I won't fight it when you leave
Deep blues and reds
Cool your heads
Oooh, put me on top
Waiting for Mars to come out
Praying that tomorrow I'll be braver
Where the stream joins the ocean,
Like a drumbeat
And the grass was gray
Let you know my hands shake
I don't know where
And just suddenly I thought
I got deep into my mind, see I got a treasury
Open your eyes when it falls 
The power of love
On a high white box in a pile of rocks
They say everything is possible but I know that it's not true
"Ich nicht dein Eigen, denn noch immer bin ich frei
Can't work a dead end ninetofive, for what
Fire is burning me inside out
I reach down and reload my ticket home
I fell ill inside eternal winter, winter
In a fist full of sand
Let me feel mine
Sometimes I ache, babe
I'll never forget what you said
Or stained in sin
What if I told you that it was all in vain
I could spend eternity inside your loving flame
And faced the enemy with open hearts
Can't take a trip to fall runnin' to first class
Melody day what have I done ah
Give me an answer you are sure of
You tune out without warning
We did not have to be lips to face
As the MC carried on with it
Shrugged him off, and locked the door
C'mon; Tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts
I waited years for you
It's mine and yours, Let's guard the block
And this is my chance
I'm best to let go
Not fire no not ice
Erased our signatures from things
A scarecrow shudders
For my choices
Breath through my eyelids, my flow keeps my teeth white
And come tomorrow you won't laugh alone
There ain't no time to set things right
Oh I'm missing you
Johnny Cochran dead, who gonna get us free now
Gucci girl Well I'm super cute and play ain't bad
And I know that you lied, but
Shimmering fields but of course my dear
I see you're still breathing
The sidewalks will carry you home
In case your wondering
Smiled at your funny little ways
I'll let you know, yeah
Dry your eyes, Face the dawn
Comin' up out of the ghetto was a hell of a struggle, for selling the fiends yayo
And days
These lips are crusted shut 
Go all the way, you knew you could
He was traveling abroad
There's no one on the line
Let your love rain
Head in two devices I
Flesh
Everything is yours, nothing's mine
A passing town
It's a wind that will keep on lasting
If there's a cloud above
You always show me
Like the hope I have for us every time
And just to be with you, I'd give anything
Seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
But I know you don't try
I hope you never leave
Bathed in the light,
To help me kill some time
Oh, is it any wonder
Falling now and settling
Walk away
Baby you're no train, you're the steam blowing by
For in this world they have no voice
Wars and Famine, plagues and pestillence
First up, on the dolcet tones of the Gravy Bone Project
But looking never meant less
Alright
She gonna make you do right
For grace to be regained or won
Let me sail, let me sail, let the Orinoco flow
But, for tonight, forget it
Need someone to whom I can belong
But we're not watching it, we're hardly focussing
Well, there's no price I did not pay, no
Over white satin sand
But put sorrow to a soft melody
vapaana kuin vartija
I'd do it all 'til the end
I'm thinking of you in someone else's eyes,
With purple highlights
How could I see anything  how could I be anything
With such a face now
Before you know you loose your dignity
I'll remember those
And make this evening bright
She can't remember now when she was all in pieces,
Over the hills and horizon
It's mine and yours
Hold me close to where You are
Fuck It's your round dude
Into the arms of understanding
I looked out for you
Knock you to yo knees
You call and all I wanna do now
Wait for love, for love
'Cause it's a jungle out there
We're so very clever
You are my friend
Where the wild winds blow
Far away on the water
Give you muscle, tone and tears
The glass ain't half empty it's half full that's why I'm a table drinker
A love affair
Oh, I've lived on top of my own words
Come on, don't stop
Was as easy as the run
And we spent the hours
It's tougher than diamonds, and it whips like cream
I wanted to be on the top one day
There goes a partridge and there goes a Go train
Tiedan mita on oven takana,
My love is his and his is mine
Looking for a ride and all about,
I still believe that there's somewhere for us
Maybe you cannot speak for shame
Love too sweet to recall
Du bringst Verderben, fur eine kleine Liebelei"
Girl that's a pressure unmeasured
Just then the room became more dimly lit
Carry on, be strong my son
Especially not when it comes to you
How is it that you noticed
And I'll be dead and gone
To move you
You call me back but why is that
Utilize your memory
To grey
Girl if we get this thing right
A day that doesn't come to the lucky
When I thought that I just can't go on
Well, it's bright and new
I don't want to lose this
The shivers on the spine
There goes a forest and there goes a bluebird
Deine Schulden zu begleichen
I can see it in your eyes
Like the whispering wind you stand here with me
Oi it's your fucking round man I got the last fucking round
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
The last rose of summer would stay
Puts you back into place
Try to get the colours right
You'll tell to me is glory verse
I am free from all decisions
Keep your eyes open up all night,
But she can't avoid judgemental
Turn me into phantoms
Beneath the transparent blue waves
Your former glories and all the stories
Stars shine like eyes
And, without further argument
Staying out 'til  o'clock and singing like a fool
Ta det ta det som kommer
Broken bodies all the time
Go ahead and close your eyes now
But no word or warning do you say
No, won't let them get to you
Swallowing like mercury down the drain
My toe hit your toe lightly
Through my empty city
Two more nights till Colorado
Driving around this messed up town
Interesting and sophisticated
Reveal for me shine for me
I want you up and down
With the tides, and their little secrets,
Stand up like mama raised me alright
When I look in your eyes
A mystical mistress in the forest of night
The time we were great before the self hate let's bring it back, y'all
By the time I was half alive
Goodbye Saturday and hello week
Counts his days
We'll bunker up for days and days
A careless soul
Running your fingers down the back of my neck
Blessings still to come
And if it's true we lost our way
Yesterday I heard you say you never close your eyes
But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts
Along the way we got off track
How many hands on my head
And if there's one thing I learned in chemistry
Tired and lonely I'll move on from this pain
I knew at last it's only time
I see tomorrow morning
On a timely mission
I'm not singing for the future
In some lonely place
And you put your arms around my neck
She has black and white eyes
Work, stress, and sweat, this life is a test but
So this is it, this is goodbye
She's a working girl now, and Mummy lives so far away,
The sky doesn't cover, it swallows
No somos mas
She says
But I've apologized to the lives I touched wrong
You've forgotten the word I love you
Lawyers write some goofy terms in letters to the future
Es wird passieren
Never a woman on the shore
And if flying back home
Oh, the stars, they shine so bright
I miss you, sweet mother
So hang me, oh hang men
At last we know it's time
Come round, you know you can work it out again
You be so helpless you be beggin me please
Roses all are blooming 
Why aren't you kind to me
Per farti prigioniero
With a sound
But I guess I'm livin' dreams
I've never seen you get so low
We looked in each other's eyes 
Give the day a chance to start
It's not like you are cheating we're only meeting
I used to be a part of a more complicated scheme
All of those dreams are in empty motion
The party's on mute
Roll like a circus clown, put away your circus frown
Through the green lights
Oh we shared so much
Where will our children go
It's not pretty underneath
I started up my hollow
It was such a lunatic thing to do
Head up in the clouds
I know I'd find my way, back home
But your know better
But we buy and sell our love away
Tell me how it feels
Watching sideways from afar,
Towards the shore
I take two steps back and tie my boots, 
That I don't remember 
Ooh, watch your step
Since the first days you know of, till the last days is over
Oh I don't know who I am and I don't know what I'll be
I don't wanna go anywhere
Haven't felt me feel real in a long time
She realized the there'd be no turning back
But one day we might make it to Mexico
e baciarsi e capirsi e stringersi
It's like a hurricane inside her
We keep it all inside
I hear the sound of mandolins
Draw me a picture
Save my feet from dancing with anyone at all
And my dust will tell
And out of nowhere I feel peace cover me
A cidade nos meus dentes, tu e eu
So now I do what I can, I'm alright
Follow your heart  little child of the west wind 
And carries you on its journey
Of tears across your fingers
Oh, it's good music, yeah dog I see now
Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never been
I know you see the light
And my family and my friends
Music, sex or something inbetween
Young homie think before you shoot, murdererah
Crying, "Lord, have mercy for what I have done"
You forgot how to sing
You can stand at a show all night
So goes another winter slowly
Even though I'd prefer the lips
Thinking it's time to get a hold
la menos pensada, es la que creere yo
And I know I'm not a bad guy 
For the sake of love
You made a fist around your heart
That runs in the deep
Say come and get me I am home
Can't watch you fall
Tell me what you see today
You get it all wrong
There's nothing left to say Our skies began to fade This is what you did What you did to me
The world they see
That's when I know We really have a home
With your kiss my life begins
I drift away, in a sunken state
I don't really mind
You gave me everything
The moon
Let the drive sequence begin Hit it, Pinback
Blacked out your tinted windows, we still see you
Vacation's come and gone too late
'Cause when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I didn't mean it, I was drunk, it was only a joke"
The night fallin' over Brooklyn, where they murder for change
Oh this feeling is marrow deep
The chchchanges you put me through
She can't change, she don't wanna
White telephone
As a mountain
Living in a piece of ever after
You've got my arms
From the deep sea of Clouds to the island of the moon
Then your smile it melts away again
On a windy porch tonight
We're through, let me tell ya
Forget all that has happened and wail down on your knees
I take advantage of a warm car and I reassess my lot
Trouble that it brings
Sometimes the medicine can heal her kind
Emotionally, it takes all of me
And always the same
naen huoneeseeni, seinalla on hakki
Sweet confusion under the moonlight
I can't go home  I can't go home
Like the whispering wind in the top of the trees
We may end up in Mexico city
Wash down every street
I'm fleeting like light in a room
'Cause I don't know if it matters
To stop my fall from grace
And the air turned red around you
I wanna know why it falls off and on
In silver trees
They also felt she was a human being like a dream
Quiet secrets on the wind I hear
Building on the city street
There's a whispering wind, I feel it inside
Bring myself to say it loud
You're left to stay
I would unmake my past
Heaven's no better, than you
Man, Martin must be turnin in his grave
There's cracks in the mirrors
Everything I ever done
Sometimes working  till ,
From Fiji to Tiree and the Isles of Ebony
I saw you sing out your praise 
And I realize there's tomorrow
Before we get too old
Then you can't find love
I'll put the phone right up to the PA
But all of those dreams are in empty motion
Life was but a sad dream
To take you home
Pride replaces fright
While in style in darkened limousines
We'll call it starfire
Would you change your last name to mine
Does your husband know I call you sweetheart
How to say
I believed all your promises and plans
The wilton house is empty
'Cause I require love that's made of fire
Will never make it out of here
Thunder awakes me, the crashes beside me
Took the last breath away
Now our hearts are locked up tight again
But Jesus, when it rains, how it pours
Who still looks out for me
Ride through the world
You are the one who has lost his mind
And let's change the world
Make the time for all your possibilities
We'll never know until we see
Left out in the rain
I cherish my free time
Half in sunlight
By his bedside table
Echoes dancing in my blood to some refrain
Their eyelids are all fluttering
I was about to take the road
Die like a clown with no friend around
And trouble may come and some time
Momma stayed home with me
Forgetting
From icy waters
Let it rain down on me
Here we go, roll up some more Phillies
I love it when she sings to me
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a glock
She kisses the photo on the wall beside her bed,
Sing me to sleep
The world is growing loud
Of faded lives
We can reach, we can beach on the shores of Tripoli
A bird you would've liked brought the sky down,
Realize the moment that you're in is magic
My foots always in my mouth I just can't stomach defeat
And in more ways in one
The black night sighs
And we will be as one people
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
Crowd the day with unrelated histories
You'll get pulled over by onetime
Or drive all night for no reason
In shimmering fields of gold
I've got your words in me
yo no quiero desganos, ni falta de pasion
This would help
But let me tell you baby, all tricks aside
The platform's full of bums again
Ya you gotta know, I can never let you go
But they still refuse to budge
This is the end of innocence
I've come to my senses
Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouth of babes
Didn't meet because of fate but rather probability
It's like something come through me
The brightest star
Oh, and now what I need, what I need
Believe it's gonna be all gravy
Let the night come
Don't fly fast
One day I'll be a better writer
When we sat next to our first tree
The harmonies we made
Oh, start a new life
There in the winter light
Watch for daily braveries
This fucking world we cannot save
Tracey Gold  where in the world 
I know that we can find the way
And I know grace
Are we the thoughts
And you leave me with my jaw on the floor, hey
Here I do plot,
No one to pick you up
And if he feels like crying she's there to hear him,
The rooms were musty
Oh I'm cruisin' down my own street
If his mother said Ted be good, he would
All boys will get the same
She got in that ride and she never came back
Myos unen ja rakkauden,
I'll make you happy
Then your angels leave and you lose it
But I'm lost, way down inside, so tell me again
Rimani ancora un po
From the stars that light the sky
Your body's sending questions to answers
Think I have it, then it slips through
And if we get up off our knees
They're just two bitter kids from a bunch of sour grapes
Waterwheels turning
And I can't compare
I'm starting again I'm breaking the chain
Work's overrated and it will kill you
I take my place among the truckers and I show 'em what I've got
Dreamy colors gold and red, dreamy colors run right through
I pierce my skin  I feel so real
Funny how I got to here
It might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
Last night
O caminho mais curto, produto que rende mais
Fall down, you don't have to lose yourself over this
So I'll fall again
That float through my head like a sweet melody
But if we only open our eyes
I pour flowers on your chest, on your chest
There are your wishes there are your dreams
Sometimes you sleep while I take us home
Tell boner life just ain't fair
She was , wishing she lived by the sun, the sand and the sea
Looking over there lay mother and louder and louder I screamed her name,
The kids all stare, the cars slow down
Forever young
Whatever happens between you and me today probably will be OK
For the people
You believe in faith and now you think their lies
But its a must to decipher one's girl
The only thing that matters to my life
Travelled the world, came back to the crib
If I was you I wouldn't talk, I'd just keep dancing
There's gold in them hills
Because you're innocent, I know
Whether my oceans divide
Than grains of sand
Offerings album version
I come and reign with the unexplained for the brains till things change
'Cause it don't matter to the moon no, no
I'll be out in my garden
And so the story ends
Shallow it seems but I need you here
Eyes scan the path ahead and all around
They're crawling up my back
A little bit longer afternoon Afternoon
Yeah, she's leaving me tomorrow
I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain
And thought I was somebody else
Tourists wear their wallets in high places when abroad
No good man
Whisky lemon
I've got your voice on tape
Another day you leave behind
And the wolves are howling 
Back in the days when I was a teenager
Arther Ashe must be turnin in his grave
We can sail, we can sail sail away, sail away, sail away
A friend became the
And the blood in your eyes is shining
Now where'll I go to living alone
I hear you talking in my head
I won't cover my face 
And he says 'I know about your man'
Voce vem pra perguntar
I'm in love with everything I see
Right now, I can see the ground turn
I guess there's got to be a break in the monotony
Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles
If I were honest
We turn it out; Hilltop we've been down since
For now it's gone
I wanna be the first on the last
I found my mind was also bent
I'm ten feet off off the ground and still looking down
Respect the hustle and set the tone
Among the crumpled tissues white like daisies fell like soldiers dead determined
Like the hopeless time you gave to me
We could start heeling today
Over us
Things will never be the same
Instead of standing on the curb behind the barricade
Trouble and suffering in a lovely rhythm
From me to you, I know I can't feel a thing
And the rainclouds leak in through the chimney
That start to hurt me, hurt me
Almost scratching heaven I
Call in sick we're never leaving this place
Her name on the radio
Stood out on the balcony and I took a look around
I never thought that I could make such a mess
Starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy
And my hoopty says to me
We can sigh, say goodbye, Ross and his dependencies
Ohooh, oohhooh,
Seen you hanging from blistering skies
I know it doesn't seem that way
Not a mountain high
Today
When Joseph was an old man, an old man was he
Came to Cincinnati linked with Mood, and we did Sacred
I said how did we end up here you said happenstance
At the speed of light
It's time to follow the black path
And plus we know, that I ain't paid
Crashing hard through days of pain
Of long winters and motels what went through your mind
Memories still lie
Check out the girl in the Harbor Tunnel
It comes and goes
I'm up here running in repeat
And I'll let you know
How it grows heaven knows
On some other lovers dreams
Above, the stars are spiralling
I wanna see the stars and be the moon to my son
Goodbye Johnny, I won't forget you
All in all is all we are
We will know the pattern of centuries rise and fall
Soft the skin of the warmest rust
Just like rain
Through my bedroom window,
Do we need debate
There's something about you now
Soon this space will be too small
There would be no truning back
And that was it for me
Swallow down your pride 
Is the same as what you're losing
The day me giving you the finger is a sign of the times
Of what life can mean to us
The Earth
God's one miracle 
No I wasn't faking it, the hurt I felt was real
Love will rule my left hand sky
Here is really just a matter of time
She's ahead of the line
You can feel the strength returning to your bones
The one the radars lost
Put me on oooh, put me on top
Closing folding like a star
In my lifetime, ain't done too many things
Lost out in the rain
I see your dreams all slip away
If we don't have that last place to go
Try to spit onto the sidewalk
In those abandoned towns, that's where your lost lives can be found
That really makes you worthy of the peoples support
Narrow your eyes
You laid beside me as a trick
Bringing on warnings of 
Us get down on a cardboard box in vacant lots
Can anybody else see it
You won't cry, won't cry, won't let them get to you
Hang me, oh hang me
She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hypeman"
Just when you think that you've got a hold
I'm busy lappin' it up, I might be here all day
Like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
Burial ground 
Let the world go on go on
From the sea, the sea of tranquility
I'm in a state of mind
Hation is a birth defect, and you know ain't nobody perfect
I hope it never leaves
How I died upon the cross for your sins
Sue came along loved me strong that what I thought
And I'll paint you face she said
You'll fall asleep in the oceans
Your song seemed to look
I know we will
"Go to bed" she said, "I can't stand you 
What we all dream about
That's all we know
And then I wasn't alone
I wanna fly, I wanna fly 
Ride down our block
The girl waited for me
If you'll be mine
Deeper we'll fall
Tryin' to be prepared for the YK
Could be what we had in mind
Choramos no carnaval
The fruit on the ground, and the wood smoke above
And stars fell on Alabama
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
Drive crazy the danger of love
Would it still hurt you
Who pays your bills How come you came this far
Sometimes I wonder where this feeling began
It was a rainy day today
Just why does she need him, and why does she stay here
Where the sweet purple heather blooms
We are two hearts joined together 
Wonderful when she's close
Such a night, such a night
Are we leaving life
At least a song won't leave
I'm building a box made of wood from a tree that I grew
That is graceful and green as a stem
Can I put my arms around you
Maybe tomorrow go out and play
But that one was his fault
Those three words
Way back
Eu nao entendo a sua volta
Your watching the door
Then you don't need to be with me
Beneath the dull porch light
The basement is where we wait
I'm afraid Candy's not feeling well
And I think I see eyes beneath your couch
Take my heart and help me feel
And sweet sweet forgiveness; you can go back, but it's never the same
Home i ver deu eternal
It turned out she wanted more all along
Them boys may be better, to grow I had to let her Never
This is gonna be a long night Long
For the world can never be
When your face got so much light
O milesimo gol sentado na mesa de um bar
I'll see you grin when I pass you by 
I'm sure you had another lover Another lover
The angels laid him away
Echoes dancing, how can we refrain
But I can't promise anything
And we found ourselves in the sea
But now I think the moment's there
My pack is waiting 
And she wants so much to see him again,
And my past life visions of the continent
So by the time I catch an apple, usually its rind
Let the whispering wind come lift us away
With no real things,
You're breaking my heart, you've changed
Did you even notice how the wind 
Broken glass was all over
Tell me now before we lose forever
Honey, I wanna fly, 
My dream weaver  nobody knows
And my heart is on the line
I call you back but why is that
That's when I found that your love was real
And no words while our worlds quake
Hours pass and she still counts the minutes
To help him through the night
Good days are alive 
My name spells emergency
Take a chance or let me go
After all I wish I'd known
So they say we aren't really here,
And so I'm free
And there are no remedies
We might not know the meaning yet, but I'm sure we can't reject
Mesmo sabendo que so musica baiana
She waits for me 
I know that ain't a part of the deal
Not a window at all,
Everything she does is right
Everyone who comes to me
Dream, dream, dream, dream,
Saw you staring out in space
It'll answer your questions if you understand the message
You know we all crumb snatchers in this land of big cake
The sun shines brightly every day I'm without you but I love, love, love you like the way that I used to do
The waiter was blind
The nights are drawing in
We will hold our broken circle and begin to pray
Suck it up, we're going down
We both found that we could still breathe
Like the sun goes way low
She laid her hands upon my head
Stare at you without a care 
This is what you did What you did to me
You know you'll see this glory verse
We're apt to think it's cruel, but sometimes
You won't cry, why wouldn't you
I'm chiseling this epitaph on a stone that I found
Que una gota de luz
The darkest Sunday from your own past
Neurons realign till the feelin' is fine,
Or I ain't hard enough to stand
Bicycles, tricycles, ice cream candy
But our souls lay bare
Now let's toast the sad cold fact
'Cause it don't matter to the sun no, no
No one, no one, no one has, won the war"
This world could get you closer
It's the one thing that I'll never finish
'Cause down is up and up is down
Pushing against the world
Smile, what's the use of you crying
Leave nothing to imagination,
In the fields of our love
Now It's over now
That used to be
The city makes a hooting sound tonight
Bluest water falling down
It only made my torment worse
I ran to the ocean, washed the blood off of my hands
Facts of life and facts of fate
That locked my face away
We are tiny pieces
I'll sing this song and feel all right
Gotta have your sweet loving
A season comes and whispers life,
I'm gonna take you for a ride"
Asleep in the archways,
It feels like I sampled true love
They look so pretty,
We can talk for hours or just lay in bed
And I don't want to be the one that you don't recognise
The blinking lights, and now all I'm thinking is
I tried to walk the right side of the tracks
We may never find out what it means
A love not warm
Or has your brain been idle too
You're life itself
It's the season of possible miracle cures
You won't cry, yeah
The princess of Hollywood way
Holding yourself with a grace that defies
To share their love and to be kind
You're a stranger in a country town
'Cause when the tables turned
And I think it's going to rain today
Take me in your arms and see
And I've cried for all your troubles
I've been growing older he thought
Cause every inch you see is bruised, is bruised
Fields of dreams become my property
Why stop to think of whether
Running with our timebombs 
The endless rain
Years may pass but the story will be told of Mother Maylene and us her sons of disaster
Calm me for sweet dreams of him
It was always you x 
They will bind you with love
Just wanna get in a car and drive
But this world was too much for you
Then I've got to be dumb
And with a little help from above
Stone go slow
Now turn the red lights on
She says carry on, carry on
So clueless as to the situation
I'm in the mood for love
If the sun shines right I might be here all day
No one answering
The measure of my dreams
There's nothing to fill me in
Although a tear is ever so near
You toe met my heel right back
Shadow take our places here in this ballet
Meet you in each street
The sting of reason
At the man in the cardboard coffin
And when in  rewinds didn't even make any strides
Let me try to understand
Still we want it all
Thick with ghosts, the wind whips round in circuitries
Me curado das feridas
These sounds will never leave you
I surface at  in the clothes that I slept in
Won't be long now for you die, poor boy
Ooh, the people I've met
But the layin' in a grave so long, poor boy
Disorder and confusion everywhere
We'll make it to
Between blessing the beat and stressing to eat
From the life of doing wrong things
There are more stars in the sky,
Melody day what have I done
But I know it's something you can't stop
And it's you and me and all of the people
You and I are side by side 
I just want to live somewhere where the air is sweet and clear
With submarine flowers
Oh the crystal caves
To know you give love so freely
At your family's old hotel
And it sure feels right
Together, Forever
Today I saw the strangest thing on the evening news
And I wish you weren't worth the wait
And the time has come to work it out
And when his air runs out
It ain't gon' stop, it's the neighborhood watch
Lost highway, carry on
I woke through clouds of syrup
Deep in my heart right from the start
The phone rings, it's early, it's seven o'clock
Hang around each street
Time gets selfish 
One more time 
If you can't find love then you will finally see
Remember all the times we said
Through water
It's the weekend
'Cause everything I need is written on your face
The sidewalks bound with steel
You gotta choose what you gonna do
Lillian lies to avoid awkward questions
Selling secrets
I had a bud of mine, I say what's going on
And I didn't understand, so I made other plans
And I'm not perfect, I admit it
Your words' a melody
We only kill ourselves more slowly
Like every inch of me is bruised, bruised
Time to close your wondering eyes
We've got a lot of time
Like a dream from which we wake
Smile, darling, baby,
There I made my stand
Those are the mimicking kind
And get into this groove
Ever since the world began tere's been other folks like me
So won't you walk with me to the park up the road
Everything seems to be going wrong
Right here on earth upon this turf, earth is spinning round
Crosses made to bare the weight
Won't let them get you down
Jesu crist rei universal
Says keep Adam, I'm going down on Louise
People die so I don't have to be a runaway slave
I had a dream  of the wide open prairie 
It's the power of love
Pull a fast one on me
And mines'll stand the test of time, when I rhyme
Is a love not done
I hate to leave you here this way
Where we used to reside
Good to know I'm not alone
I've only got this morning to live
The sleeper in the valley so soon
I'm gonna seek this thing like a buried treasure Seek and destroy
>From cities where making 's a big accomplishment
Don't pass me by
You die, you're gone just like me
You don't want to understand
Shadows are drifting in silence
Frozen in the cold tryin' to get you home
The danger of love
The trees all beckon to the sky to bless their empty lives
I'm not dreaming of the past
It contradicts your battlescars
Just say that our little show is over
While we took our flying
Which way to turn 
Some other grounds
Hungry little kids where I come from come from
Give a little time for the child within you,
And was reflected in the sun
If this is what you need, then I'll leave
A kitten on a patio is looking for me
And when she didn't seem to listen at all
My darling, my beautiful daughter
You're left forever blue
'Fraid that what I'll say comes out somehow awry
Du wirst Tage verbringen, an denen Zahne nicht knirschen
I remember when you broke your arm
Some of the greatest minds on the planet are among us
Thinking "Easy come, easy go"
So let the dead bury the dead
Are we breathing in
Soon, love, soon
That you cannot control
Light and heat
The sweetest dreams have murdered me They murdered me They murdered me 
You don't want, everything, my love
And if you'd miss me when I'm gone
Are all the good ones taken
Deep in my heart right from the start *right from the start*
Waters rise around us
We will never know why 
Tearing out your lungs
Are we breathing out
And morning
Went up on a mountain
And then I thank you
They'll pass me by
se ti resta un sogno da buttare via
Every now and then life says
You always guide me
There's one place everybody goes
They sleep along the rivers
After the party we all went home alone
With a touch of her soul
They have begun to celebrate
Butterfly
We signed the papers
We didn't bring the bodies, we didn't throw them on your floor
Bitter sweet their healing 
That I do not hope to turn again
Once you know that, you can retire
The wild things are
Fighting with our hands
Mark the month and all its anniversaries
The same old song, flows back again
Another world
You ignore every star above you
I like your dyed black hair
Put away the drafts of all your eulogies
Biggie got killed, when this shit gonna stop
It was always you x 
I miss you sweet brother
To see poor Louis in a new graveyard
'Cause I'm a lady
Worn out shoes because lotus blue is hanging in the hall
My brother under the sun 
When someone pushed you down
Only dreams will hold their sway and defy
I live alone, I live alone
They crystallize and break on the ground
They took the moldings off the walls
Ohoh, we believe that we can't be wrong,
No time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is
Sell a virgin lie that can't be touched
You can't give or cannot get
Razorteeth take a bite
The I'll die three times
Always wake up hurting
Follow the voice  that's calling you home 
You know you rock my world and
She'd change for anyone
Run through the meadow and scare up the milking cows
Taunting everyone who walks by as they sail through my front lawn
On mother mountain
Walking through the suburbs, though not exactly lovers
Didn't change that much
Looking for a ride in and out of
Everything is still
Forgot how you said
A storm without the thunder
Tweedledum and Tweedledee, home free
I pen letters that kill
I'll be tired conversation
Cause all I know is I don't know and you don't either
Say goodbye knowing that this is the end
Though in the secret heart
Since the world's metamorphis, and the plan is kept in orbit
Change this world
'Cause to them it makes no difference
But now it's something that we don't discuss
With the under current lurking,
Admit it turned out okay for someone who didn't try
Smile and maybe tomorrow
The streets is breathing, the streets is watching
And I think to the past sometimes, an dag man, it's bad
Making music like love is made
If all your moves were words, 
You and I can change the world
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
The sound of gun fire so loud and rapid, but it seems to be so quiet around me
I hope they'll keep the pace
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
I was just, thinking about you, thought I could call you, see if, I should tell you
She leaves this old world behind
All that I ever was
Tell me stories of myself 
Two one two 
I've started a new life
But the day goes on and on
Hit my head, hug my heart x
Wait, we still great but, but
I've been looking all around to know
Pull apart my body and you'll see
So hang me, oh hang me
I can't keep up and I can't back down
Quick darling make me hurt
And the world looked fine
She let a nigga hit it, and now she only date white men
Are ghosts awandering these halls
Something that no one deserves
And the copy machine's not working
Only meaning to scratch the surface
I remember when mom and dad named you Claire
More than a feeling, it's the power of love
Why aren't you
When I look inside I see where we are
Or anyone
Just you forget about me
Our happy storm is through
Crawling all over like June bugs in June
You sure you want to be with me, I've nothing to give
I've got your voice on tape
Love receiver  where did you go 
Alone
We both love rain
If you throw me a line, I'll only drag you in,
Sunshine in me to stay
Everything These are the seconds that I've lost 
So when I leave yo, you're fucking with my pride I don't see though
With frozen smiles to chase love away
So easy to love you
To heal yourself, love can heal
You say I give it all away,
Yes, you who must leave everything
Memories are fresh
When everything is dark, still something shines
Lust deceiver  one that I chose 
Your poison has taken control of my soul
You didn't think you'd be so dumb
Devote to being kind
And the angels ask me to recall
In the warm nurse
Du wei��t doch, dass ich es versuche
All the trouble it brings
I said man you better watch this
Line by line, a number of signs
You should know that by now
Pretty soon they will be fighting
Moves in circles 
I see raincoats and newspapers
Us to be together
We're all downhill 
The volume's turned up too loud but we don't cover our ears
And your city lies in dust
I wanna hear about your day
As many people pass
People think,that it's alright
That's gone on too long
And a storm on its knees
Loving on a no good plan never treats me as he should
This used to be a Spanish town
The line you walk cause something's got to give
There are bodies strewn all over my bedroom floor
Far away from the slaughter
Die like a love when you killed a dove
You need medicine chill a Pressure vendettas for real
She was just  years old
And you say;
I don't know where to go from here
They said that she was a facility Like a dream
She never wants to come back down
If I could make it in New York, I figured anywhere I'd make it
We're at the top of the world
Some of my rap patterns, still surround Saturn
Somewhere, somewhere 
She took herself out in the car
Start
I guess you never knew
To explor in passion
You must be god embodied, stand tall
Yeah, it's gettin wild out here
While down
Did your blue eyes peacefully
I've gotta fall with a clear head
Nat Turner must be turnin in his grave
Just drive 'til the tape's done
And I touched the dew on their hem
I could hide behind a straw, poor boy
He's got himself in
Make it through just this day
How the roots shape the tree
There's no price I did not pay, no
And here I realise that it's all in my hands,
Longer than the past has
Everyone uses to celebrate
Deep underwater
Do you even know what goes on in a heart anymore
Protect your own, protect your home
Got so god damn hungry
And you'll turn with every change
Take the b train or the shuttle
I'm always free
It's all around you
You're easy to love
Forever blue
Stayin' inside by the warm fire
I guess we got our own lives to live
Dandelion, milkweed, silky on a sunny sky
I told the stripper at the bar that the shots we got were magic,
That heaven's no better
We'll have a marathon of your choice
That selling out was wrong
Everything This is an absent blood clot 
Won't lie and say this lovin's best
The old world was dying
Won't you put me on top oooh, put me on top
If I can't go out and I can't stay in
I don't know why this took so long It wasn't hard for me to see It wasn't that I dind't notice It was just hard to believe
They say love is blind
You know it took me a long time
The blue watercress
We didn't say anything after that
I'm in the flesh, let's talk, about sex
I can't stand the thought of you alone
Like all the times before
That I could end this
Carol Seaver  take off your clothes 
Of his radio
The water broke our fall
Under the clouds
Then what about theur future
Just take some time to breathe
Needs a lady with a light
From those nights when we were both
The eyes have it, once again it's your Peoples
Today is just another day, take another breath in, hold it forever
But so many start off strugglin and never get saved
I want to touch your permed hair
A strand of hair came undone
I'll never end this
Here is apples and cherries so fair to behold
Keep you eyes locked away
From walking on a line, I keep some poise
What a thing to lose
Two Seabee, cigarette smoke
I'll be another waking shadow
Thought you might never show
That was only time
It is time for a new dawning
How can I hope to reach your love
My heart is on my sleeve, my head is in the sand
For the princess of Hollywood way
Blinded by the sun 
There must be some reason for flesh and blood
What can bring to you
It's like running through deep water trying to look into your eyes
"Home is where the heart is," but my heart has long been black
So many years I have given up and now my youth seems shot
Maybe I can tell you, maybe we can do this
For all that you say it never gets better 
You're bored with me in every way
Your laughter tore through the new jersey night,
Once you open your mouth
Give the world a chance to say
You've got my head spinning 
If all that's meant to be was meant to be
And niggaz wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma
Come into the light ������������
They were rotting on the ground
When I left you alone to fight your battles
If your life is a leaf
It brings hail from old water
And she's making the scene
Don't bring that stuff to bed
Paddle to the shore,
That says you can take me anywhere
'Cause I worry all the time
'Cause I wanna see my life
And that you have to work it out some day
There is not a river wide
Hey you still owe me five anyway bro You get the round
And I don't say faggot 'cause I don't think it's right
Into another new year
'Cause people change
Full of land
I'll keep on trying to change your mind
And hours pass, hours pass, yeah, yeah
Her heart is like a gold bouillon 'cause she wouldn't protest it
Tell me if your day was rough
When everything's gone at least you've got nothing
Heaven is in your eyes
There are good times to be had
To all those little girls and boys
Bidding farewell to the fears now decreasing
Who run and fight
Be my friend
I told him that I was good to sixes but all hell brook loose after that
When sunlight hits the sea
Come see me take my hand
When you break your fall from grace
The crimson eye
Even though it's hard to see because you just blinded me
This clock never seemed so alive
We watched the watchers and found a way
Oh, Caroline as my witness, I never meant to cause you pain
And I dare you to forget
Can anybody else feel it
When you speak I fall away 
Fashion your life like a battered wife
And looks just like the sun
The first thing that happened was the river overflowed
Where dreams are true
And now the wolves are shaped like people
Did I ever sleep
Sing for a while
Don't wanna be on top of your list, monopoly and properly kissed
Wenn Dich alles verlassen hat, 
Everybody knows this time
When you lose everything
You're all I know
You don't even know that when I've got it straight, now keep it in mind
Friday, Saturday, Sunday too
We don't wanna face it
Keep it simple now you're gonna make it out
You should run from me, fuck battling, ain't nothing sweet
It's their loose lips that laid me so sick with
Power of your way the danger of love
Changing everyday
Better than watching your first son put his sentences together
Amounts to nothing and there's no way
Ooh I'll follow their dreams
He didn't know 
She needs to know I'm alive
Light that lingers in a quiet room
I can't understand you've changed
My tail between my knees
Earth Mother Bear and Eagle was on the run
Redesign my life, and my cares,
To what you need the most
On the shoulders of one
As we go a little somethin' like this
Hardened by church and law 
Behind the waterfall, no one can name that thing they saw
So shape up for you own sake
I'm still waiting
The th time I saw you
We be runnin' in the sun to lay where it's shady
The nd time I saw you
We don't stop until the break of dawn, ooh
The showers fall tonight
Tell me the seasons is almost over
While you write your hiel of light,
I knew what I was gonna be
So long, so I would like to say goodbye
warte lange schon am Eingang
Oh yes, I gave my life away
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
'Cause when we kiss nothing feels the same
It doesn't have to be today
Deflowering my baby, are you my baby mate, my baby
Seasons change
We're taught to worship these rappers and athletes and actors
Till Winter stays
She's gonna make a take down
The room's starting to move
When we're home
But he left my life just a little too soon
Running my fingers through your hair,
I'm always free to walk
She's got the abilities
Whispered in the dark
I washed away my tears, washed away ten years
I see flowers everywhere
Cause the best part's just begun
The rain makes me happy
Lovely day
The freaks come out at night to spark
The power that makes the world go round
I was lying on my back with my fingers in the sand
Like they're shaped by their storming
Just to be with you, I've done everything
And head in hands
And you would fly above me Hoorah
It can get pretty ugly
A steady blade
Love of my life
You held your part
More clouds, more rain
The air is thin and hard to breath,
Hate makes us powerless
How many roads you've traveled
Here is love and there is pain
If she'd looked she would have seen it
But I maximize so my soul needs to unwind
I'm on my way home now
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Still, there's a lot to do
Lollypops, popsicles, licorice sticks
Out on the balcony  she waits for me 
It's like a page from truelove stories
Pride to the back move ahead strong
Gotta fall with a clear head you know they're alright
non mi sembra vero ma
And all the rings, the wedding bells
BoneBoneBoneBone
Does that dress fit all right
Constellations turned into little polaroids in a cardboard box
I gotta cut myself from the chains and run free yeah
Hold my breath while I pass
And I know they got a cure for this shit, we ain't rich
And I knew all night
Wish I had not held hands
Keep your eyes locked away
He dreams of his lawn
Did you know
"Go, my golden Queen, the light is within you and your men,
If turning this around is what I have to do
Once you know that, you're fine
Just singing
We don't wanna face it
Giving me strength through your love and pride
Yo, you know what we got to do, man, we need to get a whole CD
all in all attendant memories
A modern Venus on the th floor
In my memory ���� 
And my skin burns 
Like a place I can feel but never will see
And hit the motherland
So easy to love you
Last rose of summer is gone
Bright as the stars we're under
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now
Pearls in the sky are strung round the moon
Between my first breath and resting in peace
Rifle on my shoulder
We will know that the fate of one is the fate of all
And round 
No you're not what I was looking for
Like the rain on my windows late every night
If she should want some peace she sits there, without moving,
How had we forgotten
Consoling my mind
Feels like I sampled true love, yeah
Cause, her bestfriend's man got popped
Show me your love
A potion guaranteed to bring
Que eu sinta, que eu fale
It's tougher than diamonds and it's stronger than steel
Don't make me laugh
And feel forever blue
Nobody sees her here, her eyes are slowly closing
She wandered through the garden fence
Forget what we're told
Don't let me go
Fire is burning me inside out
And they are arriving in vast numbers
Then I opened up my eyes and found that we're right back where we were
I know who you're waiting for
See you in my dream
Slide under his door
Around our heads
I know the world is upside down, I know the world is upside down
I know romance is not in fashion
If we can't see now we might never see
Well I drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
Paper ring
Running down the road
Pull back, let go
Oi P it's your round
Shining light
Who find another place to shine
I'm a lovelorn shepherd  lightening skies
They're complicated people leading complicated lives
I should have known
I gave them all to someone else
To make things better
For I am overhtrown
And I know that you don't understand the fullness of My love
But I loved you much more, baby
Instrumental
Till the morning breaks
Over the ocean
Kypris took the horses by the bit for the morning ride
Drive me insane the danger of love
In his head, he said 
She's on her way
Oh you look pretty swell in your new position
See we losin' this world we love
See how it stands
I love you so
But it's nothing to pathetic
And you, you could deny me
It got me ready to set off the riot
Although a tear may be ever so near
I know these dreams seem make believe
I'd like to say to you
Let's all just relax
Feel the love inside
And I brought it home to you
Yeah but you don't care
You let me know that this was my chance
And clap for the songs
It's ringing
From all the way across the country in palm springs,
You lift my spirit, take me higher, make me fly,
His hand on his breast
Just when you get on a roll
I was waiting outside
Will when the winds of change pickup
Staying for a lie
These bones are all you own
As a dull chill came down over me
I know I'll find my way, back home
Could you take away my weakness
Endlessly a beast for thee
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Like drinking, smoking, cursing, sucking
Forever now 
Oh pilot, can you help me
I hastened to make my reply
And stars that fell
Or to have the time again
Here to make papes off this land corporation's rape
In this moment of tranquility
And Heaven, Earth are roaming in a spin
It's all over man, you're gonna make it out
Why do we need someone, really need someone
Oh get out, get out of your house 
I know I owe it
Could never soothe you
But found that I could only lie
Your shoulders
This little dream might fade
I can see, it in your eyes,
I'll keep stealing, breathing her
To find my way to you
Where you placed me in the spring
When you used to be my friend
It's the season of scars and of wounds in the heart
Gives in return a wondrous yearn of a promise almost seen
Fear makes us visual
And I feel bad for you 
So I'll buy another pickup line and sigh
All my veins and bones
Cowboys and Indians, puppydogs and sandpails
And you're drinking down the Eau de Cologne
We're all stilted vechiles 
Und die Liebe versucht zu bewahren
I heard the phone ring
empty space until  
And oak bend not for me
If you would be so kind
And in the unstoppable camera of my mind's eye,
Let the sun set,
To no real father of mine
And all I know is spilling out into the ground
A freakfreak, y'all, and ya don't stop
New winds blow taste like the cold 
Hard to forget all the moments when
From day to day
We're simple minds
Sunshine in my heart
Like nothing's wrong
Show your love
My body's sending promises that I cannot keep
Se fosse facil achar o caminho das pedras
No one's gonna say it did not take place
I know that the sun shines better
Na it's your round
Every time you look away
Think I'll kick it down the street
Like a page from truelove stories
Coming back from work
Solitary man
To keep her feet on the ground
And over the streets of the city
Don't need a reason, don't need to believe"
And work your line
It begins with your family
I can depend
They have no choice
You can heal, can't watch you fall
You approached me in a strange car
When I left they were sleeping
Where was I when you screamed
Dass sie es wert sind zu bleiben
My love was strong
Everything This is the tic in the heart 
Turn of your phone and bring some sheets
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
We'd be sitting there hoping it would never end
Picture you on the floor
The empty streets
st Avenue is turning grey
The sky was yellow
The cattle dreaming
Just to feel at all
There'll be a soaring voice for our silent pleas
'Cause when I'm gone it will be too late
And weary eyes are clear
The best part of being with you
Like Christmas past and you and me
When the music's over
But we still live on, we live on
I'll try to understand this
Can we walk in hope
And banish all the dark
Tell me that you love me
Remember that old fireplace
Make mistakes like only I know how
A lonely day, lonely day
Not alone in the dark
Rhythms we expressin similar to our ancestors
You'll find the sun comes shinin' through for you, oohhooh
Now my head's come off
Uprises the moon
Oh, now what I need, what I need
You were born with a heart that can never be filled
I heard them say today it's time
I need your grace 
This noose around our kiss,
Eleven stories on
Of horny girls with New Jersey hair
All of this ends when I am done
They all are here
Spends his money foolishly and not on me
The faded flowers
There's no door
In all of those years
Each night cause your place isn't far
The afternoon handovers by the swings
You've made your mind up anyway
Every day is full of fun and family spies
No one will ever be like me 
Desire is burning me inside out
Alot of cats here still can't bang
Rennblautur Allur rennvotur Engin gummistigvel Hlaupandi i okkur Vill springa ut ur skel
And then some
dass man wei��, dass man druber hinweg kommt
I woke alone
But you wouldn't move
Goodbye Johnny
She makes herself a drink and she climbs into bed,
All that winter we shared a cold
Thought endless
Look back and you find
To steal away, the time is right
There's no price I would not pay, no
It's all over, just like that
There'll be a fire burning in the temple of our peace
We watched it go round and round
While we stand swearin like we in front of judge who
And that's why the guns burst
That you might show is dressed in several of your wife's clothes
There will be an evolution of the human soul
I never think about the last
I heard the news today
Slow down, you don't need to move
But years brought tears
And some birds tremble
Around the world we feel the love that we say hey
You can't use it, life
I need you by my side girl
Mark, can you go home
I dropped him off and drove on home 
To the heart of the world
Cause there will come
Broken windows and empty hallways
So take me away
Cause that's just life
On my hands and knees
Watching tides and season change
These veins are drying me up 
I felt so lonely
This was all too familiar, but I've never been on this side of things
Long gone, gone
Right here what we gonna do is go back
Like bobby gave Whitney a rock but it wasn't no ring drinks party
It ain't the way it works
The fire held the shadows close
Crosseyed again
The candle in the window continues to burn
Next up, when I get loose with no fail
Now I don't know what I'll find,
A Coke or some sort of assorted beverage
Niggaz want they reperations, How you calculate the amount to be paid
And in our place
Ther's no need to argue for better position
Oh it's just not fair
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
A man who wasn't sad at all about what's going on
Is thinking of your face
It was cruel
And a flying fish
Shadows take us here in this ballet
And out in the distance saw the highway far away
And I turn
You've stolen my heart and it hurts me to remember
No need to tell me that we're through
I don't quite know
Bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
That held the room in warm embrace
Desperate it seems but I can't breathe
I know it feels good, so good, we should tonight
You knew this from the start
Away
If it's too hard, be honest
Next time you feel it  it might make you mad
Somebody told me that Delta's brownskinned, AKAs' lightskinned
To get her back I had to sweat her
Makes me feel so far away
You'll bring home the frame
Bob Marley would be disturbed from his rest
To remind me
You're spring to me
What you hope to gain
Smoked out rotisserie turning
It's all over now, baby blue eyes
And leave us standing x
Seeing you in my dreams
Trying to keep time
Through caverns all cluttered with age
You hardly know me
The st time I saw you
In your freefall from the ground
There you were, by my side
Beauty's got a hold on me
And I didn't see the way 
Memories of my brothers racing through my mind, and soon I know we'll all be together again
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see
I've never climbed the highest mountain
When you're kicking in the courtroom
Are we the parts
You got here too late, it's always so
This ain't the way that things go
Oh, the perseverance of your life
The voice from up above says
He tells her he's sorry, she says over and over
Now the days all look the same
It's Saturday
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
She's a secretary in the daytime
You are the best your the best
Breathing, oh
"Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child"
I looked at you and saw it's time
Meanlaughing too long this way
And then in the darkness she'll quietly say "Dear
And he says, 'I know about your son'
Stay for life, for life
You try to stay calm
Don't look down, don't look down 
Take my eyes and help me see
Reefer is cheaper and the sex is slow, c'mon
I'm tripping on words
You've never really known
You can stay
We independent, I'd sign on the line
I thought someone had died
Through someone else's eyes
Hope and peace from far here after
Tough you're pleading come save me
But I'm always on the run, run, run
Never mind if it could be worthing
And I'm a wreak havoc, little man with a big pen
Tracey Gold  what have you done girl 
Giving herself a chance there's no need to show her how it should be
I miss you sweet sister
From the ancient Hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures
Anna Rose it makes my heart smile
Hey lush have fun
Where hope is currency and death is not the last unknown
Get up girl, sing for me
And I don't know if I can take you seriously
All the roads that once were right
I'm tryin' to change the world
Come into the light    I'm here
Here comes your girl
Fragrant and free
I'd never find a face 
And say to you again
When will you show your love
At the two red holes
The Dark Island
But I can't even take one breath
Live on every street
Nothing could tell the power of your smell
Don't you know
I've been living my life
She walks away
With no connection I saw your reflection at home
No one will ever be like me
Oh, at least put some hope in the box for me
If God don't make mistakes
Sitting around every day
Watching the world go by
Until we're home
How can I hope to reach your love
And it's not me, but honesty, that's died
Natti came up on from chasin a dream
All the roads reach out to you
I never meant to hurt a soul alive
Missing all the cracks in the pavement
Oh in heaven, wings of angels from a dream
Anna Rose it makes it worthwhile
It's all over now, you've changed
The tidal wave they think is great
I can't hear a single word you say
If I had a nickel for every bridge that you've burned 
And her face got wet
At least a song won't cheat
Last night we went out to the orchard in the snow
I'm in the shit, kneedeep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I been all around this world
I left school, I grew my hair
To replace it with ether
While I pass you by
But all these things are now long gone
Didn't say excuse
Most don't have a clue if it goes down what to do
How many roads we've traveled
Makes this fight all worthwhile
There it flows like some magical stream
'Cause I won't beat you to the punch I'll punch you to the beat
I want to see her face once more
And all the little kids that love me make me strong
Well we are blurry lines between love and sin
A headstrong folklore strawrifle crutch
Blue bells rings
Always missed, gone wrong in a way
Cross the lines down shifting lights,
Broken hand, a broken wall
To the beat y'all and ya don't stop
I like it when I take the controls from you
A word or two, my friend
I know it was there when we were young
Glaubst du Tor, dass du linderst deine Pein"
'Cause I don't think that
Falls down in tears
This one tops the list
And put a pause to her smile 
The danger of love Drives me easy
It's always so, so
The wolves at the door can hear you now
Closer than we like
It's the one thing that I'll never finish
Like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
Tuesday flies away
Where fingers cannot reach
But look where we are
Lonely, lonely
And leave my heart for the world
Yo, I was illin'
But I'll let you know
No, no How would I know
I'm turning straw into gold and then back again
No one will ever be
It's so deep it's meaningless
Sweet summer day
There's no one answering
So we live in the city come over here
I can't say if this feeling coming over me is real
Don't stop, don't stop
Y'all know how I met her
When she started to lock herself up behind the bathroom door
There's nothing left for you to hide, my love
From that life I'm tryin' to separate
Says I don't need you physically around
Oh, just when you think that you're in control
Honestly, can I say what I mean
My heart beat like a hammer
Red lights, bumping, life is what you make it, then sorry
Tonight
And a dagger in my hand, poor boy
Or if there's anything left for us
Don't have to say you won't
The good will come out
Though what's done is done
It sounds so funny
But I better let you know
At a tin mine we do stand,
Through a moment we could glimpse an infinity
Always the ones the ones
This is all all we need
I wouldn't mind the hanging
You still land
I want you back and forth
Smile, what's the use of crying
Until you drifted from my view
There's somethin' grand coming
This plane is all I got so keep it steady now
The tallest trees stretch to the sea,
You get the people and the government
Omomukino arumononi tuite
Take my faith and make it real
I'm coming home
Just wanna know ya
That I'll never perfectly phrase
There's a distance between us
Touch the moon up in the sky, when you are mine
Some waves have borrowed all of my pain
Voice of Regina Spektor Jenny, um, I don't know if that's you, because that didn't sound like you, but you know, it's a funny world where machines could replace people Whoever that was, tell Jenny that Regina called her And PS I can't believe what he did
The truth that is in everything  that is and has been and will be
Calalily, would you make room for me in this bed
The water running through the streets and was sweet and cold
It's always in the back of your mind
It's the season of grace coming out of the void
Each year leaves its unresolving fantasies
Chasing cars 
I like your pretty eyes, and how you're afraid of the dark
In the hood is a everday happenin'
King of kings you may decide,
Come see me in my land
You were at the party
And maybe we can stay together
A ball of string unwind me
Tired and lonely I moved on from this pain
Dragged and washed with eager hands
vahvan viiden veljeksen,
And relax then maybe
Arms are braced against the counter
When the darkness surrounds them
You put resin on my heartstrings You make 'em sing You put resin on my heartstrings Make 'em sing
I had to give it away
A day when you'll silence
Drinking wine in the sunshine
I know it might sound silly but
Telling stories from the bar
I think someone should have told you that
Breakin' like a rock you grew profound
You'd work your fingers right down to the bone
Where a man is saved by a voice in the distance
And that ain't good he's always bringing me down
Feel free to hold my hand
Good days are back 
Ride past our stop
It will make you sweat like hell
I couldn't want you more
Now all you wanna do is hustle
Human kindness is overflowing
As they meet you on each corner
I hope to see her round the bend
I get on my bike
Won't you put me on top again change the odds
But eye to eye we can not see
From green and red, black to grey
But I can stand who I am and face the day straight 
Make you stay around all night
The good will come out 
Are you blind to god above
You can undo what you've done
That kitten on the patio can't get to me
When I shot you down
One of us will die inside these arms
Of my world
It never cools my temper
And don't think that you can't stop by the bar
gabbiano di scogliera
Don't bring that stuff to bed I'll touch you here
But you were something like sand
Ich werde heftig an den zweiundzwanzig Wurzeln reissen
Compassion
We believe we can't be wrong,
Just sing a song and let love shine
Love you like the rain, falls much faster
As they meet you on every corner
Was to always need him
Or needed some advice
Voce veio me ver
You know that the one place
I guess all good things have to end All things will never be the same I just wanted you to know To know that doesn't change a thing
I do it for your love
I can't feel a thing
I got this feeling that it's gonna be alright
Because there's some thing's
Blood red lips, lovely smile
Forever blue 'cause you love her
All my all my life 
I saw a man x
And realized that we are only one
I go away, go away past the hills, past the day
Mesmo sabendo que a Opala nao e plana
Then maybe we can stay together
If it's always in fun
They carried us off and laid us in the city to let the public see of our defeat
My seven fears all fear of me
I say this not from hate;
As I grew up I worked real hard
So being benificent, I bless 'em with dialogue
Not all the heat from the sun
The th time I saw you
They have seeped to son
I don't give a shit
Will set me free
I always went wrong in the same place
I feel sincerely you're too much 
So as not to get all screwed by methods here and after devised
No need to live in a lean to your troubles must be seen to
Muneno kodoo takameru monono yoni
Ich werd's nicht lassen, nie will ich sie vermissen
I can't heal those scars 
Oh kind friends
The forests brooding
And burning bright reminds us
To allow my hand 
Hussle on the Side was the cut
I won't lower my eyes 
Are you of muscle or of love
Speed thrills, but beauty knows your name
Your body waiting
And smash them like glass against the wall
Verse  Evidence
Won't cut the weekend short 
You know it's waiting for you, so put on your shoes and
There was a time
But it's only cryings that come up in the air
Don't understand or see my plight
So let it rain
Well it's all I know, although I know,
Everybody tryin' to rap faster than the master
Yes, I gave my life away
Tracey Gold  my heart's in a whirl over you
To the start where I know
Just forget me
You roll your eyes
But this is what you did What you did to me
It's the season of cold making warmth a divine intervention
You're looking for the light
A dog dish and an Afro pick
Remind my soul uh
I've got a thing, to myself; where do you end
And forget all this confusion
And I was the one who was so impressed
And she's dreaming of Terry, a mechanic,
But now I can't work out what I'm supposed to do
I study I know the scriptures but nowaday ain't it vicious
We were married on a rainy day
And heaven knows it isn't that much
My bedroom feels just like a parking lot
Darling boy, I always adore ya
A fairy land where no one else could enter
Are you rich or are you rough
May he rest in peace and get on with
Down all the years, down all the days
gabbiano di scogliera,
These arms of mine 
Catch it's breath a stream of life,
And in a rare, certain light
But as a friend, not as a brother
Don't cover eyes
Beautiful things get run down
Lift them off your eyes
How we kill ourselves slowly
I sang you all my sorrows
Oh, the sisters of mercy
A conversation on the phone
Oh how the times have changed us 
That I've never, had such a feeling, there's this, how much better can all this get
No, it's getting me down
Where the river splits towards the sea
The time we were great before the self hate
Just my dream
But the days they just drown me
And I was away just for a minute,
You made me spare
Love grows a fear
To just grab a hold of whatever came along
The shadow of death came undone
Hurt like a bird on a wire
So tell me how it feels
That you moved to be sure it was us
Refusing to be celebrated
They'll be blue skies in a better world, darlin'
I cry and you cry
You did your best
A little off track, feelin' no one shared the frame of mind
They said that she was a facility A dream
It's the season of eyes meeting over the noise
Had to take matters into my own hands
You want me Well, you've got me
Ich hab den "Mir geht's viel zu gutBlues", den "Mir geht's viel zu gutBlues" Seid ihr down mit uns, seid ihr down mit uns Seid ihr down
Though what's gone is gone
Take up your hands
Lay me down, now
Birds are leaving over autumn's ending
Outlook's bleak
When I try and do what's right
You call me back but hold on
Date back I go beyond check the holy Qu'ran
It's all around, it's all the same
My disgusting habits end
To get through to you
I didn't pull away
And stand in your glory
Now I breathe on
Forget foolish pride
Ooh, U gonna get satisfied real soon
For me you are the one
You can see there's not a wrinkle on my face
And this is the road I walked on
Listen awhile, and I will sing to you
CD cases broken in a desperate chance to find the perfect ballad
She knows what she needs
o que no pasa nada, hoy ya entre los dos
Around every single corner
Well you've done enough to prove us all
Don't you waste me in the ground"
You're more alive than this
I'll be the bright side of your bad nights
The sunlight feeds
Darling boy I've never known ya
Take, take, take my bones
She knows that Terry will be calling soon one day
You reached for my hand slowly
It wasn't me who was looking at you
I seize an opportunity 'cause they don't linger
Help me to discover what it is you're thinking of, ooh
Big eyes laughing
With another man 
All their pretty colours are gone
And I've heard it said that a man would swim the oceans
As my life turns 
Oh Lord, could you save my soul
You find a line that's in the sand and figure out who drew it
This year
Days to enjoy, peace I knew once before me
Let the time go
I know you're still in love with me
It's time to escape the shame,
I'd change for anyone
Put our book back off the shelf
This would help I know
Now a bee in a birds nest never made no honey
Give 'em back to me
Won't you sing along
Sometimes it's bad
That's the way to treat a friend
Someone asked Who do you think you are
I don't rewind to try to find disses
And wild is the wind
On the living road
I think back in the day, I absorbed everything like a sponge
You lift me higher, take my spirit, make it fly,
Yeah Comes on strong Yeah baby, baby, baby, baby, baby Comes on strong Don't you know my blood is raging Comes on strong Darling, darling, darling, darling Comes on strong I'm tired of all my failings Bring me close and burn, burn, burn, ha
It's not some blessing in disguise
I'm begging you on scabbed knees
You will be all alone
When the Reflection joint is done
He found a place where he could settle down 
I could spend eternity inside your lovin' flame
We overcome in sixty seconds with the strength we have to together
Sem sair do sofa, deixar a ferrari pra tras
The math of infinity and reason
But when I think of all your advice
I'll be the last to let you go
And your friends
On a hilltop high above
I know it's been done having one girl who loves you
But I walked upon the raging sea
Clear the way for all your private memories
It ain't gonna stop the world
Here tonight
Dawning to dusk on the hills until morning
You've been missing
Let me reach, let me beach on the shores of Tripoli
Don't look up to the stars above 
When the enemy walks in your land,
You still float
If I didn't know
Die like a fly with no lover to sigh
She's gonna make you do right,
And I'm shaped by my storming
Girl I don't want lose
In the rain than moods that seem so potlucky
I can't change, I don't wanna change
Were you praying at the Lares shrine
I don't want to stand still
I'm tryin' to get through to you
So She bites her lip,
These sounds, they seem to write themselves
I've seen it's ugly face
Goodbye now, goodbye now
Where's my bodyguard
Bringing back sweet memories
Of great god Mars
"Make It Up" We can make it better
Don't you see we're all hurt the same way 
Don't be afraid to be young and free
I remember all those winter days
I must be coming down with
It's over
By the time you hear this, I'll be basking in African sun
For grace to be regained or won
If you close your eyes
I'll come in glory
Why then we'd see the forest for the trees
On hunting ground 
Piece of mind, some kind of love, my love
Won't cry
Make mistakes like we know how
See you in my dream tonight the danger of love
Mesmo sabendo que a dor cartesiana
Faces of the day
I face your eyes
I'm feeling lower than the Nile in May
A witness or a love
Shed your light
Suffa MC came to take you home
And that will make you feel good
I'll get the nerve up to put my arm around you
We're deep in discussion
And I gave you a music box
Still healed, so far
And when I pray it's all begun
And I pray it lifts us higher
And when your hour
We pass on by
I did them all to someone else
It can never be done
But there's nothing can keep me from loving you
I've been loving you a long time
Oh, I've lived on top of my own words
I've got this notion that it isn't what it seems
I think of you today
Today I woke up hurting
Vander dig om och gar nu
He said I'm getting wet
I'll make every face 
See how lifeless life can be
Where everyone becomes afraid of you
At the stage of the game
We can sit in uncomfortable seats and eventually
Good night, sleep tight the danger of love
She thinks back on her working day,
Do not leave me dancing alone
Another day, another flight
Well I can't compare
Causing sensations rollin' through me Comes on strong, feels just like a spell Sensations rollin', turnin' from me to you Causing this aura of heat to swirl
From the tongue of a liar
From an old rusted chair
In the deepest ocean, the bottom of the sea
To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays
To my choice seems too small
Hey lush have fun haven't you had enough
My remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
And talk your line
Asleep beneath the buzzing light
How I feel
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
It don't matter to the sun
It's what's playing through the in flight radio
She can travel back in time
Beautiful shadows in my mind
The skies are falling down
All right, let's do this
I know I'll never ever ever be alone
If I can't get you outta the streets
Of the apples falling down
That your hour now is late
Nevermind your soul
I told you that I'd be right back
Wouldn't mind the hanging
Today I saw a flag roll by on a wooden box
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
If need be I'll send someone asearching
I was too drunk or too young 
Baby, can't you see I just wanna getcha satisfied
When you wanna be free
On distant shores of night
Just when things seemed the same, and the whole scene is lame
The best is being done, but they're stronger and faster than we are,
'Cause I've waited, forever, to know
If we can't save ourselves, then let's save the kids
Like remind my soul remind my soul
To the place before I ran away and found I'd lost my track
Melody day where have you gone
But everybody knows this time
You said 'jenny, you look better on the ground'
Of the seagulls in flight,
We can make it to Mexico city,
So our youth don't get played out for fools
We knew we had to go
And a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
How we kill ourselves slowly
The morning desert sun was at her back
Then Joseph took Mary all on his right knee
I need it
Resting on joy that abounds without ceasing
Been such a long time
Du bekommst was du brauchtest
I love
Or breathing in
'Cause whatever you seen be it debit or green
Letting go, this is the end of romance
bis aus dem Sauseln die Antwort mir weht
Love of love, love of life and giving without measure
There was no one else around
And from time to time 
The touch of a hand, to heal yourself
The little nymphs dance in her hair
Share your compassion
When it gets hold of you
Before you were born, before you had hair
Ceiling changes
And arrow to the heart
