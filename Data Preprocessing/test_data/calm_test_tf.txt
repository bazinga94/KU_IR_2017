There'll be blue skies, there'll be true love
Forget all that has happened and wail down on your knees
Oh how the times have changed us 
Turn on your radio
'Cause you are my brother  my brother under the sun
Fiberglass funny face up on the wall
Alot of cats here still can't bang
There you were, by my side
Deep underwater
Going on  we've got it going on
Just to be with you, I'd give anything
Stare at you without a care 
And in the unstoppable camera of my mind's eye,
We have no time for another song
When Joseph and Mary were walking one day
Says I don't need you physically around
It ain't the way it works
But I would rather wallow
Into the stars
From the mind which is one of Allah's best designs
And turn back the clocks, 
And I'll let you know
I've started a new life
My Arms wound around you tight
Tell me what you see today
And it's not me, but honesty, that's died
But not fast, fun filled with laughs
If you close your eyes
Life is ending
It's funny when it's not funny at all
I woke through clouds of syrup
And my heart is on the line
And breath in all that's Autumn,
I know it might sound silly but
Love of my life
On you I can depend, yeah, yeah
I really am a lucky man
Anything can happen in life
Was good for a while 
The children
Asleep in the archways,
We fall
Across my neck
We're going down, we're out of sky
And no matter, how long I try to get it
I can't stand the thought of you alone
Neighborhood watch x
See we losin' this world we love
Time stands too still
Or anyone
Now that you'll stay by his side
I found my mind was also bent
And talk your line
There are good times to be had
Would it still hurt you
From the ancient Hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures
Eyes forward
huoneessa on pian kaksi lintua
You know last night, remember when I tried to choke you
Something's going to break on the inside 
I know it doesn't seem that way
I've got your voice on tape
I'd do it all 'til the end
The rd time I saw you
He moved around and we kept
and him disrespectin women so him disrespect himself"
How I died upon the cross for your sins
Red, blue and yellowgreen I love you
She found a message on her typewriter, It's like a dream
Cause every inch you see is bruised, yeah
You feel the same way I do
Among the crumpled tissues white like daisies fell like soldiers dead determined
The gingerlady by my bed
Sometimes working  till ,
And you said, "Just 'cause we can't see them doesn't mean that they're not there
Hold your breath, dear 
So I gave up and said alright
That I wanna get you satisfied, oh yeah Satisfied
Eu nao entendo a sua indecisao
All you have left is hanging on you
You'd work your fingers right down to the bone
You were beside me all around
I go away, go away past the hills, past the day
Give you muscle, tone and tears
My brain's in a swirl over you
In the arms I'll lick ya spirit with my miracle whip
Harken to the fire
For now it's gone
A headstrong folklore strawrifle crutch
Baby you're no train, you're the track
And I been tryin' to play the cowboy to rustle in the dough
To the start where I know
You're easy
And some birds tremble
Sometimes elections depend on the absentees
Fire is burning me inside out
That you can not love me anymore
Die like a love when you killed a dove
Say come and get me I am home
Sometimes I ache, babe
As free as a bird in the breeze
When the music's over
I cherish my free time
How many dreams you've chased
Power of your way the danger of love
I know that ain't a part of the deal
And at home on Wednesday morn
We laid the path so you got a way in
You will ride the lights alone 
She said it feels so good to me
You said that you was gonna stop
You're everything I like and everything I despise
And it's the same sad song coming back again
To help him through the night
Where do you wanna go
Nape of his neck
No reason to complain and nothing to fear, they always will be
Burial ground 
A teen age lover who said
You won't feel nothing until you feel
By his bedside table
Oh, I hope you run into them
Oh this feeling is marrow deep
And she closed her eyes and said
The wind was whistling all its charms
Surely the sky'd be different
We crabs in a barrel, you ain't gettin out until I do first
And heal yourself, you can heal
A season comes and whispers life,
You be boy and I'll be girl and
Be my bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
I may be wrong, but I thought we said
And it sure feels right
Jag vill att du gar nu
Oh, the perseverance of your life
So tell me how, how to reach your love
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
I know my boy struggled with that for over half his life
Think I'll kick it down the street
When you got your new number
Letting go, this is the end of romance
Yo, yeah
Deep inside of me  I know there's got to be
Everything is yours, nothing's mine
I hope they'll keep the pace
But in my heart I knew I
Vielen Dank fur die wei��en Lilien und das gute Buch
Over the ocean
Each time we start to speak
Another day, another flight
See how lifeless life can be
I guess you've gone under again
Some waves have borrowed all of my pain
I know who you're waiting for
Roll like a circus clown, put away your circus frown
I see you're still breathing
Every night go out full of carnival desires
So went the dream of the drowned submariner
Well I drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
Out on the balcony  she waits for me 
I knelt by the water like a doe by a stream
He couldn't stand to see his mother in love 
Through a moment we could glimpse an infinity
But back home I hope she knows how much I care
Oi it's your fucking round man I got the last fucking round
Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way
You sure you want to be with me, I've nothing to give
I hastened to make my reply
That I, that I never, never gonna let you go
To take you home
In a little box
Power of love will keeps you home at night
A ghost of a roar, from the dry floor
Like the whispering wind it makes you all mine
That died too
And a bird in a hive sang no song
Closed circuit, checking the street
Share your compassion
To see her son Louis leaving home
I had it to here being where love's a small word
We could be we should be in love
Like the first time I saw KRS live, rockin' it
We've got a lot of time
We don't wanna face it
As they break your head all is silent
How to reach your love ooh yeah
Then running and sweating
Let your love rain
Work, stress, and sweat, this life is a test but
Sitting on the sidewalk
And wild, oh no,
Messin' up stuff and doin' things wrong
When she left her home
'Cause life is on the outside babe
You know you rock my world and
Though our troubles seem like mountains
There must be a time 
I know it's been done having one girl who loves you
Reach out and hitch a ride and float on by
"Go to bed" she said, "I can't stand you 
A doctor or a lawyer man
And morning
Makes this fight all worthwhile
But he left my life just a little too soon
That day that his phone
You could be the one to chase my blues away
This old world just keeps spinning round, spinning round
In yourself within yourself 
Make the time for all your possibilities
I drift away in a sunken state
We will find a black and white in the gray
And we will be as one god
Whichever way you'd like to place them
Then Joseph took Mary all on his right knee
Cause that's just life
Days to enjoy, peace I knew once before me
And you love to let me down
Now our hearts are locked up tight again
Just put everything on some song on the radio
Broken sky, heartaches that flowers won't mend
Let it rain now
New tears to cry
On my hands and knees
I've been loving you a long time
I see raincoats and newspapers
Can anybody else feel it
Better we can bring it on up, we can
You've got the saddest face
Be my friend
Million different pieces
That's been closed up for the night
I have a dream, no I have a wish
Desperate it seems but I can't breathe
Footsteps on the ocean bed
Just give your heart and your love, to whom ever you love
I przykrym migotem zastawek, powiek co dry
I'm a lovelorn shepherd  lightening skies
Your lips Your undulating hips Squeeze me oh so tight Fulfill me through the night
Girl who will stay and won't play games behind me
It's always so, so
They carried our boots past the naked little trees
Everyone uses to celebrate
This is New York City and the ice is thin
We can reach, we can beach on the shores of Tripoli
Wish I had not held hands
I ran to the ocean, washed the blood off of my hands
And if anyone will try to tell you that
Take my faith and make it real
We still have a while to go
I'm waiting to feel
Gotta fall with a clear head does it make you cry 
Jag vill att du gar
Here against the grave
I was but a sad breath
Their rhymes are designed to dis us, but why dis us
Tired and lonely I moved on from this pain
Starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy
If I don't wanna know  what's written inside me
Till I discover baby, the land beyond expertise and chastity
Go all the way, you knew you could
The things we discovered inside
They didn't understand
Shower me whit your love
So I took a ride away from the city
With a jukebox in my head
Songs for life's lost lovers 
I'll sing this song and feel all right
Even though it's hard to see because you just blinded me
I know you love me, if it starts to sting
So long, so I would like to say goodbye
Before you were born, before you had hair
And I can't compare
First time that I ever saw you
Of the apples falling down
Right here what we gonna do is go back
Give a little time for the child within you,
Me in my pictures
I won't cover my face 
The deeper I swim the more I know,
You know that the one place
Gets herself a seat on an interstate greyhound
We'd see the blessings in disguise
Happily a beast for thee
Bluest water falling down
But I can't promise anything
So roll on
I love you
For my love is like the wind
Washed away the empty space inbetween my ears
Hearing of a blind cat, vision of a deaf man
The mountains may reach past the sky
How is it that you noticed
Baby doll can I call in a favor
It was a lovely day
I can wait I can wait I can wait
The oilclouds see it's only time
No, the sun is gonna rise, gonna rise
And all the little kids that love me make me strong
Like the sun goes way low
I've been walking in the same way as I did
I don't rewind to try to find disses
We're at the top of the world
And stood still beside eternal flame
And round
Neurons realign till the feelin' is fine,
Speed kills, but beauty lives forever
What a thing to lose
So let the dead bury the dead
So won't you walk with me to the park up the road
You were right, I was wrong, so wrong
But look where we are
I'll let you know
So many times with thighs and sighs
The shadow of death came undone
All on a beautiful sky, I'll be
I looked at you and saw it's time
Stop at the warning light, see it flash brightly
So I can kick my feet and bang my head silently
And you're the best thing I ever knew
Didn't meet because of fate but rather probability
Oh, the stars, they shine so bright
Well, I'll be gone tomorrow
'Cause I've got some kind of disease
All the wasted years forgotten
Where the stream joins the ocean,
Well a train blows a whistle before it pulls away,
You text me back but hold on
I never meant to hurt a soul alive
As a younger child
If your not in my life
And the browns, reds and golds of autumn lie in the gutter, dead
Waterwheels turning
But I need you to make that change
Shining light
And you'll turn with every change
She says carry on, carry on
Special times we had
Need someone to whom I can belong
So much work
Reaching up to the light on the waves
Just sing a song and let love shine
Of tears across your fingers
So She bites her lip,
She's a working girl now, and Mummy lives so far away,
You are the best your the best
Mark, can you go home
Building on the city street
You know it took me a long time
'Cause it don't matter to the sun no, no
I'm just tryin'  get U  think about doin' things
I'm learning to live with the guilt of remembering
Feels like I'm strounded in an ocean of grave uncertainty
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Wearing different sizes
Piece of wood to follow
You will, yeah
Watching the world go by
Take my life and let it be
The first thing that happened was the river overflowed
What's this odd game that's all over the airwaves
He's just a friend
When there no nowhere, no place anywhere they can go
She's got the abilities
And the light rains down
Eleven stories on
But we're not watching it, we're hardly focussing
You see the sign that this was time
There was a time
And I'll be dead and gone
What a thing to choose
You need to send it to me again
The sun shines brightly every day I'm without you but I love, love, love you like the way that I used to do
Catch it's breath a stream of life,
Get a collection of all the music and everything we've ever done
Hang me, oh hand me
Leave nothing to imagination,
Your love bring the sun in me
They happen all the time
The brightest star
Tearing out your lungs
Gotta fall with a clear head you know they're alright
I'm always free to walk
And she knows that she loves him, but does he love her
Like a place I can feel but never will see
Of what life can bring to us
Your watching the door
It's time for us to fade
I had to give it away
We believe that we can't be wrong, yeah
You'll bring home the frame
And deep within the earth you heard the sound
And heaven knows it isn't that much
What are we fighting for
Laid him six feet under the clay
Light of the night
Running down the road
I'm fake to all these hardcase kids
I should be riding on a float in the hit parade
Relief from all your suffering'
Let the night come
Them boys may be better, to grow I had to let her Never
In the deepest ocean, the bottom of the sea
I'll keep stealing, breathing her
You just made new friends
Did your blue eyes peacefully
And from time to time 
But all these things are now long gone
To see her son louis leaving home
Stand up like mama raised me alright
And the morning sun must rise
Shows that we are united
My heart is beating
Was as easy as the run
We are a billion fragments
Give the world a chance to say
Wonderful when she's close
Into darkness from an empty room
Everything she does is right
Wherever you hear  the wind in the canyon 
And Heaven, Earth are roaming in a spin
Please just let us go insane
You say I give it all away,
Like every inch of me is bruised, bruised
And when your hour
Still born again into golden dreams,
To lie around
They connect in the afternoon
C'mon; Tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts
Staying out 'til  o'clock and singing like a fool
But I'm lost, way down inside, so tell me again
I will toil for years and years
But now it's something that we don't discuss
From the diner up the road
Swim a lil' bit, dance when we back on land
Father your failures are so grave,
You can feel the strength returning to your bones
Fire burns in me eternally time's eternity
My pack is waiting 
I know that the sun shines better
And banish all the dark
Sleeping in the sun
And I'm the one to forget all about you
Honey, I wanna fly, 
And in his arms I find always get that kind
Actually, nothing's new under the sun
You should run from me, fuck battling, ain't nothing sweet
Away
I'm still in love
Last Saturday
There's so much sun where I'm from
Where was I when you lost all your dreams
This one's gonna bruise
Take, take, take my bones
And a dagger in my hand, poor boy
If the sun shines right I might be here all day
Show me your kind love
But I know it's something you can't steal
If need be I'll send someone asearching
Fall down, you don't have to lose yourself over this
Lift them off your eyes
Maybe tomorrow go out and play
The wolves at the door can hear you now
But I'm sure it's only lies
Groove zu dem Beat, den Sepalot gemacht hat
I'd never find a face 
Just like it did poor me 
Here with all my vices I
When it feels like you've been cancelled
I'd always let you get your way
But black and white
Let me try to understand
Sunny day no one is here
She's a secretary in the daytime
If love is a danger, should we avoid it
And maybe this good thing's gonna happen today
The water running through the streets and was sweet and cold
And I really don't care
Holding yourself with a grace that defies
And wild
The phone rings, it's early, it's seven o'clock
Oil is the spice to make a man, forget man's wealth
Between my first breath and resting in peace
Oh, oh yeah
I could remember from way back in the day
Some day I'll be an old lady
She's my oblivion  it's to her I run 
Ooh, you know you rock my world and
Alright
We're on the top of the world
Sometimes you sleep while I take us home
Bye, I send you all my regards
Old songs to sing
These sounds will never leave you
But this world was too much for you
When it feels like fear
And leave my heart for the world
She gonna make you do right
One phone call, my world alone
So I'll fall again
Where a man is saved by a voice in the distance
Our bubble's got it covered
Friday evening and the drinks we pass around
I had a dream  of the pale morning sky 
You don't have the time for the least hesitation 
Let's pretend that we never met 
A modern Venus on the th floor
Here is really just a matter of time
She needed cheddar and I understood that
Tryin' to be prepared for the YK
How had we forgotten
Please pick up the phone
So read your books and stay out late some nights, some nights
Telling stories from the bar
To let the temperature from the very heart of the sun
It only made my torment worse
With a mouthful of sex, like drugs
Praying for just one kiss
Skar the fire son, pet the smiling one
Think your on Pressure's level Only thing tight bro
And we drove away
Who find another place to shine
To the lady by the sea
In the morning rain there are no clouds
Over the hills and horizon
Especially nothing, mainly nothing
I'm tripping on words
I swear I didn't mean for it to feel like this
Above the bar the TVs are showing the game
I'll always side with you
And each one of course is
If you, you just smile
You're digging a hole in your neighborhood
That is graceful and green as a stem
Lookin' back it seems I always been a step behind
She says, "Wake up, it's no use pretending"
It has never been done
If you turn back the clocks, 
Tonight see you in my dream
Am carried to you tonight
Now, when no one knows me,
Walk a windy weather day, feel your face blow away
It turned out she wanted more all along
I know I'd find my way, back home
Flying invisibly high, watch me
With rivers of sun glow just beyond the plateau
And looks just like the sun
The street lamps
Cowboy boots
Go down the backroads 
All their pretty colours are gone
But a hole that peasant left with his cannonball fun
Una broma de Dios
Don't need a reason, don't need to believe"
You got here too late, it's always so
I love
Then a man drove off in a bright white Cadillac
They'll put you deep in the dust dust, my niggas creepin' on ah come up come up
Past borders with waters as clear as your glass, so
'Cause that's the time you must keep on trying
I think my kids would mind
If I can get him outta the streets
You're my sweetness, my baby, my love for all time
Right here on earth upon this turf, earth is spinning round
When the good will come out 
But I guess I'm livin' dreams
Would you wanna see a movie with me
Endlessly a beast for thee
And leaves from my fingertips, unfurl
We've drunk too much, and woke up everyone
When my life is through
Questions swim around your head
It's my legacy, we can't let it stop us uhuh not now
And I think it's going to rain today
Feelings come and go  I've never known
The right place
Because you and I
Put our book back off the shelf
Pain on pain
Till Winter stays
People die so I don't have to be a runaway slave
Smile, though your heart is aching
Those are the soaring kind
I number yourself among them
Neither real nor pretend
I remember too
You can try to pretend nothing's wrong
I'll let you know I'll let you know
I need you by my side girl
Don't make me laugh
Where does this story go
They are
Pushing against the world
Is now the dream
But the rhythm of their steps is like a heartbeat
But every time I try it it won't turn for me
Tracey Gold  my heart's in a whirl over you
This ain't the way that things go
These arms of mine 
All around
But I don't even know what the word blessing means
Yo, it kinda make me think of way back when
I'll never end this
Through my bedroom window,
And if she feels like dancing, no one will know it
Look outside, and all I see
A passing town
Before they're swallowed up in the vastness of the open night
And I stepped into your arms
And days
That I've never, had such a feeling, there's this, how much better can all this get
Dreamy colors gold and red, dreamy colors run right through
We can one, two, three, yeah
Life is trial by fire
Seen you hanging from blistering skies
Shadows are drifting in silence
For the princess of Hollywood way
Can we walk in hope
Broken heart find your way
Ich hab' doch auch meine Sorgen, doch gerade sind keine in Sicht Ich hab' zuviel Zeit fur Stress, darum beneidet man mich Hab' ein Dach uber'm Kopf und mein Madchen im Herz und bin echt alles andere als von meinem Leben entnervt Ich mein' meine Gesundheit ist doch im grunen Bereich, bisschen Husten und Kopfweh, naja der ubliche Schei�� Nicht dank Gemuse und Reis, oder dank Kuhmilch und Saft, sondern dank genugend Schlaf, denn in der Ruhe liegt die Kraft Wenn das Wetter mich langweilt bleib ich im Bett einfach liegen, hab' noch nie 'ne Bewerbung, sondern nur Texte geschrieben Jetzt hab' ich keinen Abeits, sondern einen Plattenvertrag, und wenn ich die Burner bring' genugend Asche am Start ich mein' es reicht fur mein Leben, bin noch nie pleite gewesen und hab' eh nicht vor, den ganzen Tag nur Scheine zu zahlen Hab' ein gutes Publikum und dafur danke ich Euch, weil ich sagen muss, dass ohne Euch das Ganze nicht lauft
Don't turn on the lights
I've been looking all around to know
Scattered all over like the sun in our room
To steal away, the time is right
Your shoulders
I'll come in glory
Tracks that make you relax and recline
She's on her way
Chasing cars 
Are we the thoughts
You call and all I wanna do now
We're taught to worship these rappers and athletes and actors
'Cause you see I require love that's made of fire
Can't watch you fall
Or anyone else
Found some things I could relate with and wore out the tape
What did you think I'd find
Got so god damn hungry
To where the story ends
That sound when
Then you can't find love
No one, no one, no one has, won the war"
Like a kangaroo
And just to be with you, well, I'd give anything
The truth that is in everything  that is and has been and will be
No, won't let them get to you
A friend of the priest say she chewed out the captain
Wahle einen Ort, wahl' eine Zeit und auch die Waffen 
And like a fool I believed myself
So goes another winter slowly
I wanna fly, I wanna fly
Well I'm cruisin' El Paseo
The furthest star
She was , wishing she lived by the sun, the sand and the sea
It brings hail from old water
Anything
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
Thinking about letters, lights and lamps
She makes herself a drink and she climbs into bed,
Just wanna talk to ya
Silver starlight breaks down the night
Uch a night, it's such a night
Oh I'll give you all the colors that are left here in my box,
In order to see it
And I can't stand it, but I'm all right
We're through, let me tell ya
A lovely day eh
I'm a cabaret, a champaign cafe
On your skin
I said man you better watch this
It's too easy to go crazy
Well I can't compare
Your tears at the wedding
We can make it beter
And she's dreaming of Terry, a mechanic,
The real wealth to hold is with your health
It's like something come through me
To make amends
Today I woke up hurting
I been livin' with my chips all in and I'm still in, see
Still there's a light I hold before me
Everything This is the beating of the clock 
Cause it's only black and white and not a lot of each
And be carried from here
I used to be a part of a more complicated scheme
Young hearts will still be clean
That turns ivory into kerosene
But I hopped a couple trains, mom would cry if she knew the halfs
I knew at last it's only time
I told him that I knew Julia Roberts when I was  at summer camp
Your eyes fall like plum flowers
"Oh, let the father of the baby gather cherries for you"
Your eyes couldn't hide
Now you know that they're watching
I thought you won't be coming back
Like it's the end of the world and we'll make love
Travelled the world, came back to the crib
bis aus dem Sauseln die Antwort mir weht
Deep blues and reds
Watch your colours and watch your slang
You don't have the time for a long flirtation 
As you walked away
Strolling around and all about,
And this one is different
BoneBoneBoneBone
Right upon our lives
Oh in heaven, wings of angels from a dream
Oh yes, I would give my life away
I see flowers everywhere
Like black is beautiful, names from the seventies
Dass man wei��, dass man druber hinweg kommt
The place was all crowded but
Oh, Caroline as my witness, I never meant to cause you pain
Speed thrills, but beauty knows your name
Houses slip by, the cloud are so low
From down in the vault, down in the grave
This ain't the way it works
I tried to walk the right side of the tracks
Darlin', whatever floats your boat
I thought someone had died
Lost highway way too fast
Solomon Grundy, Raggedy Andy
The party's on mute
I'm still searching for what you can give,
She took herself out in the car
Take back
Go ahead each day
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Fly alone
In his head, he said 
Is a love not done
You set the rivers on fire 
Make it through just this day
Think I have it, then it slips through
Shine permanently only my mind's concernin me
She never wants to come back down
Alone in Miami
Watching sideways from afar,
She puts on her face, makes it a brave one
I've never climbed the highest mountain
I'm not singing for the future
Check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
I got dirty habits like a nun in a pig pen
A day when you silence
And just to be with you, I've done everything
The price of solitude 
Anna Rose sleep well tonight
But the shit didn't clear
Are we leaving life
Leaves a man with nothing
"Glaubst du denn wirklich, fur solchen Frevel ich der Lohn
I pierce my skin  I feel so real
Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouth of babes
And I love to tie you up
All I hear is what's playing through the in flight radio
You're left to stay
She walks away
It was only a matter of time like centuries
I've never swam the deepest ocean
I live alone, I live alone
Don't say a word, I'm not even listening
I narrow my eyes
We weren't lovers like that
But you force yourself to look away
You were born with a heart that can never be filled
Such a night, such a night
We both love rain
I can barely start to even wrap my head around it
Should have known there was no escape
You'll fall asleep in the oceans
Full of land
That runs in the deep
Man, I just recline and mind my business
Your former glories and all the stories
'Cause all those cold days returned with their old ways of causing
We're traveling with spiders legs
And he complicates their problems telling complicated lies
I don't know how they got there but I have a plan now
Speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
As I grew up I worked real hard
The forests brooding
Love grows a fear
Good night, sleep tight the danger of love
Dry your eyes, Face the dawn
We will always have Zack Rice 
Ohoh, ohoh, yeah, oh, yeah
The time we were great
Happy end �� �� �Ӭ� 
Because there's some thing's
Tweedledum and Tweedledee, home free
Living in pain, living in sin
Way back, yeah
And her face got wet
Today I saw the strangest thing
Tracey Gold  where have you gone girl
When it comes, when it comes
All the evidence points in one direction
"Home is where the heart is," but my heart has long been black
For the people
On boarders towers in flames 
So who are we to worry at any rate
Won't you sing along
That there's gold in them hills
From all the way across the country in palm springs,
When she started to lock herself up behind the bathroom door
Can anybody else see it
Last rose of summer is gone
Of course, it doesn't matter what you see
They stab ya neck with a feather until you've bled in my quill
It's the one thing that I'll never finish
You are the one who has lost his mind
Bluest water falling down on your skin
Where all new wonders will appear
So tell me how it feels
Undertake the spoil
They were rotting on the ground
Just like rain
Today
Even when we are apart
Not a window at all,
I don't want to shake your father's hand
They're making heroes out of fall guys
Somebody told me that Delta's brownskinned, AKAs' lightskinned
There are your wishes there are your dreams
I can't feel a thing
You know it's waiting for you, so put on your shoes and
Why everlasting love is everlasting
Cooking up a storm
Well, I've never climbed the highest mountain
I take advantage of a warm car and I reassess my lot
While you're away
End of story
Tears the seal
And he smiled and said
I run and dive into the blue,
So punch drunk they don't understand at all
Ride down our block
Now take a walk, take a rest, taste the rest
In my bedroom mirror
Just sing a song and feel all right
The sunset heavy
Jag vet nog, jag vet nog vad du tanker pa
Uncomfortable as a centerfold, yeah
Life did the rest
You said 'jenny, you look better on the ground'
We'll bunker up for days and days
And puts a pillow over the phone
And round 
We both found that we could still breathe
Of the time we were great before the self hate
The city makes a hooting sound tonight
Another world
Spirits 'round my head  are whispering
Well, there's no price I did not pay, no
Yeah, everybody leaves if they get the chance
The universe
There'll be a soaring voice for our silent pleas
And we both love rain
There's nothing left to say Our skies began to fade This is what you did What you did to me
Girl if we get this thing right
Chandeliers and seizures
A kitten on a patio is looking for me
Crowd the day with unrelated histories
I'm chiseling this epitaph on a stone that I found
Swallow down your pride 
A day when you'll silence
When I look in your eyes
Baby why stop and cling, to some fading thing 
She yelled out "Why you do this to black men"
Or to have the time again
Goodbye yesterday and goodbye me
And the weary eyes are clear
I'll load the back and you can drive
At least a song won't cheat
But eye to eye we can not see
You promised to keep me out of the rain
I'm feeling lower than the Nile in May
See, I kinda acted like a fool
It's time  send your company home and turn off your cell phone
Look out for yourself
Where a river sings
But I'll let you know
And feel forever blue
Now we are one, I'm not afraid
Light up your face with gladness
I was , alone with nothing to do and I couldn't sleep
There's no door
Out in somebody's bed
I spend time just trying to forget, 
In yourself within yourself, 
Hard to forget all the moments when
That could understand
I'll make every face 
Like all the times before
Autumn leaves
And I think I been gettin' better every passin' day
Brings you back to see the lights
You took my hand
Pull apart my body and you'll see
Didn't change that much
As heavy as hiphop is I'm always ready to drop it
But that's miles away like your smile today
A fairy land where no one else could enter
Without you, baby
But I'll spend the night out on the sea
You are safe here you know now
Any move and I could fall
To stand in your glory
And up on the wall
I had a bud of mine, I say what's going on
Paddle to the shore,
No one gets off without paying the ride
Turn of your phone and bring some sheets
For the first time
Echoes dancing in my blood to some refrain
se ti resta un sogno da buttare via
Do not leave me dancing alone
"Make It Up" We can make it
Reminding rewinding
Du wirst Tage verbringen, an denen Zahne nicht knirschen
I can wait another year
A little off track, feelin' no one shared the frame of mind
To the bar where I wish
That float through my head like a sweet melody
Is a wind that gets singing
More clouds, more rain
With a promising career
I've been growing older he thought
A million stars formed into one
Went up on a mountain
But I walked upon the raging sea
y la labor inmensa de la imaginacion
History that I arranged been regained by King James
The whole world endin' up the buck buck, pow
Can you hear my heart bake
To the huge illside
This is the end of innocence
She said teddy don't worry now mommy is here 
Spilt up all the things and move ahead
And I remember all the summer nights
So many years I have given up and now my youth seems shot
And I'll sail till morning
With submarine flowers
Now belonging to the past
You will be all alone
'Cause I'm up here running behind you
I need your loving every day and night
Voice of Regina Spektor Jenny, um, I don't know if that's you, because that didn't sound like you, but you know, it's a funny world where machines could replace people Whoever that was, tell Jenny that Regina called her And PS I can't believe what he did
Today I saw a flag roll by on a wooden box
And a storm on its knees
My eyes are smaller than my stomach is
Og eg f�� blo��nasir En eg stend alltaf upp
It's time to leave
And you stagger in headwind all day
Oven avaimenreiasta
I see the skull beneath the skin
The th time I saw you
'Cause whatever you seen be it debit or green
Never a woman on the shore
We watched the city skyline from the ferry deck
Memories are fresh
Drive crazy the danger of love
Always wake up hurting
Won't cut the weekend short 
You toe met my heel right back
I don't really mind
It makes me wonder how a black man could ever raise a child out here
And ornaments of shattered glass
Everything This is the slowrush hour 
Hours pass and she still counts the minutes
For we're like creatures of the wind
Everything I ever done
How could we have let this go
And they supposed to be bougious, so they got white friends
Move it on and let fate decide
I wanna know why it falls off and on
There's just no mercy in your eyes
Because this bubble, that you call home
It can never be done
A little girl, he gave
Find the right moment to stop the show
The owl on the roof has got it right
Jag vill att du gar nu
We said to us from our families
Forever blue
Everything happens for a reason
The neighborhood watch Is jewels and spots
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see
And out in the distance saw the highway far away
Spends his time aracing
I was the portrait of the artist as a young man
In all the things they have that we don't
Like the rain on my windows late every night
Cause even the Reverend would tell ya
To share their love and to be kind
Is there anyone I could call
I been all 'round cape Gigardeau
From icy waters
When she only talks about her son
And when we funk, we'll hear beats
I can't heal those scars 
The danger of love
On a night breeze so free lovers must collide
I can't remember half an hour since a quarter to four
You always show me
'Cause, see, boys they have a tendency of running from me
You know it's funny, got my guns better arm yourself
Follow the voice  that's calling you home 
And the cold stars shine
You approached me in a strange car
Try to get the colours right
And I'm shaped by my storming
Drift on, drift on, drift on
The plane that crashed
A donkey, a beast for thee
I want you anyway
You gave me everything
I remember when you broke your arm
Precious things unsaid
You forgot how to sing
My tail between my knees
Forget foolish pride
A carnation, 
Refrigerate your fire
Watch for criminals and watch for cops
We will take the ways of sin
I've got a thing, to myself; where do you end
The skies are falling down
A ball of string unwind me
The faded flowers
This is the end
All around cape Giradeau
I'm on my way looking up today
And we spent four days on an island
So the cherry tree bowed low down, low down to the ground
There are bodies strewn all over my bedroom floor
My mind was on other things
But I will protect myself from you
Time to close your wondering eyes
Would you take away my weakness,
All words of forgiveness useless
If you walk out that door
Is slowly recalling
All my veins and bones
With everything I see it could take a while
Are we the parts
The further I wander, the less I know what it is
Soft the skin of the warmest rust
But I've apologized to the lives I touched wrong
It doesn't have to be today
But she can't avoid judgemental
Appealing like the naked truth and the truth is for sale
And it's always in fun
You'll tell to me is glory verse
Ashes 'round the yard
Where's my bodyguard
Almost scratching heaven I
That holds on
Look at the skies up 
You've stolen my heart and it hurts me to remember
All the roads that once were right
No ending No ending
Now what'll I do living alone
Young homie think before you shoot, murdererah
And it feels like fear
Here come the darkest birds
There's no one on the line
Mommy don't worry now Teddy boy's here 
Try to spit onto the sidewalk
So tell yourself again that help is on the way
Protect your own, protect your home
Stars shine like eyes
Walk away
In case your wondering
Had to give you away
I wouldn't mind the hanging
It just might keep me alive a couple days
If it's too hard, be honest
This one is her fault
st Avenue is turning grey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly 
And stare up at the stars and moon and sky
True love is sacrifice
A different kind of truth  that sets the spirit free
Get up girl, heard you sing
Sunshine in my heart
Ever since the world began tere's been other folks like me
My throat hurts, I think I should stay in bed
No one, no one, no one has won the war"
The laser lights are pretty,
And you won't make me jealous
I can't believe she even found a way inside to drown us
The words that fall from your mouth
I can't say if this feeling coming over me is real
She's got the facilities
But Jesus, when it rains, how it pours
Seeing you in my dreams
Delowering my baby, are you my baby mate
God's one miracle 
The earth was frozen
Don't cover eyes
Our dignity and injured innocence
Hang me, oh hang me
Once you open your mouth
Take my heart, take all of me
Tracey Gold  what have you done girl 
Where everyone becomes afraid of you
Is calling me
And wake up alone
But it's nothing to pathetic
It just keeps on keeping time
Vander dig om och gar nu
Starfire tonight
Oh that magic curtained canyon where lovers dreams can lie
Around our heads
Thinks up ways to make the day go faster
It's a crazy world
Everybody wanna know what's goin' on with the Thuggish Ruggish
The crickets cry tonight
Living in the piece of ever after
In fields of green, in fields of straw
But your voice was full of hope
I made my confessions to them
With all the pages read
They said that she was a facility A dream
With a golden key
Because they're already numb from damage already done
I can see, it in your eyes,
The wild things are
I count my blessings, but you can only be expected to count so high
Alone
How can we look in to there eyes
Come back to the air 
She wandered through the garden fence
Changing everyday
The same old song, flows back again
Autumn came again and everyone scattered
Knock you to yo knees
And make this song complete
I blow 'em through battlezones with chrome for chaperone
Fashion your life like a battered wife
There's nothing to declare but us
Oh, I've lived on top of my own words
Her room mate won't listen but I 
Kissed him once you kissed him twice 
There goes a partridge and there goes a Go train
What day is it And in what month
Dawning to dusk on the hills until morning
I drift away, in a sunken state
A kitten on a patio
Listen awhile, and I will sing to you
There's a hopeless place inside my heart
Refusing to be celebrated
The cars come and go
The angels laid him away
Take me in your arms and see
Ride through the world
Where fingers cannot reach
Who gon' make it better for the thugs and Ps now
But it's gone just for a minute,
Far away on the water
Of any danger except what I might
So as not to be ripped off in ways to which they're not apprised
The basement is where we wait
Not alone in the dark
No one's gonna say it did not take place
Dream, dream, dream, dream,
The parts of you
Deflowering my baby, are you my baby mate, my baby
My love was strong
I'm in love with everything I see
Jumping off'a bridges, 
Her tenament yo, is rat infested
They're just two bitter kids from a bunch of sour grapes
Unsung unseen
Mesmo sabendo que a Opala nao e plana
I read in the papers about their escape
Kypris took the horses by the bit for the morning ride
Along the way we got off track
When the fire comes you can't strike back now
You reached for my hand slowly
But I'm onto you, boy
Soon, love, soon
Her name on the radio
Wait for the tone
Long gone, gone
Come what name in
Just to be with you, I've done everything
I bet Harriet Tubman would be turnin in her grave
We missed 'cause we were running late
Cause in his head he said 
I don't want to think about your mind
The accidents know you by name"
Leave worldly things behind
Yes, you who must leave everything
Keep yourself within yourself, 
Put some hope in the bottom of the box for me
You don't even know that when I've got it straight, now keep it in mind
This ain't the cops, It's the neighborhood watch
In his right side, oh
But she wouldn't say anything
dentro questo sogno da buttare via
She waits for me 
And everything was orange
For the first time in your life you're coming home
One day you'll just up and quit
I'm your beautiful love
So I start again, turn the wheel,
Your body waiting
Tell me the seasons is almost over
Facts of life and facts of fate
And Mary gathered cherries while Joseph stood down
Now I'm standing at the station with a lonely ticket in my hand
Que eu sinta, que eu fale
All the lights in Paris
There is a world to go through  but there's so much more to do
Have I got you a river view
Eventually, I knew I'd run into HiTechnology
Yesterday I heard you say you never close your eyes
Let us start a revolution
There's something about you now
Cause, her bestfriend's man got popped
And I'll be singing a song
I heard them say today it's time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Oh baby, baby You'll always make me hot Come on and gimme all you got
You don't remember but I was there
I dropped him off and drove on home 
In shimmering fields of gold
And niggaz wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma
I do it for your love
You've forgotten the word I love you
She was just  years old
Think of me before I'm gone
Honey come a little closer now
Still she takes me back
All the songs of Belfast
Punching and hitting
Help the needy and show them the way
There's no one answering
The howling of the bridges
The sky was yellow
Text me but you missed the call
These squinting eyes just sting me 
I wish I could hold you, I can't take it
Round and round and round 
Or needed some advice
Don't forget I love
It was  am and the light was grey like it always is in paperbacks
Hopefully new york city will lose you
Bringing on warnings of 
Give me another waking moment
I've got this notion that it isn't what it seems
I always went wrong in the same place
Through someone else's eyes
Pulling the weeds from the ground
Very brief in the night
You get the people and the government
To heal yourself, love can heal
There ain't no time for selling lies
You're just the kind of kid I could grow old with
That's when I found that your love was real
The future blows into my eyes
When the checkered flag comes down
This is a place where young lovers meet
So we could descend in the dark
There was no one else around
I came to realize my lackluster dreams
As my life turns 
Away to the westward
I'm thinking of you in someone else's eyes,
It's what's playing through the in flight radio
I won't tell anyone
Ga nu, jag vill att du ger dig av
'Cause I require love that's made of fire
 seconds till we smash into the ground
You try to stay calm
I ought to hate him but still I love him so
There's no real letter to write,
lauf' nicht fort Ich werd' nicht kommen, dich zu schonen 
I gave them all to someone else
Die, die, die on a Spanish coast
Are you of muscle or of love
This world could get you closer
Of feeling the full weight of our burdens
And I've waited, forever, to know
Just wish that I had something to show for it
But our souls lay bare
The danger of love Makes the power of your day
Would you like to be my new best friend
There's room at the bar
Looking over there lay mother and louder and louder I screamed her name,
I know romance is not in fashion
The truth will be the same  for evermore
The things you said I did so well
From that life I'm tryin' to separate
Realize the moment that you're in is magic
And tell the whole story to an answering machine
When love cuts the strings
Don't let the panic bring you down
This ain't the cops It's the neighborhood watch
A girl came in the night
It shines onto us tonight 
And the crows come 'round
Up the minds of the lines of dimes and fine
And clap for the songs
Jeste handlarzem, co jab��ko z robakiem
Crush my bones tonight
Anna Rose it's time to dream
Bidding farewell to the fears now decreasing
It's not some blessing in disguise
The times are changing fast
Leaving me a beast for thee
Till I'm nothing more than
I never can tell what's inside me
Climb the mast, 'cause I know
Regina Spektor I was hoping you could keep me company for the ride home, but it's okay if you're sleeping
But the musical box continues to turn
My love is his and his is mine
Nat Turner must be turnin in his grave
Cast on the covers of your bed
And I think in lines in rhymes, the rhyme stitches
Line by line, and shade by shade
It can be perfect hell, perfect
The room's starting to move
Faced down you can see the ground turn
That was only time
And the time has come to work it out
Wild, embroiled, young hearts depend on me
To know you give love so freely
Follow your dreams  but always, remember me 
And half the time half my crew could drink the bar
The sky doesn't cover, it swallows
The wallpaper's peeling
By the time I was half alive
End up in the closing time choirs
And the things that she cares
My disgusting habits end
And maybe we can stay together
I wish they'll let us stay
Yes, I'm on the road tomorrow
There's nothing left for you to hide, my love
To see poor Louis in a new graveyard
And I'll say the three words
And then I wasn't alone
That some of you don't understand
What you want's bad for the souls
Cause the best part's just begun
If I found a payment to be made
Going back in some time
Run down the beach kicking clouds of sand
They also felt she was a human being
Arms are braced against the counter
So easy to love you
As the MC carried on with it
Memories still lie
And everything you want you don't have
But you're still waiting on the moment breath is bated
Check out the girl in the Harbor Tunnel
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
From the round sweet apples that are rotten on the inside
Like rain out of the blue
Honeysuckle vine shine shine 
Are the wonders of this world
One more time 
The freedom will ease your pain
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Through all fear and sorrow
I could spend eternity inside your lovin' flame
We're deep in discussion
Goodbye now, goodbye now
Malcolm X must be turnin in his grave
Still healed, so far
Set your clock by your heart
You said that you were gonna stop
But only if I have the time
Well I'm here till close with fingers crossed
Love receiver  where did you go 
And, without further argument
It might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
All the wasted tears forgotten
See through money like it's paper with faces I remember
I like your dyed black hair
And I love to share the cost
I love forgetmenots, fluffernutters, sugarpops
On my heart
Shimmering straight ahead I see
You're bored with me in every way
But it keeps coming out as lies
Your kisses are now so blase
Making this shit actually happen
I'll see you some other time
I lay smiling like our sleeping children
Even though I'd prefer the lips
And turns them into sheep
Lovely day
Wish I could conjure up the shoots and ladders to bring me back
Just show me how to love you
I didn't paint it
Cross the lines down shifting lights,
And all the rings, the wedding bells
You can stay
Power of our day the danger of love
Admit it turned out okay for someone who didn't try
That sparkle in your eyes has gone
When it gets hold of you
That I don't remember 
And all the lies you said I told
I got them hazel eyes that'll hypnotize
My bedroom feels just like a parking lot
Like the hope I have for us every time
Frozen in the cold tryin' to get you home
We were great before the self hate
Here to make papes off this land corporation's rape
I hear you talking in my head
In the place where we could meet
Tell me that you love me
Closing folding like a star
The wheels that round the ground 
The one the radars lost
She fell in his arms and he caught her
But so many start off strugglin and never get saved
Wherever you go  I'll be there beside you 
I am free from all despair
Don't make me read about it babe
While you write you trials of life,
Anna Rose dream well tonight
The ring bearers, the flower girls, the I Thee Weds
Soaring majestically high and then
Manche ham'n Problem mit mir, erzahlen mir ich rede Stuss, der politisch mal so korrekt ist wie ein Negerkuss Aber hey, da schei��' ich drauf, denn ich strotz vor Lebenslust und kenn' nur Schmerzen, weil ich mir fast nie die Zahne putz Ich fuhr' jetzt schon 'ne Weile ein Leben auf der Sonnenseite, denn auf meinem Weg nach oben nahm ich die Stolpersteine Jetzt seh ich die gro��en Scheine fur meine Bombenreime und kauf' mir mein hei��geliebtes Gras nur noch tonnenweise Wenn die Socken schmutzig sind, geht's barfu�� und im Drogenrausch mir einfach ein paar neue kaufen in das feinste Modehaus  Oh der Herr sieht aber komisch aus  Ja ich hau' die Kohle raus und gibt's mal was zu tun, steck' ich den Kopf in den Sand wie Vogel Strau�� Denn ich schwimm' oben auf, ganz genau wie Fettaugen, die hubschen Madchen stehen auf mich, Dir bleiben blo�� die Schreckschrauben, doch wenn ich jetzt mal ehrlich bin, wurd' ich am liebsten weglaufen, denn ich hab echt genug vom nichts tun und Sekt saufen
The sands of time will blow my mind
Each day's the same
Piece of mind, some kind of love, my love
If I didn't know
Pretty soon they will be fighting
Fighting with our hands
It was always you x 
Anything you want
And trouble may come and some time
Cool water washing over land
When you're kicking in the courtroom
Darling boy I've never known ya
We are two hearts joined together 
Now you are mine, now I am yours 
Like nothing's wrong
Calm me for sweet dreams of him
When you lose everything you ever knew
But it's just not there, fair
'Cause we found ourselves in the sea
From the sea, the sea of tranquility
Did you even notice how the wind 
Thinking "Easy come, easy go"
Nevermind your soul
A ghost of a roar, from the sea shore
Still in pain
I'll be the last to let you go
So hang me, oh hang me
I'll shut up and let you rest
Leaves no place to begin
Every rose has its thorn
How I yearn for the cries,
Those three words
Take my trials and take my pain
You must be god embodied, stand tall
And here I am, tryin' to steal you away from him
There's a whispering wind, I feel it inside
Finally kissed me
On my mind, all of the time
No one, no one, no one has won the race
It ain't gonna stop the world
See you in my dreeeeeeeam the danger of love
Back to work, just like you said
Put me on oooh, put me on top
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a glock
Decoding you has proved the hardest thing
Lifeline
For the sake of love
You can stand at a show all night
Everything This is the tic in the heart 
You and I have the rest of our lives to see
Could you take away my weakness
And flags from a revolution
Like the fear of unskilled labor in the nuclear family 
Brought the sky down
The best is being done, but they're stronger and faster than we are,
Darling you let me know
It's easy to love you
From the days of the slave choppers, to the new age of prophets
That he feels so much older than he was
Some other purpose for stayin' in touch
And leave everything to the long, long road
Rise from the slough of despond, find the pathway
A lovely day
Yeah yeah yeaa
Way much harder to stay clear
Raisin' hustlers, thieves, and prostitutes
Undo the locks and throw away the keys
Remember all the times we said
And let's change the world
And stumbled through your world
Us get down on a cardboard box in vacant lots
And my family and my friends
But I wouldn't mind my own
There's a young soldier
Better than watching your first son put his sentences together
Way back
I'm so hard done by
Burn in the fire
It's the weekend
Keep them safe, keep them warm
All of this ends when I am done
Always free
She gonna make youy stay 'round
We done changed the world world, ghetto voices bein' heard and felt
And if you'd miss me when I'm gone
Towards the shore
A fire comes and you can't strike back
Makes me feel so far away
And you got to try and get it right
It doesn't matter what you see
no quiero estar en manos, de un gran simulador
I wanna go home
But only Jack Frost saw the kiss you gave him in return
She's gonna make a take down
Love too sweet to recall
There is a long way to go  there is a high place to know
Pull back, let go
We were married on a rainy day
You're just a single malt swamp clown preparing for splashdown
Be very, very careful not to
And I could hear you singing
Waltzing Matilda, Carey loves a kinkatchoo
On clear mornings
Just don't blow this motherfucker up
High on the moonshine bodies entwine 
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile
A cidade simplesmente me odeia
Think I should stay in bed today
In some gone story of old 
She don't like me 'cause I can't speak
Are we too selfish to even bless the kids with jewels
Friday, Saturday, Sunday too
I can't stop laughing, can't stop laughing
lauf' nicht fort Ich werde nicht kommen, dich zu schonen 
I'll keep on reminding me
Everyday the devil at me
In fact she's a queen to me, her light beams on me
It ain't gon' stop, it's the neighborhood watch
We didn't say anything after that
Deep under water
I don't wanna go anywhere
And half these cats ain't half of what they think they are
The st time I saw you
Hold my breath while I pass
It's the season of cold making warmth a divine intervention
Of compassion that comes through the night
Crashing hard through days of pain
And I'll begin again tonight
E quando eu me considerava limpo
Behind the waterfall, that's where your lost loves have all gone
Can't work a dead end ninetofive, for what
I start to feel the pain again
Won't remember, won't be asking
Never ending war 
Gone from the heart
Fuck It's your round dude
All the love surrounding me
Fields of dreams become my property
Horizons come to sip wine there
Show me that secret light
But don't stay up for me
Let the dreams of sleep take troubles far away from me
Blessings still to come
Never right 
Cause every inch you see is bruised, is bruised
I can't understand you've changed
Light that lingers in a quiet room
Cast away on the water
So I'll break through this rotten piece of wood
People think,that it's alright
Everybody knows this time
Bring myself to say it loud
You couldn't make it
She counts the clouds for hours
'Cause it don't matter to the moon no, no
It's a wind that will keep on
Like Christmas past and you and me
Always the ones the ones
On your skin, on your skin
Your ideals, I find amusing
If his mother said Ted be good, he would 
You gotta choose what you gonna do
Love will rule my left hand sky
Zag��usza mnie znow miejski gwar, czytaj z ust
Coney Island beaches, 
Can't tell me to stop when I begin
Und die Zeit versucht zu trosten
Till the morning breaks
I guess we got our own lives to live
Oh cool water washing over me
But soon it comes around to your soul
Now there's kids to tend
I'd tell you everything
I can't be with the man I love, 
Like broken glass, we damage
Their prayers prayed under covers 
I've heard that good things will come to he who waits
With such a face now
But that was years ago
Let's ride
Why do you leave notes at my door
You don't have to answer, have to walk alone
Duplicate, and then you wait for the next Kuwait
I can't make you feel what you already feel 
Why should I stay
Astride my horny horn
Makes a one man weep, and another man sing
So this is it, this is goodbye
High on a golden crested wave she sits
Beneath the transparent blue waves
Washed out of season
If she should want some peace she sits there, without moving,
As the melodies unwound
The volume's turned up too loud but we don't cover our ears
You want me Well, you've got me
That's the way to treat a friend
You're easy to love
From the sea, from the sea
'Cause to them it makes no difference
Swallowing like mercury down the drain
The danger of love
A lil tequila, some kissin' and burnin
Around the world you feel the love that we say hey
Yesterday, remember how clear it seemed
"Make It Up" We can make it better
And you know there was nothing I wouldn't have done for you
As in the fairytales
I heard that now you're callin'
Liggligg my tired one, rura sleeping one
Past the women and the men
Let me sail, let me sail, let the Orinoco flow
We broke up and got back together
Whispering me to sleep
All that winter we shared a cold
From the stars that light the sky
I'm not dreaming of the past
Na, I ain't feeling ya kid, we gave you
While you write your hiel of light,
Everyday is torture
Give a lil' love
They say it wasn't professional this time
You've stolen my heart and I want you to remember
It's a monumental big screen kiss
That was a long time ago
But true love is priceless
I left school, I grew my hair
Bless the beasts and the children
& your ears were not for me
Will be holding their breath until their blue in the cheeks
We can steer, we can near with Rob Dickins at the wheel
I've got glass eyes that have dined
That a love like yours is hard to find
Oh Lord, could you save my soul
Birds are leaving over autumn's ending
Ich bin auf der Flucht 
I could hide behind a straw, poor boy
And the blood in your eyes is shining
As you disappeared
So many lives around I guess that it was just your time
I can't stand the thought of you alone
If there is time, could we still find,
And act like a man
Born to be in love with a no good man
Trouble that it brings
This moment together
Of my living room
When you break your fall from grace
There will be tomorrow
As night falls I hear voices on the radio
Don't say a word, don't say anything
Oh, is it any wonder
Schaulust zieht die Leute an, durch die Menge geht ein Beben
Anna Rose it makes it worthwhile
Come into the light �������ͣ into the light
But I can't think where you should stay
When I ride
You are my friend yeah
All the things I say
'Cause when the tables turned
When everything's gone at least you've got nothing
And your city lies in dust
Running your fingers down the back of my neck
I'm watching it grow
Leave us in emotional peace, take a walk, taste the rest
Let's change the world
The stars exploded,
Like it did me
And knowing we are not alone in fear
To all those little girls and boys
Till the PATH train finally comes
Another verse in the doormat serenade
Who still looks out for me
When I thought that I just can't go on
There's always trouble
And stars fell on Alabama
Why do you come around my door
You've made your mind up anyway
Your words' a melody
Then maybe we can stay together
Your smiles at the wake and
Crack the seals of last year's arguments they don't hold a candle to the one
That all the rain clouds are fountains
Oh, she says carry on, carry on
Where you may find some peace
am Ende angekommen
Fear makes us visual
Rennblautur Allur rennvotur Engin gummistigvel Hlaupandi i okkur Vill springa ut ur skel
When I was young the neighborhood watched
It's not my hell
Hang around each street
If you'll be mine
We'll split the side off the bed
Just then the room became more dimly lit
But I'm always on the run, run, run
When sunlight hits the sea
Live on every street
You'll never be defeated if you fight with might and hope"
Someone asked Who do you think you are
But you were something like sand
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
Were you praying at the Lares shrine
Wait, we still great but, but
Though what's done is done
So we live in the city come over here
There are streets paved in gold that shine so bright
When I look inside I see where we are
They don't know nothing about love
My brother under the sun 
A man who wasn't sad at all about what's going on
So wait for fate to find me
The good will come out
Waiting for Mars to come out
We were chosen by fate 
Across sand and sky and gravel
Desire is burning me inside out
His hand on his breast
So I'ma say it, and convey it when the world play it x
Walk away, walk away
Ornaments reflected light
But she doesn't love you
You made it for yourself
Constellations turned into little polaroids in a cardboard box
Saving all your money like a fool
Son, won't you come along
But I maximize so my soul needs to unwind
No I haven't treated you so right
With another man 
Everything These are the seconds that I've lost 
Through my empty city
Tender dreams, shadows fall
Ain't no turning back
My skin shrinks against my body bones
I raise a black fist but won't say nigga in the things I write
With you tonight
No the moon will just keep hanging round, hanging round
And we never came up for air
Let the time go
My ears were ableeding
To live my life in the shade 
I don't need anyone else
And I know that you don't understand the fullness of My love
In the rain than moods that seem so potlucky
I held my part
You ignore every star above you
The nd time I saw you
Like its just another night
Come come come
Whenever I got lonely
Thought you was a queen
When the music's over now
Ya you gotta know, I can never let you go
Running out of topics of conversation
To just grab a hold of whatever came along
Undertake the toil
Let's put our hearts together
That U've always wanted, but could never find
Afterall, I'm the princess of Hollywood
Wouldn't mind the hanging
All things you wished you had done, so put on your shoes and
Breakin' like a rock you grew profound
The fire held the shadows close
But this hope that sorrow bleeds
And she's making the scene
Are you blind to god above
Into darkness crawling after you
We will hold our broken circle and begin to pray
To one safe place
Ooh I'll follow their dreams
I remember all the summer days
At a tin mine we do stand,
And mines'll stand the test of time, when I rhyme
So gentle the sea breeze,
Nigga tryin' to go platinum around  years old
As a mountain
naen huoneeseeni, seinalla on hakki
It is time for a new dawning
Instrumental
Above, the stars are spiralling
Um tiro certeiro, modelo que vende mais
It ain't so easy to love you true account of all the rattlesnakes and all that makes you blue
From the life of doing wrong things
Trouble and suffering in a lovely rhythm
Change this world
But I can safely say I ain't never played a woman
One chilly afternoon, you drew the blind
'Cause when I'm gone it will be too late
But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts
Fading in and out and I can remember mother telling me,
We swim hand and hand
She's alone in the world
Amounts to nothing and there's no way
Lust deceiver  one that I chose 
Kisses on my forehead we can fall into it
I gave my life away
I won't fight it when you leave
How he didn't like to be alone
See you in my dream
Lord let Your blessings begin
And it looks like the sinnin' won't end
Heat gives way to sweat My body's soaking wet We slide and slip From hip to lip
I heard the news today
'Round my hometown
She leaves this old world behind
Save the work till the afternoon
Nobody ever warns you
That's gone on too long
The water's rising
I pour flowers on your chest, on your chest
Overcome and flay all fears
No one or nothing comes near
The earth and the stars
May he rest in peace and get on with
Now I can't work out what I'm supposed to do
Let the whispering wind come lift us away
The black night sighs
You let me know that this was my chance
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
And hit the motherland
 Never thought I'd be afraid to trust
You are my friend
The sidewalks bound with steel
Your soul in your eyes
Finish nothing you start
Now take a rest
Shhhhhhh, Goodnight
I want to see her face once more
From Peru to Cebu, feel the power of Babylon
It's a good thing you can swim 
An hour ago I felt so low I almost drowned
With all grace
Open your eyes when it falls 
With frozen smiles to chase love away
Maybe she's gone
They're stuck in the walls, go pull them down
In the fields of our love
Like someone took your breath away
Jag gar nu
I'll make you happy
It's like running through deep water trying to look into your eyes
To get her back I had to sweat her
Is there something I should know
I've been losing so much time
He didn't know 
He said, "respect me, not seen that around here yet,
Let's make the music right
As new life will come from death, love will come at leisure
No reason left for living
The albatross flies to the stern
Carol Seaver  take off your clothes 
You know what's in the water that you drink
Hope and peace from far here after
Gives yourself away
Left out in the rain
And lovers wait patiently
Oh, has anyone had a good time tonight
Shine down on another day
And pretend that everything is all right
That brought us some peace
You're spring to me
Walking through the suburbs, though not exactly lovers
Are the wonders now
They say that all in love is fair
When the Reflection joint is done
Away, away, will you fall away 
One bone and blood mass we fuse
Your loss of hope
Let the drive sequence begin Hit it, Pinback
And I will be a beast for thee
Wahle einen Ort, wahle eine Zeit und auch die Waffen 
Baby, can't you see I just wanna getcha satisfied
And the whole mass was ran under one master plan
Past name tags and shaking hands
Oh, sing me to sleep
This year
So now I do what I can, I'm alright
To allow my hand 
The last rose of summer
Let's waste time 
Do you even know what goes on in a heart anymore
I take my place among the truckers and I show 'em what I've got
And so the story ends
But oh your city lies in dust, my friend
I was waiting outside
We'd be sitting there hoping it would never end
In fact we are closer to each other
We made echoes off the green house walls
I should take a good advice
It's Saturday
la menos pensada, es la que creere yo
Ich sah die Gesten, ich fand die Briefe, sah den Kuss
We will know the pattern of centuries rise and fall
Just when you think that you've got a hold
Just wanna know ya
We don't stop until the break of dawn, ooh
And it's about time that I told you everything You put resin on my heartstrings You make 'em sing
And like the ancients we are spirited away
From Kentucky well water to whale watchin off a back porch
Your secrets are spilling from your mouth
Tonight
When there are clouds in the sky
Come round, you know you can work it out again
Drift on, mm hmm stay strong,
Leading us forward where destiny may be
All the roads reach out to you
Lillian lies to avoid awkward questions
I'll be there for the baby
The afternoon handovers by the swings
Yes, I gave my life away, yeah
And those watercoloured memories
It was a rainy day
'Cause I've waited, forever, to know
But you can't find the window
Slide under his door
So don't lose heart
That held the room in warm embrace
I don't wanna wait for
B we get started, r we all alone
Say goodbye knowing that this is the end
The waiter was blind
You got cursed
Orchestrated midnight
And I was away just for a minute,
You say my name each time you cough
The same wind comes rushing
Tell me stories of myself 
And carries you on its journey
Falls down in tears
Like it was on better days
The rain makes me happy
I try to tell myself this is
I can wait
'Cause when I ride
We swam the evening away
Everything seems to be going wrong
It's mine and yours Let's guard the block
My heart beat like a hammer
We're apt to think it's cruel, but sometimes
That I could end this
Many who think they better and they'll walk right past ya
I ease the seat back and start to pray
Three in the morning closing in
Will you carry all my weakness,
Out through the window of the day
Beautiful things get run down
And your eyes, they were not here
She poisoned me like a virus
Memories of my brothers racing through my mind, and soon I know we'll all be together again
And arrow to the heart
If you'd ever unwind
And realized that we are only one
It's a fitting end for where this began
Everyone can see
Ja ich hab' alles, was ich brauch', was ich nicht hab', hab' ich auch ich hab' 'ne scharfe Braut, immer Gras zuhaus' und morgens schlaf' ich aus DJs legen unsere Platten auf, und in Magazinen steht meistens sowas wie "Der Topf, der hat es drauf" Und wenn's um Burner geht, ich nehm' gerade ein' auf Und wenn's mir dreckig geht  nehm' ich 'n Bad im Applaus Und wenn's nicht besser wird, bin ich oft tagelang blau, high wie'n Astronaut und's stort gar keine Sau Ich dachte, mein Job am Mikrofon bleibt kohlema��ig fur'n Arsch, vom Geld her wird's sich niemals lohn' Ich dacht' nur Schrott wie Dieter Bohlen geht in Deutschland in die Charts, doch heute sind wir large Wir haben Freigetranke bis zur Invasion, Videobeamer, Studio und Spielkonsolen, immer'n Auge auf die Anderen wie beim Turspion und machen weiter wie gewohnt Nehmen Beats und flown bis der Schei�� hei�� ist wie gluhende Kohlen Und weil's zur Zeit so geil ist, fuhl' ich mich wohl
I couldn't catch my breath laying there
They almost didn't find her,
I was lying on my back with my fingers in the sand
If I can't get you outta the streets
Would you still feel the same
And let the children sing
Cannon fire burning 
She's a hell of a girl
I'm gonna take you for a ride"
And say we love our children
And half in shade
They have no choice
It takes you further every time
The R baby
And smash them like glass against the wall
Pyramids and starlight
"The edges of our love are in the stars" choir 
Take in time to shout
'Cause when we kiss nothing feels the same
Nothing's all right without you, without you
And we'll do as you command,
Won't cry, won't cry, ooh no
Tell them all you were on track 
And as we watched for Christmas ghosts
Blacked out your tinted windows, we still see you
And what we had has come undone
Wars and Famine, plagues and pestillence
This plane is all I got so keep it steady now
Drank all the orange juice
Neighborhood watch x 
Out past the forest where the Saint Lawrence lies
I gotta cut myself from the chains and run free yeah
And out of nowhere I feel peace cover me
Du bringst Verderben, fur eine kleine Liebelei"
The fire was all that was left
When you wanna be free
As I die
I've been pushed far aside
I've only got this morning to live
And they are arriving in vast numbers
Beauty's got a hold on me
I'm not so strong out of my shoes
Biggie got killed, when this shit gonna stop
A witness or a love
The lights are going out
I remember you
Traveling caravans left me enchanted
And I brought it home to you
Ceiling changes
In the hood is a everday happenin'
So just bounce like you're banging in the back of your car
I would unmake my past
Offerings album version
Through the essence of your smile
But the day goes on and on
And the rain brings me out
And weary eyes are clear
On mother mountain
And I'm a keep at 'em, crossing my fingers that eve
With my niggas right next to me
Dos Equis Right, under red light
Timing's everything 
She is working to earn her own dollar
We talked of looking just out of town
Instead of standing on the curb behind the barricade
Headlights burnin' all my laughs
You're life itself
Something longs to grow  won't let go
Are you ok baby
And I'll let you know, yeah
The world is growing loud
Shadows take us here in this ballet
Now through the lines of the cheap Venetian blinds
Then what have we got
It will be a lovely night
And the crosstown horns
Wherever you see  the buffalo run 
Carry on, when I'm gone
Roses all are blooming 
I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain
The morning desert sun was at her back
Deep in my heart right from the start *right from the start*
At the speed of light
I hear the sound of mandolins
Knew that I'd come from city lights
So it's goodbye Saturday and hello week
Natti came up on from chasin a dream
Show a lil' love
I'll be out in my garden
Yeah they change
The next night he's over and over and under
It doesn't come as a surprise
They've got their reasons
When I thought I knew you
Each memory that we've shared
Cause every inch you see is bruised
To the heart of the world
There would be no truning back
It contradicts your battlescars
Longer than the past has
But when I think of all your advice
Whether my oceans divide
Sometimes perfection can be
Escape to the water
Times are hard, spirits weak
Don't know another girl
The fault to each our families
But it might just save your life
But if you stay,
I'm in the mood for love
I fell ill inside eternal winter, winter
ich spur' ihr Zaudern, und sie des Nachts sich mir entzieht
I'll be gone by the morning, it strikes daylight
For the next few hours
Where I left my toysingers
It's a wind that will keep on lasting
So look down to the street below 
Is thinking of your face
This is a story of a boy named Ted 
Everything is still
Balloons down below blooming colors of the rainbow
Head up in the clouds
Take my eyes and help me see
Red walls looking for distraction
The neighborhood watch it is jewels and spots
How much I love to be with you
So being benificent, I bless 'em with dialogue
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Me I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes
If you, my darling, just, just smile
Keep your eyes locked away
Give the day a chance to start
Broken love, crash and fall
In his right side
Sky stayed grey
For in this world they have no voice
Slowly I stretch out my arms freely
I've got your words in me
How I wish the woods would up and disperse cash
For grace to be regained or won
I guess there's got to be a break in the monotony
Oh pilot, can you help me
From me to you, I know I can't feel a thing
And I'd count my blessings,
Like remind my soul
For me too, there was nothing I could do
Still the same I beg to differ
We heard the cargo ships go pushing through the ice
Good days are back 
Of the time we were great before the self hate yeah
Through her eyes 
Too late for us to change
All night
Can't take a trip to fall runnin' to first class
'Cause I don't know if it matters
Many have followed the footsteps you're on
That's when I know We really have a home
"Deinen Sohn getotet hast du, wie geblendet kann man sein
The blue watercress
Come see me take my hand
Girl that's a pressure unmeasured
They crystallize and break on the ground
Product of an East German black
Coming back from work
And when you come to see me, 
Of his radio
Rifle on my shoulder
Well, I've never swam the deepest oceans
And the world looked fine
I didn't mean it, I was drunk, it was only a joke"
And don't think that you can't stop by the bar
That day in November
di amarti subito un po
As she smiled her golden tooth glinted in the light,
The sun sets
Despite this noose around our kiss,
You call me back but hold on
Just wanna get in a car and drive
For true love we pay the price
Now I breathe on
You believe in faith and now you think their lies
And we'll remain friends
And here I realise that it's all in my hands,
Blinded by the sun 
The th time I saw you
The candle wax of melted dreams
I've gotta fall with a clear head
To the ground
On the hillside 
You've changed
What will we find inside of the wreck
Gives in return a wondrous yearn of a promise almost seen
Where has all the love, where has all the love gone
The neighborhood watch, guard the block
My elders all feel the same, there's no bravery
To see my songs can be retold
Carrying words as strangers exchange pleasantries
The speaker's distorted through the phone
To a tune that was famous the year I was born
Broken bodies all the time
In a window on a train
Lost out in the rain
Oh I'm cruisin' down my own street
Was illuminating a face
There are still bodies thrown on my bedroom floor,
Give them shelter from the storm
Sweet confusion under the moonlight
Till I fall
My brother under the sun
My eyes are on your hands I'm helpless when I'm looking at you
How many roads we've traveled
You made a fist around your heart
My seven fears all fear of me
It sounds so funny
No need to live in a lean to your troubles must be seen to
When I lose every time I win, 'cause
Getting back up seems impossibly grand
We cannot tell for how long we'll be able to stand this vicious fight"
But put sorrow to a soft melody
I'm ten feet off off the ground and still looking down
Of the midsummer dawning,
You can heal, can't watch you fall
Bring us some food and some bullshit TV
Oh, start a new life
And wild, oh it's wild
Pearls in the sky are strung round the moon
I could spend eternity inside your loving flame
I just need a little more of what you've got a little bit
When you burn all your bridges, 
Share your light
You're concrete white, I'm plastic black
If God don't make mistakes
And now that I've got you all strangely compelled
Co stemplem odmowy zniweczy�� moj plan
And in our place
Nigga pin it, nigga fi'in' to descend into a dawn of a new millennium
We damage our pasts with romance and hatred,
It's a rainy world
One minute right beside me, another you're a thousand miles away
The cattle dreaming
I'll find my way again I guess
Honestly, can I say what I mean
Stop and listen Love you
Now I could make this obvious,
Before you turned your back on me in the end
You made me spare
We're simple minds
The little nymphs dance in her hair
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
You can't, you can't hurt me causes I don't care about you
Who will hang his head
Clear and serene in the love I've discovered
Sue came along loved me strong that what I thought
For all the people
Sometimes the world's a scary ride, it's hard to hang on
Far away from the slaughter
Or at least put some hope in the bottom of the box
Is there anything I can do for you, dear
In the dream, oh yes I do
Of my world
Hation is a birth defect, and you know ain't nobody perfect
While you hit trees and coast I spit flows that be ferocious
Time you start to grab your pride
Here I do plot,
Draw me a picture
A homespun clapboard blackstrap thrush
A scarecrow shudders
Next time you feel it  it might make you mad
When I left you alone to fight your battles
I'm gonna seek this thing like a buried treasure Seek and destroy
When Joseph was an old man, an old man was he
From day to day
We've found ourselves back where we started from
Next Saturday
To cover your lips 
Text me but you need a call
Brosandi Hendumst i hringi Allur heimurinn oskyr nema ��u stendur
Sun dappling through clear water
Making love is wrong
Special, sidewinder track through sand
Glaubst du Tor, dass du linderst deine Pein"
To assassinate the sun
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah I, I, I, I, I Yeah, yeah I, I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come into the light ������
You'll tend to me as glory verse
To the place before I ran away and found I'd lost my track
The moon is round 
Don't understand or see my plight
Broke the ring around it
Lookin' for cheese, that don't make her a hood rat
Because I love a man
She left a scar
Stood out on the balcony and I took a look around
As free as you wanna be
Titties representing the city that I grew up in
On a rainy night in Soho
And our bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
Shimmering fields of gold
Between keeping the peace and arresting police
The splash of tears
Get past times we cuss through
No good man
Yeah Comes on strong Yeah baby, baby, baby, baby, baby Comes on strong Don't you know my blood is raging Comes on strong Darling, darling, darling, darling Comes on strong I'm tired of all my failings Bring me close and burn, burn, burn, ha
Good to know I'm not alone
Or breathing in
You still float
I ain't lost, just wandering
I can't realise you ever cared
Won't you put me on top again change the odds
Still, there's a lot to do
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
And if there's one thing I learned in chemistry
Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never seen
Cross the street very still
No one will ever be like me 
I've been living my life
It's the season of bowing our heads in the wind
That's just life
And with these explosives, I split seas for Moses
She can't remember now when she was all in pieces,
Mesmo sabendo que a vida nos engana
I just want to live somewhere where the air is sweet and clear
If his mother said Ted be good, he would
So let it rain
Seeing you buzzing from flickering signs
She thinks back on her working day,
Everything 
Then I've got to be dumb
For every rose, one big stone
We can sail, we can sail sail away, sail away, sail away
Let me feel mine
And if flying back home
Anyway
We will know that be a part is to be truly whole
With nothing in our plate
I'm writing the words to this song with a poison pen
To the door
I knew I'd remember
A neighbor one time pounding on the wall now lulled to sleep by lowered voices
A quiet place and nature's way,
Why everybody actin' agitated
A day that doesn't come to the lucky
For the fire
There's no turning back
You'll take it back
Nevermind your heart
Oh it's just not fair
Heaven is in your eyes
I'll let you know, yeah
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
Funny how I got to here
The parts of me
Let me reach, let me beach far beyond the Yellow Sea
'Make a wish and they'll come true'
And I knew all night
And we spent the hours
I want you back and forth
Because you're innocent, I know
You say you have forgotten me
Like the whispering wind you stand here with me
I should be knocking on the door of the pearly gates
Shine a light into it
I reach down and reload my ticket home
Who's making a mistake each time our mouths meet
black man kill himself for limited amount of wealth
All those pictures float there happy just for a little while
I wanna know why it falls off and on
She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hypeman"
So with a sense of terror and bewilderment,
And I wish you weren't worth the wait
Alot of cats out here ain't playin'
Is calling
And that's real gay, so keep your eye on the ball
The freaks come out at night to spark
The touch of a hand, to heal yourself
But it was my dream to kick flows to put my people on another level
Well, they lay down beside me
And swallowing your dirt
But I don't think we should let 'em go
Sitting around every day
�� one two 
Your molten bodies blanket of cinders
On some other lovers dreams
One day I'll be a better writer
It's the one thing that I'll never finish
Inside the hurricane her mind gets blown
I say this not from hate;
He said he liked to do it backwards and I said that's just fine with me
It said that she was just a normal girl, Like a dream, dream dream
You can read their address by the moon
Could be what we had in mind
Some say it's stupid but violence really lives where I come from come from
I been all around this world
They are, they are
Through water
Poison in the very air we breathe
Your song seemed to look
But I know it's something you can't stop
That your hour now is late
Simply because you're near me
When your face got so much light
It's the season of possible miracle cures
Oh honey I just wanna let you know
I hit the bottom, hit the bottom and escape, escape
Give 'em back to me
We watched it go round and round
Got some wood and a knife
Spill it all and hope you find a way to make it through it
Facing the wall
It was always you x 
Life, living in Flatbush and going to house parties
Yeah, she's leaving me tomorrow
Suffa MC came to take you home
Women that look like actress the status of Cleopatra's
I'm begging you on scabbed knees
She lost her smile in '
Won't you put me on top oooh, put me on top
Voce ate parece um vicio
Anna Rose it makes my heart smile
You want me, all to yourself; you've got me now
And I think I see eyes beneath your couch
"You better hang on to your benchseat
In touch through his friend Mike
You're looking for the light
His mouth is open
Stay the way,
We may end up in Mexico city
I'll hug you and kiss you and love you
And the wolves are howling 
I take two steps back and tie my boots, 
What other people wouldn't do
The sunshine of my life's been burned 
I'd change for anyone
And I don't say faggot 'cause I don't think it's right
It was such a lunatic thing to do
Meanlaughing too long this way
Where will our children go
In orbit
You did your best
Won't prepare you for what's in store
I look at the clock and I'm feeling the rhythm of love
Ingrained in good
The measure of my dreams
She smiles, she shuts her eyes,
A babushka and bare feet
Smile and maybe tomorrow
And neither sin nor evil
And I lay you to rest
It's Hilltop; we're three stars like a Holiday Inn
The water was clear
She's gonna keep you inside
You're a stranger in a country town
Listen to records in my room to escape
Asleep beneath the buzzing light
Causing sensations rollin' through me Comes on strong, feels just like a spell Sensations rollin', turnin' from me to you Causing this aura of heat to swirl
I know it feels good, that's why we shouldn't tonight
All your lies were sweet like a childs
Come on come on come on yeah
How many times has he broken that promise
So she did run to him over the grass
Stay for life, for life
You got lost
Breath through my eyelids, my flow keeps my teeth white
Highway men
Eu sonhei com voce
Won't let them get the better of me
Soon this space will be too small
You'll learn one day, won't you
Somewhere in the back just watching the bands
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieu, ooh
And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind
I can't see him, I can't call him up 
Half in sunlight
The Lord knows, we can do this shit
When will you show your love
No one will ever be like me
Another part of another ritual
Since the world's metamorphis, and the plan is kept in orbit
And stars that fell
And just suddenly I thought
Like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
This one tops the list
I'll remember those
And I was the one who was so impressed
And if I don't die today
You supposed to fight for freedom not just the end of slavery
To the bar and I lose
New winds blow taste like the cold 
Follow your heart  little child of the west wind 
Before this sleep in the oceans
Maybe you cannot speak for shame
This little dream might fade
Or talk on the phone all night
Yet all we think is I'm gone lead us
That you could trust me, but I was lying anyway
So we spent the day submerged
Anticipatin', life without Satan
Especially not when it comes to you
Of great god Mars
I know I'll never ever ever be alone
You were running out of time
Your loneliness says, that you've sinned
I'm busy lappin' it up, I might be here all day
With wise men and tramps,
Running with our timebombs 
But everybody knows this time
Is it your voice that is too weak
I was out in Coolidge with my head on a counter
I'll be dead and gone
I smeared myself with pennyroyal to keep the hounds at bay
Big eyes laughing
Every other time your head looks down
Taunting everyone who walks by as they sail through my front lawn
The tallest trees stretch to the sea,
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieu, ah
Lean north like calligraphy
Say something secret
Yeah, it's gettin wild out here
Another day you leave behind
Baby you're no train, you're the silence behind
With lonely gauze and lace
Well you said that you'd call
It's your round, if you're hanging at the back of the bar
Your laughter tore through the new jersey night,
Are we breathing out
So this is over and out, this is goodbye
Out on the sea
I like your pretty eyes, and how you're afraid of the dark
He'll have turn around
Now my head's come off
I face your eyes
One of us will die inside these arms
Everybody tryin' to rap faster than the master
Oh now Yeah Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah I, I, I, I, I See you lyin' here You're so close You're so near
Before we get back in the wheel
Well I'll comb my hair like Elvis
It was like I was gonna die
I'll be the bright side of your bad day
For the storm to break
When you've got nothing worth healing 
You're a couple, especially when your body's doubled
Staring at you in the moonlight
Two more nights till Colorado
They carried us off and laid us in the city to let the public see of our defeat
No crying fields, no sins of man
As she's tossing a dime
We watched our friends grow up together
I promise to tread more lightly
Mesmo sabendo que a dor cartesiana
'Cause it don't matter to the moon
Why not call it a day, the sensible way
To speeches at the altar on, now we get our party on
Even though the bills are piling
Of the flag, of the flag
So easy to love you
Then she got lost
If the waters cool, I might just swim
All boys will get the same
A freakfreak, y'all, and ya don't stop
The fat secretary, the lunchtime lover
I'll try to understand this
Missing all the cracks in the pavement
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
A word or two, my friend
There's a fine door that you open
But anyway, That's after words are said
dass man wei��, dass man druber hinweg kommt
The chchchanges you put me through
If you would draw a picture into which we could both drop
That a good thing is hard to find
Human kindness is overflowing
And in more ways in one
She needs something
Around me again
It's hard not to sing
Cause nothing blows in the faraway
Stay for a while
The sweetest dreams have murdered me They murdered me They murdered me 
The clouds at rest
In new days to remember, always and forever
Now I got a baby boy by the name of Jake
I scream out into the mouth,
We've had a good time tonight  I'm tired there  I'm tired
She got in that ride and she never came back
You got burnt
How many dreams we've chased
Dream of sleep take troubles far away from me
When we're home
Some other grounds
Would you lie with me and just forget the world
Needs a lady with a light
So now still burning silently away
Will you make a smoother landing
Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never been
I never thought that I could make such a mess
You start to trust the things that deeper comfort brings,
I hope you never leave
And I can be a beast for thee
I have held my arms gracefully from my side
And then the temperature goes from unbelievably high
There's something that I wanna say
With purple highlights
This is gonna be a long night Long
After the party we all went home alone
'Cause I don't know a goddamn thing about the birds and the bees
Sailing through the moons eye
It's just for yourself
It's mine and yours
Pretty weak to have let it go on this long
To my choice seems too small
Well, it's bright and new
Just to be with you, I'd do anything
You to me, a beast for thee
Here is apples and cherries so fair to behold
Here we go, roll up some more Phillies
Don't wait up for me if I'm not home, yeah
Forever blue 'cause you love her
You'll get pulled over by onetime
Down all the years, down all the days
And I'm backing through the open doorway
"Go, my golden Queen, the light is within you and your men,
Breaking at the edge of day
Pull a fast one on me
I'm just a painful reminder
To remind me
Notice new found courtesies
She still counts the minutes that I am not there
You need a message, you could love our rappin'
Hate makes us powerless
So when I leave yo, you're fucking with my pride I don't see though
Now let's toast the sad cold fact
Tracey Gold  where in the world 
Bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
Go ahead and close your eyes now
Show me your love
Then your angels leave and you lose it
And that's the only thing that we have in common
And I love them for that
And disarray your every stone
And you put your arms around my neck
Ohooh, oohhooh,
It's a case of cruel to be kind
The way you hold me
Tourists wear their wallets in high places when abroad
Where the moon was coming up, and I knew that's all there was
Let me sail, let me sail, let me crash upon your shore
She told him Ted about his soldier dad 
Under the clouds
And if it's true we lost our way
And they are raising quite a stink
Revolves around 
I didn't mean to hurt you
Reflection is a collection of memories
No one answering
Especially when I 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
In my lifetime, ain't done too many things
Mommy and daddy your baby is grown
Everybody taking different sides
One for it, one for out the grave
A situation so heavenly
And now the wolves are shaped like people
Like I bleed but wait
And the trees for their hundred years
We watched the watchers and found a way
I met him at a party and he told me how to drive him home
'Fraid that what I'll say comes out somehow awry
Been living my life
I heard the phone ring
The world was young and he knew
You know the kind that I like
I had the devil in my blood
Won't let them get you down
One day
Breathing, oh
Empty as the sky
Show your love
The everbeating heart that it wasn't
Picture you on the floor
Drinking wine in the sunshine
I do not love you anymore
Over white satin sand
That blew us round the island
This book will take a lifetime
There are more stars in the sky,
They also felt she was a human being like a dream
I feel as I'm falling, and I see
To help you see clearly, then get back to me
As furniture with glass upon my head
all in all attendant memories
Go, don't stay, you know, you know that it will be all right
On the shoulders of one
I ever heard that made me want to stay
You didn't think you'd be so dumb
I still believe that there's somewhere for us
Talk down the girl
You'll go crazy by the hazy sea
I'm digging a hole with my hands six fee in the ground
It's mine and yours, Let's guard the block
A potion guaranteed to bring
Echoes dancing, how can we refrain
Looking for one safe place
So hang me, oh hang men
Could change how I feel inside
But let me tell you baby, all tricks aside
I hope it never leaves
There must be some reason for flesh and blood
Refrain
Shimmering fields but of course my dear
She let a nigga hit it, and now she only date white men
You'll be in glory born
To replace it with ether
Don't you waste me in the ground"
When you called my name
To make things better
Solitary man
And the scene was done
Below the trees
Then the light came bouncin' up, from stony ground
And the rainclouds leak in through the chimney
I seize an opportunity 'cause they don't linger
Looking for a ride in and out of
We climbed up a latter that leaned against the hay
I'm too scared to move
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now
Soft as a summer's breeze
He's got himself in
All our words go into the wire
If you would be so kind
Don't you know this government ain't vote for me and you
Losing speed 
When you used to be my friend
I have stood here in this garden
If it's always in fun
I stay clever, long as the planet stay together
I'm afraid Candy's not feeling well
Ten thousand miles away
It rains in the fountain
You know you'll see this glory verse
I surface at  in the clothes that I slept in
A few kisses ago
Oooh, put me on top
And he says, 'I know about your son'
Uderza potwornym w mej y��y falochron
Rickshaw, disco, goodnight kiss
The headlights all sparkled, blending into the sky above
Wake me up in time for California
Though in the secret heart
The danger of love Drives me easy
Wedding rings and children
From those nights when we were both
Been such a long time
Sitting in the back seat of my car
magari un'altra sera
A friend became the
We are tiny pieces
A disagreement used to be a speed bump on a highway going eighty
Sleep makes you possible
They say love is blind
Like thoughts out the back of my mind
Royal is royal in thy xenoscene
'Cause without it girl I'll just lost my mind
There's something everybody knows
They strain to slang sling, I'm trained to bring game
Give me an answer you are sure of
Don't get offended by the rubbish that we pump in the street
I wanted to be on the top one day
Answers come when we don't want to hear
It's such a shame
It's not pretty underneath
From the sun
Does that dress fit all right
That's why I'm standing right here
Out in another under tow
But it'll be the end of mine
Fuck it; no MC can ever better me no one man
That start to hurt me, hurt me
Your poison has taken control of my soul
Or this world we love so much
You will feel, late at night
I'll hear you curse my name 
There's no price I would not pay, no
And faced the enemy with open hearts
The honeymoon, the wedding ring
I'm richer through all the things I'm rejecting
I wanna see the stars and be the moon to my son
I still need a quiet place to go
Wear feline masks, we'll go
It was always you x 
It feels like I sampled true love
Like a page from truelove stories
And hours pass, hours pass, yeah, yeah
On the living road
I wanna be as big
Only meaning to scratch the surface
Faces of the day
I'm a master these until it's hard to breath
My hair's in a twirl over you
But tomorrow never came for Jayne
It's just a matter of time
I guess you have a reason girl
Let me reach, let me beach on the shores of Tripoli
I come and reign with the unexplained for the brains till things change
I'll be the bright side of your bad nights
You find a line that's in the sand and figure out who drew it
Took a plunge into my past to share with my son
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
Ride past our stop
So by the time I catch an apple, usually its rind
If the sun shines right I might be here all day
That the seasons tear off and condemn
We don't wanna face it
Don't you see it's better this way 
Bad dreams are nothing special
I don't want anything else
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
The hurt was so demanding
Ooh no I cannot paint pictures with my tongue
I get so sick of the telephone
I could see my name in lights
I can sway
Or I'll sail till I
Was to always need him
But now I think the moment's there
To you I dedicate this song
Pause when they come in a
My niggas love when they bust bust, they steady buck and you duck duck
She can travel back in time
Keep you eyes locked away
But I can't even take one breath
And thought I was somebody else
I write this moment down, 
I told him that I was good to sixes but all hell brook loose after that
Back in the days when I was a teenager
Like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
And then love pulled out the heavy artillery
She can't change, she don't wanna
O milesimo gol sentado na mesa de um bar
I've got your voice on tape
Came to Cincinnati linked with Mood, and we did Sacred
See we're losing this world we love
Why stop to think of whether
But all your lies were sweet like a child's
She's a flower she's a rose
Maybe you could getaway
View from another land
You're kinda lovin' makes me feel all right
A desert rose cascading waterfalls
It's so nice to rest her aching head,
The trees all beckon to the sky to bless their empty lives
More than a feeling, it's the power of love
They all are here
Stellare regions cry everything has its season
Lollypops, popsicles, licorice sticks
Que largar e quase impossivel
Yeah, this year we put in work and got some other plans
It's all over man, you're gonna make it out
Und die Liebe versucht zu bewahren
Then came the day she found herself a man 
You were still breathing
And wild is the wind
And holding fast with sharp realization
Lost highway, carry on
I started up my hollow
I wait for you at the end
All of those dreams are in empty motion
Crazy people know a special place to go when the pressure's on
At the tips of our feet where the waves stun the rocks,
Till the new day breaks
Take a picture of everyone
Your eyes, they turn me
Try to stay entwined
The voice from up above says
Smoked out rotisserie turning
Her love is running through my veins
"Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child"
I was dealt from the bottom and pulled a flush
Calalily, will you still love me come tomorrow knowing that I've done nothing
All the industry boys were still laughing and drinking
I see tomorrow morning
But years brought tears
See them shine
I wanted to be a star
The last rose of summer is gone
We can make it happen
The stars are dancing on the carpet of the sky
Not all the strength of the ocean
All in all is all we are
But that karma's a bitch, you steady asking God why
We'll take back everything we've said
Won't be long now for you die, poor boy
Can you make this last
That you might show is dressed in several of your wife's clothes
Then your smile it melts away again
Love ends just as easy as it's begun
Of what life can mean to us
Feel a little outta place
The ceiling is the sky
And I can hear you voice ringing
I told the stripper at the bar that the shots we got were magic,
Now turn the red lights on
I freak with word power, my man speak with beats
We can have a good time
Everytime I hear the strum
Into the arms of understanding
Tired and lonely I'll move on from this pain
I'll get the nerve up to put my arm around you
We will find we never knew hatred ran so deep
Please don't take me lightly
Your eyes caught mine, and at a glance
And then love summoned up the infantry
My nigga let me hit it, niggas we thuggin' immortalized, let's get high
The air is thin and hard to breath,
You've said, that's right, your dead 
I can't see him, I can't call him up
Time escapes us 
Blood on your hands
Springtime, springtime can kill you 
Does your husband know I call you sweetheart
Seattle  you've got to love the rain
The day is turning to night
This is the end, my friend
Before we're thrown back in the wheel
And the smell of the cold, wet dirt reminds me of home
For the world can never be
The veiled mist reveals the wandering ship upon the reef
Hungry little kids where I come from come from
With our heads above the waves
bis die obere Welt sich regt
And listen to her daddy's song,
I'll give 'em back to you
I waited years for you
Eleven stories up
I'll let you win I won't even put up a fight
Bathed in the light,
Oh, it's good music, yeah dog I see now
I woke alone
From Bissau to Palau in the shade of Avalon
And I don't want to be the one that you don't recognise
Melody day what have I done
I've seen it's ugly face
Fire is burning me inside out
All along, thought that we still had a chance
I believed all your promises and plans
, pounds of hope,
Afraid of the dark 
Like Columbus sailing over the sea
Is there something I should know, my love
From an old rusted chair
Don't stay out too long
And shower in the deep
Your love makes me see things so clearly
Du wei��t doch, dass ich es versuche
Those are the mimicking kind
Or drive all night for no reason
Man makes the money
Yo, you know what we got to do, man, we need to get a whole CD
So much for that afternoon
Now I breathe on
Got a broken car yeah got a selfish heart
Of horny girls with New Jersey hair
The endless rain
If I had just once kissed you
The rooms were musty
A storm without the thunder
Now a bee in a birds nest never made no honey
And I'll keep on reminding me
While in style in darkened limousines
With a touch of her soul
So they say we aren't really here,
Here tonight
There's nothing to fill me in
By the time you hear this, I'll be basking in African sun
Home to the home where we all sleep alone
These shins are cracked and splintered 
Though what's gone is gone
Whip, 'cause what I'm hearing's all shit on the lyrical tip
You lift me higher, take my spirit, make it fly,
Wasn't the only one
Thunder awakes me, the crashes beside me
The wind that will bring me
The empty streets
Two Seabee, cigarette smoke
Partiot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
And when in  rewinds didn't even make any strides
Broken hand, a broken wall
I turn inside instead  of wondering
Cowboys and Indians, puppydogs and sandpails
When the enemy walks in your land,
Hey lush have fun
I need your grace 
You look around 
Deflowering my baby, are you my baby mate
Trying to keep time
Shadow take our places here in this ballet
I hope I get old before I die
Where dreams are true
Let the sun set,
Looking for a ride in and out of town,
This was all too familiar, but I've never been on this side of things
It's ringing
Like it did the day before
Baby you're no train, you're the steam blowing by
Close your eyes
Save me from the movies and someone else's dreams
But you came here with my best friend Jim
You're a rainbow
Or has your brain been idle too
Make you stay around all night
Tough you're pleading come save me
Beautiful shadows in my mind
Als der neue Tag erwacht, die Klingen kreuzen
Yeah we both know it's all just washed away
Deine Augen nicht feucht sind
And over the streets of the city
Sound of monkey voices
But I'm not afraid of all that space
I know I'll find my way, back home
There's just no mercy in your eyes, child
Suites your taste of bitter ends
'Cause I worry all the time
I know the world is upside down
Guiding us forward through pastures of dream day
We overcome in sixty seconds with the strength we have to together
Fall on me when you come 
Melody day where have you gone
I remember when mom and dad brought you home
Mesmo sabendo que so musica baiana
Your fingernails drag across the walls as you unlock the door
Is like a drive in movie screen that is pressed against the sky
But, for tonight, forget it
But it matters to me
In an old order hush
And make this evening bright
We run along easy at periscope depth
Murder all around the whole world is nauseatin'
Teddy turned and ran 
But I loved you much more, baby
Wonder if it's still in safe hands
As just a few of the many things
Or stained in sin
In those abandoned towns, that's where your lost lives can be found
But there's no going back from this point now
Always running away, always running back
So much longer wind on the phone
If your life is a leaf
It's like a hurricane inside her
Has broken your wings
Of my world, yeah
LoweMorriconeTennant
Quick darling make me hurt
Live handinhand and together we'll stand on the threshold of a dream
But we buy and sell our love away
The crimson eye
For grace to be regained or won
There ain't no time to set things right
I'm losing sight and hold of home
My name spells emergency
Don't bring that stuff to bed
They expectin, the next testament by the God
A conversation on the phone
Hatin', and our enemies to hell I'm sendin' 'em
The candle in the window continues to burn
The voice from my sleep
Crimes committed are unintentional
C'mon through c'mon you come dig right into my heart
God's plan can easy bruise
You've got to have no credit cards
Spends his money foolishly and not on me
To speak my life through mics, and I never take it lightly
You put resin on my heartstrings You make 'em sing You put resin on my heartstrings Make 'em sing
The faded pictures
Her boss; the silly things he says,
Propeller seeds, corridor scene
Sometimes I wonder where this feeling began
You always guide me
This fucking world we cannot save
The mightiness of trees  that you can feel
The day me giving you the finger is a sign of the times
From old metal chairs
Two one two
Nothing to lose
Bring you back to see the lights
Last night
A careless soul
I miss you, sweet mother
Out on the boundary  she smiles 
When you're not feeling holy
Through foggy glass or windows, it was them
Oh, you are so pretty
Forgot how you said
H'hviss my little one, r'r' my crying one
Hopes and dreams they won't last long now
Put away the drafts of all your eulogies
There's not a chance of going down, but then we just might
I know our love will last forever
In all of those years
Sky scraping on backs of mantaray
Well, I've been where you're hanging
It gets right to me
Incoming fire
The streets start trends and end them  be cautious
And take off your shoes and socks, and run you
I was in the desert waving planes and burning phone books
Buried beneath his haunted memories
And I'm still the same
Driving around this messed up town
If all your moves were words, 
For the whisky I had drunk
But the days they just drown me
When I try and do what's right
Let down your bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
And the hope I had is dying
I know you fight against the shadows
Exploding outward
Listen to the hammers falling in the breaker's yard
If you go or if you stay
I wait for her now and then
I turn around to talk
Tell me if your day was rough
I'm still waiting
These veins are drying me up 
It's the season of grace coming out of the void
Years may pass but the story will be told of Mother Maylene and us her sons of disaster
In the warm nurse
The danger of love Makes the power of your way
The time we were great before the self hate let's bring it back, y'all
Walk away, walk way
Let the world go on go on
My eyes fall from my head
The night fallin' over Brooklyn, where they murder for change
What are you about
They're in the business of inventing saviors
Just when things seemed the same, and the whole scene is lame
When in day light leaves you staring
Churns out pain instead of love
Behind the waterfall, no one can name that thing they saw
How many roads you've traveled
Saw you staring out in space
Yeah we tried to understand it
Just my dream
When am I worth it to you baby
Shame on pain
And was reflected in the sun
But this fire glows stronger yet
She'd change for anyone
Nobody sees her here, her eyes are slowly closing
I follow to the edge of the earth and fall off
I can't go home  I can't go home
With a blank, blank stare
Take a chance or let me go
Rhythms we expressin similar to our ancestors
Arther Ashe must be turnin in his grave
Sometimes the medicine can heal her kind
Save my feet from dancing with anyone at all
And I hope you run into them soon
And if he feels like crying she's there to hear him,
How the son has gone to seed
Giving me strength through your love and pride
There's water and there's fire
The edges of our love are in the stars 
And this machine won't stop
That the walls cave in
I won't fight it
We'll go and fight them back
With the ripples and their stories
Feels like I sampled true love, yeah
'Cause my rent's always a month late
Cursing the wealthy
It comes and goes
And I say this not from hate;
And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind
Your smile is just a careless yawn
Yeah, I hit the bottom, hit the bottom and escape, escape
It will make you sweat like hell
Oh, I've lived on top of my own words
These lips are crusted shut 
And I would give my life away, yeah
Whispered in the dark
Where the river splits towards the sea
On hunting ground 
Oh, at least put some hope in the bottom of the box
All the rain coming down
I'm the one who gets the run around
I'll be feeling blue
Give them love
Bright before me the signs implore me
Pride to the back move ahead strong
Leaving home was the best thought that she had
When you speak I fall away 
And you bent down on your knee and picked an apple from the ground
There's someone like you
Just singing
You've got her
Reveal for me shine for me
Always running away and running back
The passengers have lost their smiles
I've got your words in me
I didn't pull away
Face the world on your own
And became another sun
Sacrifice is all we have
That follows the night;
It's the season of eyes meeting over the noise
And we found ourselves in the sea
It's their loose lips that laid me so sick with
And I've cried for all your troubles
That really makes you worthy of the peoples support
You got here too late, it's often so
Amen  Amen
End of a perfect day
Oh, at least put some hope in the box for me
Their eyelids are all fluttering
If we can't save ourselves, then let's save the kids
You're smart and kind and you're too easy on my eyes
You and I are side by side 
But the layin' in a grave so long, poor boy
Quiet secrets on the wind I hear
He dreams of his lawn
Worn out shoes because lotus blue is hanging in the hall
I just can't bare to tell you some lies
Momma stayed home with me
The glass ain't half empty it's half full that's why I'm a table drinker
Tell me how it feels
If I could have one wish
Why did none of them dream of trying
And when she didn't seem to listen at all
Please someone blind my eyes
Narrow my eyes
There must be things to do if I wanted to
I text you back but where is that
Redesign my life, and my cares,
The girl waited for me
So late at night that I
And love's the sweetest taste
And it's you and me and all of the people
Every wounded soldier
'Cause I saw a man
Someday I'll hold you again
And the day has barely begun
Where time begins to fade
Put some home in the bottom of the box
You lift my spirit, take me higher, make me fly,
In hotels and not your home
I love it when she sings to me
The grim faces that you're passing
We turn it out; Hilltop we've been down since
We're all on the same side 
Wait for love, for love
Thought she roll with bad boys forever in many ways
Everyone who comes to me
Then I opened up my eyes and found that we're right back where we were
And when his air runs out
Here's my confession
As the night begins
As siamese songbirds
Come into the light ��������
Hinter all diesen Fenstern sitzen Menschen
A strand of hair came undone
You know we all crumb snatchers in this land of big cake
The nights are drawing in
Where there's no price I would not pay, no
Who pays your bills How come you came this far
Music, sex or something inbetween
All them teenage dreams of rapping
Are we the soul
Line by line, a number of signs
They said that she was a facility Like a dream
If I find that they've sweetened your night
I was just, thinking about you, thought I could call you, see if, I should tell you
And we swam the evening away
Broken glass was all over
I want to touch your permed hair
Every now and then life says
Well you've done enough to prove us all
I told you that I'd be right back
I have none left to ease your load
Oi P it's your round
The whole world wanna be rappin' with me
Drift on, drift on
I know the world is upside down, I know the world is upside down
Cause there will come
Something you won't tell me
Took the last breath away
The best part of being with you
Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same
The nighttime gets weary of implecations afterglow
Drinking down my chances to ever return to anyone
Broken noses hung up on the wall
Just know that these things will never change for us at all
But it's worth it I love the thrill
Friends made you sensitive
There goes a forest and there goes a bluebird
I hope to see her round the bend
Everybody's telling me
And burning bright reminds us
I text you back but what is that
How deep down, my love will go
But that one was his fault
Crosseyed again
Hey lush have fun haven't you had enough
All of this wasted time
Got a head full of you
But no word or warning do you say
And in a rare, certain light
Mommy don't worry Teddy boy's here 
It feels as black as the thoughts I had
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
That heaven's no better
Just when you get on a roll
It'll answer your questions if you understand the message
Somebody that I loved so much
The last time I saw you
I can't hear a single word you say
Na it's your round
Save the work for the afternoon
Smile, darling, baby,
Comin' up out of the ghetto was a hell of a struggle, for selling the fiends yayo
Tin can at my feet
Hey you still owe me five anyway bro You get the round
The more I love, the more I grow
I'm willing to try to forgive and forget this thing
Who run and fight
Then did wave goodbye
It's funny how life is seldom what you plan
Light, a child with his own fantasmagoria 
I can feel the air redesign my hair,
Let's take a ride
The power of love
huoneeseeni lentamaan
You won't be back
Though others died for us
We be runnin' in the sun to lay where it's shady
But my skin's crawlin
We didn't bring the bodies, we didn't throw them on your floor
You hoped that if you'd forget your memories
And put a pause to her smile 
But it's only cryings that come up in the air
Can you turn this pale water to wine
'Cause people change
No one crosses the street that way
Thick with ghosts, the wind whips round in circuitries
And a butterfly in the wind is drifting like I do
Are ghosts awandering these halls
To help me kill some time
Something to be thinking this
Never mind if it could be worthing
And I guess I will protect myself from you
You know the reason why 
I think back in the day, I absorbed everything like a sponge
All you take from someone else
And stand in sunlight
Who's waiting for answers from a boy who can't speak
The princess of Hollywood way
Give me more than one caress
Hug, hug, hug me and kiss, kiss, kiss me
Like when my people understood their prominence
Around every single corner
I love you more than you could know
I'm waiting to see
Let a whisper come touch you, come touch every thing
Not all the heat from the sun
He'll fall all the way down
If I can't go out and I can't stay in
I don't have a real reason why
Sees her face in the trees suspended in limbo
Let the wind blow through your heart
Red lights, bumping, life is what you make it, then sorry
We smelled the cold bark in the air and the sweetness of 
Wash away, wash away
I feel as we're drowning in the deepest sea
And a bird you would've loved the sight of
I surrender
Whatever happened to that old song
Who kissed the neck of a pretty woman named Grace
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
She laid her hands upon my head
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
Or just appeared in parking lots of truck stops
Followers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary
Now it's looking like a dream shot down
You better watch your step
Let it shine all around them
Every time you say a word
One, two, three, yeah
I mean every word
That scream I got to get mine x
All things to me
Some of the greatest minds on the planet are among us
When you need some kind of guarantee that you're protected
When everything is dark, still something shines
And I know they got a cure for this shit, we ain't rich
Oh, but you got me at "Paris"
All the things you say get back at you
Around the world we say make a beter day
And I will protect myself from you
And it's just not fair
Praying that tomorrow I'll be braver
Ooh, watch your step
Makes the power the danger of love
And here is the man pushing paper past her
Her moon
As many people pass
A love affair
There's nothing new that I could tell to you
CD cases broken in a desperate chance to find the perfect ballad
I watched your dreams all slip away
Like the whispering wind in the top of the trees
And I'm afraid I've lost the fight
Sem sair do sofa, deixar a ferrari pra tras
Oh kind friends
Hurt like a bird on a wire
God makes the man
She's ahead of the line
But the layin' in a grave, poor boy
I'm tryin' to change the world
If you're the one
Like, don't covet your neighbour but watch him closely
With a party to arrange
Blue bells rings
But this stake that holds you in
Everyone except me
Whisky lemon
If it should rain, we'll let it
Playing your games with your innocent eyes,
And all about the pretty careerist the next cube over
And we'll race to the bottom of the glass
Man, Martin must be turnin in his grave
I see it all like a fly on the wall
I'm in the flesh, let's talk, about sex
I'm always free
They are not departed or gone
No I'm not in love
Come into the light �������᪸����
What we all dream about
Is a wind that has lasted
Just why does she need him, and why does she stay here
And you leave me with my jaw on the floor, hey
The blinking lights, and now all I'm thinking is
From walking on a line, I keep some poise
Watch who's knocking on your front door
I am your brother  under the sun 
You're the measure of my dreams
Until we're home
Erased our signatures from things
Must be things to do if I knew how to
Happy end �� �� �Ӭ� �� �ެ�
You feel the power of love
You turned when we heard them, your breath hung in the air 
May you never change
And that will make you feel good
Dragged and washed with eager hands
Cause maybe my mom's right,
If I could make it in New York, I figured anywhere I'd make it
Like a dream from which we wake
We can sit in uncomfortable seats and eventually
They'll be blue skies in a better world, darlin'
Love you like the rain, falls much faster
Live a lil' love
But you're a bird in a cage 
And we will be as one people
Of faded lives
And she's taking her time
Something's lost when I translate you
We sail
Crossing the mountains of truth, see them
I know I'd throw it all away,
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
We're all becoming one again
Empower myself and be my own authority
Come into the light ������������
All the trouble it brings
Where the wild winds blow
I'm busy lappin' it up, I might be here all day
In this moment of tranquility
Into another new year
But behind something hides
It's the season of scars and of wounds in the heart
I may be wrong, I thought we said
But I won't lose your love without a fight
In silver trees
At last we know it's time
We keep it all inside
I can't keep up and I can't back down
The good will come out 
'Cause I'm about  get openhearted
There in the winter light
When the darkness surrounds them
My dream weaver  nobody knows
All right, let's do this
With ginseng and fresh squeezed juice
That locked my face away
Shed your light
How can I hope to reach your love
Love of love, love of life and giving without measure
You won't cry, won't cry, won't let them get to you
I was still burning
The spaceman, spaceman
Get up girl, sing for me
'Cause when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I'm waiting for you
Memories of light and laughter
And threw me down upon my back
Groove zu dem Beat bis in die tiefste Nacht x
What you hope to gain
We can sigh, say goodbye, Ross and his dependencies
Don't bring that stuff to bed I'll touch you here
A mystical mistress in the forest of night
Sometimes it's bad
To hang around each corner
But I know they're just memories
Under the mountain, a golden fountain
So as cold night fades into darkness
We started to put songs together like 'What'
I look at the light and it sends a lonely shiver down my spine
Haven't felt me feel real in a long time
Well down on Venice Beach, you had to jet before dark
Where the sun steals the sand,
She's gonna make you do right
Oh I'm missing you
And I wonder what she wished for I just wished for you
But one day we might make it to Mexico
Your body's sending questions to answers
That turned love into hate 
The neighborhood watch is jewels and spots
Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles
It's not like you are cheating we're only meeting
'Cause everything I need is written on your face
Counts his days
Won't you put me on top or change the odds
This used to be a Spanish town
And I can hear you singing
How can I hope to reach your love
And oak bend not for me
When she woke up on the back seat of a studded car
'Cause I cannot paint pictures with my tongue
I remember when mom and dad named you Claire
What does this story know
But we will be as one god
Tell boner life just ain't fair
Of a candle in the night
And then you let me make it right
Choking on the dirt and sand
A smile for boss
Beneath the dull porch light
Only dreams will hold their sway and defy
Until you drifted from my view
"The king was right We fought with hope and might
What can bring to you
The streets is breathing, the streets is watching
What can I bring to you
Sing for a while
You've gotta pay for all the things you've ever thought
Coming to the end of my road, but I never wanted it like this, not like this
Long search is over, the soul is uncovered
We'll have a marathon of your choice
It's time to follow the black path
Sometimes it feels as though I have a key
I can't change, I don't wanna change
You've gotta pay for all the things you've ever lost
While angels make their music and give my spirit wings
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
And then in the darkness she'll quietly say "Dear
Belinda was mine till the time that I found her
We rock tonight
Then it changed
This place is not for me
Devote to being kind
You're left forever blue
And later they brought me this song
It doesn't matter what they say
O caminho mais curto, produto que rende mais
Crosses made to bare the weight
We kissed in a field of white
Something to jock, but it wasn't no thing
You're the one who said I love you too
The time we were great before the self hate let's bring it back
Fall on me when you come down
I call you back but why is that
I was too drunk or too young 
You can see there's not a wrinkle on my face
But as a friend, not as a brother
I was always the flower, I made waves for Noah
Take my heart and help me feel
I don't want anyone
And your friends
And the air turned red around you
Oh wild is the wind
Can you hear my voice break
But if we only open our eyes
So I'll buy another pickup line and sigh
Gimme just one chance you will realise
Since the first days you know of, till the last days is over
Or at least put some hope oooh, put me on top
We can make it to Mexico city,
You said "hold on to dreams", yeah
Last words I heard 'em say
We are surrounded by such history and change
And sweet sweet forgiveness; you can go back, but it's never the same
It's always in the back of your mind
Like the hopeless time you gave to me
Look back and you find
Like bobby gave Whitney a rock but it wasn't no ring drinks party
I'm not a sailor
Surrounded by dry clouds
They say it's good for business
Like drinking, smoking, cursing, sucking
Honey, I want it my way
Oh and when you're gone
And you'll turn with every change 
Woman Singing
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightnin'; but
To stop my fall from grace
I don't give a shit
You were always on the outside looking far beyond your destiny
I learned a way, I learned away from you
The twilight leaning
And all that was holy just slowly disappeared
And the copy machine's not working
And I turn
And this is the road I walked on
Don't need money, don't take fame
Run through the meadow and scare up the milking cows
You're breaking my heart, you've changed
Here in those eyes you hide it well
That sings for everyone
It's fleeting like light from a room
Pay no mind to those voices
This old mountain side
I don't want to change your mind
Here across your face
But you'll see, don't say I didn't warn you
We'll make it to
You haven't shown your face here since the bad news
Ridin' with my trues, humbly united gathering souls
Tin soldiers playing our tune 
A little bit longer afternoon Afternoon
Restless minds have searched  long before
Who's going the right way down a wrong way street
Yeah yeah yeah
The darkest Sunday from your own past
When the white eagle of the North is flying overhead
He could be twice as good 
Ain't a region on water
Every time you look away
Stone go slow
Wie man fruher einmal war
For my choices
To find my way to you
No one will ever be
Even risking our hearts
Alone and
When you lose everything
Knowin' not a thing can change with me, singin'
I love you so
Black and white
I'm up here running in repeat
I miss my girl
You might be waiting for a long time
Through the green lights
'Cause play starts in the mind In the mind
Parttime thing
A bird you would've liked brought the sky down,
You took the train with heavy tickets
Head full of trouble
Cause baby you're so good to me
I'm coming home
I'm on my way home now
Wild is the wind
Now all you wanna do is hustle
And things go fast
Or trouble is gone
Last night we went out to the orchard in the snow
You'll be first to spin your story
There's gold in them hills
The th time I saw you
You've got my head spinning 
My body's sending promises that I cannot keep
A cidade sutilmente estremeceu
So baby, will you marry me
No time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is
Back in the days, I'm the clown prince
I see your breath in the air, it's shaped like words
I've got your voice on tape
So come inside my room tonight
You'll have to wait a minute 'cause it's an instamatic
Other Voice garbled I just wanted to call to say hi, and um, I think I might bring Marissa and Tracy up to Topeka garbled
I think someone should have told you that
I saw a man x
Woo the sleeping one, r' the crying one
She knows that Terry will be calling soon one day
'Cause when she's flying around
Sunday night is long and cold
And let your hair down
I'm in a state of mind
I don't remember how
Through the rain we hear them cry
I've got my things
I remember all those winter days
The danger of love
When the winter came around
Yeah but you don't care
Why aren't you kind to me
It don't matter to the sun
Not a mountain high
Left to cry out in the rain
Goodbye Saturday and hello week
Well my name is Badu and I rock your world, I'm also known as the
Of the seagulls in flight,
So I'll break through this rotten piece of wood again
But I can stand who I am and face the day straight 
Let it rain down on me
New apathy
Die like a fly with no lover to sigh
For the first time in your life you'd make a home
And you said the truth's like corn and lies are like weeds
Simple simple man you're gonna make it out
There's one place everybody goes
And keep them in the woods
>From cities where making 's a big accomplishment
From the second floor
I'm gonna hold on to the love we have togther
The fruit on the ground, and the wood smoke above
Have you lost your breath
And all the plans I had inside
They're bored and waiting for you, so put on your shoes and
It's the power of love
Carry on, be strong my son
They were waiting for me
It said that she was just a normal girl, It's like a dream
Puts you back into place
Tell me the season is almost over
Interesting and sophisticated
Joey catch a kangaroo, hug you
All the roads lead after you
If turning this around is what I have to do
Let it rain
All at the same time 
But for tonight forget it
Don't stop don't stop
With your kiss my life begins
I just want to freewheel
We were shown it's only time
Around the world wa say make a beter day
Now if we wait and do nothing
Dass sie es wert sind zu bleiben
Spellbound and hellbound
Watch how your fingers twist and change
You can leave me in orbit
All the souls that I've known
Waters rise around us
And pointed full of pain
Seven moons for seven seas
Save yourself, yourself
Hold me close to where You are
Don't you see we're all hurt the same way 
Where's my bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard, bodyguard
Living off somebody's life
I can get you out of your body
None of my men were down in the fight
Darling boy, I always adore ya
I think of you today
At the man in the cardboard coffin
Dry your eyes, face the dawn
Good days are alive 
At least a song won't leave
Just drive 'til the tape's done
They're crawling up my back
We can sail, we can sail with the Orinoco flow
I spoke for everyone
Picture you kissing me as were falling asleep
I'll be waiting, get home
You paint me white, you clean me off
I'm not an early bird, plus the feathers are black
But you got burned by the flames 
And the evening so easily
But it was useless to see it without you around
I wanna be the first on the last
I will watch the sky come following me
Are all the good ones taken
But I don't mind
Don't come back here again
I'm starting again I'm breaking the chain
It will not bring you
When the world closes
There's no more to say to let you know it's alright
And there are no remedies
And the hood fell off her head
Each night cause your place isn't far
But there's nothing can keep me from loving you
And the greeneyed goddess got ready for all out war
I'm best to let go
So take me away
I asked would you wait for me
Are the wonders of my world
All you could wish for and all you could dream
��  �߬֬������ڬެ� baby 
I love your halfass accent you stole from the foreign movies
And all you have is gone 
Seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
Now the days all look the same
I just concertina and wrap around the world
Rimani ancora un po
White telephone
I've come to my senses
You tune out without warning
Be happy my love
You call me back but why is that
In a fist full of sand
Keep your eyes open up all night,
Desire is burning me inside out
I'm fleeting like light in a room
There's no price I did not pay, no
So just bounce, like you're banging in the back of your car
We didn't bring the bodies, we didn't throw them on your floor,
And my skin burns 
They touched both my eyes
They took the moldings off the walls
It's so deep it's meaningless
Standing up against the light on the TV
What is the body if not a place were you store all anger and happiness and pain
But it s worth it I love the thrill
Do you love me like you say
I make no noise
In haunted airs
Your eyes held a tender light
With the under current lurking,
Along the way the colors ran
The line you walk cause something's got to give
And when I ride
Just to cast away the ghosts
A Hiding place beneath blue skies
Don't wanna be on top of your list, monopoly and properly kissed
I don't trust myself anymore
Broken windows and empty hallways
And I could hear you voice ringing
We are like birds of a feather 
A million miles away
The day is night, departed alive
She has black and white eyes
That I die in front of each night
Oh, can anybody else feel the way I do
Just up the block
Where the beauties of heaven
If I married your mother you still wouldn't be half of me
You'll learn some day, won't you
How I longed for the journey, and those far distant lands,
And stand in your glory
If you need sometime to think
Help me to discover what it is you're thinking of, ooh
And they won't be making a sound
They will bind you with love
You said life ain't a highway
What did you think I'd do
But I better let you know
I know it feels good, so good, we should tonight
Everything This is the slow rush
Not fire no not ice
I'll welcome each day,
Finally dived into the sea
Wine and forgiveness are all that I need
But for now, emotional ties, they stay severed
Ride on a roller coaster upside down
Now the river may grow wider
Vacation's come and gone too late
No ending
The th time I saw you
Bring up praise from Mecca, make a phrase for the better
You don't want, everything, my love
Will never make it out of here
It's written on the back of your hand
Stayin' inside by the warm fire
And hope it never comes to the best in nine
And when the curtains close, open up the door
But they still refuse to budge
She said that she was leaving home
We'll call it starfire
If you throw me a line, I'll only drag you in,
That kitten on the patio can't get to me
Remember our first love 
To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays
You had on blue jeans
Cause you didn't know her
True gem of the Herbrides,
I'll keep on trying to change your mind
Hold your soldiers
We did not have to be lips to face
Sweet on the streets, worth less when it's wrecked
To help and humankind me
I can depend
The danger of love Drive me crazy
Her heart is like a gold bouillon 'cause she wouldn't protest it
And start nothing you think you'll continue
I thought we graduated back in the saddle
A bottle meant for two a glass that's full of legs but free of any fingerprints
Calalily, would you make room for me in this bed
Can you see the light 
And it disappears
Now every word of every song
Pouring down your gaping mouth
He found a place where he could settle down 
Keep it simple now you're gonna make it out
Now the song is nearly over
He bought her a ring and the flowers on her bedside table,
I stay out when I want to
Right now, I can see the ground turn
A page from truelove stories
And age is welcome home
I try to tell myself 
With no connection I saw your reflection at home
Every detail in my head is
Than grains of sand
Should've listened when you said beware
I bend to your shape
'Cause I wanna see my life
My brain's in a swirl over you 
So blow a kiss to Radio City
I had a dream that we were robbed
Us because there's nothing
You've got my arms
And start the healing 
The sound of gun fire so loud and rapid, but it seems to be so quiet around me
On a timely mission
I don't want to be the one that's left behind
And even though I'm trying to smile
Change a heart to a little white dove
And you wanna be free
Well we are blurry lines between love and sin
Bringing back sweet memories
Dim the lights home
So, next time that I see you in school
She's taking a sick day soon
Nothing to prove
If you stay here close to home
All along the white line
Falling this deep wasn't part of my plans
We've got it going on
As you died in the night
Catch your breath,
Looking for a ride and all about,
It's like a page from truelove stories
e baciarsi e capirsi e stringersi
Making music like love is made
I want you inside out
To find your journey on the black path
I did them all to someone else
Would you change your last name to mine
Sometimes I get so tickled I can't talk
Tuesday flies away
Around the world we feel the love that we say hey
Feel free to hold my hand
Over by the barn in the dark, we heard the geese
There is no danger of you
But maybe it's the perfect day
Why do we need someone, really need someone
But true love is give and take
Anything 
Just to be with you, I gave everything
You can't use it, life
Our love's never coming back
And that you have to work it out some day
With those blocks, the ones that you see through
And no matter how this ends
The moon
The sun just wont break through
And head in hands
Don't look up to the stars above 
And empty heart
To show yourself your weaknesses
Come to witness spring's new hope, born of leaves decaying
Here comes your girl
You're frozen from skating too far out on the ice
It got me ready to set off the riot
So in the name of her lord let's do what we shouldn't some more
Each year leaves its unresolving fantasies
The world they see
Just then the stripper stopped in a coughing fit
And I've heard it said that a man would swim the oceans
You will have to fight alone 
As free as a bird in the trees
The math of infinity and reason
The taste of cold steel on my lips, and a second later silence fills the January air
Like the other day
And you don't heal if you won't don't bring it home
I'll stay right here till you get back
Crawling to work six feet under
It's like the whispering wind in the top of the trees
Then I will tell them I remember you
The sun sets soon
Razorteeth take a bite
On hands and knees
Feel the love inside
Night made a day like this
And their hearts will broken if you can't decide between them
On a windy porch tonight
You laid beside me as a trick
How it grows heaven knows
Lawyers write some goofy terms in letters to the future
Will when the winds of change pickup
I don't want to stand still
Pride replaces fright
The sunlight feeds
Keep it simple man you're gonna make it out
These bones are all you own
And me and all of the people with nothing to do
If I didn't know
I never like to land
I'm starting again,
Let's get two more beers and try to make a plan
Remember that old fireplace
I had a dream  that we flew on golden wings 
You poked your head out of an alley half a block away
You're still so young
You kiss me
Why then we'd see the forest for the trees
Write with my right, bat with my left hand
Love in some way you choose
Head in two devices I
Your hair is a strawflower that sings in the sun
Know of myself and
You'll find the sun comes shinin' through for you, oohhooh
That's one of my worst fears
Uprises the moon
And the angels ask me to recall
Flying this small plane
That we could hold
'Cause the fortune teller didn't talk about stars
But its a must to decipher one's girl
No, leave on the light
It's just life
Well I guess you feel the same way too
I leave my debts but no regrets  except I wish I'd took the train
They're complicated people leading complicated lives
Sometimes I get so tickled I just can't talk
To honor the pale gibbon moon
Snowflakes falling
Wash down every street
You call me to play me the sound
She lays among the flowers
Sounds of white  people
Two one two 
Are we breathing in
Everything she does is beautiful
I stand in the way of the things I can be
Someone is lost outside,
Remember then, the summer birds with wings of fire flaying
If I wait for long enough
Chasing stardust
Drive me insane the danger of love
There will be an evolution of the human soul
Our minds
When I tumbled out of the place
Like used software
Hot dam and I can't be stopped 'cause I'm lyte MC and I'm light as a rock
Thugs like me where I come from come from, come from, come from
I sing this song
It's all over now, you've changed
A couple times she walked to the train tracks
They say everything is possible but I know that it's not true
You've got to tolerate
Unfold by the sea;
Hidden in a lonely place
My fire's burnt out it's true
Can I put my arms around you
Oh we shared so much
I was so used to bein' alone
Nothing could tell the power of your smell
I could feel that you were gone
We have no sea, child
But you can raise a sinner
Stranded in a snowstorm in a town that you forgot
No one to pick you up
She curls herself up, rests her head on the window
And if we get up off our knees
There's no telling how the day might end
He gave me his shoulder
Let you know my hands shake
Blood red lips, lovely smile
The songs of twilight
All for the love of Raymond
I saw you sing out your praise 
But listen to her daddy's song,
Does he know that I call you at all
I don't know why this took so long It wasn't hard for me to see It wasn't that I dind't notice It was just hard to believe
Living in a piece of ever after
Blurry lines between love and sin
I rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese, with soldiers
But now upon that Christmas scene
I love the cars and everything, the diamond rings
It sure helps if you can see the funny side
Before it happens, yeah
Like when my parents first split up
Or put everything on a song
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
It's Hilltop we're the first to come last to leave
Stay with me, baby, and we'll make it to
She's gonna make you do right,
We can still close our eyes if this goes south
Of long winters and motels what went through your mind
Fly away to a land
I loved you then and from now on
You knew this from the start
Giving herself a chance there's no need to show her how it should be
Where hope is currency and death is not the last unknown
Now where'll I go to living alone
Of your name
I never planned in my imagination
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
If you had half a mind
Flowers are nice, flowers are pretty
When it was one mass of land, with one nash' of man
You used to take me up I watched and learned
This noose around our kiss,
Wait, we still great but
A mind full of vintage skies
You still land
To the walls, a crude set of stairs
Well I feel like I'm lost in time,
Don't bring that stuff to bed don't hide those tears
Determinely advance technology better than Germany
Oh yes, I gave my life away
My foots always in my mouth I just can't stomach defeat
Smiled at your funny little ways
She realized the there'd be no turning back
The sting of reason
You were at the party
And this is my chance
The sidewalks will carry you home
I study I know the scriptures but nowaday ain't it vicious
You don't have to walk alone
Like the whispering wind you sent to me
If you can't find love then you will finally see
That I've been living in a dream
Life was but a sad dream
We move in circles day to day
You got shot with a bow
Thinking it's time to get a hold
Where you placed me in the spring
Leaving for work Monday morning
You die, you're gone just like me
I know the world is upside down is upside down
Consoling my mind
As strong as that wind
Then he can come back to me
They have seeped to son
The stars have all stopped shining
And just to be with you, I'd give anything
In six inch heels, quoting magazines
I said how did we end up here you said happenstance
That I do not hope to turn again
Eu nao entendo a sua volta
And a head like snow that can never be still
Die like a clown with no friend around
I did try hard to burn my eyes
She kisses the photo on the wall beside her bed,
Everybody hatin' everybody overrated
Oh, I know we shouldn't take sides
quer durch die Wildnis
You can call me a liar 
Her eyes are staring at me
Some of my rap patterns, still surround Saturn
And after he's finished, she lies there and wonders
I said I don't think you know what your missing
I like the way you talk
Remember spending all those winter nights
Come inside
We can talk for hours or just lay in bed
So, come down with me
So narrow your eyes
And I despondent turned and left
And my past life visions of the continent
I don't wanna rush you now
The power that makes the world go round
Through endless skies
I followed a sound
Ooh yeah
Far away 
And there are leaves from my fingertips, unfurling
You know I fooled around playing the field
When someone pushed you down
Hey, lush, have fun
Against your lips
A love not warm
And not floss but invest in mine
Monday morning
Ondas amarelas no contorno cheia
That she hides so well, so well under that dress
She's been dancing in a topless bar
So when life be stressing me
Go to practice, with tactics, when the track hits, theatrics
With you now, don't you know, can't you see I got over *you*
Reason why i need to fly, hide away
I see it sway as you come for me
We could start heeling today
Punchdrunk, snowblind, as though the whole thing were a bad dream
And work your line
Que una gota de luz
And to the edge where shadows meet
Or if there's anything left for us
I'm not talking of the fist time
I can see it in your eyes
They stole the subjects from your paintings
Beware of what come natural
A body laying on the floor
In my mind
While I tried to stop with cigarrettes
Time gets selfish 
And I gave you a music box
'Cause it ain't gonna stop the world no
And I've got to be dumb
Just one more plane ride and it's done
Something that no one deserves
But all of those dreams are in empty motion
Touch the moon up in the sky, when you are mine
The th time I saw you
I'm in the shit, kneedeep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
You need medicine chill a Pressure vendettas for real
When the road was as dark as my fears
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
For me you are the one
If you smile
Every day is full of fun and family spies
Try to put me to shame 
Round and round 
Today is just another day, take another breath in, hold it forever
Cover your mouth
She comes back haunting me
Tell them, tell them I always knew why
I'm digging holes, into my heart, trying to find the very end
Devotament a de'u pregau
We will be forever as one 
I'm thinking of you in someone else's arms,
It's a lie in the end, you only satisfy your friends
The last rose of summer would stay
Just to be with you, well I'd do anything
Why aren't you
Refrain
The water broke our fall
Like remind my soul remind my soul, yeah
I don't need anyone else
And that ain't good he's always bringing me down
I'm turning straw into gold and then back again
But if I were raised to fight, that would be me,
These sounds, they seem to write themselves
Deafened by the sound
Deep in my heart right from the start
Up with the sunrise you'll be staring
It's the nightmare of digression that engulfs a history 
Bicycles, tricycles, ice cream candy
empty space until  
I pen letters that kill
How could I see anything  how could I be anything
Deeper we'll fall
His words were very nice
All in one breath
I can't carry on for long
Disorder and confusion everywhere
I know that we can find the way
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
No one seems to care
And come tomorrow you won't laugh alone
And I dare you to forget
I don't wanna freak but the tongue erodes
My heart is on my sleeve, my head is in the sand
I won't lower my eyes 
I washed away my tears, washed away ten years
Someone had died
Speed along the highway,
Can give you all you need  just listen still
Every country city and borough, sidestreet and ghetto
Paper ring
The time we were great before the self hate
They get to watch your step
Freedom won't answer your call
You can undo what you've done
kommt die Einsamkeit
And I think to the past sometimes, an dag man, it's bad
Her hands all over me 
Always missed, gone wrong in a way
I can't forgive you anything
Your body's sending questions to answers,
And backsteps were things you've denied, 
Half Bboy, half Zboy, the street lights watch
She drove herself around the block
I felt so lonely
The ribbons of the flag
To the beat y'all and ya don't stop
It ain't no stoppin' us now, 'cause we can prove this shit
Do you ever look at me and see another man
Running my fingers through your hair,
Come see me in my land
I had a dream  of the wide open prairie 
Ooh, the people I've met
The only thing that matters to my life
It matters to me
Bob Marley would be disturbed from his rest
A bright young thing
On the ground
I feel sincerely you're too much 
You don't want to understand
Sweet summer day
I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days
In some lonely place
Through the windows in the fading day
Cool your heads
"How the hell did I get here"
Are you rich or are you rough
Everything This is an absent blood clot 
A cidade levemente flutuou
And I'm a wreak havoc, little man with a big pen
Coffee and a half a pack
Why should I stay here
The showers fall tonight
And no words while our worlds quake
And walk in the sand
Everything's so rushed This is the slowrush hour 
I know you see the light
You won't cry, yeah
On his face
We independent, I'd sign on the line
I number myself among them
Resting on joy that abounds without ceasing
Had to take matters into my own hands
Clear the way for all your private memories
Something inching past the edge of reserve
Don't stop, don't stop
Sometimes her forehead gets hot
To the barge that is waiting
But this is what you did What you did to me
Narrow your eyes
Light their way
You're smart and kind and easy on my eyes
She smiles 
The kids all stare, the cars slow down
To no real father of mine
Law as well spit in the eye
On a hilltop high above
The old world was dying
Would never come my way
Shadows of night disappear
The orange bled the blue
There goes a cop car and there goes an eagle
When the rain had left the sky
Lonely, lonely
Pick up the phone and call me lover
Come on, don't stop
In my offwhite coupe back '
That when the white flag is flown
And I've heard it said that a man would swim the ocean
When it comes, just when it comes
She asked to herself what had she done
Just to be with the one he loves
You should see it before there's nothing left
I'm building a box made of wood from a tree that I grew
First up, on the dolcet tones of the Gravy Bone Project
Power of love is a curious thing
I dreamt I was a letter
And besides it would still be all right
And all I know is spilling out into the ground
I see your dreams all slip away
Gucci girl Well I'm super cute and play ain't bad
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I hate to leave you here this way
A fallen angel
Like they're shaped by their storming
We looked in each other's eyes 
I'll put the phone right up to the PA
She took the midnight train to nowhere
And we'd see the new sun rising
The I'll die three times
Date back I go beyond check the holy Qu'ran
And I know grace
Our happy storm is through
Apologies, but you don't really have a hold on me
We will know that the fate of one is the fate of all
You've been missing
With a sound
I never dared to speak from my heart
What are you waiting for
On a high white box in a pile of rocks
I know you're still in love with me
Young hearts remain unseen
Choramos no carnaval
This is what you did What you did to me
My love shall never die
I got this feeling that it's gonna be alright
See you in my dream tonight the danger of love
A lonely day, lonely day
To know how good it feels
Loving on a no good plan never treats me as he should
And each time I hear who's to part
The eyes have it, once again it's your Peoples
Slow day but I pass the time
You and I can change the world
Come into the light    I'm here
It's all over now, baby blue eyes
You roll your eyes
Earth Mother Bear and Eagle was on the run
Respect the hustle and set the tone
Take up your hands
Everything looks the same
She knew right then
I call you back but what's that
But now in a parking lot in Washington
And laughing at the voice on the crackling radio station
And if we turn around can we ever get back
I was about to take the road
Danger I never think of danger
Still we want it all
I know these dreams seem make believe
Tell me you always go before me
Watching tides and season change
Here is love and there is pain
Face by face, unwords behind
It was a rainy day today
About the end of the world
Ice upon the water
Don't let me go
I'm doing this for another ten years
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
Eyes scan the path ahead and all around
And always the same
I can't go out and I can't stay in
In orbit always
If I were honest
Sunshine in me to stay
You're the one who made my dreams come true
Seasons change
Throw all on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
And I realize there's tomorrow
I know I'm prone to rushing 
Keep yourself within yourself 
Shatters the scene and brings chaos to beauty
And young children play;
You've got to believe it
Take the b train or the shuttle
On distant shores of night
Call in sick we're never leaving this place
Meet you in each street
Put the rope around my neck
Yes, I gave my life away
With no real things,
You know it's taken a long time to realize
All my all my life 
That way we can fuck and watch TV
Focus on unbiased lines
Oh, can anybody else see what I do
Get it wrong and it makes you sore 
My toe hit your toe lightly
You're a face in the distance I hope to recognise
Meet this friend indeed
Let me fly away with you
Everything 
To find the way to you
Quietly a beast for thee
Just take some time to breathe
I don't want anyone else
Then something good just might come crashing
With all the friends who told you
There'll be a fire burning in the temple of our peace
Is the same as what you're losing
Your thoughts will curl
Today I saw the strangest thing on the evening news
First time you feel it  it might make you sad
Where ocean meets the shore
Ovi on parempi avata jotta karkaa vartija
Which way to turn 
They went off with years of clothing
With you doday girl
Something good will come our way
But now I can't work out what I'm supposed to do
Take, take, take, take my arms
So come closer
Dandelion, milkweed, silky on a sunny sky
Just leave it all behind, 'cause it will be all right
But we still live on, we live on
Remind my soul uh
How many hands on my head
Making everything look beautiful
It's time to escape the shame,
Looks to the sky for intervention
Sinking ships around us
Hit my head, hug my heart x
But there's nothing can keep me from lovin' you
Melody day what have I done ah
And I'll paint you face she said
It's all around you
I'm missing you
Taking good care of you 
It's mine and yours, let's guard the block
What does this story hold
Afterall, I'm the princess of Hollywood way
Fear makes us critical
No navigation system Beyond our eyes
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
The whole scenery reminding me I should rhyme
To keep her feet on the ground
And I didn't understand, so I made other plans
And love lies dying all on the ground
I guess all good things have to end All things will never be the same I just wanted you to know To know that doesn't change a thing
Where we used to reside
Soon you'll wandering away your fears
For the right moment
We will find illumination in unnatural light
I try hard to smile through all of your lies,
And tries to hold back a silly tear
Thought endless
You were one of god's children
Water was running, children were running
She gave me something cool to drink
If the waters cool I might just swim,
There's nothing to stand on
Please bring me down
I'm sure you had another lover Another lover
And I didn't see the way 
If we don't have that last place to go
But hey, the neighborhood watch guard the block
The Dark Island
My pulse is racing while 
I got deep into my mind, see I got a treasury
And there's your girl
He was traveling abroad
You held your part
Let it push us apart if we wish to stay
And he says 'I know about your man'
I wanna hear about your day
Whatever happens between you and me today probably will be OK
We walked through the blackness, felt the endless space around
From the deep sea of Clouds to the island of the moon
Bright as the stars we're under
Feel free to kiss me on the cheek even though I'd
Shrugged him off, and locked the door
This is goodbye
Crying, "Lord, have mercy for what I have done"
The smell of rain
Their hands are never steady
We've laughed too loud, and woke up everyone
Whatever happened to strength in numbers uh
Your car is pulling off of the curb, hey
Blast beats with saxophones one of the baddest rapper's known
It's so rare she ever sees him,
It's all around, it's all the same
I examine my heart
In your freefall from the ground
Took a while but you hittin' me back
Seven percent own eighty four percent of all the wealth on earth
Between blessing the beat and stressing to eat
A mind full of cheering lies
I don't know how they got there but I'm sure it's the fuckers in their ships
Like remind my soul remind my soul
Why keep a poor man alive in a job he hates
My remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
I heard them singing
You will travel a thousand miles without leaving my sight
