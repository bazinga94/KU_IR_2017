So forget this so called dirt of mine
You'll never find with no one else
White boys with tattoos, pointing right at you
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore
Hip parties and sunglasses at night they help him not to see
But it's Fuck the world, get a child out her
We dedicated to cats that's been thuggin'
I've no land, I'm from nowhere
'Cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk
Misguided by myself  full of fatal pride
No peace inside of me
I'll still open your letters
Give anything
You won't feel a thing
You just tied me to the mast of the ship of fools
I won't let go
Like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
As if things never changed
We're the hope
His humour cut her deep
Don't point your finger of blame
How Christ turned his cheek or came down from the hill
I hope you feel it
Ain't nothing to me 'cause I am the streets
You roll me a carpet, roll me a carpet, boy
Don't shame me, for sinking the ship
Everybody is trying to figure me out
It's Hed pe homie we born to ride
There's no restraining order to keep me from you
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
"But there's nothing we can do
Say, one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in
This is a call to arms
You've been playing games
In digging up our ground
Crushed and shit your bones and blood siphon
Everything's set, everything's fine
To see the universal through a cats eyes
You fucking praise him Yes, you fellate him with your trust
There's not a net and there's no one there
I love you
An old man once told us
Iron in my spine's conducting lightning
And when it starts to rain
That gets me
Coverups official statements 
Do what you want and you're never gonna kick me round
Never comin' back
They say that we chase dreams that don't exist, 
Least I thought I did
I can feel the daylight
In my dreams they're calling
Which classify order species, subspecies
We sneak the guns right in, y'all keep tryin'
Today I woke up and these leaves had all withered
But I will look this world
Mad at all of us 'cause every song is a fucking hit
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
This is a collision on the road
I let it go  drive real slow
Under a Beirut Moon
Gotta get Los Angeles
I leave 'em looking bleaker than Memphis
You've made the cut, and stayed to watch it bleed,
Just let me plug you into my world
But people make me angry
Be it your best friend or any other 
Remember gloves
With the blood of the poor
You you you you you get it away
Quicker than email to your ass sayin', "Kill kill kill"
Or simply hide it in the chest of drawers inside your room
I don't need you
It's the sword that we live by
I don't want to go to heaven, its filled with pricks like you
Du siehst Rauchschwaden, ich hinterlass 'n Flammenmeer
Now is the time now is the time 
The sun now faded
And did our laughter, did our tears
Mouths move to fistfights to wage wars
Carnal bondage
Doubt stripping the soul
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kids lips
When you get to all the other stacks
Careful what your lips imply
polkimeni painamalla 
Into the floor we'd sink, with another drink
I haven't been loved by a man in quite a while
And now you know how roles can change
He hides behind the door
What happened to the days
God is a gun and it's on a shooting spree
Often buries something else growing
Cardboard dinners and the saints and the sinners
Flatten every surface, destroy difference
Completely wrong
Each moment here I die a little more
I've been stuck
The return of Goodfellas Part Two
Until it's to late and the damage has been done
Is ever going to end
Now the rain is coming and I'm running from myself again
Outnumbered like the Alamo
So now you're all alone
My tender jewel my precious pearl
We've gotta take cover we're flirting with death
She straightens the tipsy headdress of her spouse
On the first floor there are two old maids
And God said, Let there be light"
He'd promise her anything
Those most deserving will end up with the most
Think of all we've done together
His true fears he left without a care
Have left me silent,
dass ich mich rachen kann
Hotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter you see
All'inferno porta e non torna mai 
You ain't doin' this so you know you just talking shit
'Cause when I'm finally done you'll know why it's called a crush
dentro di te non basta mai
Hello pain
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
But staring at you now I'm glad he did
Forthrightness lost
With claws of carelessness and fangs of apathy
The cycle continues time for your crime 
Misogynists abound waiting to produce your fall
I cannot stand the way you tease
'Cause your karma's in trouble narcissistic, narcissistic
Oh my, you are obscene just for enquiring
But words fail me
No sleep till I can't hear the sound
Into the air
Somehow you'll get through"
I'm going out to get a heart attack
Tryin' to knock boots nigga
Adonde vas, tu crees poderte escapar
Well did you hear, there's a natural order
I didn't hear you coming from behind
All the bridges burnt, now the tables turn
Wake up on Sunday morning
They don't understand what it means to you to see your dreams come true
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
And through all the worst of time,
Throw it all back
When we die, we won't make +Jet+
Terrorist confrontation
If any nigga looking too hard, we Rodney King'n them
Off and on he's been here
I'm gonna be tired old and bitter, and really messed up
Blood on the leaves, blood at the root
From the open sky to solidary
I go out every other night
I throw it all away Don't talk to me no more
And it's hard to keep your sanity when spirits'll consume you
Bastard magic should make you cry
My life starts where your life ends
My man Lo said it's best to do it for the people
They'd better get their shit together it's time that they awoke
Too gone, too long, baby
Lil wayne
Mutha fukin' Lil' Wyte straight from the Mtown mutha fuka
The belief of higher purpose is yours not mine
loihdin hatakeinon hammastyttavan
Suckers the girls roll
Wash your hands, they reek of what you've done
It's all right
The fireworks say it's over
I've seen women kill more careers than any whack album did
I can fake a smile of a kind that you've never seen
You'll change your addiction
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Persevere until I spill blood
To ever come back, to get back in my arms
Hush little baby don't you cry
Goose step and call our bluff
I'll hold you way too long
I've got three boys
Your drunken kisses leave a bitter taste on my lips
Lost in the eyes of envy
I'm standing at the shore
Every cop killer goes ignored
Where the hell is my father shit it hurts sometimes
Alone with your demons you pray for the end
Here we come here we come
Ich trag' so dick auf wie Kleister auf 'm Tapeziertisch
And I don't want to be the one you're not thinking of
So feel me and all that you hear me say
A last chance to rectify
See all these niggas When I step in the club, I'm bringing them
We are the architects
It would be hell for me
You gotta hate that
Death comes knocking again
You know why my hands are so numb No
When I flow niggas know I'm like malcolm on dope
Thank the blood red skies
Never want to come down
I don't recall all the roads I took
Anything can happen now
I see the world  old
Trying is not enough
Why are you constantly calling him up
I feel this darkness coming over me
Don't hate me for what you're not
Theyll throw you away, away, away
I can't be your friend
For all the thoughts that I'm thinking
A chick got to live, ooh yeah
Don't make a sound 
Once, once is real early but twice came back
You can't just come in here like that no more
I try to tell myself, don't let it define you
Instead I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
"FBI sources tell us that the four are headed"
Black painted scars
With murder, first degree
Mm mm mm mm cab overhead
Discombobulate prostates rehydrate dry lakes
Scourge of the earth, verses are merged into dirt
Will you bite the hand that feeds
Mit deiner Mutter uber Musicals reden
There's nothing left to burn, to burn
Oh, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight
Keep life
All right
Shut up you're waking the baby
There you go again you cut me off from talkin'
Losin' my shit since I don't know when
Fire All our guns
Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase
I said before that today I hate everything
Well you exit on the right
Ich diss euch hemmungslos wahrend ihr mit NutellaToast im Keller posed
I get mad as hell but that's ok
Like fire in the rain
Don't wanna live, don't wanna die,
They got everybody singin' my "Fuck Tha Police" song
Is it my turn to show them niggaz we be stars on tracks
One day she will tell you that she has had enough
Plastic and translucent like the lies that I tell
One day you're going to rise from your habitual feast
I'm liberated "People in this country, are confused"
You're keeping in step and in line
And you think love is to pray
And smiled for awhile with a brand new style and a change of pace
Live through the music yeah
And I don't understand
Want to believe
We are the same as you
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male
Sweetheart, I'd send you up to heaven
John the revelator, straight advocator
If you wade around forever you will surely drown
Policemen are my friends so why do they always stare
Oh fancyunamazingtype in Square Park
She lacerated me, exposing me piece by piece
Je reste encore ouh, ouh
Your run slows to a crawl
Don't be an optimist and try to rock with Bis
But your time to leave is way past due,
"Go to hell," you said
Must be some new niggaz
Reflections of another land
You're all liars, inside you are dead
Innocence can't be bought with a confession
Over your skin
I just can't bend the rules
Everyday, energy, seems to stray
You think I don't know what war means
You're not on the battlefield not in the cancer wards
Can you pay my bills
That number is one
You don't mean a thing to me
O God, O Lord, so love him from our heart
I spit on your thoughts of hallowed ground
Is just the breath of the dying god who once ruled heaven
We fought them to a standstill while the flames lit up the sky
Don't be embarrassed
Of those who tried connecting all the dots between her freckles
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast
Just a little and nothing now it's done 
The army recruiters in the parking lot
Now the tables have turned all I gave you return
Breathing an air
You're helpless and hopeless
Sometimes I hate myself for what I've done
All my intentions are good
Oh, do me a favour, don't put me in the dark
Well I, I'm not angry, angry yeah
If at the age of  you fall in line too soon
This is fight music
You walk on straight
'Cause I believe that miracles
I'm afraid to lose total control
Fire All our guns and arrows
See we live for gunfire, kick in ya door nigga
I got an itch I can't scratch
I'm falling into darkness
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude
With the rest of the mess that you made 
Che vorresti volar per davvero
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Far away from anyone's face
Fucking people
Deconstruct
Clever composition and the honesty
I let it go to breathe
Now heads of state who ride and wrangle
Yours aren't words to extol,
Ain't, ain't no comin' back
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck
You can fake it, that's all right
It's growing colder I'm growing older
Fuck the morals, does it make any money
I am falling
No explanation needed, nothing can change the way things went
Enough, I call the bluff for manifest destiny
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Call up my dogs
Take me somewhere far, in your piece of trash
Quando sei   disperato come me senza te disperato
Is there something inside
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway
I wear this chaos well
At the end of this rope
Tulvassa kelluen, latomerta tuijotan x
Veils of frost entwine me in the haze of baleful mooncursed dreams,
Knock you faggots unconscience
All the years it took to build these walls
Is ever, ever going to end
They didn't have to earn respect in the same scene as you
Just us four niggaz
Think it's fair to steal my air
I'm murdering and stabbing so much vag I'm wanted for vagaside
One world, and we will smash it down
No, please You've got to, please
It's not all about cash Hell, no, not how much you flash
Childmolesters get probation
A point scored they could give a fuck about us
Beating on a drum you sing of quiet and peace
But folks still be testing me
Believe what you want, but I think you don't know
I hate the winter, summer, spring, I hate the fall
Straight in the eyes
Now she tellin' you you're not givin your heart
I came to save these new generations of babies
When you need my help I never tell you no
It's not fair to deny me
Well death is a sick way for attention
I see the one that you made cry
'Cause just when the loving gets good, you'll be gone
The universe is cold
Disconnect myself
We'll be losing media jobs and you make us your pet
He won't revert to sticks and stones
Maybe in time these indelible lines who was around when you were hungry
She said I've finally had enough
Light a cigarette, flick it at them or spit it at them
Why do you make me feeling like this 
Protect the proletariat from the bosses and their screws
Hate the birds and the bees
And Bobby Boochet yo' ass, G, yeah, yeah
Awaiting your call but I hear nothing at all
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
The answer to the question is we ain't gonna die
Will crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels
The blood still tastes the same
That taste of simple truth
You turn it around and make us out like david and goliath
Three piece suits and bank accounts in Bahamas
Since birth I been raw hot like surface core
I'm living a life of sin, no I don't have any friends
Just be a man
They're messing with me
But not for something that I have never seen
Like a good guy should
Resonating like a scream no one can hear
'Cause in a minute you gonna have grandma bein the only family member left
And I find the memory of you
Now my money right
Never let me down see the stars, they're shining bright
Can you pay my bills, yeah
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
And then the unnamed feeling
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
But who's left to stop the bleeding
This is the way of your world
So forget the cover just read the book
I think you need to walk home
Who was around
You can't do anything on your own but I'm gone now and
Runnin' around here like some brand new pussy that's about to get fucked
I bet you got that tattooed on your lonely heart
You'll have to queue nd if you do, you're gonna get some
What, you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit
We're the first ones to jump in line
A lot of people say she's crazy
Like my opinion means more because I got some fame
This one's nothing like Vietnam
Who look at your face from more than one angle
It's come to the point where you've lost me
They all fought to get us here
Can't stop this pain
My kindness destroyed all because of you
Are the rumors people spread
I left it in your hands
Smash your radio It's a revolution
When I was a child the innocence was deafening
A chemical addiction to you
They don't believe in mercy, ah, judgment on them
The abyss becomes me
Did you ever think that was the wrong thing to do
Ongoing situations start to grip
Over the top
When you're near, my blood runs wild, and I see red
Drunk on the violence 
'Cause the seven generations before me
You will always save his life
Tension mounting with every moment
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score
What with all these cell phone numbers
Run through the answers and you can feel the scratching
Wanna feel the sun of the new day
See TIP don't like the game
So I'mma run till I can't run no more
Every little thing
You can't get in
The wyrmhorn sounds cross Dagon's mere,
The double lives, the awkwardness
Leave me alone now
I got an empty mag Get 'em Vinnie Paz
Words  For words they fell and words they fought and words alone
That I don't have the words to explain to you what I'm feeling now
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
Last time you saw that nigga is the last time you'll see that nigga
Got a need for the ritual
Is like eating garbage they make me vomit
Got a snow machine
Or the streets that I have roamed
My freedom
I would take every single hungry person and feed him;
For the people who don't deserve it now
'I'm outdoor'
You are blood nothing more
There's a million things to say
I get a bloodlust when I see a slug bust
But my babies came into this world
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
Do you wanna change it
Well, tell me, how am I supposed to save a girl like you
If you live from day to day
Just the dust of a plague, left that whole, left that whole
I feel sick
Black white African American Irish and German
Echoes of the world, dissolved
Imprisoned here forever
Or have you been told
Do more to turn my joy to sadness than
That mark time on square one
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died
I hate this bad attitude, I'm sure you hate me too
You smell lonely to me 
'Cause today I hate everything
And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters
As if money is the cure
At last your number has found you
Hah, bitch you get
Held you when you were sick even sucked your dick
Sun shines on my skin
You've got my frequency but I don't hear you call
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out
I don't need no fame
I want your heart, I want your head
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine
But lord, when it grows late, I will fight it off
But you can't forgive and forget with an elephant memory
You had your chance, but you built bombs to bring hell on us
The backbone of this country is the independent truck
I know it's gon be trouble
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Chronic fatigue, antidepressants,
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop
Someone say sequester so I sink
The values of morality in their pristine state
Let the bass paralaze
All that I touch is tragedy
But you won't get to see the tears I've cried
Well I'll tell you, my friend, one day this world's going to end
But later on she made you feel like what you do is wrong
Ich bin lieber alleine als mit dir zusammen
I'm running hotter and hotter and hotter
Watch your back watch your back
 Squeezing out the life,
Would you like to be friends
I'm lining up the perfect shot
The NME meant nothing to you
Ash to ash, back to back, and dusk to dusk
Ihr wirkt auf mich wie Witzfiguren oder die Teletubbies
This a motherfuckin' gang and we down for life
DJ ZamZoe turn it on
Ladies and gentlement
Oh enough
McDonalds goes ecofriendly 
Do you feel like a man when you push her around
Your will to ignore, but when it cuts back round
You are the pleasure
I gotta let you know got no time to play
'Cause we ain't got it too good in America
Sometimes I feel like I can't lead my team well enough
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down
The only one
There's not a lot of difference between a foxhole and a grave
One minute you're standing
And my man Rock catch you up close
And everything you are is broken
Watch his head go rollin'
Breaking off inside
That's what it takes
And it knows my name
Eat my fucking shit
Follow you home after every show
I find beauty in teaching you what the definition of pain is
So how does it feel to know that this is all you'll ever be my darling
And as the silence breaks give him what he can take no way out
I'm lost for words
You'll have to queue and if you do, you're gonna get some
Reconsidering this weakness and the promise he forgets
Don't blame me cause you got caught
Face down in the dirt
Has never seen my lonely misery
Sometimes I hate myself without compromise
The cops won't arrest me, and the hookers won't undress me and my manager is tired of my voice
I will kill ya if you move in next to me
��destruye a aquel con tu instinto de asesino
Hey, big boy
You've been kissing when you ought to be ascrewing
I'm a product of my environment
I'm running in circles to get where I started from
Drains like water out the hole at the far end
Brown shirt, Italian cut
'Cause everyone has said the same damn thing to me
See the loaded eyes of the children too
Ja huutaa naapurin kyylalle pain naamaa
Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't cum oh
Am I wasting my Life"Who never ever could be loved
Always making certain that there's one thing left
I'll kill you
Yeah, I'm a God, motherfucker and it's Judgement Day
Time won't make things better
Ask that nigga named Bryan, caught six in the spine
We ain't no cute niggaz
Mistaken me for someone who cares
There are some things I can't report
Losing time and not changing anything
Sa vaitit etta mitaan
Poison thoughts in my mind
How many of 'em do you think we got
Over and over it breaks my heart 
Lil Wayne Imaa beassst, Ima Beeeasssttt
Trying to make the best of it the way kids do
God is a gun and the bullets are free
Feels like  years of solitude
I don't know what I get but I'm willing to bet
That we are gone before we go
Hotter and hotter and hotte and hotter and hotter yeah  yeah  yeah
Shit longevity
wenn deine Metaphern trivial sind wie Spaghettiwestern
He got my wife
Dieser Sippschaft, die du deine Freunde nennst
But you raise me twenty, I'm raising you five
Eyes sewn shut, stilted conversation breaking up,
Did you teach her too well how to take the worlds abuse
You're on my baby
Cocaine addiction it felt so good 
These are tales from the darkside
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
jata menematta
You forgot your fries
Whose word is a swamp and whose brow is smeared
A victim of romanticide again
Do you think you are ready for that much power 
Then you learned something new
I'm sick of second guessing and I'm 
The only thing you've proven
Like a wrecking ball on a string
Sing a song about fornicate
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Or you'll get the straightedge in your face
Yo, maybe you didn't break the way you should have broke, yo
Of a Republic for the workin' class, economic liberty"
I need to say
The earthmovers
No one to tell you when to stop

Or your socalled music scene
My eyes
We bout to crash da club
When he was a young man
Activate  burn it up
Now just today on the news I saw
Your lies still smell the same
I want audience
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Harder
Monsters always haunted your panicked dreams
Deep in my heart 
I'm gonna be drunk, and slight broke
One look puts the rhythm in my head
I still lead the league in assist
And put it to the jug we sip before fightin
Payin' off a loan, mass eviction
There's a monster in the garden you call him god
Throw your hands up, take it to another level
It's just the dust and diesel of the passing time
Limp Bizkit, hah, X to the Z, yeah, hah
Become me
Archin' my back and on a straight rough
Some new man saunters away
I wanna cry, I wanna scream
Don't dare to cause troubles
Take a piece of me with you
Keep the pressure up, don't let it drop
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
With the chrome Moss nigga
And if you feel me raise your hand and show
All along, I've needed you
Approaches the eye
Every time you knock me down
Hiding under tables as soon as I hear alarms
No making friends today
A long time I've been waiting for that thing to come
So I grew a thick skin that you couldn't see right through
And for God's sake, don't let them bury me in some field full of harps and shamrocks
Don't wear me around your wrist
So take a look at what you do to my head
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing
I'm a renegade who wants to get stomped
Every time I see your dick I see her cunt in my bed
Though you're gone forever
It's fight music
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
But as I gazed into the vastness of time
To take away the pain
I want to live a life that you
Oh, baby
But you will never understand
Naatko mita mun kadessa
Runnin' with thugs, when it get down to them broads
Why I get schizo and psycho I go Jeckle to Hyde
Are just stoking the disease
Sometimes I feel I've got to 
Never stop to rest
The game don't stop, I'm still gettin' down for whatever
Don't need a hug
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I come down in a couple of days
Tell me how you're doing on this very lovely day
And I must gofor youto comeand I will praise you into heaveni will raise you to the sun all risefor here comes the sonall risethe fatherhe is my kingand I am just a throne awayi am the heirone breath awayi will rise as your sonand I will be the one and to the warmth of the sunyou willcomei will love and guideyouas you were my own to the sons of the suni will praythat no harm on them will comeit won't ever get in their wayyou will rise as my sonyou will be the oneall rise
Wall street crime will never send you to the slammer
Now what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet
Out of the dark the wolves will come
And every time you knock me down
und trotzdem fress ich wack MC's wie dich, wie Smacks mit Vollmilch
Disorder x
The drugs don't thrill me, and my life's about to kill me and I'm pretty sure I'll end up all alone
In a million places
Fake upnorth niggas screamin' for the cops
And I embrace the balm of sublime forgetfulness
You may high hat me all the time
Why'd you ever let me go
Profit is the goal, the revolution's comin' round
Point blank  They can kizz my black azz
Let's be passionate  it's not like we'll get another chance to do this,
It's not like we'll get another chance to do this
And you can hear her pain
A happy fuckin' day
Du bist jetzt 'n MC und endest doch als Industriekaufmann
You are the end
I would rather die than take your bullet
Now when colors turns to grey
Got a sick fucking mind
Fuck, I hate it all
You've been
I've never seen you smile at all and all your teeth are black
Our government is fucked
Do you really believe in the stories you tell
Why must we die
Caffeine addiction it feels so good 
Takes away everything it can get
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton
But wherever you go, you know they've been there before
Lets ride everybody gonna die
Think about the way that it used to be 
It is returning through the dark
So rich with broken trust
Now I'm creepin' through the fall
After the sunshine we duckin' for war time
There's something inside of us that can't be touched
It's a revolution, brothers and sisters
One world, it's a battleground
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
Divided we stand and united we fall
That's why its hard to survive in this so called promise land
Someday you look back and you wonder why
I always leave before it ends
Surviving from the vitamins you're finding when you take a bite
The ghostly first wife glides up stage whispering to raucous talkers
Could not prepare me for the fall
We come from the country and we come from the city
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
I'm about to break the spell you cast
Stupid, 'cause no one cares,
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em
The creation of world war
No more tokens, take a train
In the name of your dead drive on
Overheating 
There is no resolution at the end of the day
Feels so good I am compelled to sing this song
So just shut the fuck up and swallow
You trying ta walk through the fog where sun leaks
But to fight for the rights of the working man
Your words just fuel my rage
With you, I stand in hope
I can't feel anything
Let me feel the fire
Diplomat on the fender of the phantom I'm the winner
Those filthy mother
I was isolated by the way I thought and felt; they saw my mood swings
I wake up to get my cake up I'm out here grindin'
With a motherfuckin' hole in ya back
Take off your hands
But generally speaking, nobody's got a hope
C'mon now, I'm quick to roast fry boil and even toast a guy
Ain't nothing to me 'cause I am the streets
No ground to stand, nothing to lose
That drops niggaz
Something you hide 
Chances are you've heard this
No need for talking, have my dough
'Cause you a devil like the Canaanite in Sackcloth
What have I done to lose his love
But I know I better bite the bullet
There is the gleam of blackened steel in the flickering torchlight,
At the age of  you'll still march to their tune
Four mutherfuckers goin' crazy with
It's inside me I feel it growing nowhere to hide my anger's showing
And a woman who teaches wrong from right
Don't internalize it, don't let it get inside you
Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way
Smacked this whore for talking crap bitch
I wish it didn't have to be but this song is for you
Sie liegen blank, gefroren, wund
I'm gonna kick your ass
Je ne fais pas que passer
Ascending faster than the speed of sound
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up
I need to let you rescue me
It's not that I hate your world
kohti vapautta ma pian matkaisin
I mix up that vodka with the chronic and I feel that love
Sadder than to me
All the riches taken back by needy
Everyone addicted to a technicolour screen
Your eyes grews stars
Take it back Sisqo, you know where it belongs thong ththong thong
Is death the only way to get attention
Its just a lie in my life
Lord of the bitch
When all I can do is just to break you down
Westside tell me can you feel me, hey, oh
I'm a living sunset
Sometimes I hate myself for hating me
Me care again Something that would
So you can go 'head wit' all that stabbin' me
I'm just a flash, light of the sky
It doesn't matter if I am your best friend 
This time you're the vampire
Time and time you fucked me over
Rotten core to the bone wit no way home 'n' destination bitch I see you flyin by n u implyin that I've been tradin bitch n I helped ya out I put yo name across the nation bitch n I got the chance it's all the jealousy up in ya bitch now how do ya think ya gonna get a piece of my wealth I created scopin 'n' made myself I'm froucisiouley gifted lyricly raised in hell if you want it come get it you beter brace urself my purogitive locked and I'm weddin hoes on sight it's a ractive disaster curutal upon your flight better watch out we're riding especially at night got a bullet and chamber commin after that reise white so befor you come trippin' you better think about life you only got one to see and you better live it right ride or die is my terms and I ain't gettin' fucked twice think your gonna come out ahead come on bitch role your dice
The truth isn't easy when you live in fear
Farmi la barba o uccidere
Deciiide, to finish what I started and
Passing themselves off as leaders
Gasoline 
Who cares if they make sense
If you wanna dance better take your chance suckers
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothin' bout her
Nobody but you has to, hold onto the fight
But I don't mind that it's the same old shit
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused
Look into my eyes and you can see there's something changed
Of what happened right here of what happened right here
'Cause zombies only take, they don't have any life to give
Taught to believe that ignorance is strength
Stone by stone and brick by brick
So fuck the POLICE
She will be gone
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
I know he's messing with my head
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter, fire, fire, fire
War  I've tried to see it your way, tried to see it your way
At the faces I once called home
Oh right OK
But I can't erase this pain
Intend to deny, but when it comes back around
You are the bad
When a nigga stretched out, with his chest out
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere
Too many
LA girl, LA world
Ey, wahrend ich Mic's burn wie beim Grillen Kohlebriketts,
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did 
No time for reason  I'll pass
You talk rich, and that's your cover
LONG, breathe easy pop, this is HipHop
Michael Franti And Spearhead Lyrics
Bitch you get no Love, love
But he's never been love, not on the inside
no non c'e una via d'uscita lo so che non ce n'e
All that you are
Who was around when I was hungry
"We'd like to help you" the consul said
By the time the sun goes down
Sometimes I wish I could start over
The nicest guy
You are my blood
Coming home with a broken heart
And how she never taught you to be a man
Hello memories return
Tass'on nainen tuulen tuoma 
Aw, gimme something I can root to
What's John writin' 'bout the revelation
I tried to scream but it didn't work,
We will fight them off
Now I lay in your arms
Plot the map plant the flag
Can't buy a smile off the world's happiest man
Year after year after year after year
So scream you, out from behind the bitter ache
Deny addiction
Your socalled confession,
Yeah, back to Compton again
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass
And no time for your kind
The end of all the things you know
On the walk home from school
I've got control for the candy in ya soul
In the face of diversity
Why don't you climb in my head with me 
The pain comes back in an ugly design 
You've seen it hurts me not to fight
No one loses on TV
Enough enough's enough's enough
Bis ich gewarmt an deinem hei��en Blut
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds
I stare into heaven while I'm dying in hell
Almost feeling safe
Tavallinen tyyppi
In life, yeah we cry
But what comes around goes around Yeah
Tage des Donners sie nun langsam uberziehn
And it just won't go away
Another life, another night
You faggots act as bitch as Rupaul
Will the decibels work as bifocals
As you struggle to break this invisible grip,
quando sei   disperato     come me         che muoio senza te
I cannot sit back, shed my broken skin
Bitch you get no No love
Hey chump How charmed can one's life be
Optimism wretched in my throat, no working parts,
Fucking die now
Boil the water 
I've got untapped material
But your motor skills still speak in slurs
Over and over but you try to keep it down
When passion becomes status end
But I don't go around fire, expectin' not to sweat
Way too many artists build their selfesteem around the press
I threaten everything you hold dear
Keep the  at the top of the stack
Puppy mills for fur lined collars
You'd better believe it
Secret sanctuary of my thoughts
Oh god it hurts so much
We are filed up one by one
Smile to my naive dreams
We're playing the music of the middleaged queens
Was just a dream
Is there hope for the blood of live
Are we out of love now, is this just a bad patch
Now I can see right through all of you
We are the energy
You need me
Got Phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west
Cause I can't breathe, no I can't sleep
Stop my hands from shaking
Heal life
Feels like wasted time
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind
I will never let you die
I expose that dirty bitch for the ho that she is;
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
I said please, smile just before you cry
I love your cheesey smile 
Be a man
When you have to face me, you're never as bold
I got reason to believe, some of you niggaz feel
No love, no love, no love, no love
Oh dear, oh dear and if I show you her dark side
The tears that we cry 
Goes aone, two, three
I'm gonna be goin' against  niggas in one and you think you crazy
Well you got some devotional for pain
"Because, that's all it's about, that's all human dignity is about"
And now I hate your every little everything
And me that I believed that was wrong
It's cold when birds fall from the sky
Erase our lives, take back those vows
So goodbye to the creeps who are making it
Why'd you let it slip away
It never stops a smile on your shit consuming faces
And twisted around for a whole fucking week
Yo we them hard hitters
Your life lacks meaning when I'm gone
Yo', come on
Is it welcome if it happens
It ain't my fault if you balled hard
So for now pack the gun and
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And Mr Baker, can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
Even as we fight, it doesn't matter to me
There's no restraining order to keep me from you,
I feel it in my heart and I know I'm not wrong
Straightedge  in your face
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
You got a pair of balls Well, it's time to put 'em on
When you're so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
Fifty reasons why you'll see I need you
All the remains is a strange kind of fear Yeah
Just before you cry
Come on, Ryde or die
And I always will be
And I'm coming out a man, set your alarm
'Cause it's your turn now
I don't know how a creep can sleep
Been a long time since I been serious
quando tu    spacchi il vetro come me      senza te
How pathetic can one be
She calls my name  coming, baby, coming
Would've done the world a favor
You consume my desiccated heart
Yeah my friends all tell me but my friends all lie
See the paidoff local bottom feeders
Sometimes I hate myself for what went wrong
And you cut me down 'cause I keep it real
I feel like I could drown
I've got a feeling
If I had my way, I'd stomp you flat
Du bedauerst dich nur selbst, doch nur selbst
And have you feelin like you can't finish what you started
And I'm gonna push back
I'll never get through to you
All of the dreams you sold
Well, the door is locked
Knock me, tryin' to stop me from my monopoly
Jubilate as you die
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say
And I'm telling you up front 
You can see me in a bedroom
You always have too much to say
Y'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I say
Going on an ugly joy ride 
Sie kann nicht fliehn
Yeah, I can root to this
I guess you fucked it up
In this loneliness I'll see
Here we are back to play the same old games
Impassibile
While forests choke under a 'lever sky
So I guess that's a step in the right direction
He'd promise her everything
He joined up to get a job
Split poison ivy scratch rash
'Cause a chick gotta live
Heavy breathing's your new fan club
I would sure consider you supreme to me
A wounded world, an absent creator
See the blood on my hands
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Here come the black skies;
Like an angel lost in hell
Rising above all
"Here comes the bride"
These feelings are gone, they've been buried along
Ground to dust around
Go down, baby
Don't back down
I paint a picture that's perfect so you can see what I'm saying
Oh how the seasons change, and your mind will do the same
Bass drums and tambourines
To love him
Your eyes fill with greed
Make her cry make her thighs twitch then cum on her tits
Well over the sea, and far away,
Everyone addicted to the same nicotine
Nothings above us, y'all better back off
d'een werkt per tarief, de ander op percent
And I paid all the bills about a month too late
Now, we don't believe you should be bringing up your little girl this way" 
Walking pile of shit
No need, no need to ever burn out I'm scorching and torching no time for front porching
If you wanna see tomorrow better get out of town
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
That's just begging to get out
Or The finest girl
And every time you speak her name 
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
The sinking ship the grand applause
And you fugazi if you think I'mma admit wrong
They've got these magic crystals that don't do a god damn thing
The only boy I understand
Uncluttered by the maskings of consumer addiction
So I can feel alive
Like she's chosen over those who walk around on two feet
Yeah, takes me away
Und ungebrochener Schmerz mir eisig an den Adern sagt
Now the fall begins, and our failing hearts
Paid assassin
Grab what is left inside
Once, once is real conniving,
Walkin' on the streets tonight
He wants me right down on my knees
TIP on top now
You are blood
To pick him up, let me know now
Every ounce of faith
But your headphones mute your equilibrium
Fuckin' right I've got my gun, semiCartermatic
So get it
You just go ahead
Her lips were still curling
I am your savior, you await my return,
You still want love, love's ugly, smooth and delicate
I'll shed no tears for you
It just withers like a leaf in the fall
It takes no strength to pass blame
A paradigm to hear the acid rain
When I say the word,
I don't care
Sick of this shit sick of this shit
The ones you won't hold
You reach for me and wouldn't let me go
With the gun I bring its straight for beatin' you down
Heard your bringing my name up
Yes I did it and I'll do it again 
After they take care of you
Chili di silenzio per inaugurare un nuovo gioco
"You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you"
That she's above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets
And she said, "Mama, I got a note here, from the Harper Valley PTA"
But I can't erase this pain
Aimed at your head
Ignore disasters and say that life is great,
Ain't no comin' back
 Lost in the gallows of hopes and dreams
And move your tongue around
The dogs of war won't capitulate
They can be a terror to your mind
Music is a weapon sounds like a threat
We don't care
Requires some compassion
It ain't my fault you dirty your Victoria's Secretes
Yes all your lies
But now they tryin' to get backstage to sneak a peek at you
Per il mio limite
You know it ain't easy making me smile
I can't see anything
Take your things please leave me you better do it soon 
All you people that I know will have died long ago and your children will have died  years before
Anything we had So now you're on your own
What goes on in the mind of a man like you 
And fill their swollen heads
'k Heb gezongen in Aalst, Peutie, Zwevezele en Genoelselderen
You may own the race track
I see blue lights in your eyes
My live niggaz in the spot
Be it your cousin or your uncle or your lover 
The captains of industry just lie there where they fall
And man, you will see
Something I never wanted
I did nothing, saw nothing
Cunts are still running the world
And don't you come back
I followed you to the deep end
It's like a fight every single day 
Drunk and passed out on the floor
Always making promises
Spend it on the uhaul dipping on the turn pike
I never dreamed that you would be a sellout
Buried forgotten
See that girl,
And eat the carnage
When I'm in your care
Don't know what you've got
How about I step aside
You don't know what that shit does to you
Hold it in the air
und deine kalter als Emanzen auf 'm Frauenparkplatz
'Cause I'm a real mutherfucker from
But when you see us motherfuckers, better know who we are
You recoil in revulsion, but that will soon pass,
I just wish there was something
That he lost his truth, so caught up in believin' his own press
We got a reason
Something 
I exit through the spotlight glare
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon
Make my lungs black
In my life in my life
Nobody sees things, in quite the same way
Wipin' down my head and do it again
Stuck on lines deplete
Rippers that'll rip your ass
What good is a man
I look for power within me
Too gone, too long
Thick skin
We four girls, we four girls
Your hand in my purse
Heads cracking up, biological depression, drugs aren't enough,
It's the same one in every song
My name is James Connolly, I didn't come here to die"
Piece of garbage with wings and she has the guts to sing
"One of us is still getting paid too much"
I'm off the deep end
Your blown mind reels in torture
Luchas contigo esta vez no puedes salir corriendo
Well I've seen you, and needs to
I hate everything, fuck you
Shed my skin, time wears thin
I wish I was still five
That the first two didn't count
I did it again last night
Many times I wonder why I still act the same way
'Cause you out there runnin' your mouth
Send George Forman
Pilot this plane our path remains
Before price go up
In my life
To rescue me in the middle of the night
Fuck how it looks
e non c'e' pace latente da cogliere
See we've been doin' it all the time
A testament to weakness
Un esplosione ormai vicina
And on a lighter note
I will kill it dead, dead
To stab you in the back
Uh, hit me
And gotta rest my case
Tulvassa kelluen, latomerta tuijotan
Without a single fear, say they has no fear
In the city's belly
This must be a dream now, till I feel
Put my life on the line
Have you been told
You you you you you take my breath away
I'm the shit bitch
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me
And young as the day
Don't listen  try to discuss
When there's nowhere to run to
Covered with trash I had to lay back
These faces haunting me, I'm looking back and they are mine 
I don't care what you say
Fuck this lets just kill them
Bricks and bottles in the street
The pulse of death has arrived
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
I'll kill all you
No love, no love, no love
Who walked away when the game wasn't fun to play
I am a oneton, armor plated;
We're breaking everything, rrowdy like a classroom
If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave
Now the FBI's all over my dick
And a mess out in Brooklyn, HIYAHHHHHH
When you could rescue yourself from the fear that drives your hate
And we ain't hard to find we just sleep in the daytime
The tight lipped leer of judgement
I wanna relive little minutes and try to keep the dream awake
Classic, cases of fools made from plastic
And my night stands are full of open Bibles, uh
��destruye a aquel que se imponga sin sentido
I got these niggaz on shhs like I gone deaf
One stroke of the brush paints my macabre delight
Each time lord child
I'm taking fire
Under a pale grey sky
And the typewriter's rattling all through the night
Fucking sick of falling down
Yeah tell the motherfuckers they were wrong
Shit changed, you sellin WEED over the damn computer
I state it perfectly clearly so that you know I ain't playing
I'm potent yeah
It's gettin' critical  I stole a 
Territorial and pissing
Fuck freedom if I'm not alive to live it
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did
I'm sick of it, sick of it
Not quite aside, they snide, "She's number four"
I might start to like it a little too much
That I've fallen apart infront of an audience,
Stand behind me, find your way
You gon think it's a joke until they no longer remember your name
My niggaz Berkowitz and that other motherfucker Fizzy Wo'
So quit trying to invade my space
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
Bridges I've burned
You're too many tears too late
With your barbed wire pussy and your good and bad weather
My feathered friends' end will justify the means
Angels are hating on you
I picked it up and threw it away
You swipe a piece of plastic paper
No time for chivalry
A house we built on top of our regrets
Go work in retail and spare the suspense
I hear the sound
I am so aware of you
Your blue lips are so cold
Waiting for the final day
Fifty reasons why you'll see I need you
Is just stay away
Someone said
Bind him to a chair
I hope he never lets me down again
This may be the only opportunity that I got
Under my skin
You just weren't interested, I guess, I guess
You can see me in a ballroom
This shit's about to go down nigga
You wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh
Lets ride motherfucker we all gonna die
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
Got locked in this cage of a cold cold world
Go start a fire, get close to the gasoline
By a little girl, she was small
It's no coincidence bitch
And drag 'em back to the harbour for the local photographers
Lost all my fear so I hold on
In the depths of my soul 
Clingin' to the door, quiver, cower
Cruising on the highway
Leggero ed impassibile
And this is just getting us down, down, down
Of your voice your voice telling me there is no choice
Out of me and into you, I feel sick
Now he hates and counts the dates
Sell yourself on command
That had seen her love desert her just like sleep
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I guess it's a comfortable chair
We look away so We'll forget what We've become
Von den kleinen Plagegeistern
We're gonna talk about mm mm
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
To recoup the losses and fall in line
Hey girl, you know you drive me crazy
Seems like just yesterday, you were a part of me
I'm trying to speak without saying
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
I'll moonwalk on water, harpoon jackers
I'm getting even
How am I supposed to root to this
I thought I saw what Malcolm Little saw inside the game
We're watching the world pass us by
You keep dressing ways you shouldn't be dressing
But if you keep preaching then you just might believe it
Y'all motherfuckers is back
Oh cut it off
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh
Can help you dull the pain
What, you think I just got lucky and didn't work for this shit
I'm sick and tired of the games you played
To buy anything you lack
Yeah, what's John writin' 'bout the revelation
Hahaha, my home boy
Eager to please
He's been a around the world, about a million times
You are dead and nobody cares about you
Well I need to get over
It won't change me
Swallow evil, ride the sky
The thorns are knots around your head
Hardrock nigga I kick a stone out yo' ass
Nessuna possibilita' di condividere sfiducia
Either left or raving views
Forgive me father for I have sinned
Razors cut away the pain of this life
Someting that's harder
Hotter and hotter
Appreciate the love you get but don't let it guide you
I don't want your war
What did I do to deserve such silence
I'm hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter as the days go on, man
I moved you in, took you back
Who knew that you could smile when you take a life
We were like brothers with the world in our hands
Don't bother lookin' for me
There's not much hope that I can see
They said that nothing's forever
Mm mm mm mm mm mm fist in my face
Cold run a train on punk hos that think they run the game
With you buried head and only you to blame
How does it feel to be slipping away
Over and over every night 
Fuck the bullshit I kick a bone out yo' ass
Your eyes will not tell a lie
Blood in face
Did you really think I'd take you back
Give baby a cuddle
New soldiers now say
Around the world
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
But you're afraid to get your teeth caught in my pubic hair
When my mother died, she laid in bed and cried
You ain't drunk nigga
En tahdo menna takaisin
No sleep till that man is out of town
Motorway City
And that's your cover, star lover
When I need your love you got somewhere to go
Everything, inside of me
And left a sting
I'm with my friends
You're going to burn you'll learn you'll learn
No Rather raise the Starry Plough on high, sing a song of freedom
'Cause I don't know what to feel
You will always treat me obscene
I find beauty in blood drippin from ya faces
Talk shit and ya dyin' if ya think that I'm lyin'
To watch you point and whisper like a child
They wasn't up late night losin' sleep wit'chu
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
Don't dare to be hungry
Echoes of impermanence
The sky filled with bombs
And get it made overseas
Depressed reality
You're always sayin' that it's all going better
Hit my niggas LA Re to Cali
On my mouth, there is a gag
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Will you stay down on your knees
That summoned all my scars and the ghost of serendipity
Under my bulk
All hell Xzibited lick
No, I just want a bed for the night
All for the loot nigga
Everytime I try to talk it through
This is where it ends
It's hard to dream of glory when you got something to prove
Grind away till nothing's left
Forget the chances that you lost
Except for the bullets, except for the bombs, except for the youth that's gone
I know a house upon a hill; we could stay there if you will
My target on you
Pig feed killing soil
Sure to make enemies of best friends
Desconfortavel
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in
Yeah I'm running hot
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
See the ferries passing by
Smash your radio
You end up in an icedout sarcophagus
Been dragging your cross all over this town
You never know who's around
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Of course all the power I create in my hand
Promises me I'm as safe as houses as long as I remember who's wearing the trousers
Good daddies won't let you die
Good so I buck fo' shots from the roof
Can I hit that can I rip that can I lick that Can I get that from behind
The truth will hurt more than lies
Where were you when they changed you name
The rodeo begins They take us for a ride, and we are flailing
Everywhere I go trouble follows me
Sun, throw shadows cross the floor
Sucker in my hand
Wrong time, wrong place
Isn't so messed up to be witness for a man who won't confess,
But this message really throws me off
To get 'em back without me
My thoughts you hear and you begin to fear Fear
Bake a chicken and pluck an eye
I breathe life into Jesus Christ's carcass
And I'm a fuck you up, ooh I got your crazy
Retrace the mockers of intemperance
To retain control of an open mind
Or grant forgiveness in some better days
You cowards can't, you never will, don't even try to pursue it
You've burned out, your battery has died
That would grace my lips, and the frozen tongue that was soaked in blood but it tasted bliss
Ma soisin ja joisin ja valvoisin aina vaan
There's a retired businessman named Red
And instead of wishing that the road had shoulder
Parting the waves of those few feint friends
Don't tell me how to live my life
I stepped out into thin air
Jet setting, Go getting, grownup toys
Cut me, show me, until I am willing and able and never any danger to myself
Get the fuck out of here
I wont get in the way
Your shattered world is your piece of mind
Drive me so far up the wall, I come slidin' down
'Cause I really don't believe that you've got a headache
My soul is the grounds
About the people in misery
To standing around being abused
Diese Welt war nie rein
Look into these eyes
If you took the time to unmask
Make you put your mouth around the exhaust
Say no possessions but get all that you can
And take away your teddy bear
I can almost touch their hands through the ground
Question my silence
I blackout in extreme pleasure from watching you writhe in pain
Yo His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
Face the enemy
You are supreme to me
Es ist vorbei,geschafft und du wei��t genau du hast schei�� gebaut und keine Frau wird dich so lieben wie ich
Why should I lose myself in this fighting
I've been pumpin' stomachs since the age of 
Ya trying to walk two dogs with one leash
Insect gods
The kids are scowlin
es schlagt mich weiter durch die Nacht
You just got to stand in line
This is the way of your
Fools will be fools
Make cowards disappear into thin air by puttin' shit through 'em
Welcomes me so willingly
Got a foreman and a crew, everything can move
They'll come around again and again
I thought I saw you touching my guy
I suffocated my shrink just for talking
One more time I've gotta ask you
Take a piece of me
Never mind the mess, we're going to mars next
Give me a chance
And you've been taught too much to learn
I know you were not lonely
Father  Satan with fangs stained in blood
I'm on fire
You can't just empty your sins into a pit of salvation
Light up ya lighter, bring it home
You looked at me, we connected
Managers fake friends, wannabes and visions, pop idol television
Temper temper, now, now, temper temper, now, now
Paper on the pavement
Hey, where are you going
I'm liberated "So do we say that it's time to begin anew"
All the things they're selling you makes you think you need them
Can't see behind the door
I slip away, genocide
And show you how to hold your tongue
This is what you need
And I know y'all been lied to over and over again
A puppet for your strings
So full of arrogance  too blind to see the outside world
Armageddon is a deadly way
Hast du je gefragt wie schwer es war
It's coming down all over me can't feel no love tonight
Here is a monkey from FlowerFruit Mountain smashing up my peach banquet
Why am I stricken with a pair of these
I hope you have a happy
You stick around
But we can't let you get away
Ya niggas share one milkshake wit two straws
And then they go and they come
Be it your cousin or your uncle or your brother 
Slagen i blod
Started as a sketch in my notebook
I hate it all, I hate my friends
Tear down that wall, girl
There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part; you can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all
Things look peaceful
When passion drives then hold the reins
Deine Party war an einem Sonntag Abend
Up steps our citizen leader and roars out to the sky
I've got a chip on my shoulder
Come over here 'cause I got something I'd like to say
You're a cancer causing, cancer having slob
Your consternation growing into fright
Throw you away, away, away
Intolerance and faith confides that death is product of peace in time
Give him what he can take a way out
You know what they say about bein' nice to the right people on the way up
Well anyway
This disease infested ball of lust and carnage
Let me know, let me know baby, baby
And any mutherfucker that disagrees
Now all that's left of me, is what I pretend to be
Niemand hat mich so verletzt
Bleed life
City to city and then we knock it down
And touch all we breathe
Take everything you need
We're living what we're singing
Into a perfume so rarefied
'Cause it's sick
But you'll never understand
Who makes the gun into a sacrament 
I drown on the streets and I'll never learn
Give anything to be a man
And it makes me, it breaks me
Come on love, move over here
Nigga ima flee the state
Answers are what
We blame the light for what we've done
Someone new is loving me
Who rob life of its quality
Sentirsi vulcani in eruzione
It's time to impress; time to prove yourself
+Ebony+ can't see to the lightside
My rage is my strength  it gives me might
Spend it all today and we will bill you tomorrow
That keeps me moving all night long
I gotta give me me
meren tyrskyn tyontelema 
Come in here from the light,
And instead of wishing that it would get better
Qui per ora e' nero come Angoscia e amaro come Fiele
Do you want to feel
Perforated into tiny fragments
Swallowing this hurt
To shatter all my shields, to expose a flair of misery
But I've got   niggas strong
And sing your songs
Holds us back from a greater
I hate big brother uh do you think it's too late
When it rains it rains plenty
This is the last time you'll do me wrong
Come on y'all your getting hit in the chest
They label us as the love hate kind
Miracle drugs, discount bulk purchase
Under a Beirut, under the Beirut Moon
Took you back in my life
Compton's  miles but, yo, I'mma get there
I'm just lonely
Mortally wounded in your care
Lost in the flow of time
This time you die
Wipe that prada smile from that rada face
Past the point of caring
Your pale skin in the light
The only religion I know is the heat of her body next to me
A revolution never come with a warning
Then she let go; and so did I
How come you're all alone
To get your own way, divide and rule
You say that the business is a whack
And if I could, I'd turn my eyes
I'm moving out got no doubt they've forgettn twist 'n' shout
And they come and they come
Where's the heat
We are a people state
I'll never touch a hair on your pretty head
Lost my faith, forgiveness too
Decisions past leave you alone
High heels and aching feet
Protect you from a world of hate
Collecting guns they rape your daughters but its nobody's at fault
Gegen den Herrn der sie schuf
We tried, we cried, we fell, we lied
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Half rappin' ass mothafuckers
I don't care what they say
What if the critics hate you
If we talk with them it would mean the end
We had the same dream
The next second you're not
Standing in the middle of war
A libertine's ways never for you
Maybe we're the same, nothing can stop the fire 
There was life here once
And sometimes I'd like to start all over
So throw your guns up playa and raise 'em up high
Tripped out of my mind
Something left that a kiss could not destroy 
Can't get it up
Gonna make you money, gonna make you a man
The next minute you're dropped
Don't mind me
Immortality, a fallacy
To all things under creation
Something you call love but I call sex
That's who you are
Never let me down everything's alright tonight
Thinking back to times of yesterday, I could die 
This song is for all the women out there
Bleak, all around me, weak listening, incomplete
Rap his stick upon the ground
Break down that wall
Modern slavers in drag as champions of freedom
Another tragedy has passed
Suck my dick
I'll put it all on the line for these gangsta ass niggaz of mine
Enemy, and you are so damn dirty
A puritan soul, distanced from sin,
Get the tools niggaz, let's show the world how we abuse niggaz
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
But you could still appreciate my point
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
Under this burning flag
A venom on my lips, a poison
Abyssal hopelessness
Why don't you climb in my head with me 
I'm looking low
Your mind drowns in the crypt
Be it your father be it your mother 
Life is a game that you know you can't win
You talk rich, you bitch
I'm a renegade who wants to get served
'Cause I gotta knock you out
Incandescente come la lava
I'm pinned down but I need to move
In this generation
With  dimensions
This machine you built to last
Con le tue mani da violino, perche lo fai
Ain't nothing to me
Breathe life
He saw the bush where they had to stop
se ritornassi libera, se ritornassi mia
Turn it, burn it, cure it, endure it
She can hear water rushing underground
You destroy us all as you feast on the last of your own blood
I'll fight for it
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks
Maybe it's what keeps them always coming back
Need for perfection  what has been done
Dog for life
Got contracts to get 'em, lyrical spitter
Those in the know, don't ever flatter her, they go one better
And really don't know who you fuckin' with
I've got no more inside
It's confusing to wake up
With all these conflicting thoughts in my head
BITCH throw your fuckin' guns up, put your fuckin' hands down
I don't need no fortune
I've thrown half credit, and I know I'll never get it and I'm pretty sure I'll end up all alone
This is the way of their world
Ja tahtoisin loytaa sen kaiken
One more time I've gotta ask you,
I couldn't face the burdens of another week of worry; I was broken
You may be an asshole
Let's ride its dead or alive
Of their final breaths and their blood
Got green lights standing in my way
A tu delirio de asesino
Second to none
As you rebel to my sensual skill
You'll never understand
We are the answer to
They used to be attracted to rock stars
And the Exxon birds will never fly
Need life
In your own special way you tear me down
What's the thing you're running from
Why did I see the birds an the sidewalk today,
But you cheated on me and that's for it that now
You are the angel
A toy to be done with what I choose
Me and my girl on a trip to heaven, your Toyota is fantastic
When broke powerless people grab any power they can get
She took my hand and started running all the way
Well, it's the second verse now and I really like how this sounds
Is in no way human at all
So, come on, come on, sign up, come on
Black man travel through the universe and back
You're running around science like kids with guns, creating a new world, while the world you've got is stinking, but, hands up, hands up anyone who thinks you've got it right 
Yeah, you want the big one
In theory I respect your right to exist
You paint the sky such beautiful shades
Todo parece estar
Hey, Dad try and keep this sacred
I'd say its time too late
The sweet life
Now you call me a bitch in heat and
We just keep trying
A small price for freedom
Exhibiting my power over the weaker, fairer sex,
Will blacken everything, but don't you worry
I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fi'in to get thick again
Killing is my business, and business is good
It's time to show the world
To be inspired or run
Two newspaper editors like playground sneaks
You can't stop what has begun
You don't like my songs well it pays the bills
You may fly all over this world
We will be the ones who are left alive
Don't you realize you're killing in your sleep
Now I'm ready for a fight
Haven't I been enough of a fool for you
Just one more thing before you fall
You manipulate me with your real catholic shit
You get to feel how this runs so deep
She shook here head and gave me a blow for breakfast
Who render rage a necessity
Mind and soul are broken
How all of the words I say you'll take and misconstrue
Sick of this fucking apartment
From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by
Because you caught up in the matrix you blind you sleeping homie
You got to go back to Mother Earth
I tried reason
I still remain a dog
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct 
We are just a new round
Ten years from now is anybody gonna bother
Settlement
Feel the reaper's breath
Stop Stop Stop Stop
'I'm gonna warn, you just one time'
Worden door 't leven niet lang verwend
But not the lessons learned
Maybe I should spit it in your face
The whole time
You become my healing tourniquet
The war has just begun
E tu non sei qui con me
Take a life or two, the revolution's comin' round
And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn
The game has changed
How it's stuck in my head
I could never feel the same
Hide myself inside a' my clothes
Every single second I'm alive I'm a mess
"You were a spoilt child then with a record to plug"
Hide myself behind my words
We don't even care what you know or think
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
I give myself away to you
You can't overstand the mathematics
Your lives will fade before their time
Tell you the truth
Daddy's little boy 
Strange  On no man's land for no man's land
En oo ilman sua
But in the end I know I'll win
It's just spend a buck to make a buck
Your ghost my pride
Plunge into the realm that lies
You make me sick
Split yo' ass up like a Temptation
Cyclone fences in the cybernetic orchard
It's so hip and it's so tragic if you're fortunate enough to be confused
With a bottle of sweet sherry that everything redeems
Take me back to days of summer
ihan vahan parempi
Just thought you were the one
Dinner's on, get busy with my booty
Turn and walk away
Wartime conspiracy
I have become my enemy number one
I'm already ridin' baby, it's a little too late
That's right Don't hurt me
"Into this news Four fugitives are on the run"
But if I had a guess your voice would top this list
To me it don't mean a thing
Sie liegt am Boden um zu sterben und ich lass sie sterben denn
A fucking waste of sperm
Your time is over Time is over
Now right or wrong I gotta think about what I say
This song was written about how much I hate you
Tomorrow, your worst enemy
Forget the lies, the money
But my mind is numb and my mouth's okay
Deep burned scars
Straight at yo ass
Run away and don't look back
Will never get awake again
Oops, there goes the love I had
I got one thing to say to punk asses who hate
You keep tellin' me lies
Every night is a leaving home
Got to hang these bones out to dry
To the end I will not stop
From the guys that's running the show
I'm not saying forget
Tin soldiers
In the bed and breakfast beck and call
Maybe in time these indelible lines
He signed away his name
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide
One more time I've gotta ask you, come over here
You sign away your name
Out of the darkness wolves will come
I guess you fucked it up this time
All that heat that you feel
And you are the awaking
Squamous orbs, black sword, drink deep, blood oath
The love we share
Is a real thing
They believe you were there why deny what I said
I love it, I hate it
And go to sleep alone
So hold on to your rifles, boys, and don't give up your dream
You wouldn't believe what they've been tellin' me
Rips my head right off
Temper temper, now, now, this is what you are
I've got no ambition to show
I moved you in
You think it's a game You think it's a fuckin' game
The more you get, the more you chase
Let the clock spin sweetly on it's way
Look in my eyes I stay strong
'Cause I've got something I've gotta say
Leave me alone, leave me alone
It's the ideal way to order the world
Not somebody that you play around with much Miss Delilah is his
Cheery retard masses with evil osmond smiles,
You may have your own airplane
Insomnia and dreams
And as the silence breaks give him what he can take a way out
One day you get to much  then you go out
Listen, young man, listen to my plan
Nobody gives a fuck about you I'm ruined
You feel like the fans owe you somethin' and you're gettin robbed
No one to tell you how to think
Or his mother slavin'  hours a day for the scum
Hello, hello, hello
A thousand faces stare you down
And I'm prepared now
I know that you've been calling my guy
My head beats like a drum
To me you're dead, yeah
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
I would take every single person that's sick and tired of working jobs like on the auto lines and things like that, who's worked for years and years for nothing and never getting ahead;
We just need some motivation
You call me crazy, ooh I got your crazy
The more you're in my life
Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Die Frage hallt im trockenen Mund
Still addicted, yeah, yeah
With no intent to change
And throw my crown upon the ground
Bide your time, it's all in vain
We don't waste our time tanning in the sun
Sober, sober, send yourself over
Pack deinen Shit zusammen und geh
Stand up, lay down for no one
Y'all pretended to understand the matrix
Oh yeah, straight to hell
This isn't the first time,
And if you've ever heard me talk about it you can tell
Your lips display cancer and kissed my face after
It's burning it's burning it's burning tears right through
I hate everything, fuck you Fuck you
'Cause today I hate everything Buy
The chirps, I turn them into screams
To my head, it's probable, the claws are sharpened, sharp and ready
I just want to tell you you're a lousy Dad to hell with you
You made me feel alright, for once in my life
Get ya hands on his cash and
Without the mind to congregate
Wait Ruck chill, what the deal it's all love though
And you're sellin' your soul narcissistic, narcissistic
I don't need no razors
I'm right here  haha
And you are the good will
Is this supposed to be my golden years
Let's be passionate
Oh, baby, baby, ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
There must be something terribly wrong with me
Working after dark
My love, you make me sick
I would take every single rich person and take away their money;
And while you niggas that's been to jail before know it's about to get thick
Girls and boys hear the bass and treble
Why'd you do what you did
Y'all motherfuckers attack
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
Raising havoc in my peaceful society
But in God's eyes we're all the same
No, they only want your money
Get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
Had his heart broken
I'm in for hardcore Hiphop, the surrogate father
Ora che sono qui
I know, you're down for no one
People standin in the park
Who wants to get stomped on
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
We get a bit to play around with doesn't really matter
Pissing in
ja automaatilla hidastelijaa
She destroyed me with one blow
And I too was on my knees at the foot of my bed
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying
The light is fading from my room
This unhallowed ground
Is that how it's done,
And you danced around on my broken dreams,
Yet and still you want a try
So break down that wall, baby
Fuck all haters I see 'cause I hate that you breathe
The redeemer said he bought us with our blood
I'm frantic in your soothing arms 
Are you leavin' now, boy
You didn't create our scene
I refuse to wake up one more time bleeding on the floor
In the vaults of the dreaming gods,
Been in love , times
I'm falling into nowhere
They gonna tie yo' feet
Life becomes one long infomercial
Loving couples, smiling children anger me
Seems as though it's getting scary
Throughout the ancient lands
This is the sound that should not be
Every single second I'm alive
Lose myself in a crowded room
The worst thing has been done to you
Kiss the ladies shake hands with the fellows
The only religion I know is holy poetry
And now we're in the GPO with the bullets whizzin' by
Just how deep do you believe
Those lies came straight from your mouth
This is a call to war
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
Quit the therapy, any other peace treaty
I'm talkin liberation, it seems no matter how far you make it
The media incites civil unrest
You live in a computer, you're an instant man
Those who are in hell hallowed be thy name
And we both know, like everything, that's one big fucking lie
You are the dream
You let jobs go into the distance
I think I'm going out of my mind
In the name of god you fight the unholy war
I do this for the streets, the RUNNERS Akon 'Cause I'm out here grindin'
Always have to have the last word, no matter what
Smoke filled lungs inside of you
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
To the sound of breaking glass and sirens calling
Do what you feel you must
I wish nothing but
You need to slit your wrist, get pissed and go jump off a bridge
Uh oh, I'm in the game
Not just a drug abusing lonely alcoholic
I won't let myself hold back
There's madness in your soul
Meine Raps sind so hei�� wie in der Sauna 'n Daunenschlafsack
Maybe love just ain't for me
Let's root, come on
You're a hopeless cynic I'm an optimist
I love you though you hurt me so
Bodies gon fall
Put your claws around me baby
Was battle ich denn hier mit wack rappenden Edelassis
I am the weakness you cannot control
There, hey, hey, ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
She will hold on, then she will let go
He lied to her, with a perfectly straight face
If you're not yet a woman
I been in the cold
The fucking wars
We start to simulate
With a whole lot to say, a whole lot to say
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Each one's afraid of what you seek
I keep holding on to what I wanna believe
If it wasn't for OC your scene wouldn't be alive
And it's just another bombtrack
Down on bloody knees
Don't let those other people make your life a mess
Be careful I may bite your head off
with rhethoric and bullshit that you cannot endurse"
If you win then  you be scared and stressed
Hit your mug with a  snub and watch the blood rush
Each one wishing that the other was afraid
Up my street, I see your regulations stick
This interactive lifeform
He loved me, he loved me, ravishingly low
Hustling kids there jugglin pot
Get your face between my thighs
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope
Then turn around and secretly text him
We are the new ones
Don't let the limelight you're standin' in blind you
Get the bird, catch her, shoot her, I don't care
So you closed your eyes, and dreamed your heart to a safer place
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows
The first time's the worst time
Livin' in the city
Feelings that I shared with you are over now
Fills all minds all the time
Can't escape this place, I deny your face
If your instinct's always right
How can people that you see every day
Okay, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
The universe is so cold
For the fate of all mankind
That's the way to treat a child who cries out in the night
You make me feel like I'm nothing
E non sei qui con me
Exposing all your fucking lies
The message stays the same,
Ik sloof me uit, compliment en een grap
Almost blind like an old man should be
I need you I need you I need you
The days go on and the years go by and I'm hotter and hotter and flying on by
Better watch your back  your spine
My friends call me enemy 'cause they're a fucking joke
Down on my knees
Brag on my face
You think I'm sentimental I think you're heavy mental
Were we ever really together
'Cause there's no hidden agends when they speak to you
Am ersten warmen Tag dieses Jahr
You'll surrender to your creatures
Two steps behind me, stalkin
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Always sinking to new levels
You cheeky devil you, it's not even dark
It's a shame, that niggas die young
My friends all lie
I cannot believe this
I ain't splitting nothing with nobody homie
Swollen eyes portray my pain
To hell in a heaven
Oh I'm gonna do it my way
And with hate in your mind convict me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ain't no comin' back
Without fighting to know you
If you want to get down now
Reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
Who played with you when you were lonely
Some day, in some other time
Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet
I'm gonna miss you cleanin' round the home
ich sanier' deine Fassade mit 'nem Blatt Papier und meiner Fullerspur
To share all the peace
We don't die, we multiply, hit after hit, living platinum style
Step the fuck back
Poisoned blood, your mothers worthless breed
We bang hard like snares in percussion
Your deathday clock is ticking
Live through my music yeah
So, you want my love back
Yeah I'm knocking on the banks door
I'm on top of the game
Always gone too far  always over the edge
You're no one 'til some one
You can try and deceive me
Die Welt war nie rein
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
But what I knew all the time
They have seasoned me over the last year,
Parting contestants never seem to win
Heart breakin', money makin' hothead fool
Just walk the streets with your head up high
Foulest union, most unholy
Still, I'll never understand why you hang around
Moved on to the next trend
I'm feeling so useless  I'm raping my mind
I don't want to remember summers in December
Backbone, backbone, backbone, backbone
Don't explain, you never change
As night time comes around too soon
I know you did what you had to
Go back to your rock punk
What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big
Its goin' down HC mutha fukin P the creators of the crunk shit we bout to tear this mutha fukin up den crash da club bitch
You were the gun in the hand of the killers
Put down the kid and run
Please hand another rum and coke
Follow me, go ahead, I'm watching your shadow
I need a bottle
Where's your heart, did you sell that too
Peel you off till you drop on the floor
Change your views or change your friends 
Whoever said that good guys always win
You'd never expect a thing
Don't take life too seriously
Or do you think that I'm some kind of dummy
Raid our clubs bust out parties condemned for short hair
I serial kill shit
Coldhearted from the day I bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
Das ist vergangen, und bevor ich mich versah warns schon zwei Affaren
To get up off the ground
Jesus can you listen to me my jeramaid my ray of light
Y'all know who the fuck I am
Been so long down below yeah
It's gettin' mighty dark
I can't feel my heart, but I feel the shame 
Sometimes at night when I close my eyes
And show you crazy
But I'll try to love again
You are the question
Where were you when the mothers cried
They shot him in Kilmainham jail but they'll never stop his cry
Another dope track, know what I'm sayin' what yo
In the evening blooms, I still think of you
Image is nothin' you frontin see the thirst in y'all
You're still trapped in a suffocating fantasy
Sometimes I hate myself for who I am
I don't wanna love you, love you
'k Heb een syndicaat, 'k heb een agent
When life gets rough 
And drug your kids for being bored
We'll join the other fools
Boil the water
I'll let you salt my wounds
Not when you've got short hair
Nobody's learned anything, 'cause they all do what you do
Under the gun to be a man
Feeling Old Testament
We've got one chance to break out
And you've been smoking up the ends 'til you explode
Ryde or die
The lust of men is bound to win
You're losing control narcissistic, narcissistic
You're furious, I never taught you to sing
That day my momma socked it to 'em, at the Harper Valley PTA
This kin is a knock knock knocking on your door
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past
Pennies for your thoughts and dollars for your sins
Hit it to me harder
I think you need to walk
Fuckface  that's where I'm gonna stick it
So together, but so broken up inside
So far from sincere I love you, fabrications in my ear
Become man and then
Open for business like a cheap bordello
I can't deny it's killing me
I've given you drugs
You would amount to something
But that is in fact my identity
You follow me on the fucking street
But had no life, no purpose
Give me the pain that you feel
When I got a sawed off, bodies are hauled off
Dreams of tomorrow as darkness descends
I'm under too much pressure I think I think too much
We're in a war that can't be won
Well well what the fuck
Nothing inmy view, hey I can fly
Who's got the name of change
With a steady pace on the face that just we raced
Under the influence
And when you're runnin' your mouth, our razorblades come out
As the years go by I can't deny the flame that burns inside me
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
I'm carrying the weight of a world that sold me out
I'm liberated "A republic for people to have in them self respect"
I'm not angry and I've never been above it
And I fear that I can't find you
I hear that voice inside a' my head
To lost limbs, backstabbed twofaced turncoats
You say you have all the answers
You gotta be careful
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
Hopeless but endless love story
Love when you love
I been back and forth and up and down again
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
Always forgiving
As we attempt to bring home the championship
You sign away your youth
Divide lots and plats
All that I feel is agony
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something in you I despise
Same old thing, same old game
And replace it yo, with your Hollywood
Whenever that's why my shit is hot, can't keep it real
The way you live, can't seem to find
I had my balls and my brains put into a vice
And it is always Christmas in a cupboard at the top of the stairs"
It's a revolution Baby, you're a smash
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
That's the word don't you know
Have you lost your head
You lot 
Yes, I guess I loved him too
A mountain of fulsome, son of god
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
And those motherfuckers are wack, I travelled a rocky road
And while I'm all apologetic you just conjure monsters headed
Is it me Is it really me I cannot stand myself
You just tore all our kisses right in half
Hey chump You're better off, don't fuck with me
Ora che sono Ora che sono qui
Von deinem Sabbelwasser kommen hochstens Flecken auf 's Plattencover
Damned be those stepping out of line
I thought the fight
I just sit in a corner and I don't make a sound  Not one word
Not to mention, you're just following a trend
Come and get it nigga we wit it
Bluntly put in the fewest of words
You lost nigga
Swapped boy scout hat for army cap
Honestly needing
Chick You asshole You shit
Now that I said it I feel liberated
I never wrote one single thing for you
Take your face out of your hands
I've seen enough to know that I can't see at all
All my questions all are meshes, wallowed sections
So you get done then you get some
Another face in the crowd
When she sneaks in with the scarecrows and it's haunting me again when she
A Motorway City
I wanna hate it all away
Never trust a happy man
Guess I'm putting my foot down
Fuck this let's just kill them dead
Clementine I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage, or whatever it is you've got goin' there If you wanna be with me, be with me
Philipp Dann war' der Track doch zuende, war' doch schade drum
All I think is about yesterday, I could die
I give you all a boy could give you
Don't patronise my fuckin' ass
I bow down to no one, you like the faith
And you wouldn't act that way if you really loved me
What'cha niggas want
Dead eyes live lies, I know you're sore
Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying
Now throughout the ages, we've been a' turning all those pages
Different rules, we haven't got a clue
Got the whole world shocked now
None of y'all niggaz don't really wanna fuck with the dread
Go ahead and punt
Just don't take chances on anything at all
So fast you'll hear the party spin the fuck right off
Why did I do it all wrong
One second you're breathing
That leak into my soul
I'm cast out by my relatives 'cause they don't want me around
Tender moments with a burntout cigarette
The war for oil is a war for the beast
Look what Harry Potter did to Andrew Galotti, Kid
Your telephone's the one that helped
Your time is over
Don't get smoke in my face
In fault the line extends
You said you hope that I'm happy now
Mistrusted start, chemical replacement in my head,
I just want you back
They cut the cord, it cuts everything that's living in me,
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
Stop this, why won't you sympathize
From this painful dreaming
In verge of tears
And people on the trains play little games
What is this I see I don't believe this
Away
'Cause I hate everything
I push you away
When you're leaving, I'm breathing
I don't care what nobody say
It's a shame we have to play these games
Baby, hey, hey, hey, hey, ain't no comin' back, oh, oh
And suffer with your fools
Ze worden zot
Mr Murdoch cares for orphans 
No sleep till that man is found
I hate my
 Shivering, as truth lay bare
'Til you see a carcass at your feet and then you feast upon it
"We are now approaching lunar sunrise, and, uh, for all the people back on Earth, the crew of Apollo  has a message that we would like to send to you
There is no place to call home
Hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter
But you'd eat them out of house and home
Cause mind control
Ain't nothing to me 'cause I am the streets
Summer winter spring I can't forget the fall
Every cry a wasted moment
I am the reason you wish you were dead
Who never ever really could be loved
A perverted pipe dream of the past
The toxins you spill are forced to decline
Now nigga you can rest in pieces
Say you're right again
'Cause I know I'm in control
And always forgiving
Childmolesters get probation
Quartets from the heir to the throne x
Well, I been havin' a little trouble lord
I see the world  dead
Runnin' gunnin things knockin' niggas out like Clubber Lang
Here is a strange and bitter crop
Pop pop don't stop I need your heat
Your libidinous urges long repressed
Son of a bitch you broke my heart
When I'm in your care
Now it's broken and can't be fixed
Gotta work every day
My good boys good girls and good gods
'Cause she had cobwebs up her fanny and I believe in giving to the poor
Takes me away
Now every time you go to sleep
No time for games, tonight we fight
You dried my eyes too well
Me and my girl on a trip to heaven, your Toyota is fantastic
With a prosthetic arm and smelling like Boone's Farm
It's these voices inside it's that darkness above me
Lies, Hate, Greed, feeds the machine
And what you're trying to tell me
And indifferance turns to solace
You let it all slip away, yeah
Think its fucked up now it get worst for y'all
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Ripping the rest
He scares easily
Can cut you from their bloated budgets
I won't go inside the gates, leave me in the waiting room,
My beautiful bird has gone away
Niggas talk about greatness
No more deaths
But if you blame somebody
Celle qu'on traine chez soi
I be that prime honorary nigga
I try to do right and I can't figure out
I won't fight for a cause that's been lost
You are the beginning
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block
And though you dream of being free
London town is traffic hell, it's freezeframed in D
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion
Look up and see that motherfuckin' writin' on the wall
I love you instead
Every day is November first in this Sodom and Gomorrah
I've been up for days and I have no fear
Won't take it back
I've got a need to kick them down
Strapped to my stomach screaming, "Let's get it on"
My inner vision, dulled and darkened
I see the people as they tick
There goes the Citizen Army with their fists raised in the sky
Your hair still smells like the sea
Come on, come on, come on
I've come too far gotta keep my pockets thick
I keep my head in tune with my thoughts  are always clear
Fingers once offered are now too heavy to extend
The tension, the harshness of life
Judged and told I can't cut your shallow hands
When they are in fact part of my species
Oh che esecrabile emozione
Like throwing up, nausea restricting loving host,
Oh yeah, yeah
You are my soul
And here comes another
Touch me baby, tainted love
It pricks like hot needles in my Eyes
Or swallow potential heart attacks
Primetime of the mind,
My clothes don't fit me, and my friends don't like me and the furniture is giving me a rash
I'm gonna do it my way
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit, and start over from scratch and write new ones
Gonna hang these bones out to dry
But I'ma raise hell to the bitter end  I'm a soldier
He'd better have a dream that goes beyond four walls"
You said you wanted to be loved
You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me
Eating a hot dog reading the Holy Qu'ran, while I'm on the john
My summer's over and it's time to face the fall
And you're consuming spirits just to peer into the voodoo
I'm a soldier on a battlefield
Not just a dream
And a voice on the radio says 'get out while you can'
Feed your children toxic food,
Factory farming killing flora,
A black hole chaos theory
Throw sum chairs
You forgot to see it
It's all been done before and
Free is your way  far ahead all your thoughts
Out to nourish a salty dream
It's an adrenaline rush, you feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
I'll take the fall
And you are upside down
Neither up nor down, just been turned and turned 
Doing time, been led astray 
And people around me is tellin' me that you's a stalker
And how long did you think you could keep me tricked
But I see right through your skin
I live in peace
Let me feel it
It took us down for a few showers in the afternoon
Sending our successors to the battleground
You're going to need a lot of luck Mommy's little cowboy
Right now feeling pain, make it go away 
Get the bird, bring her down to the ground from out the air
It comes on slow and then it takes over
Watch your back
A moment out of time
Why you want me to die
In a different town, start a brand new life
Sixteen m's and one pump
You better get up out the way
Tibetan Black Magic, I'm a warlord
But I break, know what I am saying, this is how it goes y'all, damn
'Cause it's been on my mind,
I'm not your prey, I'll make you die
But I'd like to practice it to get it straight
My real niggaz, hard hitters they die with me
Some days fine, others out of my mind who was around when you were hungry
You can't to a psycho like a normal human being
Torn away from my warmth
Give baby a cuddle narcissistic, narcissistic
Hey Dad What'd you do with mother
And all this time
And take what you deserve from life
And I can't tell you what I really need
Had it all in our hands we had it all, yes you and me
That your card will get pulled if you interfere Interfere
I could leave you alone
'Cause it's driving me crazy and I can't understand
You can ski anytime
Ah, ain't nothin' left here partner
Some say engine, engine number nine
Caught in the red lights
After everyone out there has log gone deaf
You've given me up you've taken everything I got
Don't try to fight them, it's too late
Auf meiner Reise endest du hochstens als gro��er Tourscherz
Will you bite the hand that feeds you
I don't know if I'll die laughin'
It's on your face that I'm gonna sit
And clear your eyes
Become me
And to think at the start you were alarmed
Haunted by carriages, Rosemary's Baby
So she can dance her husband out on the floor
Here we are, so close to the stars
Go burn the whole house down, like anyone cares
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
My fists, man
Man you're seeing that you just get angrier
When a life breaks it is silent
And your mother turns tricks
Do I start writing all this down
When Sport Utility Vehicles are no longer enough you need The Terminator Stuck in traffic in Lost Angeles Drive over the tops of everybody else You'll crush 'em before the cops can catch up with you Your precious artefact child needs to be safe They're talking to a kid whose skin is a different colour Grab the kid and mow 'em down
All the twists and turns
And we'll throw stones until we're dead
Lovebird, you haven't touched your bread
An cryin' won't help you none
Turn out the lights, make me a porcelain doll
Clenched teeth 
To the outside of town 
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Gotta getcha groove on Gotta getcha groove on
A hundred thousand heavenly soldiers sent by Jade Emperor cannot defeat him 
Treaties are written on history's pages
Gather 'round my covenant
Greenhouse Effect ain't the same without Inkwell
Darkness pulls me away
My constant decadence
What remains is hope that has gone
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin' the flow, slow venom any opponent
Where's my money Where's my clothes
God is a gun and it's targeting me
Like our tired hearts
Life  They fought and fell and died and never came home
I don't wanna go to work but I must
Another funky radical bombtrack
Get him a place to stay
And y'all steady screaming for war but want peace
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms
Hotter and hotter, hotter and hotter, hotter and hotter, oh Yeah I refuse, I refuse
<Pop pop pop> was the sound I put the bitch down
And when the feelings come, I will fight them off
While her's recalls a honey house
Them anytime goin' right ain't no bar nigga
quando stai     in agguato come me      senza te
Feel me, feel me, feel me, hey, hey feel, woo
Man you're seeing that you're sinking over time and you're blind
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Make me sick, they're all pricks
Who can match the Bident with my top speed
Or shall I sing and dance
cerca de una despedida
You are the ice
Where were you when the babies died
Your rapier wit cut me down to size
And drastic movement of people acting stupid
Spinning out of control
I feel, I touch, I breathe, I cry
You're still safe, crossed my hart
They're bangin' on the walls
And hold on for a rough ride
Little girl, she was small
Act on command
Ooh Tainted love
Said it's a pity 'bout the middle class Holden mass
Runnin' like I just don't care
Better start runnin' 'cause you're gonna die
Sometimes I feel like I haven't learned anything
Don't waste me on something stupid like this
Every bit of something we call home
Your own arrogance was your downfall
Or your body's life you were fighting for
Armageddon is a deadly day
So afraid of anything that may not come that easy
Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
Sisters Sisters, you've got the power use it
Gonna show me how, boy
Me and my girl on a trip
There's a new world out there
All my niggaz
Take everything from me
So kind and generous
You make me feel like a piece of meat
And the things you've done
This is everything you've waited for
I can't see my way again
Blackness tossed against the wall
Sleepy from the poison, bitten by a snake tracking her so cruelly
My thinning blood, reactionbased anxiety, I've had enough,
The closer I get
"You gave me this tattoo back in '"
Isn't it sad that the strongest arm's still to short to reach
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
They may cut you
Envy and hate feed the demons within
I can't find my piece of mind I feel like I'm losing touch
I watch him struggle with the fact that he's become what he said he'll never be
I see you duck, you little punk, you little fuckin' disease
Living breathing being
Men on a string
I know the haters are busy making up hater lies
We are the spring
Using infrared
Oh face it daddy, don't wanna have me no double cross,
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
And what's John writin' 'bout the revelation
Increasing the weight
How can I expect to ever be loved
A space in the silence
Is this something, a toy 
I'm jealous yeah
Amped up for a nasty joy ride 
Who the fuck are they foolin
So call me a bitch in heat and
The road ahead goes on and on
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades off or completely down"
Temper temper, temper temper, temper temper
Just a little and nothing now it's over 
Before your head hit the dash
Nobody gives a fuck about you, or me
Rock bottom is a beautiful start
Disassemble
I'll talk to you soon
But if you were, yes, if you were, I wouldn't want you anyway
Like an assassin for the better half
Are you brave enough to see
Is it in my blood to have to take you down
There's nothing here for me and you
Lost Father, hollow be thy name
I am chaos
But I don't, I don't, I don't know how man
Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers
To my generation
Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down
Can't find a good reason
My need for innocence
Documents
Death is the sickest way for attention
I am the voice that you hear in your head
No lover coming to the door
'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine
To you it's another day
That dumb ass will blow you away
Did we toil in vain, in hope
That's why drugs seem so lovely like a way to escape
Our kids die in deserts, they been sent that way,
I just feel better when they're not around
You are the answer
Two kills to me, two hearts too far
La zona rossa esplose in un secondo e fu
We the Best Season has returned Akon 'Cause I'm out here grindin'
I ain't slept in  days
But at least you're honest, speaking like you're being modest
Where you dream for tomorrow what you lost today
You know I think I'll get myself a maid
Over bodies and cases
Strung out on your wire
I cannot sleep with a head like this
Oh, there ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
Get 'em when we spot em hit 'em kid we got em
It's all that I can do to get up
Welcome to
All around you slow decay
Treats me this way
'Cause I just want to know, I need just a little
Ethnocentricity
Hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter oh yeah
To find yourself staring down the throat of the beast
Io non so stare solo
Now at the age of  tin still won't turn to gold
Junge, lungerst du noch an deiner Blubber bin ich schon langst startklar,
Whisper your secrets, can't get to the truth at all
No chance for cash or fame
komm' deine Raps peinlich wie 'n Typ mit Pferdeschwanz
"Let there be light"
For with death you have been kissed
That gets me through
Oh, now dance for me you fucking puppet
So what comes now
Curse my pride, I react Play yourself again
Yo, you know we had the baddest motherfuckin unit back in the days son
Then one day my world was shattered
Each new, hot generation has a statement they wanna call their own Tattoos Piercings That's for Moms and Dads What you wanna do is spend your allowance on devil horn implant, Elephant Man head, designer tails, third leg, fourth leg  everyone a hermaphradite
She looks like she was born to it
So please, don't you go
Me and my girl in a love machine, your Toyota is fantastic
How would it feel to have to be real
Oh, no, comin' back when your foot of pride come down
Runnin' around yappin' about they be holdin' figgas as big as Jigga's
Won't change you
The land will be covered in darkness
With nothing left to hold
Take flight adjust the Yaw
mika sina oot
From fly over country, back through Mississippi
And in this lonliness
I don't know if I'll cry
I've now introduced you to your future ways
Cry when you cry, run when you run
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
Oh, baby, ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
Hundred treaties signed by your fathers' lies
Let's blow the motherfuckin spot
Stars light years away, alone
We were born for hard ball
Run away run away run away
You were blood nothing more
I told you everything, opened up and let you in
Till we break and we take back the world from these fake motherfuckers
She will fight it when you steal her love for your lust
The roof the roof the roof is on fire 
God, help me to believe
Little boy 
I'm liberated "That it's time to stop goin along
It's time motherfucker for the shit to go down

Idolatry of ideology
You're a fucking prick
Sa syytit sun isaa
Running in circles  so bored of life
It's people who have been through what you've been through
What happened to the dreams you had
This time you will see
A subtle prick, a blatant lie, your denial
perche lo fai e il domani diventa mai
No one answers
Your parents' parents made this happen, yeah eat your words and fold your napkins
Waiting in worry for the confirmation of information
I need to say to you,
Oh, no, yeah
You dizzy bitch, swallow this
It cuts at me like a knife
Dark boys on the black gas see they don't black mask
You gotta follow all the rest
Why bother to defy when we still can't unite
This is a reason to die
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
Lighting universes
Now they can't stand my black ass
And I don't need you No more
I fear you
I'm almost home so I better haul ass
I held you way too long
Swallowed sleeping pills like dreams
And when there's something in the way
His hand is like a fox paw, fox paw
For my eyes to be blinded
You gotta give something back to life
This is a rallying cry
You want to help out the homeless
At the age of  he was forced to choose
So are you ready to go
I need some pills
But when temptation starts, I will fight it off
Well why are we here It's thinning us out,
Can you feel me
But to the light side it don't matter none
I'm from where the war games fascinate you couldn't
Wake to the sound of a dumptruck backing up
Because when you're caught you're left to rot
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
All the shit you've given us is fertilizer
A sole voice to justify a reason for so many to decry
Listen, don't try to explain
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it
I feel so alone
Satan done got me on this song
Three boys dead, non that I knew from
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you
Oh lie on me, that's all I want is you to lie on me,
You screwup, you make me sick
More to the left
Warm in the comfort that darkness will bring
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
Looking for ways to play the thorn in my side
MTV moves too fast, I refuse to understand
'Til they bring back Gallifrey
Go with the flow into the shitter they are sucked
I hate my generation now
I'm the motherfucking ungrateful
Now at the age of  he's in Catch 
Gotta tear her apart, let me at her first
From anything that brought you down
He got his clique and his brothers haha
I feel it beneath me, giving way
Give me a reason to fight
I've taken you in, I've trusted you way too much
Sacrificing your own while their under your thumb
Beware of the soulsaver
Feculence excrement
Third time
By Doing the thing I love
She's so raunchy, so vulgar, not me, why the hell her
Antagonizing and instigating my hate
Serpenttongued priestess bares her pale flesh,
Fuck this lets just kill them dead
Show you machine gun funk
We are not alive
The songs you knew but you never sung
I will fight it off
We raw nigga
  makes you wanna fuck your end
His head is a little interior of grey mirrors
We barely left the ground
I been seein' red and I don't know why
I'm getting sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit
Everything I say is wrong
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Set you in the water
In front of you
More will my friends stand for
How many times do I have to tell you rap niggas
Where'd you leave me tonight
Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear
We go to dinner at the Governor's mansion
Gather 'round and haggle
Jest ti bom naredu stih k bo dobrk ti
War  I tried to see it your way
Identify the enemy, remove the source of fear Start to change my life
The dirt that I shovel to uncover the truth
Every time that I turn around
Think I give a fuck
And let's just see who gets out alive
Hope  How many more if any more
Let me know how you feel
We ain't got shit, now had enough
I'm aiming your gun
And I need some thrills 
My mind was slick  my temper was too quick
Hey, ladies
The Eternal Fiends exult in rapture
To need you
Und mich beliebt machen
Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a coma
What have we done
Dig inside himself and make a change
Will fade like the hopes and the tears you denied
Mountain from a molehill mountaintop removal
They're drifting farther everyday
I just wanna get the fuck away from me
quando sai     di essere sbagliato       come me
Kickin these niggas
The tears that she cries 
Got a monkey on my back
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
Maar ik wil geen grap meneer, ik wil geen grap
Until you stand before death so now you can create
The world around me falls apart
Cops chase me when I'm standing still
The good ones died, the others just got old
Smash their head
Theyll throw you away, away
Better come back on the inside, 'cause you got too much to lose
God is a gun and it's killing everything
Open your mind put it in your head
Drama brings you to your knees
Getting hotter and hotter you see
Murder on command
Listen gravedancer, with disarray pander
Ni ar den stora graa massan
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace
Oops, there goes you'll never leave me alone
And gettin' jacked by the youknowwho
I still see what you don't
Only Heaven's silence for an answer
Heart line is flat lined through the therapy era
It's all around you it's a tragedy, look
Celebrated when I made mistakes,
Nobody knows where Osama been hidin
To do right by his son
And they're not even in season
Ooh, pay my bills
I can't remember what I'm missing
MC Ren, I hold the gun and
But you don't know shit till you been in my shoes
Right, right
'Cause it's built on solid Rockland ground
When she met you, she loved your songs
Come face to face with a world of darkness
If there ain't a fight then it doesn't mean a goddamn thing
Emotional swords slash my soul 
If you want the big one
And I'm a fuck you up
Tainted love
Now comes crumbling down
Give something that is real
��destruyo a aquel con mi instinto de asesino
And somehow I got this far
Words  For words they fought and words they fell and words alone
Mascarada, Incontrolavel
You are the doubt
I was a hitman with no friends
As they wonder what's under my waist
It's got all the right elements that I like
There's nothing left inside
The music she make, rubbing our faces in the feces of the daybreak
We'll let this battle pass us by
Your confession of faith is far behind you now,
You are the shelter
I hate myself
So shut up and accept your fate
It's always been the same
Burn motherfucker, burn x
So charred and black
I've played a million empty shows to only family and friends
Destination death or better days x
She knows his name Stopping all she can
Who turned out to be the younger wive's nursing schoolgirl crushes
Push your baby carriage into the street, till it's mince meat
'Cause I need you
The tomb, it needs
Wanneer het minder goed gaat, wat heeft ie dan nog
Oh, foot of pride come down, ain't no comin' back, ah, ha, ha
Well good morning baby, welcome back to town
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
Du spielst dein Spiel doch drei war einer zu viel
Don't you know that, killing is my business, and business is good
Without attempting to overstand its basics
You can play the game your own way
There's not a net, there's no one there
Now here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Your pages get flipped
Oh everything's set, everything's fine
Yes, I'm afraid to turn around,
So put a big smile on your face
Or the pain that I'd inflict
I beg your skin, You buy a whore
I know you feel me nigga, you feel me nigga
So what the fuck you know about being a gangsta
Sick with disease
They got just the tool, everything can move
Next time I warn you'
You're just a player in the game'
Assassinate your best friend now I hurt you par
So try not to feel like that today
Jedi mind tricks
Enough's enough's enough's enough
A flick of the wrist, you'll be gone
Now all the sudden, she wants you to get a desk job
Skadattle, slam, you been defeated
Cities fall in ruin
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
You'd fuck any guy in town
No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Then I gets mad
Padded with power here they come
Fetishistic anomalies
We are We are We are unbreakable x
Oh, big grey mother, I love you forever
Well, can you feel it
Did you forget about me, Mr Duplicity
We will fight it off
Evil are those who call it sin
When you don't come home to me Man
Fuck that How this shit look
What a beautiful cover, a talk show makeover, and you'll lose some weight
Paranoid, star lover
With Loki DMS, JJohnny to my left
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
That's what they all say and that's how the trouble begins
Chick Oh, that was great and everything, but you know,
To kill the snake you cut off the head
He wrote the book of the seven seals
I don't need a license 
Y'all niggaz ready to do it
I love it, I hate it, baby
Sure enough it won't hold you for long
I watch him struggle with the fact that he relies on people that don't really care,
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath, you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
A wounded world an absent creator
We did it all in our lifetime
Can you get up off your knees
And I've been hurt , times
Even though you're the one that's bringin' in the money
Lend me your ears for just another page
bin ich 'n SechsGangeMenu bist du nur Tankenfra�� Danke, das war's
Surprise, niggas
Straightedge  in you face
Oh yeah, we puffin' on one of them thangs too
You sure get around
Don't you run
Nothing's working
You carry rocks in your head and pitch them
Fire, all our guns
Yet your begging falls upon deaf ears
Ten thousand dollars up front
Red eye red eye
Every now and then I dream about you
Constant conflict
The only religion I know is my lips kissing her skin
Scared to believe
I heard your name the other day
Your whipping boy's about to speak
Now drugs and booze keep my alive
Talkin' that shit  you're mine
Your pedestal reeks of death
Your vicious infestation of the weaker mind
Well I say Shit floats
I think I need your touch
Once, once is really something twice
At the age of  how was he to know
It's my life for everyone to see
Now look what you have done
Don't wake the baby
Drunken and pedestrian, taken from behind
A dystopic creation dividing a nation
She calls my name, but she's just one of millions
A stupid fucking bastard
'Cause I'm like God, motherfucker, there's a price to pay
If I had a guess then your voice would top this list
Makes me turn away from good to bad then to ugly
They only do it 'cause it's the cool thing to do
And nothing's right
But I have been here before
You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell
Before you were just maggots
I'm sure that god hates you, he thinks your an obsessed fan
Defeat the Monkey Defend the heavenly throne
Don't you feel a little bit humble
Away from here
To the cries in the middle of your dreams
I tried to leave but it didn't work,
Yeah, that's life
Now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Your breath, so thick
You bit my lip
So what if she's handicapped, the bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap
Let's get it on baby
These parting contestants never win
I said, 'Look man
I can't get you from under my skin
Then if I were to speak my mind about this house"
Now that's entertainment,
You are the trust
Hello darkness
I hit the ground, and then sit
Though none should save me
See her up in the tree, looking down at you and me
You need another try
All the time wasted
I'll tear that fucking chapel to the ground
We don't really care if you say we're too young
The casket calls to your despair
Sleep with my enemy
Usando i nervi a mo' di comodi condotti
Or was it your mother
Full of broken dreams  always on the run
That's my style
But I'd trade them all for just another look
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
Hit it, hit it, hit it
Fuck fight music, bitch, this is losing your life music
So here we are
Lips likened to poison in a rat trap
More time to explain myself
There is no turning back
And the Earth is full of lurid madmen,
Ci sono istanti che vivere e una merda
Feel life the sweet life is all I want
I won't say a word  except right now
Yours went stale a long time ago
Waving his pistol in my face
Watch your back
No really its nothing
queriendo cerrar una herida
We four girls are here to stay
I love reading Koran in pitch blackness
The rent or I am gonna get evicted
From the LBC to Helsinki
Immobilised from hair down to my feet blue coming up,
Who exploit her and take her youth and throw it on a factory floor
We could go dancing if you want to, but I'd rather take you home
Through all this time
Now take that voice outside a' my head
Arbor hospital, you never should've let me out
Now It's calm down around the place nothing recalls
Don't change your tune
Denn ich erfror, als du so kalt gelacht
And they last too fucking long
And boy, were they surprised when Mrs Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
I observe the Universe
But I am not solely race, nor environment, nor destiny
This calamine lotion made my skin feel good
I'm barely hanging on
So step right up and pull your fucking reign again
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, till my hip don't hop anymore
She reaches out her arms to me
Well, I have been here before
Never give a fuck about niggas y'all not Nutso
Sie ist ubergossen mit leicht entflammbaren Mitteln und 
But I'm keepin' it together yeah
And I don't care what you say
Take it away
Squawking over my head, don't let me down
Let's root
We've been climbing uphill together
She can hear him breathing, breathing
Government control
Since he left them both ten years ago to serve the ministry
Move to my music
Prove my innocence 'cause I did no wrong
What a fucking scam
I fear
Me and Fred about to go half of Microsoft yeah
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
Eat grass; and little else
I'm the best thing in history
And every waking moment
Ein Seitensprung, das kann passieren
I hate you,
I imitate my shadow
You are not alone
I'm tasteless, there's beauty in strange places
I will never understand
By turning countries into labour camps
Your crucifixion has been so drawn out,
I was adopted by parents who loved me
And if there's nothing
Will take you until you get old
I want to hear your voice
I will continue to pray for us and try to remember only the good things
To make things right
Yeah, use your rights but don't imagine that its heard, Oh no no
Pestilent conformity
Honey are you lonely 
Oh do you want to go to heaven
You are dead to me
Stop messing with the people's head
It's just a memory
The thought of you makes me sick
How many roads before the hand we hold is free
It seems like there's nowhere to turn
Roaming the street with a bag of stones
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
'Cause I don't give a fuck about you or that shit that you're saying
One of these days these boots
I'll take you for all that you are
Nothing you can do 
I'm looking for a fight, at  on a Saturday night
Pretty pretty girls with witty witty words
And then life fades away
The money's just doubled
Them same superstar nigga
And then you call me your best friend
Every action in this world will bear a consequence
This feels like a dream now, then it comes
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
A shoulder to cry on a friend to depend on 
Ritualize, please help me
He bare my G strength in replicating in man
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' sucotash
Different person
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill
Look, I got somethin' for y'all
In the dome of the sky
No more love yous 
With the sound of gun shots
Take a look at what they spend it on
Somehow you'll get free
The money's just doubled narcissistic, narcissistic
Nocoj bom vse zatte naredil
They got mystery written all over their forehead
Then go and get the straps nigga gunfire with me
Stare into the sun
Come il cielo impassibile
e di nuove lacerazioni non c'e' voglia
Where were you when in the darkest night
Why do you make me feel like this 
And whatever you do, don't let them make a martyr out of me
You don't know what it takes to get this motherfucking drunk
All these people on my back
Il buio e' un peso, e' un imbroglio e brucia come il fuoco
Life  Above all else if nothing else
Slamming overhead hurting my hands
Even if it's only through the phone
I close my eyes
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
Knee jerk reaction, got a mouth on me
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch
I've given you love
Beneath those deep black pools
The best fuck you've ever had
But you better learn to love it
It's a circus we're the clowns as the giant ones disown
They comin' for you everyday
It's time to try out health
Drop dead, a bullet to my head
But I understand him
Reach up and touch the sky
Feel my soul is slipping away
That says gotta get outta Los Angeles
I hit you once more
The landlady's husband came up to town today
Military beasts starvin countries
Go over the top but come up from the bottom
Two tarnished golden hearts
That's gon' get at you be fuckin' with your mind, stop talkin' shit
I'm careful not to break
I'm thinkin' it's time to chill
Till I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
Bust my gun
So we have to find a new way
"Filthy words on children's lips are better, my dear spouse
My God that sounds horrid, eating MC's
But he won't succed as long as I stand true to my ways
Hype off of carbonated water then some fructose
Nauseous, raising the stakes
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
Don't bother me either way
You're the only one
What you know bitch, you got a lot to learn
I can take the punishment of you and your friends
You grip that throne to drink from hearts until their blood is drained
You better look me in the eye when you talk that shit about me
They'd better get their act together it's time that they awoke
'Cause you be tryin' to kill my hoe, my girlfriend
Than your fucking soul
Your song is ending, so don't cry
Watch me, cause you figured you got me in this hot seat
The broken, breaking through
I was a child, and now it seems so long ago
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
My kind we fight in the club
There are morals that conflict with orals
That I've been to
Want, touch, feel so much
Play that fucking music
There's no one left for me to be
You don't really give a flying fuck
He's goin' to fuckin' war
You may never go my way
The fire started long ago
unfassbar, ihr seid lastig wie Krumel im Barthaar
I'm falling fast down
Sorrow and sickness, you reap what you sow
Ma naan kun sa poistut pystypain
For my generation
tiistai ehka vahan parempi
Careful, choosing what to say
When you left me behind
Yeah, you've never been truly mine,
Got one more that is three
God I wish that I could feel sorry for you
Like sharpened knives to chicken McNuggets
Can you hear your conscience's crying
You bitch, you ain't that funny
She said this time forever
Ooh, I got your crazy
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
To win my heart again
You niggas flies
Well they can love it or leave it
How do you think I feel when I gag on your erection ugh
Bbut you always press and you know I never stress
And he finds it hard to be alone
But you've got problems
From Blueridge to Cattail on the prairie 
Dig deep in your soul
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you're dogging
It takes us down away from here, your Toyota is fantastic
This is an evil night
Sway  so hypnotic x
It's through the fight, it's time and I
Is it so simple to deny yourself these things
And now the pain it takes control 
Cheeky bastards 
"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth
Droppin' some shit that's DOPE
Or will I always fly alone
Dogs of war and men of hate
Everytime I take a look, the only thing I see is
We are We are We are unbreakable
It's deja vu one more time
Whole town be locked down
Ring the alarm we come to wake up the snoring
I wade in streams all day;
You would let less than a motherfucker fear no one
Don't hate me for what you've got, I've given you love
It's a frame of mind
Problem with you you're afraid to die
Baby you smell lonely to me 
You you you you you take my breath away
For this world to believe
Destruye a aquel que se imponga sin sentido
Is your lack of selfrestraint
The love we had just fade away, away
If you'll be in love with me
Du spielst dein Spiel doch drei warn eins zu viel, eins zu viel
 Unending questions driving me into insanity
All the friends think you're a fuckin' comedian
I hearken to the grisly murmer of nameless fiends,
They sang a hymn though that could cloak the air in mystery
I'm right behind you
Toes over the line
You blink, and then it's gone
Wanna go for the speed of light
But not without affection, no not alone
At night when I retire to my coffin, to sleep for a hundred years or more
Just bullet holes and broken bones
My heart is hateful, my tongue ripped
Shedding innocence like falling dust
Who's Who, The Orphange, The Minor League, Greenhouse
You lead the way, you beat the drum
Matches the color of the one on my face
Can't find hope to believe in
It's all that I can do to get up off the ground
But no one wins wars by evacuation
As if you care showing your devotion
The future isn't set in stone
You need someone to hold you tight
But my current state
Signed "Charlie Scene" on your girlfriend's tits
Moses to Moses, watching the flock
LA girl, you bring me down
I was a fool
And all of the things I sold
These boots are made for walkin'
Maybe the sound of your voice or the brake of your car or a little more than everything
If I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust
No, I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
Shoot the man, I still stand
And I can feel you under my skin
Sign away you life
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep
But haven't we been here before
Und ich liebte sie nicht
Place him face down on the bed
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
Lost my soul, lost my soul
That at the age of  he'd still have one to go
Why do you need a savior
And blow them away without any refrain
The tenant's boy said "How d'ya do" then swore in French
Round the way
When a faith is sealed without you
The travesty of science waking up, I've had enough,
Now I know I've got to
You're no one 'til someone
Even if it means we have to die this way
I've lost my mind
They got some beautiful people out there, man
So call the police
Step on its fucking head
Become man again,
Dispute the suits I ignite and then watch 'em burn
E quando sei     disperato come me      senza te
I can't go one day without y'all in my face
Forever it will stay throughout all time
All he wants to do is survive this painful cancer
Court jester, don't kill the humour
Fucking temper
Ask how I get freesh
While senators on holiday
Representin' the town
An utmost compliment
It doesn't feel like me anymore,
Rule the universe
Stare into space with a look on your face
Oh get down, getting down, so much money in the ground
Plies
And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment
Shut the fuck ah
She can hear the birds living in the leaves with their fucked up, fucked up language
The Earth will be burning
How rip I bars, walk through walls perform magic
Can I breathe for the ritual
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
Some day, in some other life
Got a blackberry stain
I can't sing along to this at all
You Waited a long time, you wasted more
Squeeze your neck harder when you start to cough
The lines just keep escaping me
I would take every single man that isn't in his country that's in a uniform in another country where he doesn't belong and bring him back home and take him out of his uniform and put him back in the world;
I dream I work I bleed I say things that I don't really mean
A lush that love to drink, drunk driving a tank
Yeah my friends all tell me but my friends all lie
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A bonewhite light
You been staying when you ought to be aleaving
I'm my strongest ally, living life as I know how
Theyll throw you away
Go home
Another bloody election 
Warning, to all those, caps get peeled
Teeth are rotten
I stomp on ya forehead
Listen to her try to suck me dry
Someone
I'm getting used to this nuisance of fags who bad mouth this music
Back in time for those you know
Alert the police, 'cause it's a state of emergency
These feelings are gone, they've been buried along who eased the pain of all your sadness
To be a man
And then they come and they come
Let me know boy, boy
Your heart, your lips,
Always hit the mark
Against the same fucking wall
As I have said, none resist my charm
You are but a fleeting illness
Don't lose your faith
You, are becoming gods 
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't
I'm taking a ride with my best friend
My thinning blood, reactionbased anxiety,
Out of step for what we believe in
Fire, fire, fire, fire, no, light up ya lighter
Might just catch somebody off their feet
If y'all gon' ride with me, get high with me
'Cause police and little black niggers don't mix so
My revenge on you will not kill you
Standin on the verge of them gettin' brown
You're shit
If I did it wouldn't matter
'Cause any time I'm ready, I can tell you baby get lost
Psycho shutter speed
Keep my head up high, looking toward the sky
I hate the trees
A revolution just arrived like the morning
Is your exclusion of dissidence masking your guilt
Something gets to me over and over again 
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger
Onneksi joka MacGyverin seurasin, nainollen kinkkisen tilanteen selvitin
'Cause I'm sick and tired of waiting
No one can listen to anyone's answers
The thing I love
There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind
So recall our downfall
Has unleashed the dogs of war
Another human again
You are undivided
If you're so rich then pay for what you've done
But under oath you cut my throat with sickle blade laughter
From your heart in tears
And nobody knows what to do, what's your point of view
I've saved your drawings of moons and spaceships and stars
They see the vision in our clear blue eyes
Somebody's out to sabotage what you hold sacred
And they go and they come
What's she thinking Does she really believe
To distract from the mess I'm in
Que l'on traine chez soi
The servants won't serve me and the doctors won't
See how you are, I'll never trust a happy man,
Let the rich man fry for it
Until another day is lost
Don't give a fuck
And you've got me feeling oh just like a roadkill
Looked in the trash can yo it had room
And one by one, they poured in incrementally
You're temptin' me to run my mouth and call you out on this, bitch
Shakes a lot like an old man should
'Cause revenge is better than money, you see
Well, this is just a little patent place and you're all Harper Valley Hypocrites"
I know you are but what am I
But now I'm gonna pack my things and go
You see it's all been spent
Living existences with no chance of scar
Straight to hell
'Cause people overanalyze my words because I got a name
Oops, there goes the house we made a home
One right after the other
Child of convention,
Payback  cashin' in your ticket
Sleep to the sound of a chainsaw massacre
Anything at all
My ruby red my diamond girl
And his head it spins around
Who had a teenage daughter that attended Harper Valley Junior High
And God said, Let there be light
I wait for no one
Please will you kiss my baby 
Maybe I'm just crazy enough
Burn burn burn burn
And as the cash box rang, I thought everything away 
Without warning, Happy drunk
Hide myself inside my mind
Brings out in me the scent for the kill
And mark the grave to burn when we go
One I desperately need
I need a friend 
Makes it hard to believe what you've done to me
I think it's your turn to go down on me
And you have no fucking purpose
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Just go back and hit 'em up style
And now someone else can kiss your ass
The will to deny and I'm standing in the dark all over again,
But I don't care
Goddamn thing
Behind these hazel eyes
Still swimming fast and hard
'Cause I am the streets
Everything I say to you feels stupid now
In the end, all I want is to survive this
Let no heart be faint, let the battle rage on
I'm your latex lover wrapped like a gift
Drag them into the streets
A blind man with blind faith is he your fuckin' enemy
In pod vokal age prtegnu
Now wearin' my dyes, 'cause I'm not stupid, mutherfuckers
You see me burning hotter and hotter and the years go by
False promises
I understand
'I'm gonna use my gun'
That you can't hide the fake smile
Sie hat nur noch wenige Tage und wei�� es genau 
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine
AIDS is our problem, we've gotta talk
Hab ich mich so in dir getauscht
Im allgemeinen hast du die Stimmbander eines Eunuchen
It may just make itself at home
And I am still alive
Now I'm not afraid to kill this
Some heads will get crashed
Shady day, I'm the prey
No time for reasons
Leave odor on my clothes
I believe in a better way
I'm counting the days while I'm saying
I ain't no puppet on a string
And the sanguinary sweetness of stealing someone's blood
Desease will be  will be overcome
I ain't never givin' in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
The suckers the girls roll
Pain causing fear
But I will be on guard, I will fight it off
Take it away now
Cause anyway you do
With the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
Om kadootjes te kopen en aan iedereen te geven
dove non entra piu neanche la polizia
Who won't take a stand
Later for you baby
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
I hate it all, why Why Why me
I'll sing you to your sleep
The guilt eats you just as you devoured your family
Back until end
Treason is the reason for my poison years
'Cause when it all comes down
They never ever listen to the man
Hand me over and hand me down
Yo, get at 'em dog
People wander aimlessly
I sit alone and think of darkness while the sun is raised
From a former life that we'd rather not hide
First Born, DTay we hard hitters combined
Or leave well enough alone and let bygones be bygones
Ignorance and understanding
The lessons I've taught weren't the lessons I learned
And drain the consciousness from my mind
Tonka toy permanent permit for demolition
While cavemen still though that the earth was flat
How the fuck do you figure
Of gods that close their stake in hand to fight vampiric habits now
Cast out for nefarious ways
Squamous god encoils the onyx shrine,
Can't the girl just shut her mouth
If you need revenge then dig
Cure me and my producer calls my music a bunch of noise
And talkin' all the while
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Hed finally be prepared
God created the heaven and the earth
Got to reach out, got to sync up, build up, get up, to a stronger foundation
With empty words
Pasty skin and heroin
Obscured by the sun
I have no friends you still actin' up
I feel lost in a familiar way, another memory I can't explain
You had such a good love, sugar
They kept me in the deep end
Where were you when the war began
Don't you drink  the water of the earth
That the cream cannot help but always rise up to the top
This is war
After all you're not a fool
Covered faces,
Your graveyard eyes unseeing
IMF dirty MF
sempre ragione tu
And I can't provide the right type of
Tombigbee, Tombigbee, help me hang these bones
'Cause I'm trailing her tears
I'll try to love again
You'd have to kill me to take me down
No It's far better to die like a man on your feet than to live forever like some slave on your knees, Lilly
I'd rather be alone
When the night falls you know who you are
Everything in sight, all through the night
You say you want things to be even and you want things to be fair
Then I got me some equipment
But if you wanna get well then why the hell do you hesitate
Now clever feet that flicker like fire
This oven's kind of burning
Spells scrawled in blood and frosty rime,
In this life
And on the second floor is the Macintosh Man
She's gone gone gone
Que pisaste mil tormentas y siempre te has salvado
Swallow me, then spit me out
Dominance over women, racism and threats
Is this love or is this hate
It's your boy Pipelaya
In the planet and out through the opposite ends
Que son posibles que tienen llave
Put in boxes, placed on the wicked shelf
Elevate the zone, ain't no fiction
I'm not into Jailbait but my girlfriends only seventeen
And my friends all tell me but my friends all lie
Something you hide
And give me all the simple things
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing to me
There are so many things
Look, she dresses Look at her a mess, what do you see I don't know
Reasoned but with reasoning life only echoes mine
Oh be a man
To ever get back again
Let you back in my life
And I'll be singing it out
Permeated, soaked in darkness
With the rest of the mess that you made in your chest of drawers
To make you say the things you do 
Sometimes I try the late night dial
Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock
"He's so cute" 
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
And I die a little more
Vararenkaan kaulaani pujotin,
I am not your pretty thing
We took everything in sight, all through the night
This time I refuse to die
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
Didn't go your way
Start slimin' up the walls, leave him in his draws
I could not believe it
For you there is but one direction
No huggin' trees today
Don't blame me for sinking the ship
Picture time as before where you slept through it all
Steady when you're treading, careful not to fall in love
Undead, motherfucking, time to ride, ride
Ad libs for about  seconds before fade
An English boss is a monster, an Irish one even worse
I'm going down with up interest
﻿Buy a pack of squares
And this is more or less a morbid test of sordid stress
A restless reaction to what I witness
This is a call instilling fear in all
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out
And how this pedestal fits like glove
No sleep till he's kicked right out of town
The fight was only mine
I'm sitting here figuring and wondering why
Heads of state who ride and wrangle
You exit from the heat
Come and go to summon hope with cryptic, fake glamour
Nothing's working x
Yeah baby you look great 
Day the Earth caught fire
The sun shines red
Kick you on the run now
But I can not stand it anymore
May come apart
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
To love you
Name this for me, heat the cold air
Got green lights in front of me
Don't care how great you are
And I'm right right, you're wrong left
'Cause no one cares if you're a man
See Trix are for kids, and boo I'm too old
Police can make me under stress
I see the way you go and say you're right again
Sie ist ubergossen mit leicht entflammbaren Mitteln und warten auf den Todessto��
"Now, there's Bobby Taylor sitting there, and seven times he's asked me for a date
But now you've no choice in this carnival game,
Make you move like an animal
die mich auf diesem Track storen, wegburnen
Over and over and you wouldn't talk about it
You say it was your father
International loan sharks backed by the guns
I'm not the way I used to be
Wake up, wake up, wake up right now
I'm running with my eyes closed
To keep their guns from firing rage restrained
Si dejas atras la pregunta de como saldran
The whole room was swirling
Quit making up stories, ah, give me a break
As tears fall like the summer rain
Take your time please remember
'Cause I am just a bastard
Backbone
You don't need nobody you're the littlest man
I don't care what you say,
Whether enemies exchange negative energy
I couldn't even step out the baby blue Bonneville
Watch the scene 
Why'd ya do it she said, why'd you let her suck your cock
I'll stab you through your fucking temple with a floorboard
Just take your time and do it with enthusiasm
To another place it ain't worth these tears
Heart breakin', money makin', earthquaking, love fakin'
I used to love your every little every little thing
Sie muss sich mit ansehn wie die 
Go, man, you go
Let's ride all day all night
I'm hiding from the things they say
How can I please all of your needs
But y'all wasting your time I got you haters figured out
Broken up, deep inside
'Cause she's gone gone gone
Chances are you've cursed this again
I always knew you were pretty with all those scratches on your face, look
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
Trickling onto wraithcarved stone,
Teachers are my friends so why do they make me stand
One day it's gonna be to late
While Dr Dre videotapes you hell yeah
And never have to see your face again
They will plunder all your dreams
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
Silence, silence all sides
Throw you away
Call it what you want, 'cause I'm comin' from the coroner
All the things you learned too young
Under a Beirut, under a Beirut Moon
You'd better spend it fast
Ooh, ooh, ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride
I wonder if the spell we're under
What time's the ceasefire
Clementine Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive But I'm just a fuckedup girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind; don't assign me yours
How you feel, what you think of me
And it got a little rough,
Like a weapon kept concealed
Nouse luontoni lovesta 
The dark down road of his approach in constant rain was drenched
Victims of war, seeking some salvation
Did you teach this little child these curses on my soul
Never let me down
We write songs like letters
The flames burned out, still embers glow
I say things that I don't really mean
You can't intimidate men like me
I hate myself I want to die
That love again
"She was selling speedboats in a tradeshow when he met her"
Long as they take care of you
Go fuck the world because I can
This is not an ordinary war 
Another life, another night
But not enough for you to get off your ass off the floor and do it
Too afraid of anything you may not have seen before
Don't you turn away
I will wait until the end
I have fangs fucking  inches long
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
You are the pain
That leave you in the dark nigga
Go fuck and fuck and make a buck
Reconstruct
Will ever be broken
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
Broken like a train disaster, I've had enough,
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain
Offrad pa maktens altare
She can hear the water rushing underground
In the Afghan hills, the rebels still fightin
It's coming round again
Y no recuerdas que tus botas nunca te fallaron
And say the right things to keep 'em all inspired, it's ill
Your dick it would be shrinking 
And while they treat my group like dirt,
The air is thick and the place is packed
Oh, heh, how considerate of you to come in and order five minutes before we close We already shut everything down, and cleaned it all up But we'll go right ahead and fire those grills back up, just for you, champ
I fuckin' love you
Disturbed, I'll grab her by her beak
But this ain't no headtrip honey
I hate this song
I can see all the veins in my lids when I close my eyes
Although I still bleed
Some never find what their looking for
Is in the fight of their life
The new leader of the world will be one of us
And your face will blur and fade away
Karaoke losers, microphone abusers
A union scarred by bitterness
You will not get it without a price
Chick Come on, baby, come on
Here alone in this place, here alone in my bed
So shut up and swallow
You just know  that's the new shit
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in
But that's so hard to believe
Someone say surrender so I sulk
Cyberhead punch in your code then you can go
I'ma break it down turn this world around suckers
Got my microwave plastic wrap heating up my clit, wooh
Some say, they wanna shoot the game
All alone, I fade to nothing
I need you like a hole in the head
Hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter
My drunken belligerence
Feel me, feel me
Well, I'm here to remind you
All this ugliness above me how much more can we take
Don't call me your friend, won't you understand I don't need
For your friendship to end 
See through the news and views that twist reality
Heroine just loves her 
You don't realize that in a year's time you'll be over this
I'm everything
Political scum, Political scum
Are you ready boots
When someone disrespects you
I'd better get the boys round
And even I am alone
It's the darkest place like beneath the stairs
Perche lo fai non rispondermi se non vuoi
Upper class
I hate
Put his face in the mud
Guess he'll never go home
Destruye a aquel con tu instinto de asesino
Sometimes I hate myself for thinking twice
Feel life the sweet life
But I'm backed by the Dungeon Family
You love to pass your time
No time for all these games
Breath on command
Welcome back my friends
I don't want to run and hide
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow
When they review the debut
We're rising up to show the world our scars
We already dead ain't nobody getting out
Truth and fiction must collide someday
And I'm not alone
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
perche lo sai che io vedo con gli occhi tuoi
You can't make it fit when it works like this if it becomes a job
They like oh god there go t double
I ain't splitting nothing with nobody homie I gotta give me me
Baseball bats
I'll never forget you,
It comes alive
Perhaps my raps will paralyze a bitchass and make him collapse
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers and made them drop his coffin
Don't just walk away unlock the chains from your heart
Nothing left to say, soon I'll fade away 
I saw my father smile a smile he tried to hide
This all would work out right
Tell me what's the problem, is there something I can do
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
Ya get outta line and TIP gon' like they aim
Another bloody election
Till death kicks in your face
I crack jaws and swing swords of the ancients
I want to take these little minutes and try to find myself some space
I can't breathe
They are surplus to societies needs
I'm tired of this fight
Stand your ground
"Well here's a boy if ever there was
You read between the line
Our golden sun will rise
Breaking forties on the concrete
Can't save your house god burn your soul
Your brainless, y'all don't wanna test Vinnie Paz patience
Why things were like this
telefonarti o uccidere
Why don't you set it aside 'cause he's got nothing to hide you just put him down
It holds the answers
The snakes in the grass get caught by the rattles
Same day same life
That you fucked up
So sick of your games, I'll set your truck to flames
Lighting up the night sky
Is still to be humane
As you fell on your face I had to laugh at you
The last white point star is a trap for the Master
I took the low road I took the slow road
I feel so scared
I guess that's just the way I liked it
This life is sick I don't know why
Wish I could turn around
Cross my heart hope not to die
Beyond the witchsong, darkly sweet,
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
No one now is getting dead
Hey, ladies, when your man wanna get buckwild
You have to leave me alone
perche ti dai come un angelo in agonia
Are you trying to get even with the past
I show them my mask
And I'm getting sick of their shit too
Brother, Friend, it's not like I want this to end
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen
Mascarada, incontrolavel
Through another day of the drunk unknown
And grin with foul teeth and skin, when you go to bury daisies
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
I've got a bone to pick
Just another pierced goon of little faith
And when you close your little eyes
And I'm going straight to hell
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
I'm so alone
Look over your shoulder
Fill my bed with LEOPARD FUR
weil ich mitleidig zuseh' wie dein Style in Schutt und Asche fallt
Spinning out of control 
Fair unbalance, Foxy Fox,
Too much government control
Hey, hey, hey, ain't no comin' back, baby, ain't no comin' back
With a smile
Forever and a day
Profit off the poor, fight the power
I'm gonna try and be okay for you
False gestures too much makeup 
Oh, don't mind any pain  it gives me wisdom
They take away your name
Why can't the girl just shut her mouth
So you got it
Get away get away get away now
se todellinen puoli
Away from every little thing I have
Get a hold of your cock, get stoned on my hash
And your Frederick's
Friends have their lovers
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
Turn on the lights, paint me a tapestry
So many things
You wonder to yourself how come that man hasn't burned out
Don't you dare steal my air 'cause I care
He's so cute 
After every show
Hope they know that around me talkin' about what you got will get you hit
I'll hold on to what I have and never let go
Wake up in the harsh day light
Then we hit these niggaz spot up with fifty rounds
He signed away his youth
If I could smell your words
Well they refused to see the change in me
I don't care how great you are
For whom it concerns
A trade of bottle dreams
No shut the fuck up
And sometimes I don't even want to be alive
I wish I could drive all night
The white light that opens the doors
Sun and moon will never shine I can't go on I apologize
I've given everything to you
A few bridges were burned while your backs been turned
It's just a little bit of ghetto blasphemy
I feel around me
That made him wanna draw an X across his last name
To suck in one good breath and scream,
Theocratic agendas breeding fear from hate
Swirling all around you
Then the unnamed feeling
They call the revolution
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
So, come on, little cowboy
Why did you leave me
With speeches you repeat that mean a lot to you
Ain't but three comin' back
Upon blood and soil
You see the rest they lookin' like they need a rest
Am I the type of guy
No, no, it's cool I don't even wanna go home Especially not after a twelve hour shift with no lunch break My reason for living is to serve YOU
Shake your hand and kiss your ass
'Cause every night has a day
Call my man again and I'm a fuck you up
When we've had enough
I'm not yours to control
Friend you'd better think again
I'll cut you up, gouge out your eyes
I start to choke, break in half 'cause I can hear the battle sounds
Lived life to extreme
I don't understand why
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ain't no comin' back
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do
I feel so exposed
Lookin' like the jack is back
Now that it's all been seen
The girls won't ride me, and the boys won't fight me, so my self esteem has hit an all time low
I don't give a fuck, keep giving 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up You get no love
Now I'm the terrorist see how it feels
You stink like shit and smile through it
Oh papa you'll have to come across
I can't go on forever turning my cheek
But you know that I would rather take you home
We gon get to the bottom of this shit if it takes all night
I'm trying to find a better way, but I'm trapped, can't get away 
Last year, Valentine's day, you would spoil me, you say
Which almost never comes
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
The street brawler stomp your face into the back of yo' head
And the sad thing is I want you
The power of the trucker comes from his truck
And his violent hand
Unearth the voyeur
You own it, you better never let it go
"But it's also about, one's own selfrespect"
Act like you don't give a fuck though
The last of a family of filth
I got HU tatted on the front of my arms
And Dre is back from the CPT
You're losing control
The mattress hit, the mistress fooled
I hate the world, the birds, the flowers and the squirrels
Something, to moisterise my soul
I refuse to die
Quando tu    metti in moto come me      senza te
But lets keep that between me and you
When it all comes down
Converting the world claiming your word is law
I can't believe that I ever thought
But to me its just another tale from the darkside
Me if you feel it
Deine Raps sind stillos wie Sandalen mit wei��en Tennissocken
But they didn't tell him
There is no love left inside of me
The mm went <pop> to the temple
And I hate myself
That gets me, the only one
Burning marijuana and take the time to hug a tree
Shackled to the slimesmeared bleeding stone
That's a fact got a fear on their bozack
Walking home on a lonely street
Now what a fool are you
Southside tell me can you feel me
Haha and we are the best
Just enough to want him
Yeah, put the dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
It's the rage, I know that you are hunting
Tell me where to start, think I'm at the end 
But most of the time I really
My knees are weak
Was geht denn mit dir ab Ich bin 'n MC, der sogar Promis flasht
There'll be no sorrows left to drown
Now simple feet that flicker like fire
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
But there's no such thing
You are the fire
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
A princess' work is never done
One step forward and two steps back
Frustration isn't helping, turning black, decisions suck,
Faded and fell to the ground
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean streetbrothers
Though the words have changed,
Wipe Ammonium Nitrate across the side of ya face
Buddy Dann war' der Track doch zuende, war' doch schade drum
Dan heeft ie talent, fans, wordt geerd als een vorst
Around six of the glorious
He's looming like, like the god of blunder
And said "My boy you're just protoplasm"
And it's looking right back at me
When you're driving through the night
So come let's drown ourself and end this nightmare
So the name of your family tree lives on
I guess superpowers control for a reason
Then my soul slips away
If you're invading this space
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
'Til he chopped off the head of a visitor's child
I cannot sleep in this downfilled world
Have him sign the documents
Don't tell me how to sing my song
I am the guilt living deep in your soul
Lil Wayne Khaled I got ya
But there is really nothing left of
Would you like to try a double bacon burger with a shake
I see you watchin
Better looking less of same I'm on my way to up the road to the next thing
How can you think straight when you've had to much  in excess
Step back, heard your point of view
Till death do us part
There's nothing behind it
I would even be here if the walls were caving in 
My selfish ways are out of control
The size of my game
Verbal abuse I get into trouble
He promised her everything
Miltein hermojeni hallinan ma menetin,
Building cities in the desert Cities in Antarctica Cities on the moon
Du spielst dein Spiel, doch dreimal war einmal zu viel
We don't need your war
There's someone who needs you
I, I, I'll never forget
And as the silence breaks
Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic ways
Oops, for all the lies you told
The memory of his last retort
And on the way I grabbed Sole and Mia
For crying out loud
Why do veterans get no respect
Shut the fuck
I'm sorry that it comes down to this 
And I can't breathe
And God saw the light, that it was good
Remembering your face again
Are these not words of heresy,
Oh Lily, I don't want to die, we've got so much to live for
I don't know the face
So baby why are you so deep in there
Run away, I've got to
And I'm caught in between your lies
One more time, I'm gonna need you, I can tell
An Iraqi babies with a GI Joe father
In my life
Like Darth Vader takes a Sky walker
Been gone
Your arms around me tight, everything it felt so right
Move to the music
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap is tight but I'm
Tot ik genoeg op heb voor een volgende stap
Father forgive me for my sins
Oh, what is gone
I just need to, get on with my life
We're the only ones left
That withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
Before the sun sets on the situation
Oh baby you look great 
Tell all the children in the arms of their mummas
It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with
You go your way and I'll see mine
Your ego cursed you till you bled
When I am dreaming
Before I call for a face to face
Another day disappears
He goin' 'round town
Touch gloves take your corners and come out fighting when the bell rings
This fable of elements
"Babe, I love you, love you babe I swear"
Kill the best and buy the rest
Bush has got his upper cut
pero lo sai che io vedo con gli occhi tuoi
Also, entschuldige bitte, das was du hier ablieferst, das soll tanzbar sein
Cocktail parties, personal talkers
The walls are closing in on me
Hatred is the name
We're only giving a fuck
Y'all motherfuckers don't know how to act
I took the chance, I paid the bill, I nearly died for this music
We've got something against the words
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him
More cars and endless car parks 
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
I fucking hate you; I'll take your drawers down and rape you
Got a need for the ritual
There's still a withered soul that now filled to the brim
I wish that we could just get back in line
Would you capture it or just let it slip
He won't confess, no
Getting down, getting down, we have to make it now
Don't give her water
Big mouth, big money
This tainted love you've given
Oh, what is gone, yeah
I made a promise but I broke it every day
So we keep it on till ya comin' home
They don't care 
I've got your frequency but I won't make the call
You're lying inside me
When you hear 'safe sex' you snicker under your breath
Give your ground, or try your best to please
I found a ship to sink
Yeah you're cheating on the outside, doing anything you choose,
Instincts with imprinted cryptic code
Oh, yeah
We see right through your display
Yeah I run it with killas homie, so what
Oppression is king
Scattered thoughts and scattering masses
Never think to censor the pride inside
I can take the fight
You think I'm vulnerable to your pressure tactics
I hope I'm crazy
They stick their tongue out when they bow they head Cause We Da Best
Find satisfaction on the island where I live
I bet you never thought this could happen just for pissing me off
The man isn't live and direct GET AT EM BILL
I could never believe you'd do me in
All my friends try to tell me I'm the greatest
Got an overload of hate
A dotted line hit return dash dash
Lost, ran at my own cost, fearing laughter, scoffed
My love you make me
No one's gonna give a fuck when I die
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him no
Oh, ain't no comin' back, ain't no comin' back
Stare into the eyes of blood,
The turnin' point from which things could never be the same
And show he wasn't scared
I can tell by the weight in your face that you can't be trusted
And it hurts, but I'm pushin' you away
Ich ertrage es schon viel zu lang, oh, viel zu lang
Tin soldier
How fuckin' stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
But when Brits get caught they're left to rot
I'm raw lightning my power extends
You gotta get up and fight
 thunder in the heavens
I don't mind if it is your day that I spoil 
Lost time behind 
No more love yous
How did me become man,
It would not undo what I have done
No one 'til somebody hates you
I don't need a license
I held her claws as we walked between the headstones
I'm running from the maladjusted boy I used to be, 
"Nowhere to run to, baby Nowhere to hide"
I was helpless but still you pulled me in
Will be forgotten as soon as its done
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way
I'm the one you've mistreated
It's never been, will never be a picnic
'Cause I'm running from these things on me
I drink I smoke I fuck
As we move toward a new world order
You try a pharmacy instead
What the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my life
I will never be dependent again
I just want to tell you that I'm really feeling bad
Since the last look in our eyes
Another night, another life
Grief's the mother of invention
Dawn of a new day
So come on
Instructions are haywire
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teetertotter
But I am the reason
Irish and German
How many times do I have to tell you
The emptier, the easier to break
Fuck the world nigga ain't nobody getting out alive
Chances are usually not good
Simulating your last breath
Cause your eyes will betray
And everything you are is on the ground
Bring that shit back in
Who was around when the world was falling down
"I'm going to miss you, my brave little cowboy"
Oh Tonight I Don't want to sleep alone
Where were you when they screamed your name
Cock back the hammer and just shoot nigga
Let's just fuck our brains out my love
You'll die quickly, when we apply all fifty
You are the storm
In time everything grows stale and old
A fading hope now lost in time
Meine Methoden kommen krasser als Chirurgen mit Kaffeetatter
God saw the light, that it was good
Crushed by myself  I come undone
He suffers this desert heat
Your mind has decided
And what the fuck you know about being in danger
Come and show me how, boy
Oh, Another face joins the crowd
And watch it blow up, blow up, tell me How you gonna see her now
He's been high on a young girls vibe
A chick like me, I got to live
Wir waren beide jung, ich hab dir verziehen
I'm not a nice person
Spilling family secrets out to flunkeys and castrato walkers
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
And gave it to a bird with nothing in her beak
It's not that I hate you,
Your own scene
The great spring of life runs dry
Be ashamed of this fact
Said, 'What man'
I hate myself I want to die
I whispered in her ear just to glare inside the fences
And I'll be holding your hand
I thought these tears were gone
You pick me up, to put me down
Is something, something that, something that, you'll never see
I just can't stand your apathetic motion
I was one of the Prozac people 
Rather stand alone than divided
Sharp eyes
You are the good
One more time, I'mma spit at you some shit
To see our life's work in your constituents clout,
You've been led on
Every body has its price
"My name is James Connolly  I didn't come here to die
Right to smoke in it's place
I'm sick of seeing you around this town, oh
Hast du's kapiert, dass du das Battle verlierst
You don't see eye to eye with anyone
'Til you died but you're still alive
I've saved shining scars
Your words are like a gun in hand
This time you're asking why
Leaves are changing seasons of my
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
"My name is James Connolly, I didn't come here to die
Gotta get outta Los Angeles
Es hat noch nie so weh getan
A gun to your head
Konepelti on kylma kun silla makaa
Put me in a homemade cellar, put me in a hole for shelter
You see me burning like the sun in your eyes
A victim of romanticide, that's me
Oh, ain't no comin' back, baby, oh, no, no, ain't no comin' back
Political scum Political scum
When you walk out the door
This is a rich man's world
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors
You keep saying you got something for me
J'veux de l'amour, j'veux de l'amour, in die hel
There's a whole wide world for you to see
And your perfume and your smile
Oh baby doesn't that feel right
Put to work to destroy
Scrap wit no doors, four walls tighten
'Cause it's just another one of his
If I gots to kill a nigga but I'm always down for the one on one
Foot, foot, foot, foot of pride come down
Every heartbeat closer to the last
Ravening fiends unleashed to feed,
And you need it too
Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper
A love repressed,
Keep my hostile thoughts to myself
But my heart keeps telling me, "Don't trust you"
Take a look at where your money's gone seen
Our currency is flesh and bone
But I am still waiting
Always
Leggero ed impassibile 
So am I still waiting
Oh feed your children on Cray fish and Lobster tails
Repented all my sins to scientists that came in a dream,
Vicious lies that terrorize
So you wanna go to bed with me 
No wonder that we shoot each other
Als ik kots in de goot, onder 't kwijl, hallef dood
And the curse I curse is the worst it gets
Daddy's gonna die  wave byebye
We killin' so efficiently, we can't keep count
Came in the world thuggin' leaving with big nuts
In a million different ways
I'm at a loss to tell you what I need
I do the "getting rid of"
Deal with people that just like to complain
Come to the light hang on to this arm
I used to stand so tall, I used to be so strong
Emanating from within
You were blood that's all
To suffer the penalties for speakin' the truth
"And God said, Let there be light"
But I'll never understand
Come over here, sit down, I've got somethin'
The bells and bombs, we'll fight them off
All alone, I hear you calling
Sie hasste mich 
And I can't even bring myself to try and figure, 
Pushy mother, lost brother in real hot pants
Decapitate and shit down your neck
I'm selfish, my needs are quite great
I think it's time for you to
And you are the storm that's raving me
You don't come home to me
Sometimes you gotta cross that line
Become men again,
Everybody tryin' to get their hands on the same green
Raw paws won't stop these dancing feet
And don't let them fool you with their milk and honey
Always stuck in a daydream
Got somethin' to burn, and love to waste
I punch through the wall as I break my fist 
In my weakened state, I could fall for you
I woke up in the darkness and I tried to see the clock; it was AM
Confront the investor
Who's black  don't wanna role  sells his soul
'Cause my manager is a bigger douche than you could ever be
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
Davvero come deflagrasse un mondo
I'll be cold walking through the backbay flinging bricks
And my escape became my only game
'Cause I got to knock you out
Things can get drastic
For the day which never comes
Go fuck the world because you can
In front of a class of gawking fools who'll never understand  They never understand
Fuckin' with the hard hitters, DTay my nigga
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
I don't mind if it was your day that I spoilt 
Melting ice and rising waters
Running a book on which of them is going to last the week
No one hears
But my will is stone
I ain't scared to go
And I suffer from this deadly disease
Throughout the veins of the night 
We've had enough
To look inside to see what's comin'
And the businesses that burned us all
This ape is crazily arrogant and out of control
You love me like an angel, but you treat me like a fool
Fuckin' up the sandbox since I was seven
Maybe one day, I'll trust you
Maybe I'm the same, nothing to take me higher 
Let's root
You can wiggle you can jiggle your tongue on my clit
Oops, there goes the time we spent away
Aw shit baby, are you married
See go to war nigga, hard hitters we buck wild
I'll call you a mother fucker
Isn't funny how some people never practice what the preach
Eradicate, ravage your being
Talk is talk, and talk is cheap
But inside your heart it is black, it is hollow and it's cold
You cry alone and then he swears he loves you
Flowers are for romance, here the fun begins
No constants
It's a contest
So let 'em all kill each other
You still playin' games
And you say that you've had a vision of enlightenment
"It's about individuals, it's about all of us"
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Tombworms bloat on carnal blood,
Learned enough
I'll be singing
No need for talking, have my dough
It just sits inside so it burns and burns 
The more I'm pushed away
Is this your only way to survive
His hands are flippin
And nothing could tear you apart
I'll take the Morningstar
Maybe I'm just losing my mind
To ever believe you want be wit' me
Feel his dreams through us
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five
And you have the nerve to tell me that, as a mother, you think that I ain't fit
Which I cherish in my heart of hearts
Sometimes I wanna fly far away from here
When our love is gone, we will be calm
Peace  They fought and fell and died and never came home
If you're lying there expecting me to suck your dick
Such a pity I built no ladder from the roots
'Cause when the press loves you and the people don't respond
All you gotta do is set it baby
Wish I could just forget
A demo from an eight track
No non ce la fai piu
Whenever you try to creep through
Don't touch me, please
Never facing it, straight on
Just loveless, loveless, loveless
Smoke filled rooms make me blind
The pain has gone numb
Yeah, there's always one 
Kill the dog
I've lost the feeling, it's dead skin
We loving the broads, there's nothing to applaud
In a pretty picture on my wall
Forgotten what you waited for
It comes down to you and me
I've found safety in this loneliness
So you better let him know that
Chances are you've cursed this
I know I'm a reasoning guy
'Cause your karma's in trouble
On an outta work coked up, A&R guy
If we come at lunchtime, we afternoon killers
Is somebody there to catch my fall
Give me money, buy me clothes
It's that fourfour on the floor
Of the people you once esteemed
This calamine lotion made our skin feel good
All that was given me I choked it all away
You a homo you a trick silly faggot ass bitch
Boulevard brass knuckles in the back of the car
She was young and she didn't know
No I won't stop I just rock and I battle your whole clique
Ah, I feel better now
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Some days fine, others out of my mind
Yo, but Dre's a nigga with nothin' to lose
No love lost, no love found
Obliteration of mankind
Of the mess you left when you went away
I'm feeling tired
Yeah yeah yeah
Rich bitch, sugar daddy, whizz kids, city boy
By the bleeding stone I am enraptured by ophidian eyes
This could be your last chance
It's some real motherfuckers goin' rot tonight
" miles to their homebase, Compton"
But I will run with you
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks
Your best friend today
How did you make your fortune 
So you wanna go to bed with me 
Takes war to make us live free
I've got breakneck delivery
I am the human scientific process
Move you move like an animal
Her and the troops are right behind me
I'll get the guns, the drugs
Don't wanna be that guy
I got so many men that they all standing in line
Or a rainy Arabic wine
Better bring a stretcher when you come down here
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
Scan apartment
Ora che sono
I'm tuning in, turning on, and tuning in
Wraiths and fiends whirl to my bidding
A superpsyochotic need
Drive through a brick wall, pull the parkin' brake up
What's my name DMX and I be the best
Now the working classes are obsolete
Another chance
And LA kids who will dance to the gun
Joina sa syytit sun perhetta
That can make things clearer
To outride the Armageddon
But I don't care, you know why
That's right You don't hurt me
I've got a chemical infatuation
Ah, Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed
They pave the way for every second of the day
Probably twenty years
And I don't want to remember last summer in June
I sat and took it almost every time,
Philipp Ich hab kein Bock mehr, kommt, wir vertragen uns
How could you let me down
Shut the fuck up
And it feels so real
I was one of the Prozac people
It is sad to be alone
Eeeeeenough
That's the debt you got to pay
Then burn the flag down
I am very sorry that we got your order wrong
Iiii, I know the meaning of life
As a child
You're not the one impressed
Y'all ain't ready fo this shit we finin to crash da mutha fukin' club dawg
Go buck and fuck and make a buck
'Cause I've been eyeing you ever since
Lost in limbo like pink shit camouflaged in a pig farm
The war on terror is a war on peace
Turning star projections
es jagt dich weiter durch die Nacht
Happy robots say "life is fine", they're the ones I loathe
The facts that astound you
And I think, I think she's alright
He joined up for just three years
The moon is just a stone
You been lying and there ain't no believing
Of paradise she dreamt with, the tears she can't contain
So I went to Neiman Marcus on a shoppin' spree, ah
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck
Ready to blow this bitch up at the drop of a dime
Shine out ends
e piu che non ci sei e piu che voglio te
To show he cares
Into your fucking throat
But who the hell am I cursing those whose skin
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
With honestly needing
You're crossing the line
Take my life away or give back the answer you hold
These places all I ever think about is lost in time 
You can accept celestial facts about short attention spans
Got a union too, everything can move
Now, some of us do but most of us don't that's just how a nigga feel
Makes nightmares out of pretty dreams
Recuerda cuando creiste perderte y te encontraste
But I'm likely to ride
Someone find me, please, losing all reserve
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the Gcode
On that hydro so high so I don't know where the time goes
That'll clown when it's time for the showdown, better slow down
And it cut me like a blade
What that mean is that a tell a nigga byebye and pop him in his right eye
Yeah once, once is real conniving, it's easy now,
A Philistine is what she is, She'll do wondrous works with your fate
Accidenti a questa vita che corre come un treno
"Hush your mouth you hypocrite"
Lets ride yeah everybody gonna die
Where my niggaz ready for war we right here
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come
But here we still remain
And a voice in distant thunder
And there I stand in the middle, and I was
In the south they saw my anger and my tears and my despair; they saw my mood swings
But once you lose your grip on time
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
If you thought things had changed
It's a revolution you know we can't be denied
Mannequins and skeletons, cities and dustbowls
I'll put it in black and white
And God divided the light from the darkness
And I speak the truth when I say
She believed him
You're getting used to the sickly, thick fog of indifference and you think that's all right
Ik babbel met de gast die mij een glas aanbiedt
Burn, ya burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack, uh
I hate my generation
Drink and smoke upon his breath
Because I'm black flagging
There ain't a fight and it doesn't mean a goddamn thing
It ain't the first time baby
quando sei     disperato       come me      senza te
Lost time behind
Come sway this way
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head
You're making me want to end this 
Money outweighin', problems on the triple beam
Alles wird herrlich und prachtig denn der Tag des Herrn wird alles
I rap like no one out there can fuck wit me Prodigy
That's right You don't hurt me And I don't need you No more Don't want to see you No more
You don't get more points for all your suffering
It was a slap in the face, how quickly I was replaced
Malte Der Lied ist sowieso zuende
That conflict with anals, that believe in angels
You both mean shit to me
In the HARM WAY, we do it the war way, all day
You may own half a city
Become men and then
We're in this together and through it all
So save your breath and the money you spent
'Cause I'm a nigga known for havin' a notorious past
vahan parempi
This is dawning of the age of the animals
Step back, now that I know you
It feels like a broken bird
Mask in my hands
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
I don't want you to hate me
Who done did some time and wanna mitch new figures
Lets be perfectly clear boys and girls
Geh jetzt, oho, nur diesmal fur immer
Just another shooting star
Pastoral scene of the gallant south
She can see the birds living in the leaves with their fucked up, fucked up language
I've seen them rise and fall
Sink her to the level of the rest of us that inhabit the earth
And write raps to the sound of these gats
Until you reach your timely demise
As you slip inside the tomb
Degenen die, zoals ik, werken op 't sentiment
"There's number three just by the door"
My eyes are filled with pride
If you give me just a second I can fix it in a jiffy
They say things to you, because they want things from you
Landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
'Cause I freeze with my hands on a hot hood
We don't mind
Yeah what's John writin' 'bout the revelation
You can smoke one to the head to this
Khaled man call this bruce lee
I've tried to see it your way I've tried to see it your way
It's you I hope for
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm
No one's gonna give a shit when I die
This soil is dripping with the blood of angels
It's a false state of elation, you can join the Prozac nation if you want to
The days are too dark
There's no one to protect you
All we get is censored news
Only you know, only you know different person
Mann, dein Reimbuch ist fur mich nichts als Toilettenpapier
But I'm gonna get off
He come to me
Is there something inside 
Don't you dare and steal my air
perche non vuoi che il mio amore ti porti via
Bitter resentment that rocks you to sleep
It's cold when you are down
In the name of your dead be strong
Cars crawling in the road
You are the anger
Watch them take the poison that drives them all insane
But hey that's life
And snatch up our childhood
Be it your best friend or your uncle or your lover 
Is anybody else here sick of this shit
You ain't drunk mutha fuka
Words fool me
I will conquer
I'll surrender what's inside
Leaving scars and fucking stars
This time is different
I'm liberated "So we say that we recognize that freedom is indivisible"
Waiting for the end
Du denkst, du bist der krasse Held, wenn dann nur bei der Mullabfuhr,
But don't let them wrap any green flag around me
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
I really would die to see
You're messing with a guerilla
With the twinkle of an eye
Find a school near the top of the league
Stay hood, stay rasied on the streets
And why your talk is always cheap
Stupid human scum
And on this dark night of my soul 
How many people does a smart bomb kill
You have a right to your dreams
See I work so hard just to get ahead
There's a place where time stands still
Them drag you out the yard niggaz
No direction, my compass is broken
Stop messing
And in this honesty you'll see
When was your last confession
That you're live that in the night
I want to relive little minutes, but they just keep stacking up on themselves
In their on way
And we need it now
The sound of drums
Fuck your love songs
Say we won't lie to ourselves like those bastards you swear
I'm not moved that much but what I just heard moved me to the left
Last of the timelords once again
If I would shed my skin, the layers left
In the light of miscegenation
And that'll leave you brokenhearted
Wie lang ist das her, ist schon die nachste dran
You call me your best friend
And God said, Let there be light and there was light
Bom bom here's what you get an M and a kevlar vest
So save your breath, you kiss me like a guillotine
I think I should do a come on let's
And I know we're all goin' out to get slaughtered, but I just can't take any more
Are you upward bound or will you burn in hell
Hey, ladies
By living all the same way
This is what I feel, ooh, this is what I feel
For the storm that tries to shake my roots
Explosive elements reveal
Gets him out of my head
We aim beams in between your eye brows
Can write a book about
You're a hopeless liar and a hypocrite
For this land of the dead
Stuck in your world of dreams again
Does she speak eloquently And would she have your baby
Don't hate me for what you've got
And work it good
For this world to stop hating
Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'
Till death do us part
mutta mita sina oot
Lightning in my bones
But if you get caught you're left to rot
Making it lie down
Till a bullet pierced our leader and we gave up the fight
'k Heb succes gekend, 'k heb ellende gekend
Well it all dies anyway
Well you believe what you want, but I think you don't know
You're furious, I beg you for sin
A mi delirio de asesino
Don't thank me for what you've got
When your conniving with me
But he underestimates my mind
From across the room
Be committed to emancipation
Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose
perche' un sospiro puo' affilare il taglio del rasoio
Gimme the million dollars and I'm dropping off the cash flow
Heart full of hate
Your arms beneath me
Christ mix it up baby
I come to every club with intention to do harm
Leaving scars and crashing cars
We are slaves in our bedsheets 
And I'm ready to risk it one more time
Leave me alone
I'll smile tomorrow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
In sickness and in health, 
When will you let me wake you
You don't need nobody to hold your hand
Treat yourself at leisure, relax and have a ball
You'll pick a fight with anyone
Vicious lies being heard you stand there how absurd
Tomorrow we'll ridse, so let's fight today
'Cause he's got nothing to hid you just put him down Go
He talked of how it came about
e tu se vuoi puoi nasconderti dentro di me
All her thoughts would compose a careful symphony
Zdaj ni ve bedarij
I've had enough, morning papers chill me to the bone,
One more mile to go through the dark streets
Where you can't holler none
Empty words lies from the start we stood strong never apart
Betrayed us all with your own selfish greed, your greed, yeah
Don't need the lies
'Cause if we die we still gon' be some dead niggas
Now you can rest in pieces
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn 
You own it, you better never let it go 
Cruise ich auf der Autobahn nimmst du den Trampelpfad,
And no one knows
Tearin' up everything in sight
Jogging over skulls and leg bones
Give me the real shit
It's in my head, it's in my head
PTSD and a broken back
And yes, this city is filled with people and I might just be one too
This town ain't friendly now
Ich flie��e wie ein Wasserfall, da hilft kein Rettungsring
The shotgun kicked  and it murdered motherfuckers
Take the chill off of my life
Vinnie Paz got more hoes then Jim Duggin
You don't come home to me Oh, no
Here I'll stay, in some kind of way
I won't kill or die for it
I float through dimensions
 The mind cannot mirror the soul
Deep south, way down and out, where heads hang from the trees
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon
Got a knack for knockin' all my loved ones down
An older version of me Is she perverted like me
No sleep till the location is found
Something passionate will work real well
Asshole  the shit is goin' down right now
You should be looking for the answer now
Now each generation you've got to choose a new location
I wish you lots and lots of luck
And as she walked up to the blackboard, I can still recall the words she had to say
I hate my generation yeah
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in us all
Sometimes we're all victims of depression and unrest
I think I'll stick around
I dream I work I bleed
Be the voice of a new generation
Too afraid of anything that may not
Incantations pour in torrents from my lips
The press confrences keep on lyin'
Undead, motherfucker, time to ride, ride
I would take every single prisoner out of their cages and put them back in the world;
So fuck you
mita sina oot
It's do or die, it's do or die
We don't need to talk
Eastside tell me can you feel me, whoa, oh south
riechen Typen wie du nach su��em Eau de Toilette
You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
The fuck out you wanna wet duke squirt your four
Tulvasaarekkeen keskipisteessa,
I guess that time cannot heal every wound
Hey punk In a year's time we will see
You don't know how to root
They like to take all this money from sin
Once I duct tape ya to the front of a Mack trucks, face ya
This life's like one white knuckle ride
My real niggaz, hard hitters they ride with me
Judgement and sentence the company you keep
To further burden divided friends
They gon' take you right down
Now all I have are these three fucking assholes
In everything I choose to say
That have been lied to by their men
Just tear down that wall, girl
Bleed it, Beep it, whatever you want
God knows, God knows, God knows it's been fun
When you got it
I'm a hammerhead who wants to get stopped
Well, I can't stand to feel your touch
Every move I make your ass got something to say
When pieces of him are already scattered in the attic
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't
But it's getting harder to look ahead
I didn't ruin you
Ugly joy ride 
Tried to see it your way
Forgotten the earth is our mother,
It's the way that I work, it's the way that I am,
Metaphors started menopause in your moms before you were born
I can hardly breathe, and I can hardly take it
Oops, there goes the dreams we used to say
If you want it we got it
She can hear him walking up the stairways
A slight grease fire, accidentprone at home
Butterflies of love rain on me
Wielding instruments of pain
Are you still down with me
Far into the stars, below
And you dropped the ball
It ain't a home if you ain't allowed
Breakin up a home, that's why they took Bruce Bailey down
Y'all been duckin for quite some time now
I could have lost my life
Niemand,niemand hat mir je so weh getan
Out of the darkness the wolves will claw at your door
And there's nothing you can do
Split open inside and why do I hear the birds when they're
So lie your way out of this one again
Money money make a buck
The well of the souls
I can't fuck with them overseas
Is that a quote that sounds familiar to you these days
The IT it comes and it takes me there
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference, when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
Stay hood, stay rasied in the streets
Like when children play
She knows his name The devil treads the sand
Watch your watch your watch your back
Malte Lass uns lieber einen saufen und wir vertragen uns
At the age of  he did as he was told
Xzibit's on the track
So fly the fuck away
Can you pay my bills
Lady it's your turn now
To show you who the boss nigga
Air conditioning the ice cubes, chillin' poolside
Tend to lead to mutilated daughters
It gets inside and it tears you up
You had a life that refused to wait
But something inside me seems to be lost
Raining teeth, blood and spit
One simple thing is all I ask
'Cause the slightest dilution
Won't get me far
That wisdom came from what we'd done
It has a mind of its own
For hard cash, we will lie and deceive
I've got quite a mouthful going here
I promise I'll try harder now
That you fucked up again
I used to have friends
Undead, you better get up out the way
Or is it the other way around
You dried my eyes so well
They gonna tie yo' hands
That I can take another day
Hunted you all day and night
Arrive at the apartment
Swallows up that city light
I'm big enough to be a man
Your eyes resemble Mephistopheles, in fact
Oh, oh, oh, ain't no comin' back, you know that
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Burning my skin
I don't need your money, your position or your caddy, Daddy
Another little piece of me
I bleed, I burn
And don't you worry, I am all alone
The Diva de los Muertos is just swallowing my skin
Spill your blood to save humanity
Or people in college, because I had to quit school, because I got so fucking paranoid, because after Kent State, after Kent State, I realized that I could put on a cheerleader sweater with a "I love America" pin and the people that were shooting wouldn't even aim and it wouldn't do me any good
No getting out, no question of a head start fair or fake,
To leave without saying one word
Do you want to be friends
Your life's a total mess up, why the hell do you hang around
Don't want no trouble, I got to be the boss
y lo dejaron con vida
Keep me off the road when you're around me
It's been reported you've been drinking and running around with men and going wild
They ain't showin' no love
It's growing inside me
But there's nothing more sadistic than an infant
Rope at the end of the line
So ask me please x 
You don't have to turn away
Wait, stop and see what I do next
But that's life
Turn so evil when they come in and pay
Or is it just a lie
Turn you into anything that they want you to be
Still you cut your tongue out 'cause you don't want to taste it yet
Bier trinken mit deinem Vater,
I hear the High Ones whispering ancient spells in the longdead tongues,
Adonde vas tu crees poderte escapar
Sometimes I feel like a sociogenetic experiment
Your mind decided
Then you become so uncomfortably numb
Hey punk Another rock star wanna be
'Bout music and God
In the book that your friend signed yesterday
And I'm a fuck you up, and I'm a fuck you up
They just try to live from a day to day
Reach back into your mind
In my heart
But I think it's time you learn how to use your tongue yeah
And I don't even wonder why
Hey, no comin' back when your foot of pride
See you ain't heard I hit a lick
You look so uppercrust
Selling junk only cowards will buy
And squeeze a little harder with your arms
Why do you gotta be such a dick 
Emotions of the city
All the pain inside amplified by the
Is calling me to rule the world
That if you want to get down now
Is the precious gift of my father
A heart to tradeoff,
That these blinded eyes were looking for in you
What would you do if I gave my love to you
Poison years in my mind
And maybe you could get a clue
For the blood which we dine
After everyone out there has long gone deaf
Until it's taken away
Your change of heart has come too late
The Time Lords returning
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
And fill my heart with disgust
finche non capirai
The general says we never miss a shot
Takes war to let us live free
That can fool you
Drag you to the manifold,
Shut 'cho mouth
Me and Missy, we get it straight pissin'
Sing me one more song, ha, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
Pounding the world like a battering ram
Peel the top of your fucking face off like an orange
Nothing's working x
It's my turn I'm retaliating now
From these industry fucks to these faggotass punks
Clingin to the door, quiver, cower
TV commercials for a popping pill culture
All your bones corroded and they hide inside decaying flesh
I know it won't be easy, baby
Ich werde singen und tanzen und es mir
We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
Third time
On a day like this, I'mma break my wrist when I write a little bit about the strangest kiss
It's all darkness
lei non e una via d'uscita e forse non ce n'e
Is where it will fucking stay
The rest of you could wither away and not a piece of me would care
You might come home with one less leg but this thing will surely keep a bullet out your chest
This is our time
Call my neighborhood a ghetto 'cause it houses minorities
Don't ever trust a happy man
With a measurement of lines
Back that thing up
They got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names
It's not that I hate people
Them four hard hitters nigga and we back
I didn't stutter when I said "Fuck Tha Police"
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
You've got it locked and bolted down
And you can listen or just walk away
One world  One world
Empty prayers fly through the air like burning papers
And yes, for those that love I would rip the seams
I really love the daughter
Nessuna cosa al mondo sa come si disperda
Move it to the music yeah Let's get it on
No sense in wishing no transmissions ever come this way
Perfect union
I would rather think that you were honest
But the takings are up by a third, Oh So
Fuck the world nigga ain't nobody getting out
A shallow form of life
So put your fist down until sanity can be contained
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
The whole time I think to myself, this isn't fair
If you have a racist friend 
You won't get a job anywhere
Nocoj bom vse zate naredil
Multiply the ghosts like the world's greatest coke supply
I could try an' stop you cheating but I just don't have the time;
Dissect space and time
I think about more than I forget
Stop drop
Or use your right to protest on the street
Has never seen the sorry state I'm in
Well I've nothing left to say
Di lacerata sensazione
Nobody's gonna stand in our way
Facilitate that permanent high
Should you meet your malcontent or maybe meet with an accident
Mein starres Herz,
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
Do my dirty work
And nobody knows what to do, what's your point of view
The one ashamed to be a man
I'm a dickhead, yeah, yeah
And I don't need you Don't hurt me
The room feels so cold
But nothing ever felt this good
Revenge served cold, breakfast in death bed
Brought me to a place
When in a black and white the capacity is two
It walks the earth
Do or die, it's do or die
Evil is not the lust of men
Now I run from you
Might as pay, turn away in disgust
There's a new world out there waiting
Your little half ass, direct hits
It's so safe and lonely with you
You can't change the state of the nation
I love reading the psalms to bitch actors
A straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'
As I studied hieroglyphics on her alabaster pigment
How did it come to be
What'cha niggas want, uh, uh
My baby just walked out the doors
And you're sellin' your soul
Heatin you down leavin' you six feet deep in the ground
You'll be getting your reward
All I see are daisies for miles and miles
Doch all das stumpfsinnige Geschwatz
We won't take prisoners
They don't care, no no no
At first them chicks didn't want to speak to you
Don't come down on me,
Seein the roof fall, feelin' the floors heighten
Poison coffee, diamond blood,
Sie war gegen das Leben
You got no business playing this
'Cause summer is cutting me again
And all my life, you won 't stop giving me your Jipp
Leave me alone I've got work to do
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
Straight buck foes when the nigga Ruck pull the snub nose
Let me get the manager
And stand unashamed of what you have done
When you hear him knock four times
Time and time again 
You don't wanna fuck with me today
Then you throw it away
Warum musst du standig uber Leute wie Puff Daddy lastern,
I can still hear the screaming in front of the
Or I'll have no choice but to kill
Ah, did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
You've been given a present
A bleeding romance
Tomorrow I'll be back home
Reading a book at home they know what heat is
They'll never lock us out again and here's the reason why
You never see the truth
It is so sweet I lose everything I'm lost in my mind
Mashin through the city yo, and the foot it don't lie
There's hope yet in the rain
Seus presentes nao valem tanto assim
'Cause you've had none of the answers
Except take the time to ramble
Breath life
We are breaking through without a warning
I don't care, because I'm not afraid
Sinister cynical instrument
The sum of all your fears
And that was more than I could bare
Johnny's takin' heads off of all faggots who hate
Just when lovin' gets good, you'll be gone
Your voice your voice your voice
Move it to the music yeah
I'm a rock I'm a roll I'm a shock to your soul
I can't understand a word you saying, you fuck
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere, but straight to hell
Seeing you, it kills me now
Go 'head, with your games
Now, I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way
Every rapper better fear me
Than take your bullet
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
The years just slip away
The futures stopped, do you like the view
We out here choosin' nigga
Overflowing population
I'm gonna show you
Let's get it on
Suas historinhas nao sao tao boas assim
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night
I'm running hot
I mean I'd smack the shit out you twice dog and that's before I start cursin'
Ran fast enough
As the kids who called me nigger
You niggas soft
Oh, oh, ain't no comin' back
Is ever, ever going to end
Or somebody in the club gettin' shot tonight
Where I walk hand in hand with death
It's dark, but love is so light
I hold it inside as you sleep, as you hide
We burn out before we fade away
Adrenaline intoxication
I don't need you No more
And you must die so that they may live
One crown, two kings, three wars, four more
That I can say peace and the gunshots will cease
I didn't know life was this hard
Ve se entende agora
All right
Mit deinem Mundgeruch kannst du am Bahnhof sogar die Penner schocken
All alone, I fell in you
Dicktricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'
Empathy, out of my way, I can't die
Do you want to go to heaven
A loaded gun jammed by a rose
You are the devil
He's burgundy for breakfast tight
When I look in the mirror
Yo, this song, yo
Or burn your star with  points
I had a friend one time
I've lost my light
Niggas talk about greatness whenever they speak about me 'Cause I'm out here grindin'
Still you're the only one I want
Another group of monster teenagers shot up their school today What makes them do it Video games Marilyn Manson Oh, it can't be the parents, or the fact that school sucks, or that the jocks do get patted on the head every time they beat up the weirdos and the jobs you get once you graduate from school are stupid, boring, meaningless, and a deadend to insanity
I laid my black heart on the table
And it feels like I must be blind
When it's over then you die
A pretend life in a make believe world
I'm looking high
Happen every day
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our Tshirts
I know the meaning of life
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this
Been through their big deals and smalls
Looking through the night
You step in my way, well now I have a little more to say
Look, I hope you're happy
Preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain, or was my tolerance a phase
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Jetzt sind wir wirklich wild vor Wut
I'll say again, must I still question my friends
That's when they come
They're in control now
Hate, it's more than a word
Got a lot of things to say
Fire, fire, fire, yeah, you know, so light up ya lighter
And I'm here to remind you
Then one after the other
The dogs of war don't negotiate
Dispute the suits I ignite and the watch 'em burn
Show them you are able
God I hope it's all going better for you
I heard the sound of drums
That's why we carved it in stone
Random access memory
And there ain't no engine built fast enough
'Til you died But you're still alive
Whoa now leave these niggaz shit tore down
Buddy Ach, hor doch auf mit dem Schei��, wir vertragen uns
And my dreams and there's no out that I can see
It's always easy when you have it your way 
I wasted a good conversation
I got a urge to kick down doors
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
There is no way of any hope
She's starting to yawn
Now I can be controlled
And he looks at me like a prince
He told me "Son, I've really got you now, boy"
Everyone addicted to the same gasoline
Somber thoughts of burning planets
Get away
Goodbye to the let it happen stand
Righto, let's check it out
But I hate him just enough to get off
Hey my friend I thought you knew it's all an illusion
These eyes have seen no conviction
It's cold when I release blood
Kuplassa istuen, latomerta tuijotan
Where platinum comes in eight stack, bitch
Leaves are changing seasons of my poison years
Manic thoughts
But as hard as we may buck, the king of fools is still in place and fit to rule
Would she go down on you in a theater
Your number is one
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
To a hollow kind, don't mind
The chaos that surrounds you
Your smoke alarms and barred windows
Animal vegetable illegal chemical
Mangle ripped clothing 
Party protects us and every day fades away
If you are able, sucker
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight
Make me want to get you out of this
You dried my eyes so well but still
Take a shot for nothing rather than not
Falling into nothing
Como se um copo tivesse arrastando um corpo
This is the fuckin' shit I be talkin' about
This is a sad day To none is it sadder
Left inside x
Did you ask if I minded
And so we found your car, in seconds flat
Of a subtle disease 
Digest my gospel headlines 
From the mess that you made of your life
I'm turning on, to different information;
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
Shopping like it's still December
You bring a knife to a gunfight
Give me everything you got
Today
Get your booze away from me
To guard oil rigs where the head cutters reign,
Keep pushing me and I'll stand my ground
Now point four fingers and watch through binoculars
Another night, another life
Den Herrn der sie liebte und der sie nun niederrei��t denn
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
��matare por el ��repudiare por el
I don't need a bed to hide behind, I'm laying by myself
Like old linoleum, battered and worn beyond repair
Protecting rap like the exoskeleton of a Lobster
Start up beef, we in yo front yard with gats
Drink to much, passing out
Es tan fuerte tu tormenta que fuera ves mojado el suelo
A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
And I wait for this train
Your kind are still to blame
But little did he know he'd lose a rib
You motherfuckers wanna JUDGE me 'cause you're NOT me
To be the bearer of bad news
The carnage yeah
Hit the road, Jack
It's the bird, it must have been the bird, disgusting critter, it must
I don't feel it,
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
Introduce the millennium STOMP nigga for the future
Autotuning folk punk rockers
About these poison years
What's been said has spread like fire to all
Well good morning baby, hmm welcome back to town
One world
You're making me want to end this relationship 
Hello, hello
Cause you that I always keep it true
The rappers in their limousines just want to be loved
You make me wanna run around, pullin' my guns out and shit
You don't come home to me Uhuh
The more I think, the less I've got to say I don't remember you no more
Is something I don't believe in
I'm just another face
I've paid my bills and cleaned out my closet
Daddys gunna sing you a lullaby
Around your neck
Even lands we once called home
New day new way all my friends can say
You don't have to worry, what's done is done
No one to tell you when to think
Chant slogans timed one step off beat
Still reasoning my life
Now he knows the truth
Just lies and more contradiction
There are hardly any left to penetrate
Will you profiteer or ransack with the soldiers you kill,
Can't find hope to believe
From Nashville to Chucktown we go round for round
Your pious contempt brings you closer to God
And knowing that you dug your ditch and climbed in anyway
You want another chance
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom come
Like a shadow in the night
You make me sick
Love obsolete
Who's going to do big things
Don't monitor this guinea pig for research any more; I will try again
A criminal inside of you
Development
So now I'm gonna get up
You may have enough money
Hide behind a view, gentrify it
It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight
��destruyo a aquel que se imponga sin sentido
A revolution never sends you an omen
Watch that scene
How dark it could be
Like the pain inside
Sorry son, there's nothing we can do
And you keep thinking that you'll never get burned, ha
My innocence has been tarred
Look at all these off brand niggas
I'm a cruddy nigga leave you all bloody nigga service with a smile
A foreign sense of orchid scents before I lay my skull to rest
Du spielst dein Spiel, doch drei war eins zu viel, eins zu viel
You need not say a word
Don't give a fuck
Yes, millennium shit
The time is now, the time of do or die
Ist das wie du dein Versprachen halst
I hate you so much right now
Never alone on a Saturday night
Deine Raps komm' so lastig wie 'ne Heizung mit Nachtspeicher
I'll topple the noisy creatures
To move on with me or step aside
"And I was a shaven headed seaside thug"
And pick up where we left off
Don't need to hear the truth
And I know  I know a lot of people, and I 
That's that bullshit
When you ain't got enough to get by
And next door to them is a man so mild
It's like a Pain in the Ass I'm Crushed by the longing for feeling
'Cause we drunk drive Cadillacs, we never go far
On the run, got a gun
Back home they'll remember you in papers, on TV
And no one's paying attention so I'm free to speak
A way of life
And burn like candles in smokey spires
Yet Cube, they can't fuck with the darkside
You can knock at any door
He lied to her
Pharmaceutical conglomerates just count me as a unit for their product
Then all the leaders thank the lord
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd ya do what you did
Touch my man again and I'm a fuck you up
And now my anger is my best friend
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
Here's to you, Lily, the rights of man and international revolution"
Not saying you deserve to die
A  Miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
I'm already gone when you turn your head
Tumour growing, filling life with deceit
Watch your back
On tour wearin' the same thing for a week or two
Y'all just hate, I can't take no more
Hey, ladies, yeah, yeah
Cut short your cord length on the phone
No getting up, knuckles smashing windows in my wake,
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
When you don't come home to me
Am the only one to be called
Oh well, it's dragging me under
You said nothing's to negotiate
Karma has come to claim
Smiling eyes disguise their lies
One of the few who's been accused and abused
Oh yeah, I'm so mad
You'd regret the road you chose
No rage or battlefields
We see our heads collapsing until we find some kind of space,
The weak are washing upon the shores
Blow his head back right in front of the precinct YOU HEAR THAT
They're in my head
It comes alive	
Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out
Don't cry freedom 'cause you've stolen mine
Got one now is dead
Go to dinner at the Governor's mansion
I fear myself
I'm liberated "They are fed lies, from the highest level"
Believe it
Shittin on your soul, welfare mother
Someone to tell me they care
Hmm and if you can't play it my way, well now baby get lost
Chick You brought a condom, right
Just rape the world
Sometimes I hate myself for being blind
You still get no respect
But show me my ring, baby, let me think
Some nut blew jfk away 
I feel your warmth on my face and these thoughts in my head
I'm going to kill you
Rough gets smoothed, everything can move
That'll voluntarily blast the last, Tom and Jerry ass nigga
Gasoline for breakfast, Napalm for lunch
And taste the venom left behind
I'm sorry if I'm a little confused if you're leaving
Few get what they want, and fewer get more
When there's no one left to FIGHT
And behind it all there's a price to be paid
Can turn y'all into someone else
 Shabazz, Greenhouse, Soul Position
Sometimes I hate myself for what I've lost
Few view the blueprints
Why'd you do it, she said, ain't nothing to laugh
Diese Welt war verlogen
To watch me fall apart at the knees,
Leading them is a mighty man with a mad rage in his eye
Maybe we'll fall in love
Watch your watch your watch your back
We can get you right to it
Dealin' drugs, bustin' them slugs
And all your jeans, how I would love to rip out those seams
Then something happened that took a bite
Du kapierst nicht Mein Shit ist hei��er als dein letzter Bierschiss
You sing to sing his praise because you're lazy
Ja mita vaikka joku
Your blood it flows in torment
Kidnap your baby's mom straight earth the whore
Undead, why won't you punks just die, die, die
  Too gone, too long, baby
In front of a class of gawking fools who'll never understand  They'll never understand
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time, so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
As the days go on
You are the one I've been searching for
You don't love me, you just hate bein' alone
The light flashes and the mind goes numb
Blast while you right hooking, right when your wife's looking
I've had enough, my thinning blood, concentrated therapy,
We hold our hands to block the sun
As you're walkin' down the street
Fuck yesterday
Play the horses, baby
I shed blood, for my people that'll keep you lookin' seethrough
But you won't even know what are there
Everyone I know
This thing between us is scientific
I wish it didn't have to be, but this song is for you
You can't stop me
You know why Because the customers always right, right The customer is always right
Machine guns on a New York transit line
Just slap her hand
I've had enough, my thinning blood, reaction based anxiety
Now look at me I'm still a fight
They've locked us out, they've banned our unions, they even treat their animals better than us
Who do you think you are you ain't foolin' shit
The walls that surround you in a gentle caress,
He's not your friend
Marilyn committed suicide 
That can kill and reveal the front of your grill
Olet niin kaunis
Follow what you're told to be truthful
I told you, I was the street talker
About the fact that you fucked up
Just the sight of one more child screamin' from hunger in a Dublin slum
Who's got the future
Aiyyo yoyuhyo, and now I hear no one
I can't die
Stealin' cars and livin' life hard ya heard me
A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch
We all have a dark side, to say the least
And you sure get around
Curb chasin, straight lacin, with a Mac blazin'
Now is the time, now is the time for your friendship to end 
The stupid hippies, too stoned to see their lives are fucked,
Don't ever come back to me again
Who turned away Couldn't bother to be around this now
Temper temper
Don't be scared 'cause I'ma show you how
It's a clean kill
You should both be shut down in the coalhole
You'd be a fool to leave
For you a charade, for me a disease
Sometimes I think y'all trying to pull me down
And let you do your thing again
This year's been really really rough
Yes, you're gonna burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
I hold it inside as you sleep, as you hide who eased the pain of all your sadness
And I'm about to make you lose yours too from far away one time
When I'm sitting alone some people think
He danced upon the bonfire
Give me something good, now 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
All your jewels and your cash gettin' got tonight
While all LA's a fuckin' mess
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you let that trash
Sacred in the forest, fast food in the kiosk
And all their lives, you won't stop giving them your Jipp
Wahrend ich mein Reim wie 'n Keim frisch in die Erde pflanz',
Peel away all the scabs
E allora annaffio il muro con il mio veleno
The best heroin that money can buy and
The term they apply to us is a nigga
We could have shared and would have lived
I need a little loving
But your sheets are on my mind
Just turn your head and I will be replaced
We are safe in our bedsheets 
Shadows crawl to the sundered stones,
perche ti fai del male, perche ce l'hai con te
You can't tell us that we're all together
That's right
One minute I'm cool, the next minute I'm up on a nigga, rippin'
Now your turn is coming around
So call the police narcissistic, narcissistic
This is the voice that I was given and
Well I've been there, and it's bitter
Well, the note says, "Mrs Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
Then I'm coming back for you
Fire, all our guns and arrows
Runnin' on but never runnin' out
Your senses have been stripped
What you intend to ignore, but when it cuts back round,
I could walk out of a classroom and be on my way to lunch and be killed just as easily as I would on the front line of a barricade in a demonstration
You've unravelled DNA, and at the same time you're cultivating bacteria strong enough to kill every living thing 
When there's nothing behind it
I'm stickin' to the script, you nigga's skippin' scenes
And I should do it your way
Was Zuerst hie�� es, dass du cool warst, doch du nervst
Your walkman generation
A swarming of disease
But the being you should most fear when you turn out the lights,
They're stupid or they're lying  or a little bit of both
Because you can't find a way to put her before your art
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
But very real on this night
Trying to remind us it's time to awake
io non ti lascio in questo nostro Vietnam,
I love reading the palms of bitch rappers>
And your bitch caught out there
I know there's something more
Do you want to be dissident in the world that you've built
Bass
Force his face down 
That's why I'm trying to warn you people
And I'll be left with a broken heart to heal all alone
Have you been let down
You're hanging on the memory, you need most
Stare into the eyes of blood, 
Systematic warfare  and an obsessive
I'd reek of hate disturbed
The number's even  now I'm leavin'
Plus die Konige der Meere
Some people got no heart, that's just the way it's always been
What I do to you is unhumanly possible,
It's just been too long
And not another way
Someone hear me, please, all I see is hate
Yeah baby you smell lonely to me 
Ihr zwei klingt am Mic wie keifende Klatschweiber
'Cause she's gone, gone, gone
You gotta do what you gotta do to get by
No one's gonna save my life when I'm drowning
Get that voice outta my head
For three years and counting
Clubs all night is your life
The blood on your face
Cry I think I won't this time
Prove it to me just be a man
We'll eat your children and steal your thunder
To appease your conviction
E prendermi con se
A dark tide of shadows follows me,
Drown the crunch out with your headphones
I'm not angry and it's never been enough
What will your conscience say Maybe you'll change the channel soon
olla sita mita sina oot
Better hold your fire till you see the whites of my eyes
You're dying inside
solo agli sguardi e' concesso di sperdersi nell'aria
se tu volessi vivere io non ti lascerei
Whoever said to get down on your knees
And every time you speak her name
The bird, the melodies she play
The moonwind blow your hair
Watch you clap your hands by the stage
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy
All right then,
That shit's as worse as it gets, this verse is over, I quit
It wears me as skin
Gravity to even try
Uncle Sam is spared
Follow me again and sing an hour with the wind
It goes aone, two, three
Me and Fest don't know if we should write more songs
Understanding
I know, baby I know
This must be love
Or maybe it's to late, anyway
'Cause it sure as hell does
But in the world it is right
And I'm laying down my head
Have you running out this fucking club in your drawers
But they don't understand the things you do
I've had enough, my thinning blood, concentrated therapy
Motherfuckers don't know but you better watch what you say
Slammed the front door tight
He says "One day I'll throw away all of my cares
Don't want to burn up
She knows his name
Dabble in fall of failure
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up relentless, I smell blood
"Things haven't really changed that much"
sita mita sina oot
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Detox, Detox where are you
You doing so much travellin', never know when you'll be round
Dressed up, messed up, greeneyed sycophant
The place where I began
There you are a tool of their firmiliar game
You'd come running right back to me
I am looking high
A hostage walking free
But use your brains, we know who's to blame
'Cause I am killing over
Voor m'n vrienden, die ook vanavond weer de weg
I can't believe the guy could be entirely dead
By the blaze of the burning skulls,
 And roads of nonchalance grew upon
And you can't have the sun at the same time as the rain
Happiness is a state of mind
Something burning inside, I get hotter and hotter
You fuckers never should've let me out
