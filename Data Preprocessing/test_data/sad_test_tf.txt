The face forgives the mirror
No one lifts their eyes
We got a rock and a rock 'til our dying day
Her heart like a crystal
Don't speak to me this way
House of cards, you fall hard
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you Hey yeah, hey yeah
Those starving children they ain't got no mother
From her smile the golden tooth is worn
Lay their boots upon my floor
I need you more than dope
No I won't say a word
The songs you wrote
Miles and miles
For the last time
And I ran off and ran on to something
I told you the truth
I will grow through this pain
Oh no, I see a darkness
Yes, it struck me that love is a sport
Can stop and smell the smoke
I just have to wander through this world
All these blues I have cried
We made love on the living room floor
'Cause I'll know that you're lying
My panic research was no help
But I can't draw a hand
I'm sure you will get yours too
Get the sense that you're on the move
I've been screaming for years
Our gilded age may come and go
Here is where you'll stay
He was rich and I was overawed
Outside the words
Innocent child, lookin' so sweet
A deal was made and I was paid
So I'll hit the pavement
There'd always been someone
Babe, I better rewind
And we will hear those planes overhead
That circus tiger's gonna break your heart
If you go back out there
No one knows where we're from
He'll be careless of
That is what I remember Do you remember
But I pulled you and I called you here Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Oh, but those feelings ain't this strange
And does he cry through broken sentences like,
Even though it hurts, even though it scars
Got back in the van and put the walkman on
I never tried to trick you babe
And then I'd ask about the girls he'd date
And I'm up in the air, so baby hell yeah
Naked bodies look like porcelain
The words they use so lightly, I only feel for you you come swimming into view
Faces fell long in the half light
It is called fear and it's seeing a great renaissance 
So the sleeping children were awoke
But you and I both know
And forgive me for not being in your life
Swear I'll drive right off a fucking cliff
Oh let me tell you, I am
Girls found honey to drench our hands
Was in never having planned to fall to fall in love, Luv
Tryin' to figure out this life
'Cause nothing's going right
And how I failed in love and jumped out on my bail
I'm standing at the back
See you looking through me
It always feels like torture
That they have told to you Not one word was true
Heaven knows what happens now
I'll tell them we just grew apart
I used to be a lunatic from the gracious days
A sleepy kisser, a pretty war
At  years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
So obsessed was I and selfabsorbed that I
You're just paying, for all of the bad you have done
Another friend, the one I love
We're all just victims of a crime, yeah, woah
As you start to crawl
I can't fix a car
We won't have to be, we won't have to be scared
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Somehow I know that we can't wake again from this dream
'Cause girl you're love is still on my brain brain yeah
And the white sun scattered
I was here but now I'm gone
I won't tell if you lie
With the windows closed so he'd never wake up
Said my love was never coming home
Everything will be fine
I can feel the distance
If the weight it was to slide
Are your thoughts results of static cling
And set up my holy holy still
As the waves break
That you don't want me there by your side
When I am away
So why do I try, I know I'm gonna to fall down
But you may never know why
When it's late at night
Until you wash off the buzz
Until he tracks her down
Take the disaffected life
She walks to school with the lunch she packed
These blue valentines
In Harmony Street, we beat a man just for standing there
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces
Some things tie your life together, slender threads
And love can really tear you up and it can break you down
But I guess you look happier, you do
Into a life you never meant
And to the voiceless trees it is their own they will lend
I'll be outside of your window
Just to fool myself, to catch myself, to make it real, real
Where have you been, Luv When the mistake we made
Yes, we're back again
My vision of a family was artificial and fake
This is why hell is underground
But you're a beautiful woman,
When the tide comes in
It's your turn to weep
Well I always say, it would be good to go away
I'm stealing lines from myself
There'll always be a place
I'll swim backwards, I'll swim backwards
Until you're done
Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
An oversensitive guy that he's lost and alone, yeah 
My friend can't see
Got to be so I can't hang on
Oh 'cause I need this hole gone
I was hoping I was hoping we could crack each other up
Envy your lover
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
I wish they was mine
She packs her things and she goes
A pale moon rises
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
All the time
And you won't even remember this for long
And I will shine on for everyone 
That you've run this in the ground
And I'm crying all the time
But heaven couldn't wait for you
Just a little skater boy they could pick on
If you need some money now, oh
What you have said
Far away from you
And there's something to cushion my callous sighs
Still all I need is you
For the first time since my accident
It's a lot of shit, but that's just what the doctor said
It's going to take you people years to recover from all of the damage
You could have been anything
And close my eyes real tight
I watched and acted wordlessly as piece by piece you performed your story
Leave you alone
I know, somehow
If they believe me or not if they believe me or not
Sing for the kid with the phone who refuses to sing 
Morning will come
When people all stare
A star's a star
And I wish I could steal it, abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can
The words they use so lightly, I only feel for you
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Flowing right in with the dawn
The purpose buried every day
The glue of love is still bonding us together
But tears fall from my eyes
The eyes of youth must lose their way
Is what no one can break
But these people they just
And every time it rings it gives me chills
It's a chemical, chemical kind
For love I can't feel
What is an advisor Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Don't ever forget me honey
Won't you hold me, won't you hold me
Lord I have a broken heart
It's chilled us to the bone
When I call on the telephone
Well, I was almost honest
When it rains
Down a road that's leading me nowhere
And through my tears I sang along
My worried shoes
So you slide to the floor
And I do believe
The wind bites more bitter
Having seen this place before
And you say "Take this,
When I go outside
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
They just know what is what Young Money
Tell me all about your men
Then we finally was married in 
They need for you to be everything
But I've never had a man
Feelin' weaker and weaker
And you'll sing to yourself the rising, falling melody
Promise me just one more night
You raped, I feel dirty
Across the room
Hold my hand
Saw you walk inside a bar
"I met a woman once, I gave her my best shot
Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
So the metals faded black
Oh, send your love my way
And that's why, love, you shouldn't stay
All we are is colored sand
Started thinking about my old man
So in the meantime
But don't walk away, don't walk away
Get it stuck there in your head
'Cause this call costs a fortune and it's late where you live,
Before I go I want you to know 
But the devil's in the details
As the music fades
And from the pasture the fence it is leaning away
Until death, we seek destruction
I do the things we did before
You're my best friend
The channel fades to snow
When the days all feel the same 
The boatswain calls upon the quay
I'm suicidal, suicidal dream
Wash their hands and start to pray
They'll give us something
Things that are supposed to mean lots
So I pushed you a little bit more
And claim that you've done all you can all along
I'm having trouble sleeping
Child your only hope has flown
I woke up this morning to a blood red sky
Drinking coffee and reading lies
And I'm tired of waiting
That's why mommy stopped and stared
You can laugh, it's kind of funny
We laughed at the darkness
Is the only sense I've left
Do you remember when,
That way, no
'Cause your money is no good
And if the ship was built in bottled sand
Who will sing their blues for them
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
I know I'm leaving but I don't know where to
It's not just something you take, it's given
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers
Slow glass
To buy my lady a long and flowing gown
I may cry, ruining my makeup
I could say this I could say that
You're looking at a picture of me
Your hair riding over
And drink with my friends
Dry your eyes
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere
And my bass down low
Something else to hide behind
Did I dream you dreamed about me
Led you back
So I'm not hurt when you're not around
No, it's just more lockjawed popstars
You're a nightmare beating the dawn
I know you're the ticket, you gotta be
She whispers something in my ear, the message is unclear
It's been a bloody stupid day
Turn around the heartache
You come to follow you around
All I have left is the only place I've been
Breathe the taste of salt water
If you knew I was dying would it change you
Your love's not alive, it's dead
If you're compromised
And I'm up in the air, said baby hell yeah
There's no more trying tonight
One last time
And I settled for a telephone
Go on wasting my time
This life is mine
One that would cure me of this cold, winterset heart
And no poem or song
I don't know what I said
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
To pretend he walks with you
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair
But still they come to haunt me, still they want their say
And all of the days
Changes are shifting outside the words
I always hold a place for you in my heart
Can we start all over again
But don't say anything at all
Of how I loved and how I failed
And ours alone tonight
But someone stole my record player
When I awake, I'll see your face
You tell me that you haven't slept in days
But baby I just wouldn't be the same Wouldn't be the same
Are you maybe here to help me hurt myself
The fear of being my father has never disappeared
Can you see the sky turn red
The world was at her feet and she was looking down
And oh babe, can you tell what's on my tongue
We're yelling, "someone's got the answers,
And fuck your own child 
Praying to the wound that swallows
Cryin' all alone under the stands
Got to get those fees to the agencies
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
An eye on all my horses you've slept with all my men
Oh God, what have I done
I'm lost here in this moment
And I knew darkness swallowed
What I thought was a dream
Oh, into the dark
A scientist who'd tell the world
I don't know how to let you go
We've  gotta make it last
I'll turn the TV to the bed 
Yesterday is gone
And I'll stay here if you prefer
Will love you forever
And I hope you'll always be
A mountain of a soul
Goddamn we
I passed through before I knew you
I am willing to give up this fight
I fall behind
They're crooked love thieves
Cyrus Jones,  to 
Are the details in the fabric Hold your own, know your name
In the time you became the girl that you wanted to be
What could be the harm
When I think I might just fall apart
That's just sentimental
And the fire burn the beauty in their eyes
Just get out the butcher's knife
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
At the bottom of the sea"
Reaching into the night
As I drive
And sometimes I think you want to me to touch you
You're homeward bound
That overlook a highway
A rape in my eyes, and on your flesh I'll eat
Don't blink, everyone's watching
No time for halfhearted goodbyes,
It's a good year for a murder
The faces stay the same
I never said goodbye
Be free of all the pain
Looked in the mirror
They can't see everything on earth
Three months and its still hard enough
Patterns in my mind now moving slow
And she goes, she's been here too few years
In every city, memories would whisper,
The moon is yellow silver
When I return
There would be a documentary on Radio 
And how the grace with which she walked into your life
Why did I leave
So you walk that way, I'll walk this way
I'll be lost when you're gone
I'm sure back home
Everything's reminding me of you
I think I'd better leave right now
Couldn't pull my heart back together again
Do we kill this one tonight
Can darken the heart
Something's wrong, I can't let go
Girl you know me inside out
Just to reach our door
I won't lie and tell you it's alright
There's one thing that you might have missed
Oh, the bed ain't made
To be a better man
As we fall back into the impossible dream
Then somebody says that it's always been this way
Our love will never end
The one making you laugh, oh baby oh
We are alone
I want the truth from you
Once bitten twice is shy
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
If the world all falls apart
Long after night has come to claim
Well, you're back in your old neighborhood
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
In this magical land behind your eyes
The place where I am free
Where the biscuits are soft and sweet
I get up early 
Then you passed it to someone new
Under parking garage lights
Even if it's a lie
Say things I'd take back
I need a little time, can we even up the score
And stay with you in your steps
But no one knows your face
Let your memory reduce them to dust
Is true love just once in a lifetime
An eternal flame
But the mountain never moves
Years later on, I saw your face in line to catch the morning train
That I only come home
Trapped on the terraces, I looked at you and knew
When someone has broken your heart it changes how you feel
Rather give the world away than wake up lonely
I feel like a kid again
If you can make the damn thing work
And no one in turn ever spoke to him
Our hearts are as dark as the rain, ah oh
What seemed so far away
You were just a kid
There was a time when we were young
She lived upstairs from him
I gotta get rid of this hole inside
Scared of what you'll think
If it's just another cheap line flung
And all your little brother's favorite songs
But you're right
On the last day of the year
So many questions so much on my mind
Just like a dream
Time after time
To get away, maybe I could sell kisses
That was worn by his mother
You love somebody new
And he wasn't like them
It starts up in our bedroom after the war
I'm searchin' for a face
What you hope is love
I accept that some things will never change
Wonder who won mine
It's you proudly knowing that your father is doing the right thing now
We had a beautiful magic love there
I watched the beauties, watched the fire
Mark my home and draw some lines that match
Still rings in my ears
The fairness of our trade
I can't just carry on this way
My window show the same
Think of it all of the time
Here or the next life
And does he notice my feelings for him
I pray I get the chance to make it up to you
It might smear their lovely career
There's no one home
All these poses now no longer boyish
'Cause I'm scared
Would you have played in your school clothes and made me mad
Can save me from this darkness
And they walked from the road
So here I am in my new apartment
And what comes out is a horrible mess
Woke up way too late
I swore ourselves a better life
And watch the time go
On such a lovely Sunday
Couldn't part from you
For me it's just a pain in the ass
The people under me
Baby can you hear the rain fall on me
And Sonny Liston rubbed some tiger balm into his glove
Things happened at halftime, I'm sick of the bends
As comparing our new brand name black sunglasses
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
"You don't get drunk on red wine and fight no more"
You've always been
And say you'll hold
Hanging from my mirror
Watch me fly away
If I had the chance, love
Wordlessly watching, he waits by the window and wonders 
And he tells me I pushed him away
Are your thoughts results of static cling Go your own way
Does anybody know the way to Atlantis
I meant what I said when I said until my dying day
Till the sound of my voice
Now if you're trying to break my heart
So please let the cleaning begin with evolution
I remember waiting for you to come
Well I think I would call tonight
And I would like to run away from
This is how our story ends
And did you say that she loved you
There's not a lot that I feel obliged to share or talk about
Everything in no time at all
We would stay up all through the night 
Say goodbye
A love for everyone I know
Go ahead and build it up again
The fearful always preyed upon your confidence
Not what you are
I was so completely yours
And how apparent it all becomes
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah oohoohoohooh
Everything that I should never take away from you again
And I don't mind
But what do you say we go for a ride
Why I wasn't meant for you
In the wind and the rain now, darling
I know what it's like
Why the sky is blue
Now every morning, there is no more mourning
In the dark of the night I found
And all of this will make sense when I get better
Heaven wasn't made for me
He's embarrassed to be seen now
I was driving south of Melrose, I happened upon my old lover's house
To say goodbye goodbye
I can't give everything
Will they breathe our air again
Side by side in age and sadness
Pardon me, I didn't realize
No matter what you tried
And daylight knows
We sat and waited for the sea
Who are we to understand
We've always had time on our sides
A telethon 
This is everyone
When you throw it away
He says that he loves me
She washes her hands
I know I am enough
What are these tears upon your face
I wanna lie here 'til we've killed this bitter doubt
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world
And been the one to end a war
And I can feel your pain, deep in my bones, deep in my bones
Feel I'm getting old
Beautiful, only slightly mental
And distance tells you that distance must come between love
And I breathe, I breathe
Of the woman that loves you, loves you
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
I'm afraid to come back home
Obsessed by you, your looks
And everybody here's waiting for the million dollar jackpot
How'm I gonna keep your heart
I fell in love with you
Said he's finally made up his mind
All of the king's horses and all of the king's men
And everything will be fine
I lie awake and try to recall
When it sings, when it lies
Maybe when our story's over
I can't compete with all your damn ideas
I am not one
Hell, no reason, go on and scream
But I was almost honest
That David played and it pleased the Lord
Son, I see it in your eyes
It's not too late because
What's in your eyes
I went to meet you at Central Square
Courage my boy
But you don't really care for music, do you
Maybe it's all gone black, but you're all I see
I'll kill myself, from holding my breath
All my thoughts were real and so sincere
"That's a good boy"
I'm sick of always hearing 
In the park past the statues
We're all gonna be in the same place when we die
Three spirits and twelve lonely steps
Mother wake me in the night
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
A cold sound in the air
But you're so misunderstood
Was I just a fool
I've got to get better Caramel
Sing for the president, sing for the terrorists, sing 
Growing up without your father in your life
But I didn't mean to hurt you
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
Like I don't always connect 
And the memories I never can escape
As you lay your weary head
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself
There's nothing like a sunset"
Her clothes hang in the closet still
Cause it is mine, it is mine
From the chorus of people screaming
Swallow, choke, and die
Oh, it's true what they say
Oh, and how many times will you make me feel more alive
Realize it's not okay, it's the end of all you've known
Ooh, that's right
And I lose your hand through the waves
Did I dream you dreamed about me
So I'm always pacing around or walking away
And nobody cares at all
I've grown tired of holding this pose
I cry, I don't want to lose you
I'll swallow my pride and bite my tongue
It'll be perfect babe
You'll rise each day as planned, your will is your command
Meet me after dark again and I'll hold you
And sometimes I think you want me to touch you
Sandwich bars, and barbed wire
With her father and brothers we're all at the funeral
Oh fuck, I'll give you anything
Just to sound confused
And though all these things will change
You need to be up all of the time
And suddenly my cell phone's blowing up
Cursed with a love that you can't express,
Always
All of the colours I see my love every time I see you
And the ghost of your memory
And it rose like thunder
With my gothic girlfriend, making love in the creek
All the seeds in our garden fight
Oh come, come back to me
Love, you're news to me
We'll go where it's always spring
And I scream for the sunlight
Glass is breaking, so don't let go of my arm
But ain't nobody need you like I do hey yeah, hey yeah
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
The priests dressed children for choir
Gggget, get a lick of this lovin'
Do the things that I'm afraid to do
Carrying a box through the rain
I know you want me to
'Cause you're gone
And blackest night and I wait for you
She leaves the pictures hanging on the wall, she burns all
When we return
Bright eyes
'Cause this life is anything but certain
Maybe you'll get here someday 
Leave her there with her things on the doorstep,
Oh, 'cause I don't know who you are
Where shadows choose their horrors
How their eyes seemed to follow you
MARIANNE and still we sing little boy, little boy, lost and blue, listen now, let me tell you what to do you can run on, run along, alone or home between the knees of her; all among her bracken and her ferns and the boy will have a name
Love will be the death of
And you know I have a drive
My sweet time
Like every single wish we ever made
And all the speculation, save it for another time
If you're lost you can lookand you will find me
That you didn't have
Well, baby, what can I say
I wouldn't know how to say
And there's all these funny little men
To silver glass
There's something there that you can't find
And leave it all into my mind
I've got to find mounts hill Caramel
Without a word
You look happier
These are only walls that hold me here
And when that queen's daughter came of age
And I'm down shouting names
My shoes took me down a crooked path
You know that darkness always turns into light
Wouldn't trade anything
So you buried all your lover's clothes
Put on my worried shoes
You're never coming home to me
I force myself through another day
He's so cold he will win the world tonight
I'm as troubled as the tide
But I can't tell which way my thoughts are travelling
And I can make you promises
Hating all the boys who got to you
And I caught you and I brought you here Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
The truth is I'm too tired to play pretend
So it don't seem right
And when it all seems like a mistake
MARIANNE three for a girl
As many petaled kiss I place upon her brow
And the hours of your life
I'm as puzzled as the newborn child
If you're the kind who keeps the veil on
It's the end of the world"
Everything is quiet
In right or wrong good or bad you said
They don't need to see you cry
And smiling in my dreams The storm is coming, can you see
Know tonight we'll make our bed
It isn't any fun
Now, that's not fair
On the way home this car hears my confessions
If anybody ever had a heart, he wouldn't be alone
You stay strong and you carry on
You're right next to me but I need an air plane
Like the land joining the sea
The truth, if this is how you feel
And I know you cheat
Three months of living here without you now
People, making fun of me
It was like prison
Closed the door and I tried to hang on and she
And, I will take a step away, and, see if you come back
In your eyes I saw a future together
You're a little bit more than I thought you'd be
She worried it might come to life
There'd be a thousand barren mothers there to talk to her
I only know because I
Given to a perfect day
You've been on my mind
I had just destroyed everything
They just know what is what
To hear those words from you
And don't believe the lies
MARIANNE there's no name for us
Don't want to hurt you
A willow wand, a willowisp  our ghosts will wander all of the water
And all day all night I dreamed
The drum beats out of time
Just another day in the maze of a myth
We drove the yellow convertible all night long
In the city where I'm from
I wanna be the boy I was back then
I know you will forgive me for my honesty
When the things don't make sense
Let's just take a walk in the afternoon  look at me
We might as well be apart
We've people to see let's put 'em on hold
Some moments last forever, but some flare out with love, love, love
The funeral had begun
One of these days the mountains are 
If you miss me once in a while
Throw a party for a thousand years
Living a life of fear
An inferno that never ends
And I don't mind sayin' so
Goddamn us
And the night too long
He found him with another son of God
I almost forgot myself again
Nothing lasts forever, for all good things, it's true
Alone to sort it out
Now that I have made up my mind
I wish I could turn back the time
I haven't lived my life, I haven't lived love
I used to live alone before I knew you
You've been asking me to bleed
And I don't know what you mean to me
So when it came time to create I made a mistake
I think about it every year so I picked up a pen
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
He took my bones and turned them into bread
Prayed for snow a long time
And your makeup on my pillow is proof
That I have not been to since your goodbye
You know this could be something
Deep breaths
Always someone's carrying
Two days past eighteen
After all that's what you're looking for
And cold here
Pulses glow from their homes
My wife is in the next room 
Healing waters to be
You touch my lips and grab the back of my hand
Can I coax it out its shell
You're so misunderstood
I say I loved you years ago
But if things don't work out like we think
We will not write a new one
Take me in your arms and love me, love me, love me
Reminds you that the memories will fade
Nothing is harder than to wake up all alone
Comfort the girl
And all the things they took from you again
And the white light scatters
If it's a broken heart then face it
Now I'm drunk and wearing flipflops on Fifth Avenue
But if you leave don't look back
As you throw your arms up to the sky
Take me away
I went back to Omaha
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun comes out
But each day I'd see your face
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you"
I don't know where, where I go
I knew I had to stay
Just stay in when it's lookin' this way
The land disappears
I want you to stay
The ships have come to carry you home
Although I leave you here this night 
As morning's light breaks over me
It could stay this simple
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
I am too busy to have friends 
Can't stop driving, I don't know why
And our poor friend, Jim
Some things you do for money and some you do for love, love, love
Thinking of you like a movie star
Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry
I wanna stay here but I've been denied
The wind will soon blow it all away Yeah, oh yeah 
Don't worry, but I won't be able to write for a while"
Who have done the most singing
I'm looking far too skinny
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
If I can make myself believe
And there were rows of ripe tomatoes, where a secret was concealed
Now it's smoke
Seem to have come undone
I arch my back cause 
Been a long time
Never felt so cold
I wanna hold you but my hands are tied
The last couple nights or so
There's moneylenders inside the temple
You're still all that matters to me
And so I drink to stay warm and to kill selected memories
There's a high wind in the trees
I see, see shadows
And I cry and no one can hear
I'm so wasted on you x
Old picture on the shelf
Can't wind down, the ending outlasting the mood
Open your eyes with waking light
Flashback to warm nights
That living is for other men
Just one last time
My heart will break
Is cold and hard as hell 
And we won't have to be scared
Your eyes
Somebody cries in the middle of the night
Because we don't take to arguing
'Cause I don't know who I am
In your heart
It's hard, hard to run
Go ahead, go ahead
I can write a song 
And you'd love most to be told
Letters from further away
I'm always assuming the worst
Such a lonely world such a lonely world
It hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on
Well hey little girl you will always make up so take off that unbecoming frown,
Who holds the stars up in the sky
I've been acting like a child
And a head to match
As I gently close my eyes
And push back your seat
I remember where the love was found
But for memory and clarity
I risked it all against the sea
Well some just can't be bothered to stick around another day
I'm trying to get to you baby
PATRICK four for a boy
It hurt so much to hurt you
Mommy said she didn't care
Baby, it's the slow fade of love
In the snow on Christmas morning
Even ghosts get tired and go home
Give me endless summer
Holding your hand
But I wish I was getting old with you
You're crying all these tears but they mean to leave you dry
Can poison your voice
Two pale figures ache in silence; timeless in the quiet ground
You know that it all takes my breath away
I gotta hide beneath my sleeve
Won't you please bring that flash to shine
The last day of summer
But there on the motorway, reeks of marmalade,
Yeah, yeah, yeah
He raped me in the chalet lines
Waiting to hold you"
But the bed ain't made
This pain is my heart oh oh oh
I am the entertainer and I know just where I stand
So the letters came from an army camp
As she lies here beside me asleep with the night
Soon we'll be far away
They think I've lost my mind
Look back before you leave my life Don't leave my life
Can you sleep as the sound hits your ears
And the pain in the river
Hush, this is where it ends
Here the sprightly Chickadee gone now is the Willow Wren
Now I tremble in your arms
But the last day of summer
It's a love you'd kill for
No memory
What's gonna kill you is the second part
Another sleepless night again
A life left behind she can find in her mind, gone away
Baby can you hear my heart cry tonight
I just let it fade away
Every night
As nothing to us
You were a runaround, a lost and found and not for me I feel
A quiet truth to calm you down
Calling you through flesh that burns
Running into the sun
Soon as I let go
I remember the makeup running down your face
Boat drinks for captains
Then I got on a plane and flew
My heart just stopped when I was told
And he'll take our daughter with him, she wants to go with him anyway
You know, I would not hesitate
Sometimes I feel so worthless
But reasons like seasons they constantly change
For fear I'll sink the ship and drag us both down
I know what you did to me
She lost both of her babies in the second great war
Without my love, my love
Within a room, within himself
This is everything
They're mixing with the rain
And as I walked through my door
I don't think you'd know where to start
I thought about it but it only made things worse
Ela e mais sentimental que eu
A statue stands in a shaded place
Me together, I remember
Father don't you know
I made a mistake that I never forgot
I wake up alone
Why you look me and you blink your eye
I need to rest in arms
I'm in the background
It's cold in here there's no one left
I love you more than I did before
I'll find my way back to you
If you're moving on with someone new
Like time was standing still
Why do the white gulls call
I don't need a better thing
And it feels like a warrant is out for my arrest
I can dance and win at games
You touch me in many, many ways
Goddamn us all
But I know it's never really over, no
Baby, think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
In every sky, in every kiss
Hit the wall,
You always said we'd meet again, someday
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
Up heaven's stairway to gold
In all the wrong directions, and by daybreak we'll be gone
I'll leave but just know
There ain't nothing left to say
But in their arms you feel so alive
To face your mother
Don't hurt me again
Opened my eyes, had a dream last night 
I'll kill myself, I'll put my head in a noose
Don't you know
I breathe, I breathe no more
'Cause girl you're love is still on my brain
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
And love me
The language is leaving me in silence
What if I got it wrong
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
And I'm starving now
If you love me, then that's your fault
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt
And everything gone
Not while I still feel like this
Oh, cause others infiltrated
Has held me back 
Rumors spreadin' about this other guy
Matt makes his murderous demand
Sweet sister, just feel me
Yesterday was mine
No matter how nasty
Like halfforgotten dreams
Youth is wasted on the young
Dead things
I call your number
I would like someone to make a map
I still think of you that way
You're happier, aren't you
That I would love you from afar
Billboards quoting things you'd never say
Does he love you the way I can
After the war
Little voices mimic you
Hush, you color my eyes red
And cut me at the surface
Fuck, I'll pay you anything
Wipe the shadow from your eyes
To comprehend this curse that I call love
Go out and find them, boy
Can someone take me away to a better place
Get off with you, ooh ooh ooh
And you said
But baby I just wouldn't be the same
So I was wrong
Yeah I've been looking though slow, slow glass
And I cut my bleedin' heart out every night
And finally now, believing
I'm gonna keep your heart
You'll feel when the wind blows
Walking away
To long too far from home
If you could end this 
When the letter says a soldier's coming home
All the angels kneeling to the frozen lights
I'm your son
Yeah, you look happier, you do
You came to make sure that I'm not running
Is it a kind of dream
I used to have demons in my room at night
When the houses came
Like a cigarette
Lie with me one last time
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
The morning is just a few hours away
Would trickle down generations in time
A good woman will pick you apart
And infinite silence
A bitch in heat, the alpha male
Down on this floor
Don't leave the light on baby
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie
Since you walked away from me
Hell's boiling over and heaven is full
And they just dive right in
So please explain
And I wait praying to the Northern Star
Never should've let you go hey ey
They let Lisa go blind
Wanna know where I go
You love a stone
And the future hangs over our heads
Oh, how could anyone not love your cold, black heart
When everyday begins,
I'm sorry I'm hard to live with, but living is the problem for me
With each light of morning
You keep on saying the past is not even past you keep saying
It's better this way, I said
But know there's no backing out
And you won't let me sink
Worried about everyone but me
You're the reason why I burst and why I bloomed
You'll ask your reason why
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
I'm the one you've been waiting for
We're both alone
And you're out singing songs
Make a wish
You've only got to love him more
That I'm crying crying crying crying
I'm not trying to find a way to get in your bed
Rest assured my angels
Baby, we're done
So that I can feel the rain
You make me somebody
Well, I'm as puzzled as the newborn child
Goddamn you
I'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be
You could love
Sixes and sevens, we live on jet planes
If I had a chance for another try
Yes, why don't you sit with me for just a little while
If everything we got is blowing away
I'm so tired of this town
And hallelujah to the one that we love
Refuse to fall
Who's to say it would have worked
If what we had was real, how could you be fine
And way out in Seattle, young Kurt Cobain
And our time couldn't end
"I didn't touch you there"
Or we think we did
Every word he said
If you're still free, start runnin' away
We're turning to go home
I can't promise I will heal you
Have a care and say a prayer
Once more from the start
Funny that how skipping years ahead
Foolish running for miles on the concrete ground 
The ground you tread under
Maybe you really forgave us knowing we was confused
All makes sense now
Like a reclaimed bad part of town
Bruised and beaten in the fire
But do you think I am telling you the truth
They are smoke
I let you say goodbye with lips like dynamite
Lately I just lie awake and hear and dream
But I can't feel my head and it's unravelling
Here's a hope that somehow you
And everyday I wake
Oh, please
Yes, I am falling how much longer till I hit the ground
There's too much I can't say
'Cause we paint the foil with the flame
Yesterday when we were walking
Until I come again
The second hand unwinds
I, I, I like my beats fast
Please don't tell her or anyone but I need to talk to somebody
And we walked without words
My time will come, yours too
I feel, feel let down
I was looking for a holy ghost
As many petalled kiss I place upon her brow
And when there's nothing left behind
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room
Gracefully unnamed and feeling guilty for the luck
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before
Don't mean to harm you
Until you fall asleep then I will go
Thought I'd make friends with time
There's one where I stayed with you, across the sea
I spent all my money on whisky and beer
Everyday I feel the same
I could fix a lot of things
Nothing to convey
All you touch turns to lead
If it's the same for you I'll just hang
I am the entertainer, been all around the world
All day it is there to remind 
I look at your photograph all the time
Moving through an unknown past Dancing at the funeral party
She motions outside
I put my thoughts in a letter, send it when I'm feeling strong
Then that man is standing there
I was all pigtails and cords and there was a day when
When all objectivity's gone
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
Today has been ok
Promise not to run, this time
Makes any boy feel like picking up roses
But I want to turn you on, turn you up, figure you out, I want to take you on
She hides the bruises with the linen and lace
Does he walk around all day at school,
Would you have made me quit smoking by finding one of my lighters
Just left along the way
Into a life I never meant
Last night I told a stranger all about you
Raise a glass and tell some lies
And would you let me
Like the horses of the sun
There was a time you let me know
Eyes the color of water left in wood
Every Saturday night I seem to come alive for you baby
Once I stood so tall, now I'm searching for a sign
And if you ask, I will stay
I warned you before there were water skies
Are starting to feel the way I used to,
Take a breath there your heart goes
And lies that lead you
The trees are white with snow
All we fight for
I keep this moment by and by
And I shall believe
I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight for you
That should be me, holdin' your hand
Take a picture
And things to treasure days like that should last and last and last
Mother wake me from my dream
Justified with empty words
Obsessions lament to freedom
Though I have a broken dream
Sing for the children shooting the children, sing 
The truth
Another one, another one
In some other time a thousand miles away
Was in your way I'd move it for you
Warm light when your eyes
With fate mooning back at me
This world is full, oh
You were perfect babe
I'll always hang
Get out the butcher's knife
Did they paint your face that pasty white
Marie you are the wild blue sky
Yeah you punched me right in the heart
I was determined in Chicago
With bullies always putting me down
The long distance runner
Every Saturday night
Beautiful lights, the starfilled nights
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
You're turning skin into a dirty secret
Since I've lay with you in bed
Two years later you're still on my mind
Just get me out of here
As I sit here, frozen, alone
So here I go with all my fears weighing on me
We'll keep coming back because
I can't give everything away
Walter's on the telephone
Sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you fought for your life
I cursed the road
Time alone will tell
And haunts the smallest children's sleep upon the floor
This is the accent of the halfhearted land
I'm a little more careful
That I was a stone
You're jumping in my bed
I'd rather trade it all while somehow saving you
And I'll keep on moving on for a while
There was something trembling in her voice
And every morning that I wake
And we wait above a road
I need to borrow money
And hallelujah to the one in our bones
And in a moment you're cast aside
I held your hand when we took shelter from the rain
On the way home, this car hears my confessions
He said, "I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
Make me a day, make me whole again
Refuse to feel anything at all,
We could use a handful of wheel
I know I love you
Remember, remember
I know something's very wrong
I turn on the spotlight and flee from the scene
And bury your head in the sand
You always said we'd still be friends, someday
And there's nothing there to ease this aching
The lights exploded
Red blood sticks like glue
I hope you know that I am me
And as you walk through valleys of fear
No, not today
Without finding closure, You take them back,
I haven't lived life, I haven't lived love
I don't want noone else
Even though it hurts, baby
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Don't talk about everyone,
In your arms
Darling I beg, come back to me
And together we sashay
What if there was no time
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
But I know it's never really over
Following the river of death downstream
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
And the world is closing doors
If you just give me all your love
And stand very, very still 
I do, I still think of you when we dance,
Because it's you and me, we're history
No one heals me like you
'Cause it's all that you left that's mine
Little child, lookin' so pretty
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
And you said yes but you've been wearing leather 
Piece of mind
It's working, 'cause you know
It's better this way
My tears I refuse to explain
Till earth swallowed the last of the sun
And drop a smile passing in the hall
In hell
That we all need someone
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from poopoo and 'prentice
So let's just say so long
Possible to be loved
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
Life is a game and true love is a trophy
Little Mikey Carson, ' to '
And I don't know I could crash and burn but maybe
Didn't see that she was
I've let your tiny minds magnify my agony,
In every child, in every eye
Don't ever let me say
Another one in the casket
Love me when it storms, love me when I fall
I can't change my name
Break all of their wings and make sure it crashes
With the twilight
As the day turns to night
I know I fucked up again
My love, my love, my love, don't explain
And we're quick to surrender
When I was , I grew accustomed to more fear
When the stars all look the same 
I envy the wind
Rearrange well I'm nobody
You can never dream it down
So let's love fully
I called you from the hotel phone 
But her dreams give her wings
Oh in a perfect way
So come with me in bed
I'm still up and driving
It was a party, it was going fine
We'll have a bit of fun
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Have to touch myself to pretend you're there
I picked myself back up
A lover would just complicate my plans 
Hope fades
Doctor, doctor on the phone
My love
Counting all the scars you made
This is getting serious
There is a town
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Right in my face
We're all gonna be just dirt in the ground
Be sure before you close that door
My pop quiz kid
Sat down at the table, and for the last time
To live, I won't let go
And there ain't no place for
Blueeyed charmer
And I, I always knew
Could you get it back again
Too many times I've planned 
The other woman finds time to manicure her nails
Burn his money and his house down
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And I'm hanging on your words like I always used to do come swimming into view
I'm never gonna love again
How can you be ready for life
And I'm sorry that it's this way
Though I have a broken heart
I got a question for you
Saying, "we'll need something to remind us
Read me your tombstone
You've got to you gotta say you will
And came to rest upon a beach
I will always be your light 
I know I could love you much better than this
And that I see a darkness
It's always incomplete
He's known by all in town
And she knows, she's been here too few years
Oh, let it rain
Just say it to me
And tell the man in the black cloak
Oh, you fuckin'
Three months and I'm still breathing
There's such a life to go and how much can you show
Well, nobody's perfect
There is a story you bring to life
We had our knives drawn, they were as sharp as we were in love
And then I saw your face
I've got to stop smoking Caramel
And they walked on the dirt
Three months and three months I, oh
Their beauty carved out of absolutes you could never claim
And finally Finally I have found a way to be
My head about it
There was a day
And Mrs Reardon says he has a brother somewhere
So as you pull me from the bed
For your mouth singing
It's a shame and as you know
I beseech, come to me
Tryna take my food stamps away
Men cut marble to mark our graves,
He knew the one time with the army captain
I've never dared to
Toast one last puff
What's in your heart
Fare thee well
You came into my life
Why don't you talk to me for just a little while
You said, always and forever, is such a long and lonely time
And I won't be here in another year
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
Does he kiss your eyelids in the morning
Yeah, what do I care
Carry you around, in the background
I can stop and catch my breath
For the fire and the faith that was you and me
Trading air
Five am Friday morning
To go our separate ways
Someone better help me
And since you are my friend
And if the perfect spring is waiting somewhere
'Cause baby two is better than one
Perfect moments wait
Everything you think you know, baby, is wrong
Do you wonder why I prefer to be alone
I looked all around and saw the sun shining down
But you're caught in my head like a thorn on a vine,
Your body's a halo
Ah that will be the way that we remain
Lift your head
Dreamin' about my death, dream
Please say the right words
When I sought out a light
Let the Universe call the bluff
Ninety miles outside Chicago
And none of it is yours, man
I wouldn't change a thing
Here it comes, it's all blown in tonight
And roads can't hold us down
I'd give anything now
And I wait for you
Into the endlessness of blue,
We were best friends
I went walking around the city some more
But you should never be embarrassed by
How do you find the words to say to say, to say
It is a personal thing
'Cause I'm heating upward bound now
And the fog comes up
From your skin I am born again
To get one last look at my baby
Cut your hair like Joan of Arc
And forget about the stupid little things
Every car crash, every misstep, every word
I only say that word for you
King Saul fell on his sword when it all went wrong
Down by the shore in the lazy summer
I'd have you by my side
On a lonely highway, how can we
And it would roll off my skin
In your sister's apartment
Give me just a chance
It's like we never happened, was it just a lie
If you ever could have known
This is where our story ends
But never did I talk
I don't want to make this right
How can the light that burned so brightly
Don't waste the sun on a rainy day 
'Cause when she's by his side
The house on the hill
To prove that you don't love me
And I know that you hope for
They are beating me with ease
We drunk dialed
'Cause we all need a reason, a reason just to stay
And I try to be the one
Remember when you were my boat and I was your sea
So kiss it' I too once thought I was owed something
Be years before he gets over it
Shine on, light of love
All alone, come to me
I'm leaving but I don't know where to
In a small brown house in suburban streets
No more "I love you's"
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
Tonight
I guess I always knew the score
There's a little child
I'm in love with you completely, I'm afraid that's all I can do
You had come back from the dead
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me
I was locked all day in the summer heat
My dad moved out about that year or so
To sing this summer serenade
I was born
A old man gave me a tip he said
And I can't get you off my mind
I wish I'd never grown up
The two apart
Yeah, that's the time and place
Twilight
He rode his bike like the devil until the day he died
'Cause I can feel your pain, in my bones, in my bones
Your trouble with living
But you can't borrow my clothes all the time
What if you lose yourself sometimes
This ain't no happy place to be
But how do I let go when I've
The sun turns us to stone
The back of my hand
Mother, please forgive me, I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Then I'll come for you
Do you remember when you were young and very pretty I do
If you want some money
She said, "You can sleep upon my doorstep, you can promise me indifference, Jim
Once you've found that lover
And wished them all away
And I'm wasted all the time
You lined me up
Mother don't you know
I know now I was naive
But you get six months to adapt
In my heart
Leave the rest for my own sake
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
To forever torment me, and I wonder why
I believe I believe someone's watching over me
And I hope you'll find your freedom
Then life ain't worth the drown
We sat and watched the sun go down
Please, please tell me you know
Made his greatgrandchildren believe you could live to 
Painting rings around your eyes, these peppered holes so filled with crying
I could help myself to something
Oh, you strike me with your silence baby, tonight
As my soul heals the shame
Singing this song, singing along
Before you know it's come and gone
And we were best of friends
I beat yo ass if I beat yo ass twice and you still here
Yes that's not the way,
I see things change
Scared to go back to Section  with my mama stressin'
So I'll begin not to love you
I'll love you forever
O my heart shies from the sorrow
To the grave,
Will not pass our way
One day it's gonna happen
I'm living dead, dead, dead, dead
And I wish it was something
What did we think we'd find
No one will ever know
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody,
Check my phone, nothing though
And every time I turn away
Can't shake this feeling that I have
I don't know just what I'll do
Does the silence get lonely
I won't be your winter I won't
Beyond the constraints of my mind
'Cause I've been holding your hand
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You're owning up to nothing and I wish that I was gone
And the very dreams that led to them
Floatin' on air
I know for sure that you're home
Breathing the smoke of the train
True love is cruel love
But dear God, why did you choose her
And you keep saying you keep saying
But at least the war was over
I fantasize about my death
Let my feelings free
And I don't wanna lie and I don't wanna tell you the truth
I just don't know what to do
That hurts you oh so bad
What will become of my dear friend 
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
Is not a place to dwell
Living in fear
Long nights of pasty face tunes
And your body on my mattress is proof
And say and lie to me and say and lie to me and say
You've marked to find your way back
What's going on in her life
But it's just a faint taste in my mouth
And we were only kids
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
It's like love
When you come swimming into view
That made our memories
No good times, no bad times
I truly love but I know
And your hopes 
Take my hand
Mirror mirror, who's the fairest bitch in all the land
Forget the lovers you've known
Good girls, hopeful they'll be, and long they will wait
I want you to stay, oh
And a man on my back
And where do you start
Well I was, what I am
Too drunk 'n' still drinking
We stalked the streets like animals and danced as windows shattered
And breathing is a foreign task
Now you say your right on track
'Cause baby I didn't
I only ever told you one lie
I'm back, back in town
And when I'm scared
All the little pieces falling, shatter
I was blind
If your compass broke
What's up, family Yeah, it's yo cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man I know you been havin' a lot on yo mind lately, and I know you feel like, you know, people ain't been prayin' for you But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy  says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart" See, family, that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way
And head on my way up there
I've stopped returning all their calls
When you're gone
Everybody hurts some days
And where you been to that you no longer remember
Could be held between my arms
Dans le bleu de toute l'immensite
And if it could start being alive you'd stop living alone
The reasons for the tears
You've been in bed for too long
Don't worry I'll catch you
Together as one
And one and one is two
Don't think I can't feel that there's something wrong
The days grow short as the nights grow long
Well my God, what the hell am I supposed to do
Hearts will hold
Oh I, I'm along tonight babe
I've fall behind
Alone, alone, alone
When you got the mind of a man in the middle
Oh yeah, let it rain
And every second I spend waiting
Watch my head about it
As I will say
No kidding
I don't know how
When he saw his face reflected in his victim's twinkling eye
The worst is just around the bend
And I know I'm unwell
And maybe two is better than one
Any light that still remains
And so we meet alone
And I ain't got no money
As I make my way through the century
For the poor tortured souls
It's just saturated loneliness
Alight for  billion years
Together all these years
The tears are coming down
You leave on the bed
When we must go our separate ways
It's nice to have a little warning 
It's still raining, up here
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
Like a white light scatters
They run to the pines
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
And always empty
But the ghost of you asking me why,
Go get lost where no one can be found
Who's the man in such a lonely world
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
And it's clouded and so is my head
Heaven couldn't wait for you
To a diary entry's end
She stared for hours
From the shackles of language and measurable time
Go back outside, I beat yo ass, lil nigga
Keep the thought of you aflame
How many times have you told me you wanna die
And when your devil complains
Or what the wind says when she cries
And you get two more to leave town
Could change all we've got
Hey sister, I feel it, too
You won't get better till you're worse
Another one in the basket Ananother one, ananother one
'Til the light shines on me
Took me so many miles and they never wore out
It hardly matters
Death is policeman
She lay in bed all night watching the colours change
Laura you were the saddest song
Permanently at square one
Sorrow all across the surface rolls
I feel so low from living high
Tell me I look stunning and cadaverous
But don't forget the knife that was thrust
And everything you think you had, baby, is gone
And your lids are your best canvas
Will you love my scars so I can heal
You will always
Said he's had a change of heart
When your war is over
Who's the man ththmanthe man in the middle
Oh sister, come for me
Makes me laugh a bit
When this is the one and only love I've ever known
But I can pet a cat
If you want to tell me something
Don't you know the train keeps rolling
You tell me summer's here and the time is wrong
Well they'll seat us in the sun
One that's void of all discretion, such an awful tearing sound
We were shivering yet warmed by the subject matter
Breaking them till they've become just another crown
Say it will be alright
And show me your face tonight
With your ringtone
There'd be two hundred troubled teenagers to sit with her
With the secret harmonic emotion
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me
With my bass down low
Feel their hearts they're cold as ice
My racin' heart
You told me you don't love me
Broken by the rules of love
Well, I hope that someday, buddy
There'll always be a few things, maybe several things
I don't give a fuck about goin' home
She was easy on the eyes
Where my words would allow me
But still begging for attack
With time I'd have won you
We can bring back the old days again
Could be your biggest mistake
Will spend her life alone
And float from branch to branch, lighter than the air
Would you let me
Sure as Jonah turned whaler
Everybody's stopped believing
There are monsters outside
So stay with me
Makes any boy feel as pretty as princes
Choking back the urge to fight
'Cause I heard you say
Little child, lookin' so sweet
My only sunshine"
I know I'll rest tomorrow
Reminds me of what I have run for
For our love
So I'll take my chances
I shall believe
While she's still around
Wasn't always in your head
Cross your heart to take me when you leave
For more than a minute, get used to it
And I feel like I'm getting old
I'll find a yellow flower and I will lace it in her hair
Still I never want it all and I never want it now
And I know what you're thinking
If you love someone, you should set them free
Before my eyes
At the end of this road I might catch a glimpse of me
Interpret the rooms
If this was ever real
Say you love me more than you did before
The wind's a cheating wife
Well I was stabbed and bleeding
When you look them in the eye
What once was yours is mine
I said, "Darling, I'll give you everything I got
They argue "Walk this way", "No, walk this way"
Before I replace you
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes 
Raskolnikov felt sick, but he couldn't say why
Live with my friends there
That burns in desire's name
A million stones, a million bones, a million holes within the chinking
Painted like an unknown saint
And we always say, it would be good to go away, someday
With the world all falling apart
Don't let me know as it's happening
Are the things that make you blow
Let's love now
For  dollars and pieces of silver
You come down, holding tight, to the railing on the side
I can't be the same thing to you now
Well who's laughin' now that I'm leaving your town, again
Hold on to this house
When love makes you wake up sore
Tomboy running around, hanging with all the guys
Washed away this slow
I'm holding to you holding on to me
Blue thunder
 you opened my blue eyes,
Grab your bags and a picture of when we met
I woke from a dream
I'm still frustrated from last night
Never should've let you go
Fall from the sky telling us all to go free
Where the things I really cared about
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
As the smoke it flushes out
To finally come around
Talking for hours, that should be me, that should be me
Our love is a fickle love
There's a party there that we oughtta go to
They wont let me turn around
As your own children are lowered in the ground, 
Lift your hair while they change the hospital sheets
Caroline says
That's right I'd die here
We stand to fight for nothing
Drive your car through the rain 
What's the best way no one knows, yeah,
Everytime you walk into the room
A really big mistake 
Yeah you got the glue
You are changing
When you drive home to your place
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Yeah that's not the way
And I wish it was something more than this
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
Oh, blue, blue, black and blue
I know the ocean speaks The stars retreat behind their veil
And don't get cheap with the wine
So let's be married here today, these rushing waves to bear our witness
Maybe you know it's true
Educated criminals work within the law
All that I hold
My name's Elizabeth
Still I'm proud to have known you
Won't let no one break your heart
The painful realization that all has gone wrong
I've seen all kinds of strangers
I see you in Citylight diner
It's so hard to just let go
But if you knew what's going on in her life
And the gold as I was told
I know what you did was wrong
I'm holding on to you holding on to me
But every time I'm close to you
Never more to be alone
This basement's a coffin
I'm scared of falling in
We were acting like a child
Who fall at your feet
We had a good run and I'm setting you free
We haven't seen the sun for weeks
You always said we'd meet again someday
I cried 'cause you were doomed
Number to come up man, and you know
I'll prolly die with promises
For I know with the first light of dawn I'll be leaving
Snuck out to the greenhouse, put a bullet in his brain
You're hurt but you don't know why
If you knew what's going on in her life
A strange glow in the sky
But I am gone, I am not there
You know that boom boom pow
I drive fast, radio blares
And I remembered why I loved her, and I asked her why I drove her off
Forcing everything metal to shine
I know I need you
You tell me winter's here and your days are getting long
What a day to sever such ugly extremities
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'
There's nothing left but hope
To the heavens again
But just as summer's hold is fleeting
Read my eyes just like a diary
Don't pull over till you're sure 
She thought it would be fun to try most anything
We don't want to lose our souls
In my worried shoes
Oh honey I can see your house from here
I made a promise when,
In the same old sickly skin
I cannot let you inside my cell
I cannot wait to call you
When you're alone
If you touch me you can never go back
This may sound bad, and don't take it the wrong way
They show how stupid we've become,
And no reason or rhyme
When I lay tonight, when I close my eyes,
Covered ground
Well, we'll still be there
You gave me your name and signed
Sometimes
Of running around
You'll be sad that you let me go
It's amazing what you learn when you never been taught, y'know
But I was looking through slow, slow glass
And the ringing from this empty sound
Because of you
At least she may forgive me for my honesty
"Take me in your arms
My love and I are fleeing
Just walk away,
Sister of night
Into a white and soundless place
You tell your friends, yeah, strangers too,
Underneath the stars
I've never been the type to call
If living is seeing
That we were something fatal, that fell into the wrong hands
The sound of the drum is calling
I hope you're doing fine
When I awake, I'll see your light
"Se ela te fala assim, com tantos rodeios, e pra te seduzir e te
And decided to stay
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Got bubble wrap around my heart
She'll give me a place
Yo' teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
Isn't fair
When you only had barely enough of her
If it weren't for my drinking
Out in the breezeway
Honest when you're tellin' a lie
We're sounding out it's a terrible, terrible tide
Before I fall any deeper
Give me the truthx
Then lost in that feeling
I fuckin' hate you
Such a lonely world
Day is gone on a landslide areeling
Si tu me le demandais
But I know the game, you'll forget my name
Now my foolish boat is leaning
He got one that whole deal before it happened
And no one likes to be alone
She sends me blue valentines
Seventeen years and all that he gave was a daughter
Desire, despair, desire
If anyone asks
I wake up lonely
You raped, I feel dirty
Because we
A timeless word, the meanings changed
Had just held out for tomorrow
Outside ecstatic love
Guide me safely in worlds I've never been to
Soaring through the utmost fear
To be with you wherever you are
And I know you do too
Sank into the dark
You're right next to me, I think that you can hear me
Oh nobody knows me
And I could never tell as a kid
When you phone me tell me everything I did
But somehow I know that you will never leave me
And there's no need, I know
If I could ask God just one question
And the sun was shining bright
Those words keep me on my feet
They poison our minds
Help is on the way
Our hell ends every weekend
Better not hear you got caught up
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me 
Through the wind and the rain
I keep feeling the lights
Like I dream of you
Death is an angel and
And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone
I'm just gone, just gone
Everything is back, and they'd use what
And dream of the ones who came before
Open the door
Come and lift me from this place
And I let him in
And how could anyone
Sunlight unfolds in my hair
Overwise wasted
I've been up all night drinking
Too much about honesty
A line above the step beneath
I've got a burning desire for you baby
Oohhoo, let it rain let it rain
Lord I have a broken dream
And they came from the road
And the silence from the side of the car
But the cold light of day
Take me in your arms and love me
That you put around her face
And nagging little thoughts change into things you can't turn off
No matter how bad
Nothing's ever left you scarred
I'ma tell my Biggz "yeah, dat's da guy"
Or cry like the stone white clown
And I forgot to tell you
I drive fast wind in my hair
Of knowing the truth
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
On time
To tear themselves to bits
With skull designs upon my shoes
For you to live, I took your place
Every step that you take
The finishing time
And how tall did we stand
Yeah you hit me right in the heart
Christened in blood
He turned on the gas and he went to sleep
We don't care what you say 
With a bucket bare and dry
Where nobody leads at all
Every time the rain falls, think of me
When We were only kids
That I was the one for you
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
Through the rain, hail, sleet and snow
Best to go down without a fight
I suffocate until the end
Too small to matter
Bass, bass down low
And you know
Everything at once the same
Two is better than one
You both know I'd be bleeding inside
Waving this town, goodbye
I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground
It all becomes the same
And this damp air it's fighting my defroster
This could be one of those days
You've waited long enough to know
I know you're gotta God shaped hole
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
Just fall asleep with the TV Darling
Hell no reason go on and scream
Back in the day it just went without saying at all 
She laughed as we picked out our children's names
It could bend or it could break
Forget about my past, find someone new
And they paid, I cry and cry for you
I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'll still believe
I can't live this life
There must be something here
Is we're all gonna be, yeah
Cause crying, ooh, eases the pain, oh yeah
I'll drive so far away
Still ended up in love
I was over my head
Everybody feels this way but it'll be okay
Oh tears my soul apart
And if you ask me I will stay
Then let me never ever wake again
To lighthouse shine, to calm tide
If the plane goes down, damn
Swish, swish, aw I got them upset
Or disarm it's getting harder to shield
Wash away all the things you've taken
Smoothing out the edges of the stone
You read on rocks below
He runs back only to announce
He had no friends, he seldom spoke
Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time
Never know why it's coming down, down, down
And will we ever end up together
I promise this drink is my last one
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
Well, at least the war is over
And it's hard to be a human being
So close your eyes and stay away
And all of the fracturing starts
I still ponder this old question why
I'm lyin', they know it
Some animal sips where the river flows
Someone better hit the alarm
And you saygo slow
It only causes you pain
To you everything's funny
No, I won't be your winter I won't
Stillness has brought my love to cost
Bury them away in the earth
Together as one against all others
And all is said and done
I have no way
Waiting out this long light brigade
I remember what you wore on the first day
But I'm shy, can't you see, oh baby, 
For some action you lost in the dark
Now I know that she thinks I am dead
You make things so easy
Give me all you got, baby
You're the echoes of my everything
Nothing much Friday night
Babass, bass down low
A short delay, the parrot blues
Pressed against the window pane
Just turn to my embrace
How did you go bad
I never know why it's coming down, down, down
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
MARIANNE five for silver
Phone calls from further away
Love isn't lying, it's loose in a lady who lingers
And it's fun
Am going to a place where I am always high
The moon
Send someone to love me
She lay in bed all night watching the morning change into green and gold
To anything
And men do foolish things
Come on baby let's light the night
Forget, forget
You hang your head and pray
Gonna take me from my man
Almost too much for my heart
You wake with a start from a dream and know that I am gone
I'll give this one more try
Then we shall see each other face to face
The generous queen will kiss a fan
So the pain begins
In the light
That's the hardest thing to see
He couldn't sleep at night for fear that she
I won't be here in another year 
I sure could use the rest
I know I hear folks chchchchchchchchatter
You found a million ways to let me down
Give me the truth, even if it hurts
This house that we have made,
Of summer's kiss upon the sky
If the moon had to run away 
And there's nothing I can do
Thinking, why does love leave me so damn cold
What I've done
You're already in hell, you're already in hell
This made me all of who I am inside
This place, it's fucking cursed and it's plagued 
And spread your wings
I'm trying to listen to your words
I'll thrash the air and then be still
What it means to care about the things you wanna do
But for now let's just pretend that we're gonna get bombed 
Half human, half machine
Then I don't know what will
Thought I wasn't enough
Who sailed around the world
Only slightly mental
I'll leave when the wind blows
Where all my journeys end
If you knew I was dying would it change anything
The trouble understand, is she got reasons he don't
I think of all the men I, I could've kissed
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I just wish it would rain oh how I wish that it would rain
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
And all of the things he was so scared of 
Then I'd know that I am not alone
In such a lonely world
In all I know
If you'll be waiting
We'll sing love songs about heartbreak and grief
Gone away from me
There are things I could've told you
There's no times at all
I remember when I moved in you
Conversations, full of words you never said
But, though you like all these things
Hey, I got a feeling there's something going wrong
Now I can't walk back, I can't leave behind
Long days of wanting you here
Put it in your mouth
Tell me now, tell me this  a forest's son, a river's daughter
Her tongue a thirsty knife
But I'm missing way too much
Lamenting policewomen, policemen,
Victims of a crime
Now the killer was smiling with nerves made of stone
And what I said was never said
Do you really think I'm made of stone, baby, come on
Don't you make me lie here
"And I am what is left a puppet Laughing at the look of amazement on the musician's face, Pinocchio dove off the cliff and swam away"
She's the sweetest honey pot
It's not somebody who's seen the light
Only nightmares take me in
A scream which fills the air
Of a lover who brought fresh bouquets every day
From caring for his often
Help me now or hold me down
Like a mother, or a maid bringing you down, down
And please don't find her skin
Would you have been a little angel or an angel of sin
And blessed are the broken
What it your eyes close before mine
And now you're just a ghost
I'm losing hold
When the dark flood came
I won't make a sound so you don't wake
Baby wait a lifetime before
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I should not be surprised I should have seen it sooner
And can you tell me was it worth it
She put her fist through the window pane
Don't believe their headlines
Catch me if I fall
I let the snow
Melt in my mouth
Does he ever get the girl
There were times when I'd find myself saying that
Our love will remain, love will remain I'm cryin' in pain
Life is long, my love has gone away from me
Don't say what you're about to say No, no, no, no
Oh my lady, lady I am loving you now
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
Fist tight, banging on the door
You hold me down
Pick up my things, just make sure you're not there
It's a beautiful place if we make it
Go ahead and put it down
"Friends, you don't understand"
Say your goodbyes but darling if you please
Through books of older time
Elliott, man, you played a fine guitar
You have gray hair now,
I believe without a doubt
The nightmares, the lonely nights
And I will bow gently by your feet
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
Somebody better show me how
I beat yo ass if you walk in this house
Everyone knows it
I still have that record
I got to meet expenses, I got to stay in line
But these hazards of love never more will trouble us
The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones,
This is goodbye, this is the end
I rape, no one hears me
If I loved you, well that's my fault
She stands hard as a stone
Something in the way you move
Well I'm a modern guy
It's only everything standing in front of me
If you want to know the truth of it
All the people come have gone
Saying, "Yo, have you ever said a pretty word"
Just give me the truth
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
I'd discovered something new
It was a beautiful song, but it ran too long
And the moon's laying low in the sky
Make a pass, impress another girl,
 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
Has drained and it's gone
The weight of an empty life
So please don't cry 
'Cause I'm never gonna love again
Somehow it got easy to laugh out loud
And in every face I meet
If truly his heart was made of icing
If you leave I won't cry
'Cause I'm never gonna love a new
But it can't cancel out the stars
My life will not be lost
Baby I know
It's gonna be all right
Put a rock beat over anything
It hurt as a child, tied down
What if the paint chips from the wall
I'm waitin' in the dark
But there's no laughs left 'cause we laughed them all
And stand each Sunday, a hymnal steady in your hand
Fake a smile, yeah, lie and say that,
She told you bad things
And as I helped, my mom would start to cry
Twilight, I sit at all tables
And I, it's a little cold outside
We're just a habit like saccharin
Found a life worth living for someone else
And I have sense to recognize but
I take as much as I can get
Yes, I'll leave you without a word
Lord I fear the cold
Sometimes you picture me
It's the tattooed broken promise
Leaving your town again
Can I get a little Goose in my OJ
Oh, lonesome me
And I'm lonesome when you're around
But they don't know what is what Katy Perry
I remember when we kissed
The tracks of a train's arm
And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone
I might have loved a king
Get on the train, train, train
Did he hear a goodbye
So go on, go home
I put one foot in front of the other
Has finally turned gray
Every day
Alone or with our wives
You're the emptiness the whole world sings at night
Another one, another one 
There's a time and a place
This world  I am afraid 
Sometimes I don't longer know
And they go their merry way
The doctor told her years ago that she'd go blind if she wasn't careful
In a stupor from the drugs that didn't
So come on, I'm thinking about history
Did she give you what you hoped for
I'll fall for you again
Still more
Without me by your side
As the fox lay sleeping beneath her kitchen floor
They know what is what Do they know
You look in my eyes and I'm screaming inside
I march further and further away
It washed the cars and everything
'Cause there's no more trying to make this so right
Yet you're going to look at me that way
So I've learned to dance with a hand in my pants
No need for reminding
Brace yourself to the morning alone
I can see a new beginning rise behind the sun
Ah that's not the way that friends behave
But it still pays the bills 
'Cause you're still around,
My girl has found another and gone away
Won't you take me by the hand
Is holes and lack of love left
Now love is a game
I'm coming to an end,
My life seems unreal, my crime an illusion
The lure of my bed is ever near
But I fell for the promise of a life with a purpose
In the life I know
And I wish I could feel it, abduct it, corrupt it
You're all right, you're all right, you're all right
Please tell me there's something better
I don't know who you are, but I
No one to forgive
Take your hands off him
But if she don't love children then we can't party
But if there's nothing there to make things change
I heard it said
It hurt as a child, tied down 
And suitors would journey from kingdoms away
Today I walked down our old street
And I'm wavin' you goodbye
Where are you gonna go if they come for you
You know you'll up like the rest
With every kiss and every letter
That I swore was everything but beautiful
I have nothing left to fear
Head hanging with horns
Everybody just want to be free
So this is the end of you and me
That there is no reason why it can't be like you said
My eyes wouldn't open, cemented to her face
By tomorrow I'll gone
So it's true what they say
The cigarettes taste so good
From winter brings the spring again
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
On the same greasy street
Do you remember I do
But each time I try on the thought of leaving you
At , my biggest fear was losin' it all
First tell me which roads you will take
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
So hopefully they disperse
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
I know that this might make me cry
It hurt as a child, tied down, you would hit me
What we had, a beautiful magic love there
And this life's getting old
Taste these teeth please
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
I can paint my face 
'Cause in my mind, I need it,
Walk down your street
Where are you tonight
From the sound
Maybe not this time
I'll be back again
You with someone else that I have felt and seen
What's inside of me anyway
In the middle of the day,
Reflecting the glow of the winter moonlight
Of faulty manufacturing
The blinded eyes that see
Another right
And facing those fears
It's another thing for me,
I've got no one to send a letter to
We talked till we cried
And if today I don't see your face
Away with these nightmares
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Oh my head is spinning around
We wrapped ourselves inside a dirty blanket
Oh my love I can't let go
Before I took my last breath
I don't know who you are
And a day off and a bruised road
Take heart, my little friend
From everything
Looking down every few steps
No, you've always been the one
In starlight, you came from the other side
Take me to the places that we lived
You're only doing things out of desperation,
I'm shy and turn my head away
There's nothing more to it,
He don't play the trombone
And I wish that I could be the king
Cold smile on your lips
And spend some time dissecting
These words, "You will be mine"
I made up my mind
It's true what they say when you throw it away
Grandchildren far and near, and none will shed a tear
But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
From your father
If you wait for me
The love died, but the hate can't fade
Swish, swish, aw, my haters is obsessed
They gave her one more day to say the words I couldn't say
Baby, I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for a higher ground
Try not to look too scummy
The kettle sings it's tortured song
Was it something wrong that we did
One willing fool
To say goodbye goodbye
I love you
Oh, I believe it's all because
Been a long road since those hands I left my tears in
Morning calls for pain relief
With a rubber knife
And I'm sorry it's this way
And I wish I could steal it, abduct it, corrupt it
So nothing sounds quite right
Oh I miss you now, my love
But no flame burns forever, oh no
And the look that you gave me
Under some dirty words on a dirty wall
My eyes are glued to the floor
"I love you far too much"
For I cannot find the words to say
To know what it's like
All we ever got was cold
Could put right what I got wrong
In a big city, they just dropped me off
When all's gone and can't be regained
So what's so wrong Why the face so long Are you changing
She is soft, she is warm, but my heart remains heavy
So resolve your loving said all
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
"You can't plan on the heart"
Of faulty manufacturing
My arms are open wide
You heard your love again
But I didn't give them nothing else
It was not about me
Who knows
I'll be on your street
'Cause baby, you look happier, you do
Forgotten and
The same mistake again
Say hello, wave goodbye
You'll ask your reasons why
With feelings hid
Your heart starts skipping steps
I'm speeding by the place that I met you
With the noise in the background from a televised war
And he said, "Would you mind sittin' down for a while
Row our boat, stowaway
I don't know where I'm at
Remember waiting there to find nothing at all
Heaven or hell or somewhere in between
Every little thing there is to know
For the island, for the thrill of it, for everything that mattered
I'm too busy to be dreaming of you
Don't call me home, little sister
Was a place where my body could be laid
Oh lord give me magic
All of these moments are lost in time
What is in her mind
Gasping at glimpses of gentle true spirit, he runs
Expect me to apologize for things that you've done wrong
I can see how you are beautiful
Blueberries, dancers in line
It's gone berserk
Such a lonely world
You're moving but not aware
What went wrong with something once so good
Well, I wish there was someone to love me
It's your turn to feel the pain
There are things I wish I didn't know
I cannot rest, or my consciousness contest
All the living are dead
You're the one that I hold on to
Oh I wish it would rain
To keep me warm at night
Or slumped over in a vacant room
Here comes a long arm of the law
He was waitin' for the bus in his army green
Got kicked out of school and so it seemed
I only know because I'm way
And tears you up, to start again
If you can end this hell
Will you get out the butcher's knife
Drive me to the dead end, till I
You'd do anything
Everything has changed
My babe is gone
Got me through a lot
Give me all your love
Or maybe die because these smokers
Squash every week into a day
Thinking of you like the way that you were
'Cause then I'd never know
You sound so alone
I just want you to be true to me one time
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And take a look in my face, for the last time
I learned to forgive them; now I got the balls they can lick on
Some will say
I can feel the distance getting close
Well I know I could have loved you
Another bow, another breath  this brilliant chill has come for to shackle
Nothing I think or believe in or say
Away
And I wonder if, I'm alone in your head
You have a way of coming easily to me
Ain't no use hanging on to her memory
And I want you to stay
Take your hands off me, hey
Your memory is breakin' my heart
Eyes open, shut your eyes
That I don't know how to let you go
But wasn't he a most peculiar man"
Nothing is new
So, Cyrus Jones lived forever
This is our town
Nothing is true
Life is no cabaret 
The neighbour kid gets dare to touch the house
Like he would his own son
It's no different when you're leaving home
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
The pigs arrived with tear gas, and I wept at the mistakes we made
Is this what it feels like to really cry cry
They travel in the air
Go home
Tough girl, I'm in pain
With pencil and light
Because he's still there
Say good morning to
And you'd never hear me say
Yeah, the truth will set you free
And don't think I'll replace
Your star up there
Then I'll be the one to find you
Till then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
I've thought of everything from A to Z
And karma's not a liar
Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
Once you've fallen from classical virtue
Well, you're my friend
I never wanted anything more
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
Since I woke up today, up today
I can feel the rain, I can feel the rain
Maybe it's all we've got, but it's all I need
Hideaway,
Men who ran the company ran your life
A place for me
White shores are calling
I beat yo ass, keep talkin' back
Bright eyes, burning like fire
My old man plays the trombone
What if you dream of somebody new
And the way you would have laughed and talked fast or slow
I feel I know you
Did you hear about my friend
And the seasons of lies still like reasons are flowing, away
The fevers the heartaches
Well I made amends
We'll never leave this room
Thinking how blue it looks
You're gonna be swept off your feet
I'll say something that I'll grow to regret
I scream, no one hears me
Away from you
Everything
I'm thinking of what you said
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me
Still, I'm gonna keep your heart
I'm hiding from the kingdom come
And we hoped for the best
There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues
Why won't this just all go away
And I felt the fault was all mine
Or tear it apart
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
I'm a complicated situation
Wanna get into a car and go
Where she's loved
Oh, but those feelings ain't the same
I almost forgot myself there
It took him hours, start a punk rock band
'Cause you, you are the only one left
There will always be a light 
She tries hard not to cry
Where I was laid
I think of you and everything's okay
Taking my time, taking this drive
They, they just want pain
I beat yo ass, who bought you that
We're inviting you anyway 
Three months and I'm still standing here
Among your noise and fuss, I've let it go
Well this is the last time
And life must go on
How much I love you, no
They'd dream of being laid sidebyside, piecebypiece
To lake woods fields
I let 'em rub my neck and I write 'em a check
And I'm gone
Really anywhere you know"
One day soon I'll hold you like the sun holds the moon
Why do you choose that pain if only you knew
My grandfather's name
How do you love someone
Snakes in the grass beneath our feet, rain in the clouds above
All the city streets a wondrous chorus singing
Dishes, TV, bed
Time is tapping on my forehead
And I don't want to hear the sound, of losing what I never found
Take my thoughts for what they're worth
It's alright
And I looked in the mirror
With fists that are ready for more
What they did that made you sad
Let it fall
And I saw your face in everyone I swear
That was hunting
No sign of the things she used to own
Yes, it all makes sense now
Ah that's just not the way that friends behave
And with a malady of the soul
If I hurt you then I hate myself
Everybody was being real crazy
And I wait staring at the Northern Star
We've been had, I know it's over
Saturated loneliness
I wanna stay here 'til we've killed this bitter doubt
The world is full of diamonds
Songs I can't forget, what's been said
I'm so wasted on you x
White lips kissed
Love, love is going to lead you by the hand
'Cause I was almost honest
If you fall I will catch youI'll be waiting
This is a ballad for the good times
Dancing on the moon
All the martyrs with better ways
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
But I'd be foolish not to say
Oh no there ain't no help, it's every man for himself
You're the one I've been waiting for
I think of you from time to time
On a blade of grass
A boy and his friend
There's a heart I cannot hide
But you stand by me nonetheless
Waking light, your profile in shadow
I'm holding my breath
Tears are in your eyes
And it's over, it just started
Giving voice to the flame
For the ninetyseventh time tonight
Wearing the same dress she wore yesterday
I see your car parked on the road
All my friends keep asking why I'm not around
Comes rising up sometimes
"If we walk away, they'll walk away"
I wish I had all the money
So before you replace me
The lights are out Where'd everybody go
Spin the sky
And quickly look away
I've never dared to let
I could tell you I feel it's time for us
We got nowhere to go and no home that's left
What if I fall further than you
Yeah we all feel pain
Ooh  a sweet Clementine
All of your fears will pass away
Soon comes rain
Look back before you leave my life Don't leave my life
There I wait by the mouth
Walk down your streets
And I'm habitually feelin' kinda blue
Hot breath, rough skin
Push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care
I see the blood pool on the step
Trainwhistles, a sweet Clementine
I never tell a woman what to do with her body
Never gonna love again
So I'm up at dawn, putting on my shoes
Oh, how could anyone not want to try and help you
My suicidal dream
And, I will take a step back, and, I'll let you ahead
Too much too soon Hell yeah
She looked deep into you as you lay together
There is nothing within me now to gain
There's weight on your mind
I'm stuck on the ground
Some charity, a phone plan, a subscription to a magazine
When the rivers turn to roads
Flash of youth shoot out of darkness
And we plotted out my death
I wasn't born yesterday
From the woods, from the woods
Watching through windowsI'm wondering
And pulling all your threads saying
If I still had your number
Beautiful days are long gone
From the flower bed
I'd buy me a used car lot
Pretend that you owe me nothing
It's leaving but I don't know how soon
Clapped under our hands
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
I stare across the street and see the churches and the blue 
To the world outside
Tarot cards
And I wonder if I'm alone in your head
I was almost honest
In passing greet each other as if old, old friends
With this blind and broken heart
There's a few that stayed
Out in the frozen air
Know your own name
Three months and wake up
This is neither the time nor place
The phone sits on the windowsill
You could be my silver spring
From the ending to the ending
I'm taking a ride off to one side
They'll give us so much to forget
And these hazards of love never more will trouble us
And in these walls I feel your sadness wane
And I can't see clearly right now
I just replay it, love
I've been told that this will heal given time
I don't know if the world will end today
Then I'll return to you
I vow to come for you
Before you roll Those dice Don't do it, baby, no, don't do it, baby
We wasted so many days
Nothing seems to help me since you went away
I stopped taking dope
I'm never gonna get it together again
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
By the way
She said he was a most peculiar man
After your picture fades and darkness has
Friends tell me it's spring
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
That's what Mrs Reardon says, and she should know
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
And her hair in a fine mist floats on my pillow
Keep me safe from harm
If there's still time to turn around
What they did that made you happy,
I haven't found the one for me
'Cause you come swimming into view
Something so wild turned into paper
If you call me I won't be home
She stood burning in front of me
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
Guess it was his turn this time
I remember pleated skirts, black and white sattle shoes
And I'm getting old
Stuck inside of me
No they won't change a thing
How my eyes have tired
Are we breathing, are we breathing, are we wasting our breath
Don't look back
If somebody would just take my call
MARIANNE one for sorrow
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
I know I've been taught
And you come away with a great little story,
I don't know why
Let's make it up, let's even try
Throw your pain in the river
Scars love me when I fall
I would've said something like 'Hey dude I could buy and sell this place 
But she asked me to care for you
And I'm thinking two, is better than one
Here to see you through till the day's end
She tied you to a kitchen chair
Let the fat man drop
I'm feelin' weaker and weaker
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you
The policeman
In every man, in every hand
You're staring at a picture of me
To have a better life
You motherfuckers, you'll sing someday
I won't let nobody hurt you
Gimme all your love
Days are gray and the nights are black
Give me just a chance Give me just a chance
Will you ever return
Now I hear you in my mind
In between life and death when there's nothing left
The whole wide world is mine
And what I've thrown away
Every second every moment
It's crystal clear
Oh, you're my best friend
I rose from a dream
And all the people said "What a shame that he's dead
And we called it a home
I don't know why you're mean to me
Or get these bloodstains off my hands
The letters are sighing
I hesitate but answer it anyway
There all asking me to dance and sing
Oh now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Well I never tried to change you, honey I'm your biggest fan
The other woman enchantes her clothes with French perfume
Babababass down low
Three months and I'm getting better, yeah
You better open the door
The boy in the corner
Hotel rooms my only friend and friends like that just don't add up
Clean out the reds in my eyes to get by security lines
I'm cryin' in pain, cryin' in pain
My my blue thunder
I can never wash the guilt
It's all in your imagination dear
I envy the road
Those who care too much to see
I have a hard time standing up
And you hold the key
But all that I know is it's gonna happen
She said, "The slow fade of love
And if I could have just one wish
Sad song, last dance and no one knows who the band was
Not once did I think that
But I've been looking through slow, slow glass
Everybody's living or they're dead
Every time that I see your face
But we still can't go
Slipping off my shoes
And if I die, I'll die, I'll die alone like Jesus
And I was certain that the season
No matter how many times I tell myself
What's in your cake this time
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you
And I breathe, I breathe no
Away with this spilled milk
You'll never get away
It's all right
Halfway to heaven from here
Dark clouds eclipse, the sun won't shine again
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
No matter how haunting
Together again
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
We used to spend on dope
Not just from letters read to you
Come on, sister have a drink
Give everything to you
For a while I sat there staring at her photograph
Dirty stepped on lying out on the floor of their room
Wild flower in starlit heaven
Hello, I love you will you tell me your name
She made herself a pair of orthopaedic shoes
So I pretend I'm doing all I can
By the way,
I dreamt of a fever,
I'd put a knife right into his eyes
I never should've let you go
So I'm gonna give my heart to you
But they won't mean a thing
Stands alone in most walks of life
Or a car to take me anywhere
All along it was a fever
You have made me into a quiet man  look at me
That's when you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask
Life is too short, and you're almost dead" he said
When you're feeling moved
I was hoping I was hoping we could be raw together
Limbers up and falls timber down
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your PJ's
And no one will ever know
Three months and I'm still remembering
The place where I was freed
You should tell your gathering friends
Since life has led us here
Oh the things that summer brings
Two dollar color pictures from a photo booth
The lover speaks about the monsters
But love had lost its cause
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
Blood is like water
With one crushing blow
Pass us by
Have a seat at the bar
Do you do what you did when you did with me
Jealous lovers left behind
All of us now bent as we fall
With riverboat casinos and you still
'Cause I let you alone for long
Lights come on
You're used to wearing less, and now your life's a mess, so insecure you see
Oh, the tears that you weep
And there's no air or sound
Yelling and running 
And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight
When I pick them off the floor
It feels like tragedy's at hand
What that window door went to
Lies that lead you to the grave,
I get put in the back in a discount rack
You're wasted again
All the babies tucked away in their beds, we're out here screaming,
And I must be one
Can't stand still,
My body aches, it heaves, it shakes
And I have desired
And I would never lie to you, no
I can honestly say
Time keeps passing by, but it seems I'm frozen still
I know that there's others that deserve you hey yeah, hey yeah
Stop before you fall
There was love I meant
﻿House full of roses, a letter on the stairs
Need you more than dope
Inside a lonely world
Of someone that I used to be
You know you're just a mama's boy
Tomorrow has to wait
And I walked barefoot down the road
What could you be doing that is so much fun
Through the dark fall
Please beware the quiet front yard
He says that he'll raise him up
I thanked my sister for keeping my head above the water
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
Took off my worried shoes
Each time I say something I regret
Cause so badly I wanna go outside such a lovely day
Bet you know, which is why
Then we'll go our separate ways
And the holy dove was moving too
But even after all I still think of you that way, yeah
No one hears me
"The life that you thought through is gone"
Yeah, we were building a life
He's so cold raining on the world tonight
In pouring rain
This letter's written itself inside out again
When all the world is green
So scared to show intelligence
But at least the war is over
It's gotta be better than waiting
He said something to make you laugh
You say the weather doesn't sit with you
Where I go how far I don't know 
Did the captain of the Titanic cry high
Maybe, every time that he smiles
I'm having trouble breathing
We're fucked, we're fucked, we're fucked
Oh what's the fucking point at all
In sheets of shining memory
Go ahead and try
I'm so heavy tonight
I would like to think our paths are straight
You're coming back for me
"If you love something, give it away"
Come back tomorrow
I remember you best
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry
Don't blame your daughter
Ride away
No, I can't feel a thing at all
The stream can't contain such the withering rain
And tell me that all we had were lies
If women and men would come to follow
Don't you know
I got a million excuses, as to why you died
Not while I'm still so obsessed
Make their way to my door
We live in a beautiful place,
All souls pass
I wanna feel the way I did back then
Why are we so alone 
It's nobler to never get paid
And I turned home
But I've been living on the crumbs of your love
The blood stained the carpet
Of who we'll always be
Might just lose a little faith
There's a lot of things that I gotta do
Lose another blind game
The quill from a buzzard, blood writes the word
Again at the butcher's knife
Well, I wish there was someone
The speaker in this door is blown
I can't cry and I can't see
You had to finally walk away because of what it cost you
We have come now to the end
I need you more than dope
Which of us do you love
It's very cold here 
In your eyes
I'm in pain
Tears that fall from eyes
The vision softly fades
All that is gone
I'm broken, don't break me, when I hit the ground
I used to be the smart one
Couldn't relax, couldn't sit back
And people are being real crazy
I've got to get better
I know that this will hurt me
Seek the weaker till they've broken them
It's a complicated situation mama
If you can make a promise
Bad things
Just bird's eye view from the sky above
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
The towers had fallen
'Cause he's the only one that I have ever loved
Sweet love, tasty blood
You left the thing stinking
Stuck and I could never change
Losing her lover
Lately got to thinking that
Does he lay awake listening to your breath
"Does he ever get the girl "
My friends all say they're worried
Your eyes to the ground
Oh, these feelings should not be in the man
It's black in here blot out the sun
I've gotta drink you right off of my mind
It's late and morning's in no hurry
You looked like you'd been softened, like you never really loved the pain
When all is gone and can't be regained
There's a feeling
It only serves to show me that I'm still in love with you
All the angels kneeling to the Northern Lights
You've been slipping, been slipping away
Though you don't believe me
When there's a man on your back
Well it's lasted for a while
So your farther gone
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun does rise
As I walk these streets
The bottle is waiting
Maybe we could find a room
And if all we've got
For the slow fade of love
A cold sweat hotheaded believer
Well, I drug your ghost across the country
I guess you heard he's gone to LA
I am nothing more than to see you there
I think I feel a little hurt
And the bath water's cold
I dream all day that they would get me far
A most peculiar man
I hope you live forever
But everyday it never comes
And brother, don't you know
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
Why Samson loved Delilah
Dear Bradentown
Looking down a cliff it isn't fun it's communicating fear
Holds twentythousand days
What are we running for
And I'm never lonesome when I'm by myself
So don't need your salvation with promises unkind
My tears in the typing pool
And one's pointing his tree branch at me
Going fucking insane
It's not all she said
I think of that day sittin' down at the pier
This time I think I'm gonna stay
Do you believe
Turn my head and I can see you
I am the entertainer, I've come to do my show
Glaring over you and over you, this feeling of despair
Believing all that shit is gonna heal your soul
Every time it breaks, every time it's torn
How could I say goodbye
I hope you understand
And nothing stops it happening
'Cause they'll soon know where I live
And you are Caramel
And go your own way
No matter where you live
It's in your lamplight burning low
Someday we'll know
All of the reasons why
Would you have been a little genius, in love with math
I never said "Don't Go" don't go
I've been hungry all my life
Bleeding after beating his kid and she threw a shoe at his head
I have No way
To remind me of my cardinal sin
And upon the lips of everyone a curse they've never dreamed yeah
So, go ahead, go ahead
I got a question for you, ooh, ooh
Running round this house
For a long time
Until my head hurts
The sweat in your bed sheets
Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops
Till your singing eyes and fingers
To see your face, your smile
You fuckin' bitch, I hate you
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
Well the clock's heart it hangs inside its open chest
We're chained to the world and we all gotta pull
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
Let it rain let it rain, let it rain
'Cause come tomorrow morning we're off to the county fair
He said, if you dare come a little closer
And I know what this means
Hold my breath 'til communication is only just a test
Would you swallow me alive
What if there's always cups in the sink
And your friends on the road
Here's an evening dark with shame
Look and see the sky turn red
You know you'll find us here
All her friends call her "Alaska"
And she combed your hair and she kissed your teeth
I heard you fell into a rabbit hole
Burning on the bridge, turning off the lights
Will they see the sky again
Tells me everything and how we are
Maybe you got lost in Mexico
And I have the sense to recognize
They don't mean a thing
But in doing so, in letting you go
I want you to stay, stay
Does it mean that I can never change my ways
I shot for the sky
Someone worth walking on when you ask me to go
Cry, cause your drought's been brought up
Here is the time when we didn't speak
If you walk away, I'll walk away
Thinking of blue thunder
When winter sets in
In time to haze their eyes
As days go by
Love is, love is, love is, love is, love is
With the mind of a man in the middle
We were living on a fault line
They reminded me of yours
But the things you do for love are going to come back to you one by one
It's not much of a life you're living
And you should know that
And the picture frames are facing down
We meet at the lights, I stare for a while
'Cause it did not 
You're not alone
I have followed mountain bears
And everyone else has gone home
No they don't, they say they don't
Make it rhyme, take you in and make you mine
Act like there's nothing wrong
It's filled full of hope
The silver in your hair
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
I'm gonna see you every time I turn my back
When I awake, I'll see your face
The yearning to be near you
Into war's waters, I will wade
Teach Superman to fly
We're on the run, I can see it in your eyes
And she flies to a place
It's just a bird's eye view from, from up above
Sad things have to happen
You owe me something still
You could be the one to help me help myself
Once a vision from the woods
So I came back to Minneapolis
Having never ever planned to fall in love, Luv
I can't draw a lot of things
But now I know
Your spirit don't leave knowing your face or your name
Tryin' to get his mitts in my oven
And know your name
Or about her tonight
And run to the pines
Like in war no one can be blamed
The end's not near
All I do is wait and wait
I've broken every bone
Drop it to the floor
Drag our secrets to the sea
The cold wind blows right through my bones
I said we're all gonna be, yeah
It was a kind of soso love and I'm gonna make sure it doesn't happen again
I wish that I was stronger
And burning slow
We'll go to a movie
Yeah in fact we're almost strangers and I don't know how,
What really lies
They're foolish now
I wander lonely streets
One that wanted the floor
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh
My only hopes to see you
I don't care much for the gogo 
It's hard, hard to stand up for what's right
A stowaway that lived beneath this hull
Each day I cry
I climb the walls for oxygen
But they won't change a thing
Coma kid tell me how
Scope out every angle of unfair advantage
Why am I feeling so guilty
'Cause in my mind, I've been there,
Not I, I'm never gonna love again
You'd give anyone
Why aren't you here with me tonight
I don't know
Before my heart grew cold
And this is our town
Walks alone in most walks in life
And pull the smiles inside
The monsters are crazy
Tell myself you never loved me, no
And the sun's going down
For a while I cried and tried not to make a scene
And bring home the bacon each night
No one's gone in vain
Little bird, please don't stay
Into these twisted months I plunge without a light to follow
Adding scars to my heart
The hearts of all lovers
Do you remember dancing that night
Can feel your hand in mine
I come home on my own
It all comes down on me
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
No one lifts their hands
I've got a skin full of dope
And feast on your holiness
Watch the past go up in smoke
Far from the street
I fell into the ocean
And I still pour you a glass of champagne
Before I take a hammer to the walls around it
There's a statue of a girl,
Yet I know as I gaze at my young love beside me
Across the sea
Then I'll slowly drag one home
Nobody knows what she's holding back
On the parkway now
The rain comes down like a victory
To tell you all the things I never said before
Don't touch me this way
Frozen kiss by the fountain
You tried to see inside of me
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And there's blood on my sheets
Infinite silence
One at a time
And tonight will be all I have left to recall
I used to be the bright one
My sighs they ring victorious and fog this tinted glass
And you can tell the world
Kneeling above this playful body
The hint of these new tears are sharp I try to choke them back
Forgotten as soon as we meet
Burnt flavor you hold the big picture so well
Always thinking that you know
I love you, however
For to smoke the days away into the evenings
Would I turn away from you
I would be your only dream
Wait a moment until I'm gone
When I used to be someone
They are coming from the woods
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Then you look at me
Fundamentally evil
You know I'll be fine on my own
Take me in your arms and love me, love me
A beautiful magic love there
And burned the letters lover wrote
There's nothing lovelier, girl
I've played all kinds of palaces and laid all kinds of girls
I've heard her call to me The clouds are clinging to your sail
Take your woman by hand
This bitch is a Stan
You're making my heart bleed honey
It's a February night and I don't wanna feel anything
Oh, when skies are gray
I no longer love
'Cause the freaks are playing tonight
Never gonna love again, no not I
For you, your friends
When every back is turned
No drama, no time for games
Out of memory and time
Rip out the binding and tear the glue
I don't want to hate myself, don't want to hurt you
Behind our backs when mom would stay up late
I used to feel woebegone and so restless nights
The girl I shared with was away for the night
When there's nothing more to say
County building's on my ass
Fire fireworks
The plans I make still have you in them
Our hearts are as dark as the rain
My heart overfloods
Down the tracks
And the wind called out
I see you as you see me  look at me
I guess we both know we're in over our heads
Pass outside of your window
Happy birthday
These things go through you head
Certain things turn ugly when you think too hard
I've gotta tell you my tale
You'll be turning five
If you're gonna have a hit you gotta make it fit
White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
But, baby, this is serious
But I'd rather think there's nothing to be found"
It happens when you're hurtin'
Catch your breath,
Biding time will tell us
And you are
Our sidestepping has come to be a brilliant dance
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
All the things we've written in it
Day in, day out, my tearstained face
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
In all the world than you
Let the light shine the way,
With no need to return
Unengaged, dimlit love didn't taste the same
How good it feels seeing you today
Today
Please say you'll be waiting
And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
Won't, won't you read my mind
They ate up everyone like they were fishes
I don't know if I'll survive
I wish that I was good enough
So I put my hands up; I say, "Enough is enough
That I wish we were the same
I'd like to spend a day or two, but I can't stay that long
I will stay
It's lonely at the top, block outs and airplanes
The television man is here to show you how
Hello, I'm good for nothing, will you love me just the same
I sense there's something in the wind
Before the night is done
In a cold little mirror you were grown
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
And all the gardens bloomed a flower for each day I was away
Sing cause its obvious, sing for the astronauts, sing 
That love is a powerful force
And I'm surprised to hear you say
And pushing you far away
It can be like you said
Covered yourself up in snow
Like the way life scattered
Before you know it's come and gone, too soon
Come and turn the lights down so I
And an old movie house
It's me and the moon she says
Yeah you, send a little love my way
Oh, Does he know that place below your neck
And I drive this ocean road and remember
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
But I know one day it's gonna happen
Now and always you
I noticed emotion
We can never catch up to it as fast as we run
'Cause I've relied on my illusions
And many times we've shared our thoughts
There's no time to decide
Oh, how could anyone not love the terrible things you do
I went away alone
Lamenting policewomen, policemen
That lingers in the afterwards
There's no tears
In the shape of a woman
Here it comes
If you knew I was dying would it change
The idea of perfection holds me
I know I'll be fine on my own
It becomes clear, this is all we got
I warned you not to drive
The party just gets better and better
But life is long, my love has gone away from me
Ooh, we've all been victims of a crime
Yeah, we are far less than we knew
Scooping up the soul of the wine
I got to breathe
But it's filled full of hope
Walk out on a limb leaning on a cloud that isn't still reveals
I wanna know
The waiting's everything you know
I hear the songs and the words don't change
And you know  yeah, you know
Comfort the man
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Still enchanted in flight
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
Don't say what you're about to say
First, you think the worst is a broken heart
One day I'll go
And I'd love to stay but there's bills to pay
And I'm never gonna love again
It's not so hard to make that sound
I was walking slow to a dirty dive
The things you think at times like these
Whiterobed small voices praise Him
And I breathe, I breathe no more
Won't somebody come take me home
I am the entertainer, I bring to you my songs
And you know what mommy
And I know you never meant to make me feel this way
I know what lies beneath
I've got to find genius Caramel
He knows, she's been here too few years, to be gone
Not in the name of love
The small of your back, nape of your neck
But until that day I'll find a way
Could I kiss you and make you a queen,
Just to call his own
Fred Jones was worn out
I can't get over how she set me free
Gave you my heart
Gonna fall into the sea and they'll know
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
I don't think that you'll be back
Time after time
All that you believe is here and now
Oh, when skies are gray, and gray, and gray"
Cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten
My lonely soul brothers
But I don't wanna live this lie
The spartan Mule and The Crippled Cow
Who cares what cowards think, anyway
Everything was free and everything was fast
You stole it, I beat yo ass if you say that game is broken
Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse Because he said he's gonna punish us, the socalled Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel We are the Israelites according to the Bible The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee So, just like your children, your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America I love you, son, and I pray for you God bless you, shalom
Yet you're wasted again
Running into the sea
Felt clean for just a little while
And you've got to clean up this mess
Then one night she climbed into the picture frame
Oh, there's nothing more to it
But you would not let me
Remember waiting for you to call
Rest your eyes in waking light
De tanto eu te falar voce subverteu o que era um sentimento e assim
You fucked up my life 
And I wish I could steal it
Riding home everyday
My, suicidal dream
All I want is someone who can fill the hole
Waiting here in line, hoping that I'll find what I've been chasing
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
The winter birds have come back again
If I don't stay on the charts, oh
There's no one that can take you home
I'm so sick and tired of trying to change your mind
Here's a good one
But you still carry on
O my heart, o my heart
I was stronger
Do you wanna know
But I still wonder why
Nothing I dream
But among your books, among your clothes
You lie for what you're worth
But I can't catch my thoughts
Safe in my arms
'Cause no one ever turns to me to say
From a shellfish or a sheep
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen
Well honey I can see your house from here
Happy Birthday
I know you were not new
All the days came, made us older
Our crooked dreams will always glow
And I know you're on to me
Close your eyes so you don't feel them
I drive, drive these roads
Keep pulling me close to home
Alone
William & Margaret
"Can you see the sky turn red
I'm letting you go
And you said yes I said I don't believe in revenge 
And I give myself three days to feel better or else I
Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirit's well
EightySix Charlie came over
Saying, "Ho, have you ever said an honest word"
In every sky above my head
'Cause you are my star
Oh the reason I hold on
EightySix Charlie, he came back
Why should I play the fall guy to your love
I know the sun will rise,
That her father gave to her
Someone said the truth will out
I've got to get rid of this hole inside
And hand you a square of the airport
And I ain't got no mercy
ver buscando o sentido daquilo que voce ouviria displicentemente
Don't always need to do it by yourself
When the laughter fades away
I'll love you forever Caramel
With apparitions of your soul
Everybody has their reasons, that's the reason we're all going to die
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
And your lack of shame comes naturally
And it takes me all the way
I can only try to make it right
EightySix Charlie, he came back, he came back
Kate claims she can't depend on me
I was hoping I was hoping we could heal each other
It is a Thursday 
But sometimes hate is not enough to turn this all to ashes
Do you want me back
Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush
Nothing I am
We're wild and on the run
I held up and robbed a hard liquor store
Is this what it feels like to really cry
Why's it always you
I found a letter that said, "I'm sorry that you were asleep when I wrote these words down"
Oh, why is everything so confusing
And I know the cause
How the time flies, even with the blink of an eye
Don't go, please don't go
Never got to begin
By leaving your town again
And so are you
Do you want me back 
The things we've written in it
I should know better than anyone ever could
We'll be lost before the dawn
You ride with both hands
I'm staring at the sky
But I swear that I would follow anything
Can't find another way around
I need to know should I fight for love
And my body was weak
All face down
So there won't be far to fall
And I just have to look away
Away with this dirty dishwater
Shine on for everyone
But in a moment you'll feel no pain
Bet you know this
I saw the stars spelled out SAVED
But your love is alright
There is this thing keeping everyone's lungs and lips locked 
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
Their breath is as sweet as
Would you still leave me here
When you start to raise your head
We all deserve something
The memories will remain
You told me boy look the other way
But I wish it would rain
Eu sei, nao e assim, mas deixa
While you're picking pebbles out of the drain, miles ago
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
The asshole sports that I never played
Scars are left behind, but some too deep to feel
But you're the one who can succeed
And all of your timing has gone
But to imagine a fall
If my love comes across
You could be so cold
Please always stay
Certain things just happen when you make no plans
Hold me here, hold me here
You're only better off in half your life
I'm softly walking on air
And they will shake their heads and wag their bony fingers
Then believe that we have lost our eyes
How will I break the news to you
The war is over
And you will kiss the ring
It was me and a gun
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Every Saturday night I get dressed up to ride for you
Through the tarlatan holes
But I feel heavy, like floating, at the bottom of the sea
And I don't know, this could break my heart or save me
Tall rock shelf
Swallowed in the shadows that glow
It's not the same as running
In the background
I ponder it frequently while I'm sipping on my beer
Told me how he's driven by a curse
Oh, how could anyone not want to rip it all apart
Crowd surf off to sea, float toward the beach
And we will lie like river stones, rolling only where it takes us
No there's no starting over,
When the wolf comes home
Some angel is stuck inside me
We were made to never fall away
A place for me in your heart
You're doing all these things out of desperation,
I barely go before you
Feed Jacky's gerbil and try to stay clean
I had just said no for the final time
What a rainy ending, 
All the world's history gradually dying of shock 
I believe I believe in possibility
If you could stay like that
My life is shit and piss
Si un jour la vie t'arrache a moi
Funny how those compliments can 
Failed to stop my heart from breaking in two
Will I win or lose if I go or if I stay, yeah
And you are their jailor
The fool might be my middle name
They let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind
People watching with a cold, blank stare
With no one at all to catch you
Or even hello
He lived all alone within a house
Eu disse e nem assim se pode evitar
And laughed and said we're at the top of the food chain 
What if there was no light
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
That's my fault
You stay the night at his house
Their minds are on trial
People, this hurt I feel inside
All the time, oh
Say what you say, say it like a cat
Let's televise and broadcast
And I can see everything
She got darling hazel eyes
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'm too busy to be heartbroken
But though there are caveats galore
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
There's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet
It's all heart and lungs
To be washed away slow
For no reason but jealousy
Don't get caught up on the evil things
Embrace me, assure me
It's just a lyrical lie
And in time you will forget me
At the empty place inside
Which way is down
Remembering your life, 'cause we wish that you were here
And it's left me with a chemical dependency for sanity
If there's no one there
Let me surround you, a sea to your shore
Hanging round the bars at night, wishing I had never been born
And now I know 
Do what you like and do it honestly
And then you kissed me
In this devil town
Whooping cranes and woodland beings
No comparing, secondguessing, no, not this time
You and I had to be the standing joke of the year
Is anybody here I know
With one good kiss
And I will know without remorse or regret
You said always and forever
I'm a man and I got my pride
I'm fine right where I am
No matter how sad
Those kind of thoughts can be so cruel
I know you regret it, love
I feel the world is tumbling
That I could look straight in the eye
I'm in the background 
Seems I never get your kick quite right
When all the world was green
I wanna hold you in the dark
Steal away where only angels tread
Another serenader and another longhaired band
And even know your friends tell me you're doing fine
For every fear that can't be named
How many times have you told me now that you've tried
I got your number
I go to some bar room
The smallest dreams got pushed aside
Holes in its throat where the blood was drawn
His note said, "If living is the problem, well that's just baffling"
Away from all welcome mats
She said, "I'm off in an hour, and I know where we can go"
I've gathered all my money and I'm goin' to town
Don't say
It's a long way down
I hope you too will understand
For my land locked blues
The dark was filled with dread
It hurt, I'm not a liar
We're all taking the same steps
So many answers I can't find
Took too much and now I'm done
But must hold inside yourself
But you can always come around
And the night will come
You remember those simple things
Its alright
I've never cared
I haunt the halls of medicine at night
You're the leaky sink of sentiment
The light on at your window
It finally dawned on me tonight
The ink is still drying
All that I feel for or trust in or love
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
You don't know why they had to go this far,
Is chased away
You saygo slow
From offices to farms
Trust in me through closing years
Sometimes I'm wondering
Yes, it struck me that love is sport
Don't call me love, don't call me
She ripped my heart out beating
Into the hole that I have dug here,
And there's nowhere left to fall
The things I did not know at first, I learned by doing twice
You think you might just crawl back in bed
And all will turn
You'll be free, child, once you have died
You put up walls,
I got nothing to rely on
Anything you want it can be done
Did you know how much I love you
We left the restaurant where the head waiter in his s said 
Oh, ooh, oh my love
PATRICK still we sing
And all the things they took
We burn ourselves to hell
Dieu reunit ceux qui s'aiment
When the bottle gets empty
If not the moon will us guide
Liz likes to liquor up my thoughts
I'm cryin' in pain, cryin' in pain cryin' in pain
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
And I'm not tryin' to take away Oh no
I have a smile stretched from ear to ear
Waiting for my life to start
I will stay, I will stay
Shards of me, too sharp to put back together
No footsteps on the ground
Love my name
You said, always and forever, is such a long, lonely time
Ooh, baby
If it's a broken arm then brace it
It seems these kinds of questions, they come too easy to you now
So now you know, you know it all
And we can talk it round again girl
And I knew there was someone that loved me
That organ's playing my song
C'est la vie
I'm writing songs to entertain
I gave into the loneliness
You've heard my latest record spin on the radio
I know I can't be with you
We're all just victims of a crime
It's a beautiful place to be wasted, don't you know
When the accusations fly, hold tight
Would that change a thing
You threw our love away
Hoping you are doing the same
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
Broken, lovelorn on your rocks
Get its wings on
I want the truth
I've been a moonshiner
Like backgammon and Life
And hold your own
Are the things that make you panic Go your own way
All of the time
Nothing wrong, nothing right
You are in my dreams
Have yet to see a soul
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
I missed my time, I don't think I could stand
Now I step into the line
I see things you were too tired
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer
So I was wrong 
You like all these things
A broken heart that the world had forgot
And I've look upon it for so many years
God bless them handsome men
Sing for the bartender, sing for the janitor, sing 
It's soft edge might cut you
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Open Sesame we've places to go
There's an angel on my shoulder
The thrill of blood comes instantly, there's only darkness at the finish
Only two more days until your birthday
Three months and I'm still sober
You ain't coming back
Oh, I'll be getting closer
You've been the sweetest part of my life so long
It's just the way I feel
Resting in my chair
Now your back's to the road
Come on tell me boy
No heaven couldn't wait for you
I heard a song and turned away as piece by piece you performed your story
Sense of joy fills the air
If your thoughts should turn to death
So I'll just change direction
By tomorrow I'll be leaving
I won't waste a single day
The Faces stay the same
But the song's gone on too long
You wished you could change in the lazy summer
During the day but
I can't help falling out of love with you
I see your beautiful smile
And no of course we can't be friends
You're in the car on the way to the movies
A dance that lasted for a while
At least I can say that I never been a quitter
Eu sei, nao e assim, mas deixa eu fingir e rir
So many monsters
I watch the stars crash in the sea
Ruined my mind like a snake in the orchard
Father, can we start over
So I must get out of this
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
Maggots put on shirts
And I've got my new red fetching leather jacket
My aching heart would bleed for you to see
Full of grace
The salty water's underneath your feet
Nothin' nice about me almost everyone agrees
I push it to the limit 'cause I just don't care
Safe in my heart
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
I'll be back again
You have come to journey's end
That my heart's been hard to find
Will lessen in the moonlight
Everybody hurts
Another night
Made up in my mind
And I would've had a hard time feeling compassion for him
But it's all I have to believe in
I'll stay with you
It's left me feeling tired and exposed
Looking right through the lens
'Cause I stay winning
Baby you got me checkin' in my rearview mirror
If only things were black and white
It hurt as a child, tied down
I smoke your brand of cigarettes
As we dance through the dark
She is on the other side
I remember every look upon your face,
The doctor told her years ago that she was ill
Tepid water chase the pills
The view is beautiful
And all still to come
And freeze to spread skeleton wings
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
Paid for the murder before they had determined the sex
That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side
And one name read that nobody really cared
It could be the end of the world as we know it
My dear Brena
We walk slow now, but we still have each other
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would have been
I said I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry
And I didn't think you'd ever find me here
I hold your casket gently walking to the grave
Love would stay till I come back
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
But still it's much too long, to let hurt go you let her go
You marry a role and you give up your soul till you break down
And so I ask where are you now
Stand there and look into my eyes
Mandala destroyed by the sea
Can you guess that I'll be gone
I told you this that night
Like the horses of the
Oh, my lady, lady I am loving you now
But you're going on nonetheless
I never wanted anything more more
And I don't wanna lie but I don't wanna tell you the truth
You're coming back to me
Baby you said watch my head about it
I'm walking empty streets
I climbed up a mountain, and looked off the edge
My feelings free
And the third is when your world splits down the middle
She thought it was the answer to the fashion blues
Like the stone face of your lover
Because if seeing is believing,
But darling dear get a grip
That won't stop this drinking
By the grace of God
When I'm so all alone
And everything will escape and I'll know
'Cause its all smiles and business these days
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
We let go of the rest
So when you see me falling backwards down the wall that says I'm still alive,
But if no one calls and I don't speak all day 
I held my breath as I watched you swing, then run your fingers through your hair
Someone came and washed away your hardearned
You know I was just a stranger
Instrumental
And there's no way around it
Bring you up, call you down, sign your name, secret love
Is it a kind of shadow
You come in on your own
Riding horses cloaked in gray
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child
No one sees you here, roots are all covered
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
In Portland I tried my pretty hand at fishing
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
You say it's only me, and, that I'm so perfect for you
Say hello, goodbye
Don't dream away your life
To see what I might spend
Change your heart 'cause I am already spoken for
But I do believe
It's hard but you know it's worth the fight
I had to watch my tone for fear of having you feel judged
It's all right, I'll be fine
Ooh  to heaven from here
And other people got their own reasons for homicide
You came out a little faulty
If nothing is safe then I don't understand
I'm with you, I'm with you, yeah yeah
Saw the back of your sweet mother's head
The wind through your bones is all that remains
Because I know there's nothing we can do
She's gone
Memories of children's dreams lie lifeless, fading, lifeless
My broken life will never stay
Laura are you still living there
Twisting in my head
And I'm phoning my friends
If you stay baby, stay with me
There's still fountains down there
Wanna get your mitts in my oven
And you love a stone
Break all of their wings and make sure that it crashes
Drinkin' 'cause you're lookin' so good in your Starbucks cup
My only sunshine
If you see him say hi
The fallow field that will yield no more
Everywhere and every way I see you with me
You hold the big picture so well
I used to think about you all the time
I am giving up on making passes and
You know I'm leaving here tonight 
Let love take away all this pain
Let the water come
There are some school kids 
And got me through these years
They're glistening like diamonds
My baby called me up to say
Another one in the casket Ananother one, ananother one
Six in the morning
With his feet inside your shoes
It's just the chance we took
You stayed up, left to dry, Now you're crumbling
I think that what he did was wrong 
They are calling
That if you're by my side,
I've faith that there's a soul somewhere
Now we see things as in a mirror, dimly
I only know because I 
And we walked through this land
You son of a bitch, you fuckin' ruined my life
In the morning I'll find you,
We've been had, you say it's over
He was a most peculiar man
The world's gonna end
If it's the same for you I'll just hang, the same for you
And I don't go really anywhere, you know"
Proud to have been a step up on your way
Are there really ones like these
And you've already got me coming undone
When it's so easy to disconnect mine
I wonder, do you still think of me
Those who say the past is not dead
Hey, you can tell the world
Well, my husband he's leaving, and I can't convince him to stay
I've got to let you go
Cancel our dinner with Max and Coraline
When the blue sky turns to grey
Why am I holding my breath
Echo in rooms
Maybe I'm a target for people that are bitter
And look at me without you 
Just when that day is coming, who can say, who can say
And memories we've saved,
Dry your eyes, you poor devil
In dreams, I meet you in long conversation
How dark it gets this time of year
One last kiss, one only, then I let you go
You're still my everything
I'll see you on the other side
The grey ceiling on the earth
Still you will and love me
Don't let me know what you've said
Locked inside
Evening time
And hope someday you'll find it in your heart
And tell you that I landed somewhere
So many voices, and nothing is there
Anyone who'll throw an arm around you, yeah
Yellow walls are lined with portraits
Wind has burned your skin
Shine on for everyone ahah 
So I just don't have the time
In every kiss you understand
But I'd rather not get into that
Lie whit me one last time
"Let's hang about
How can you know it if you don't even try
Oh, what a shame
Now every time I get close to the edge
So keep calm, honey I'ma stick around
I don't care no more, no
And she turned me into sand,
All these poses of classical torture
Oh tear his heart out cold as ice it's mine
There is this thing that's like touching except you don't touch
I've been looking in the mirror for so long
But my mind is made up and I'll never let you in again"
When I pretend, tend, tend, tend
But you don't really know you know
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even know he's right beside you
The party's just begun
I beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
Of the woman that loves you
No time for love, no time for hate
I'm lookin' for a place
What does it matter, a dream of love or a dream of lies
And everyone turned their backs, 'cause they knew
But faith
Up and out that cellar door
But I wept with your movements
Straight sound like the end of the world or armageddeon man
Now you got a little brother, maybe it's really you
But I know, I know that's just a sky
Everybody screams
With time dissolves
Accumulated  times over throughout the years
I know we need to talk
You said, always and forever
I am giving up on half empty glasses and
She's the silk lining my bed
Santificado sea tu Nombre
I'm wasted
He doesn't need to trouble his good soul
They need to find another way for people I talk to
I'm alone and I feel empty
Do you remember the times we would give up on each other and get back together
Who once gave just one rose, one day, years ago
It's just a different point of view
We live in a beautiful place
She thought it would be fun to try pornography
The alarm clock's going off
There's a lot of things that need to be done
My friends have changed, a few did last
We might be dead by tomorrow
And I can't take these feelings with me
The past is done we've been betrayed
Earth is no more, why don't you burn this muh'fucka
And let's love loud
He climbed the stairs and the gallows groaned
This world is full
Hideaway
And he wanted the sun
And supposedly you can crawl right through me
Quem e mais sentimental que eu
You've only got to prove your need
There's more in a smile than in a hand
I found myself staring at the closed oak door like the day she threw me out
I'd give all I have, honey
In all the world than making love to you
Mommy, why your own child
All lines have broken and we need you to hold on
If you find me, hide me, I don't know where I've been
I've heard there was a secret chord
And Laura's asleep in my bed
Like blood it covers over me
It's never to become
Well what about the man that I saw handcuffed in the emergency room 
It has a way of crystallizing the bad times
So misunderstood
Don't feel the cold or wind or rain 
And I came home to the love you gave
I can't forgive, can't forget 
Ease the pain, would set the house ablaze
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen
It's like the wind changed your mind
I'm wanting to forget
"My family tree, is my history" *echoes*
A criminal who drinks champagne
They're unable to know
Melted away like I was free
And wait for the fire to spread
I was hoping I was hoping we could dance together
Thats why I change my name
And I love you more than I did before
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job
The wind will soon blow it all away Yeah 
Only to trip at the sound of goodbye
'Cause every gift and every letter
I like my beats fast
Who walked upon the moon
You've nothing to be ashamed of
Damn, man
Motherfucker, I fuckin' hate you, fuck you
An angel girl with an upturned face
Rest your daughter while your mother cries
When the letter says a soldier's coming
In an attic, in a house, in the dead of night
But I still love her so
Her window was hung like a painting
Warm laughs and smiling
Screaming and crying wife
When you went away
Singing But I pulled you and I called you here Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Sooometimes
You told me boy hide those hands
I could try to smile to hide the truth
Until we vomited blood
From the good man that he is
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
And the waves break
That not everything is gonna be the way
So when do I give up what I've been wishing for
Everything will be okay 
And don't say that she's pretty
At the center of the world
And I'm afraid to be alone
Suicidal, suicidal, suicidal dream
The kind of thoughts I got
Still I sit in diner Citylight
We wished we never had
Afraid of the fall that never ends
And I wonder how mine would taste
I woke up this morning, and played our song
Then there's no one there
She said, "Nobody here can live forever
'Cause she didn't have time
I know it's true
Lay your head where it burns
Reminders of you
There was no other way
Skeleton
As they crawl back under the stones
For those dying days
Ignorance was bliss
So was never known on which they choked
Will there be someone left to sing your blues
Some animal lies in the pasture
I found you on a Saturday and that was where I lost you
They are four for each other
After Mario got busted
And That I see a darkness
He said, "When it's gettin' kinda rough over here
Girl I thought that you'd never do me that way
You can only see me through a clouded sphere  look at me
The page turns on me and you
You know that I love you, but look at what lovin' has done
On the hearth with his feet up
From that job that makes you sleep
And now come the tears, heavy and hot
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Frost or flame
Is ours alone tonight
We're not the same, I wish that could change
Compass gone, he long has lost his way
The sky cracked open and the thunder groaned
In a very short time
When you're sleeping in someone else's bed
As she gets up from the floor
That I should stare at 
Hold your breath until you see the light
Quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer"
You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
If only we could stay
Like a little bit of revelation
'Cause it's not my fault
She's the only thing I trust
Cheap flights from Paris to Bangkok, I thought it was nonstop
But you know you're not alone
I've never been anywhere cold as you
With their love begging bowls
How the girls can turn to ghosts before your eyes
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed
We would laugh and get high, and never answer the phone 
And it's not a cry you can hear at night
And live by the mountains Caramel
And pulled me from the grass
Through shadows falling
And I kissed a girl with a broken jaw
I'm drunk and so is everyone else
The sun and the moon, an ocean of air,
If it's a broken part, replace it
In a place where I can feel the beating of your heart
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like a jewelry store case
You're better now than ever, and your life's okay
And do you know Carolina
Slowly I'm losing your face
The game is over
Is nothing new
And I wanted the whole
Oh God, what have I done Ooh
And fuck, your own child
There's some things you gotta know
Me and Jesus a few years back
And I cannot sleep without the radio on
Or should I lie with death my bride
Sometimes hate is not enough to turn this all to ashes
And nobody seems to know where you go
Some devil, some angel has got me to the bones
Even though it's not his baby
In your search to find
I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll fight for you, I will, I will, I will
Factorytown
I never will, amen
I know you're late for your next parade
So stay
Breaks baby, it's torn baby, every storm
Unabridged for so many years
Oh what have I done, why have I done it
Givien him all that I could
You know she begs me not to hit her
You and I both know this all too well
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams, he worries
I had no choice, I erased the debt of our family
This is as quiet as it gets
I was longing to be free
I'm still waiting for you
And most don't even last the night
To be free of all the pain
You showed me love was all you needed
Oh you're my best friend
I hope she'll give me a place
Margaret, array the rocks around the hole before we're sinking
And you are a friend indeed
It says
But I don't love you anymore
Everybody seems so far away from me
Push it to the limit 'cause I just don't care
The time that you danced with me
It seems like every time I try to make it right
Time after time time
How your body felt beside me
We've all been victims of a crime
The gymnast, high above the ground,
I had a premonition a movie in my mind
But it gets me nowhere
If you wanna get with me
This cities just cementaries enhaced
To go our separate ways Oh no, no
And it's cold
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
Yeah you send a little love my way
Anything to take from your mind
One of these days letters are gonna
I told you this that night,
Suddenly I see you change
And I just wish I was back home
With the world's most populous drinking areas, you understand
When the longing returns
You hear them say with smiles meant to cry
Look away from the sky
I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance
I tripped and fell and did I fall
And all I've wished for has come to pass
Go ahead and burn it down
They are one person
Even only  hours under your touch
Got to be so completely
With the loneliest eyes
As we were talking outside it was cold
Kneel into the frozen lights
Somethings will never wash away
I won't cry when the silver lining shows
And lay your hands over me
A curling fox in a hole
Along a river of flesh, can these dry bones live
It gets harder everyday
Quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer
If I'll ever feel the same love
There was always someone carrying
As autumn turns its back on me again
How should you know when you've never been here before
It's a complicated situation
Although we can't jitterbug as we did then
A million miles between us
And I daydream and I stare
Where you gonna run when they come for you
A nice little housewife, who'll give me a steady life and not keep going off the rails,
Don't know, don't know if I can do this on my own
So she would not cry as she lay in your lap
And each album I get shit on a little more
And it's going to cause a crisis
Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
The fortune inside your head
The surface
Oh how I wish that it would rain
And she could take your life
We've got a lot of catching up to do
I've got to get over
The purpose buried every day,
Nevermind what God said
And I can hear you say
At a point between two tracks
Like I'm making a bad mistake 
Worried you smoke too many cigarettes
I baby, I baby you bet your life baby
'Cause I don't care no more
You'd think after  years I'd be used to the spin
All of the reasons
A tape full of messages for anyone who cares
Baby, don't go away, come here"
But you won't forget me
When the hunger descends
Oh nights so loveless, love
And he'll drive all over town
To take the test, I'm feeling sick
With blackout hearts, the flowered news
Never had a chance to pause to get a better glance
I remember everything as I drive
All of us now breathe it like smoke
Saying, "come on, come on
Romantic tales of distant years
China all the way to New York
I said, "Hey, what troubles you"
I just get through it
Oh darkness I feel like letting go
It's been years since I saw you
I know you tried
I just can't help but to wonder
You saw her bathing on the roof
I wanna hear you lie
In the hall where you had your first kiss
You'll be resting on my mind
It scattered easy in her hand
Some hair from a horse
You know I never claimed
Oh, the ocean rolls us away, away, away
Under the deep red light I can see the makeup slidin' down,
You left behind some clothes
On every face you'll ever know
Twelve days gone by, since I have saw you last
And we followed the road
Hear it fight, hear it roar
It will pass away like a slow parade
And I'm a courtside killer queen
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't care
And I've figured out with all that's said and done
I wish we could go to hell
And the dead are all living
Is saying goodbye
Standin' at the door of the pink Flamingo cryin' in the rain
Did they make you stay up all night
It's hard, hard when you're here all alone
And the best that you could hope for
I had one friend in high school, recently he hung himself with string
Just like I said
Throw this book away
That sleepy person lying next to you
Yes, this is love for the first time
And we are beginning
I wish I was dead, and you're breathing
But found no joy in what was sung,
And some say this can't be real
I think I could last at least a week without someone to hold me 
Your game is tired
Terrifies me still
On the cross, my faith cannot be tossed
To let everybody know that you're coming back
Listen, the birds sing
Watching shadows melt
No one's so sure if her crime had a reason
Find the words to say goodbye
Was , surviving my return to Saturn
Well, baby, anyone can change
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh, ah oh
Nothing's real until you let go completely
A breath between us could be miles
They say with crippled grins
No no there ain't no help, it's every man for himself
Maybe one day we can meet face to face
Don't hurt me this way
For each day a striking distance
Noiselessly across the floor Dancing at the funeral party
And everything has changed
Still on my brain, yeah
You could have let him fly
'Cause a people united
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
And my face gets sick
Together we'd float so delicately
But I, I'll never forget you
But here in the city that never sleeps
I can feel the distance as you breathe
Will stay you in your steps
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
Give me just a chance
Our bedroom
I wait, but I'm too tired to play pretend
The postman
As she makes up her eyes
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Maybe someday you'll really get to know me
Well, everything's so different now
As for me, well I'll find someone who's not goin' cheap in the sales,
He'll drive all over town
I was scared to call your mother
And fuck your own child
And I said I haven't been eating chicken or meat or anything 
I too once thought life was cruel
Than tears that fall from eyes
Three months and I still mmm, oh
If you fall I will catch youI will be waiting
Who catch my tears
She's looking like a queen
When all their power turns into vapor
And I said you're willing to tell me this now and
In a place that's warm and dark
There are diamonds in demand
All that is left is a heart made of tears
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
Slow fade of love
There's nothin' but the rain
Except when she got deathly high
And your money' and when I walked by he said, 'thank you too dear'
They who wish to hurt you
To say what I want changed
Just get me through this night
I'm lonely here tonight
Top in my class
It's hard for me to say you were my soul
On all these bruises and scars
You know tomorrow
And I carry this
With the satellites and the roving drones
If I don't stay on the charts
I'm walking too far ahead
Maybe two is better than one
To keep looking ahead at your future
Oh was a perfect day
So many faces, I don't know the names
I see that you get home alright
You hold inside
I've seen this world before
Tonight is real
All of the seasons
The words you're trying to say
I hope I mumbled goodbye as you walked out the door
Of my heart
As you walk through the light
I see you've got your smile back
And four and six have come and gone
I can only imagine what you're painting, what you're painting
So I will never look for love again 
Don't say what you're about to say
It's the slow fade of love"
And the song you sing today
Oh remember, please remember oh
And turned into a castle for some towering queen
Broadcast to each house, they drop your name
Shoshana was jonesing
Twilight, I fall in the harbor
We will put this flesh into the ground again
It's always bittersweet
When it ends alright
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
The windows for sleepin'
I can finally say we're through
Your head rests and slumbers
I'm still in my bed
I cannot forget
And I'm thinking ooh I can't live without you
And we fall asleep again with ties to mend
The TV's playing it all out of town 
The world around us disappears
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
Before the end of me and you
All the way from Philadelphia
And the world's got me dizzy again
Can't go home obviously
You're my one true friend
Stop me from feeling what I'm feeling now
As the city sleeps tonight
I looked in your eyes
It was such a funny feeling
You're calling to me, I can't hear
It's all over but the crying
Before you forget
They'll think you're up to something
They'll always be failures
The only place
I'll never forget you
And it's leaving you with such a heavy heart
You remember when we kissed
Please don't cry 
Every time I pass a filling station
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
I am not going back
And you said watch my head about it
We'll raise an empire from the bottom of the sea
Waiting to hold you
Now it just feels weird that there you are
Oh, and how many times will I let you get away with murder
But I know that that's impossible now
Oh maybe I'll build my house on your cloud
I know that this will break me
Oh babe, I've never been so lost
Take me in your arms
The slow fade of love"
Whistling my consence to make me cry
I can't breathe
She shakes underneath the pouring rain
Hand in hand with fear and shadows, crying at the funeral party
And all the stars didn't wanna play 
Don't you come for me
When we were only kids
I don't really know 
Walked out of the past and into the bar
'Cause I must sometimes see you
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
The loveliest words whispered and meant
Say, love's confined, on Earth
It seems, for years and years
To offset my fucked up family land
Don't be afraid of what they'll say
And falling in your eyes
But everyone she knew thought she was beautiful
What they say 'bout me reveal
He thinks he owes some kind of debt
'Cause I can't forget you
We are the pray
Take me by the hand
I only want my mind to be clear
It's the slow fade of love
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail
One of these days the sky's gonna break
Tell me this is just a dream
Even if you don't show up on time
With love in my heart
I only wanna be kind
I'm coming home to you,
But I believe in divinity
What if our baby comes home after nine
You know something had to go
The land is unchanged
That I've been desdesperately alone
On silver mount zion
When I forget how to talk, I sing
From that place on the carpet
On a bathroom floor
Living with this crime
You haunt me with your violent heartbeat
But you told me your love was blind
Why no one told me so much work
So you can't hold them liable
Sure in a cinematic way
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
There are times
Sweet love tasted blood
But I will pay this time
They smiled patiently with disbelief
Back in the days where the magic exists
And I'm the one who tells you
Sometimes I'm just happy I'm older
As they wind a watch wrapped on a wrist
Great white wings beating
I damn to hell every second you breathe
So watch your back, the Ides of March
Big monster lover
Now I'm back on my beat
To make these nightmares go away
And as the years go by the other woman
Today I am your champion, I may have won your hearts
Is this as hard as it gets
I couldn't get up for my shift today
The moon so thick, the wounds so fresh
Waiting for something
Each time I go 
So many questions, I need an answer
Red and yellow pink and green purple and orange and blue
Been hurting low from living high for so long
Collage of broken words and stories full of tears
You keep me high minded
I threw my hands in the air and said show me something
The boy next door turned out
Feeling how it turns
Beautiful, only temperamental
'Cause you know you've got the truth on your side
Don't cry for audience
And all was alive
But there's a light that still remains
If everything we've got is slipping away
It must have been the season that threw us out of line
You said wouldn't it be a shame if I knew how great I was 
Light the night
And the sixth is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little
I would never lie to you, no
We don't seek death, we seek destruction
I don't know when
And the sun sets low
To see you walking down the road
There's going to come a day when you feel better
Choosing our life over your life meant your death
I was hoping I was hoping we could be creamy together
And the peoples' hearts were pounding, they were throbbing, they were red
And nothing works, just living hurts
Don't be tryna double back
Is a wonderful thing
My newfound life made all of me magnified
Save for a few of those late night episodes, missed opportunities, and "I don't care's"
As I'm leaving, she wakes up and says
Just give me the truth, give me the truth
Came in through the back door at the start of the show
For days and days
Should I thank you for that dear
And all the sadness inside me
I went and looked her in the eyes
When I drive, drive so slow
I'm grabbing at the fray for something that won't drown
Please say honestly you won't give up on me
And look your skirt is torn
The anchor's kiss was scrawled in dyslexic crayon
I've got to breathe
She said, "No one is alone the way you are alone"
And love me"
By the window 
A supple heart
Muriel Stonewall,  to 
I can't sleep so I take a breath and hide behind my bravest mask,
Feel their hearts they're cold and white
Give me all your love now
Straight buzzin', Robitussin
I dream about, how it's gonna end
"You are my sunshine,
I'm a fool for staying home and having none
And you'd never sleep away
And everything's a mess
"Here is where you rest"
Two falling sparks
Can't explain the way today just fell apart like everything
Lights upon your eye
But I was swallowed up by doubt
But I'm still burning in your flames,
I'm way in the background
You've kept your word
Gimme all you got, baby
Bastard headmaster
They are two alone
Here's the time I took the blame
You'll get a glimpse of the truth
I feel you taking power from me and I can't leave
He says that behind my eyes I'm hiding
You love white veins, you love hard grey
The pictures of anything
I know something is wrong
Unless you're mine
I can't keep running away
Is goodbye
And let go of the rest
And I wish I could feel it
Habits
I'll return and fill that space in your heart
I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow
As she gets up off the floor
I said I'm sorry, but what for
For I am not the one
I'd just drive a different car every day
Whisper in my ear a wish
Through the night sky yeah
Can't you see that we're going to hell
To this gray town
Sitting on the windowsill near the flowers
No, no one will desert you
In my fragile family tree
It's so cold in Alaska
This is the last time
Say it to my face and say what you know every one says
Silly women, taxmen, uniformed whores
All these things are ever lost
Everything falls apart
And there's kids playing guns in the street
Let's walk down the road that has no end
Stand by the stairway, you'll see something certain to tell you 
Of the time when she was mine
To stop the world decaying
And I think that I know the bitter dismay
The streets here at home had rapidly filled up
But we will only come
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
I don't find myself bouncing home
Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes
If today I woke up with you right beside me
It's gonna be all right
Every moment that will get you by
But the hours they creep
Well, you know I have a love
Ran When Nicki gettin' tan
The preacher lost his son
We gave you everything
We're eight feet deep and the rain is still coming down 
As some will say
I know you've heard them all before
Into the world of night
Insides gripped
'Cause I lost my only friend
Let it rain
And pray that you might give me a call
She had eyes bright enough to burn me;
The minor fall, the major lift
In this weather, the wind outside is biting
Just stay this little
I loved sneaking out when my momma's asleep
But Frank put it best when he said
There was a time I'd dip my feet
And spent it all on girls
Till it rains I'm gonna stay inside
When you are scared
Your sweet and weary head
What's so wrong Why the face so long Is it over
I wonder about your skin tone and shape of your nose
When morning comes it will be too late
When the memory leaves you
Right above a dirty bookstore
Well, for nine days
But did you ever, ever notice
She was easy
Sometimes I feel discarded
Well, I've been running from something
Getting ready for school
Without so much as hello
With its hands stretched towards the calendar hanging itself
Watchin' the movie
And I still wonder
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
I beat yo ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
But that was back when we could talk about anything
With heat to melt these frozen tears burned with reasons as to carry on
People have been travelling miles just to hear us sing
Well time cast a spell on you
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
It feels like nothing really matters anymore
Any time
Just get me passed this dead and eternal snow
Give me the truth, even if it hurts me
Fulfillment to their lack of strength at your expense,
I got your message
Show me lonely and show me openings
Could still be little
You could have done anything
I got beaucoup payments to make
There were flowers pressed to my face
I'll have my brother stop by this Saturday to
The lovely air so thin
'Cause I'm afraid to be alone
And if you ask me, I will stay
Skeleton me
"What a lovely day," says the butcher as he raises his arm
There's something in the water
Amen
Always someone's carrying Cathy
Let it rain rain, rain
I make all kinds of money when I go on the stage
Out past the land mines
You are my sunshine,
The life I have isn't what I'd seen
And I said do you believe we are fundamentally judgemental
And I wonder what's in a day
To see a whole new life
With their hearts on the bible
As the belltower blocks the sunlight
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
With the boys from the amusement park
If drinking do not kill me
That's why I'm always on the run
Dropped all your clothes and life
To his silent world and his tiny room
Oh, I told you all along there was no point looking to me
And no one's ever burned you
Some people get it
These memories come back to life
That time that you danced with me
I was young and struggling, but old enough to be a dad
Are the things that make you panic
And they came to the river
Twilight, I fall in the hills
Oh let it rain, rain, rain, rain oh how I wish that it would rain
Awaiting a word
I put up with all the scenes, this is one scene that's goin' to be played my way
So scared that we lost it
And that would have worked on me yesterday
I know to you it might sound strange
Don't be cautious when I'm cautiously approaching on the other side
Our children will always hear
Night is falling
We still might not want you around
From a black little crack in a stone
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Well, I ran from him in all kinds of ways
Tell him I am not at home
You're here with me, sit down, have a seat
Baby, is the thistle in the kiss
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
A draft from all sides
And in that deafening pleasure, I thought I heard someone say
And in a story told, she was a little girl in a redrouge, sunbruised field
I'm sure you know that I'm leaving
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
Tell me it's nothing
Oh, it took me years to write it, they were the best years of my life
The water is rising on a river turning red
And I cannot sleep without the radio
Does it all make sense now
Oh, but what the hell, you know it's just as well
You turn kings into beggars
If I spent myself till nothings left
If I miss you, well that's my fault
Two silent birds circled by
We're all gonna be, yeah
You best believe
'Cause life has been insane but
As I slowly turn to house dust
Devil's hand across my heart
I want to know, am I the sky or a bird
From the space between your bed and wall
Cause you said this was right 
Courage my boy, when you look them in the eye
Right or wrong, right now it doesn't matter
Get it through your head and walk away
And break my heart and soul inside
Please don't let me make
But tread softly, you tread on my dreams
There's never been such grave a matter
When you're thinking about the things you do
I won't let you come to nothing
Makes me cry
Ma vie
Not ready to let go
I will stay, I'll always stay
Everybody's laughin' in my mind
The same eyes
Or should I lie with death, my bride
She smiled in a big way, the way a girl like that smiles
And the night's too long
Don't blame it on your son
I'll remember where the love was found
To ride the commuter train
Closed the door
Away with suburbia shakedown
You know I need you so much
I will always
You love her but you don't know why
Listen, I gotta cry
My heart would break without you
And the years have been good to both of us
One that won't know the street
You used to wear in your hair
But don't blame your daughter
Everyone loves you
Instead, these blue valentines
She was tired of sleeping
But I just have to pass on by
I try my best to let them go
This is our town
But you carry on
Still breaking old habits, 
Now that I am done, remember I will always love you
Blind man on a canyon's edge of a panoramic scene
Every moment like a sudden pleasure
I'm sick, no one hears me
Bababass, bass down low
Why did you not include me on your list
Never be the same as it was 'cause the way it was
Oh no, he was a most peculiar man
Could it be the sea
You can sink to the bottom of the sea
Anyway
You've raped, I feel dirty
All that's cold and cruel
That I know I was happier with you
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
There is this thing that's like talking except you don't talk 
Reclined amongst these packs of reasons
They will understand one day, one day
Thursday night far from sleep
Down a road that's leading nowhere
How many accolades do I need to block denial
Dependin' on how I feel
Without saying goodbye
The heaviest weight, the clumsiest shape
At least I hope so
And disappeared in front of my eyes
Tout ma vie
And in their falling, make no sound
That we don't wanna believe
But he wanted the sun
As I hold you to my bed
Not while I'm still this obsessed
That know why
That both my arms were broken 
I used to be the bright one 
You won't get better till you'll get worse
Oh babe, meet me in Tompkins Square Park
I don't know, I don't know
But they don't know what is what
You're drowsy without a care
They've packed up and turned out the lights
And rip your own child
They're insisting that our love
So I say
Maybe we could change his mind
Somewhere you can't make it home
If you're shocked it's just the fault Go your own way
We're going to commandeer the local airwaves
Say hello and wave goodbye
Someday I'll go
I know this room, I've walked this floor
A memory I wanna forget
For the love no longer here
In the light, light, light
When you turn the lights out
I think tonight I'll take the long way
And paint them all a shade of grey
A house of cards
So I think I should get up and call you
I heard the words come out
And light it up forever
And Joseph's brothers sold him down the river for a song
Sappy love songs on the radio 
All of my life
Your thoughts have always laid close to mine
If your map was torn
Don't you know I'm numb, man
Merry Christmas, my love
I lay back in a glittering mist, and I
Words you spoke to her that night
Now as I lie in pieces and wait for your return
'Cause for all we know
And I claw for solid ground
When you sleep with somebody else
Fish tank this thang along with four more shots Potron
Quit fightin' while your husband
When the world is hers and she held your eyes
But love is all around
But I know I was happier with you
When your heart don't have the heart to say to say, to say
And I'm not looking for answers, no, I'm not looking for answers
Baby I don't want to know
You call me a boy, but I'm trying to be the man
A man said, "Folks, would you bow your heads
On stony ground
You were the only thing that mattered, there was no one for me but you
It seems that all men
There's a fortune inside your head
You have been left alone
Bababass down low
You wrestled your nightmares
That we only love the things we own, baby, you're wrong
Is that a crime
And I thought today had been ok
Lazy, your long sister lays
Into the horror of the truth,
Now when you're in love it takes time to heal
Late last night I saw you in my living room
Drive all over town
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now x
'Cause my heart would stop without you
It's not for a fuck or a kiss
I would think about you all the time
Proud to be a part of your illustrious career
You love a stone, because it's dark, and it's old
And I know you'll find your freedom
When you had to escape, say the word
The shadows and regrets
Our mother has been absent
Same way you confuse me all the time
Wave goodbye
The earthiest smell, the hollowest tone
Well, I think she'd be lovely and stubborn and brave
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
Your father, Mister Ed
Laura, us, people who suffer
I remember high school; man I hated high school
Town to town
We both wake in lonely beds, in different cities
So, I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
I'll just stare and hope you'll care
When you only had barely enough to hang on
And I loved you back then
We let them lie in wait for us
And I'll say your name and in the same breath
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
Because there's no more trying to make this so right
In the general sense
Having never ever planned to fall in love, Luv, Luv
For seventeen long years
See me age nineteen with some dumb haircut from 
And I knew, the fire and the ashes of his grace
We're running to the edge of the world
If you ever had a real heart
If only night can hold you where I can see you, my love
Sat on the corner of the room
To do as you want, to do as you please
Your voice is dead
"I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
We tried to make it work, you in a cocktail skirt and me in a suit but it just wasn't me
While she's still around,
Bass down low
 is forever when you're just a little kid
I see reflections of me in your eye
I'll keep on searchin' for an answer
Oh, you haunt me with your violent heartbeat at night
Watching everyone
And I think what I just wrote is going over my head
All know his sins
And choking on hello
Is either dead or in prison
With the whitest of snow
You wanna stay
Yeah baby yeah
They barely notice 
High times
But soon they'll be coming to rush her away
I quit drinking whiskey
Yesterday is dead
But what if the pages stay pressed
I still feel it on my lips
I did all my best to smile
From the heavens to the womb
Found I wasn't so tough
I look up at the stars
If you're shocked it's just the fault
And soon the sea shall give up her dead
Still fighting all these years about the same old things
Running, running away
Our somersaults through socalled art
Why I've felt this way
And it's gone
It could still be simple
Everybody's going out and having fun
So keep your hands on your chest and sing with me
But if you're not ready for love
As we continue our goodbyes
In a place without time and space
It is hurting me
I can fall through one's fingers
And I never meant to hurt you
Wonder years passed me by
Just so that you could know
Daddy's payday is not enough
Leave you cold
Feeling like the wind from the sea
All the sad songs on the radio 
I know some have fallen
I'm living in your letters
I can't accept this all because of you I've had to walk away
I was such a fool
You have inside
I thought I could fly, so why did I drown
Your hands were on my hips, your name was on my lips
Oh promises, promises
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
So make a wish
Scared to be alone
Remember that she's getting older, too
All we ever wanted was everything
You fucked, I'm sick of it
I'll swim alone the long goodbye
Twenty years in a car,
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I get nothing
It's like , , , fuck it
And yes you're still a fine woman and I cringed
Spat into an empty room
And I'm up in the air so baby hell yeah
For your eyes smiling
What do you say we get high
Think we both ought to put 'em on hold and I know you agree
I thought about it 'til my head hurt
Take my call
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
Every step that I take is another mistake
E'rey day feel like my birthday
That you'll read if you're so inclined
Wipe the makeup from your face
Swish, swish, bish
Too amorous light we call out
Oh you just look away in the distance
Darkness always turns into the dawn
So no, of course we can't be friends
You abuse the ones who won't
It's not a classic Cadillac
Reflections of me in your eyes
Santa Monica I'm racing in the lights for you baby
I'm about to take this drink and just stuff it
And it was so, so hard to do
The summer's gone, the years have passed
I close my eyes to conjure up something
I hate our favorite restaurant, our favorite movie, our favorite show,
The first orgasm of the morning 
And it takes a whole lot of whiskey
Funny how he couldn't see at all, 'til she grabbed up her
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light
Write a letter to my love
Always be
Come back tomorrow"
You abuse the ones who love you
There's nothing to be gained from this
It's just you and me on my island of hope
We will meet again one day 
We've been having troubles you know 
And you're off with barely a sigh
And I am willing to give up this fight
Well, I ain't got no mercy
You're the cause of all my trouble and pain
These words are not a bit profound
If you touch me you could never go back
And the city streets a wondrous chorus singing
You were there for summer dreaming
I've got a burning desire
Suitcase of memories,
The band is playing our song again
Through these walls the winter bites
I love my hands but it hurts to pray
In its mouth where the tongue was torn
The sound of the drum has called
We were born before the waves
I was made to taste your kiss
Maybe I'll just place my hands over you
The kiss is infinite
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
Living with me's like keeping a fool
Maybe there's a God above, all I ever learned from love
Like a pain in the river
You're holding court
And pace with you a while
Oh, what's a boy supposed to do
Trying to escape this desire
And when her own man comes to call on her
Where does it go, all the light that we had
'Cause I need you more than dope
Drive your car through the rain
And out it came like summer rain
Don't you remember that I promised I would write you
Teargas and plateglass
A lifetime of questions
On some forgotten hill, abandoned by the mill
Without you by my side
Oughta know, who is gon' take the responsibility nigga
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back
You were old and hurt
One Friday night at a football game
"Does he ever get the girl"
Till we see the moon
I lie around in bed all day just staring at the walls
Yeah everything will be fine
Let love take away all this pain,
It's a promise not forgotten
But I don't ever tell you this distance
And the love that they swore
Through Jesusland
Before the world came, made me colder
Comes blacking in my mind
Her face was just a smear on the pane
Crowd surf off a cliff, land out on the ice
For Jesusland
Surrounded by your peers, without suffering or fear
If you walk away, I'll walk away"
I remember those simple things
You make it hard for breathing
And it's harder as anything else
These roads go on forever
O my heart
Well I watched your black tied family
But don't make her drop you off around the block
There are times 
Give myself to anyone who wants to take me home
Bombs droppin'
Hard not to break down and cry
Is like a fire drill 
In the window when I ride for Chicago
I have to keep it covered up with a smile
Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Can you feel my eyes on you
Folded and yellowed and torn at the edge
One more day and it's all slipping with the sand
I can't seem to breathe
Yeah you, send a little smile my way
Or something in between
I won't let go at any price
Five times before they're seen
Gems and stones,
About the tears been shed
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
And I barely recognized her, but I knew exactly what she was thinking of
To offer me mercy, mercy, mercy
Long afloat on shipless oceans
Of all the sweetness that has passed through us"
I'm going to keep your heart
If I could I would, I'd change everything
And I think you know about me
He smokes his cigarette, he stays outside 'til it's gone
Woke up sad from this dream I've been having
Hand out of the window
If it's one that you can keep
If you dream of me
You said always and forever, such a long, lonely time
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
No one ever takes the garbage out
Please don't take my heart away
A light on the water
"Don't waste your time with politics" he said
But I didn't hear the ringing bell
Without you here the seasons pass me by
And you'll be here in my arms
I was hoping I was hoping we could challenge each other
Some things you'll do for money and some you'll do for fun
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
But if I lose the highs, at least I'm spared the lows
I don't want to risk our paths crossin' someday
Red blood's a power fuel
And I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me die
They know what is what
Is a hope that somehow you, you
You will steer your life and die old in bed at home
A mirror was splintered on the decks floor
Its just one day I fell asleep
Why don't we stop fooling ourselves
I'm taking matters into my own hands 
Traded your worth for these scars,
Why do you choose your pain if you only knew
For all the ones who've left
She thought it was an answer to the fashion blues
Without finding closure, you take them back,
Except this one mattered and I felt it had a spirit
Oh, is it a dream
Two, is better than one
Tell yourself it's alright
The neighbors hear but they turn out the light
How much I love you love you
Tough girl in the fast lane
With the world in our hands
Drain the veins in my head
She says forever to light a fuse
When desperate static beats the silence up
I'm a fool for you
Couldn't park that fucking car
Not just let the water
And you're thinking about the things you do
When the truth was like swallowing sand
But my darling, I am still in love with you
There were birds all around me
Because it's smooth
Oh I, I'm alone tonight babe
Many times we've been out drinking
To send me blue valentines
Through this memory
You watch your back 'cause no one will
Another fight
So here I go with all my thoughts I've been saving
I'm going to get myself in fighting trim
Night is gone, long way turning
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
And she bit your lip and she made you hers
These words, they haunt me, hunt me down
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Walls are shaking, I hear them sound the alarm
'Cause it's the ones with the sorest throats, Laura,
It's a hell of a year for you and me my friend
Jesusland
My everything depends on you I depend on you
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Do you still love rock and roll
Love me like I'm not made of stone
She's the only one I love
Do I wish I'd never known you at all
And when the waves came crashing down, he closed his eyes and softly kissed her
Love, don't cry
Ooh  I'm walking on air
From my mind
Sayin' let me walk away, please
He's so cold he will rule the world tonight
The songs from the ugly organ
When the morning comes to meet you
That you've marked to find your way back
Oh fuck, I'll pay you anything 
But with this long last rush of air let's speak our vows in starry whisper
And there's no one here but me
I wonder if she knows
He thinks he's made a grave mistake
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
I'd separate the waves
And I don't know just who you are
On this glary random day
You can love
Hard for you, I've fallen, but you can't break my fall
Well, stop and smell the smoke you keep saying
We sing, how your love is like a knife to the back
We were running
Busting out the heavens 
The sky's not blue and the field's not green green
There's pink flamingos living in the mall
I know I could have loved you
We are smoke
I write them out of the book right there
Ooh  dancers in line
There's a war inside my core
'Cause I know I'm wasting my time
Laying on the bathroom floor
If I'm looking for you,
I hope that I know
And there's no need to test my heart
With nothing left
But you may be offended, and you may be afraid
We all fall down
Ghosts, they come and memories all repeat
Everybody feels this way
Before my time
Leave your pain in the river
I taste the sulfur on my breath
And everything, everything will be fine
I always knew
Rise up from graves near cemeteries
If you find me, hide me, I don't know where I've been
Only a month we've been apart
It's a damn cold night
Some days
And there's nothing to cushion your heart led fall
It's not that much fun
It rains so slowly
Ask questions to myself about the things I'll never know
Know your name
And we drive through the farmland,
I can't remember faces, I don't remember names
And what I've done
The men started working
And it hit me that love is a game
In each others' arms
Grey ships pass
My broken heart inside
Please not to purse their faces grim
'Cause when you never see the light, it's hard to know which one of us is caving
Why you haunt me with your violence baby, come hit me
All my blood will spring and spill
You get me high
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Still we're kind of shy
Will give the game away
But I can't get through
With a cigarette
"We could drift away"
Together or apart
Now I believe you baby
For a long time I thought that you'd be coming back to me
Can I buy an aeroplane
While you clear your head
It's all right, I'll be fine
And I think I believe that if stones could dream
Who knows
I used to be the tight one 
I am giving up on greener grasses
And glows in the dark
A place that now belongs to you
And who's to say it wouldn't have
The dew will settle on our graves
"It's your choice, babe, just remember
You come from an island
You were too scared to see
He died last Saturday
What if I never let you win, chase you with a rolling pin
So, just walk away,
Margaret, the lapping waves are licking quietly at our ankles
I'll pretend I'm okay with it all
So rest in peace
In the window when I ride
You feel it in your heart, but not for very long
Way up high in the old blue sky
Although you don't believe me, you are strong
And that is the way that we remain
Over that broken road
But there's going to be a party
You tell me sleeping only makes you tired, anyway
But I hope that you're laughing now
For the short time that I did
This is where it ends
Look back before you leave my life
Well, I ain't got no money
And some dirty basketball
And I'd love to say I do
I poured my heart out
I wanna love you but my hands are tied
I write on paper erased away
When the light's out
Made me a man ah but who cares what that is
And all the world is green
And I still wonder if you ever wonder the same
Or maybe we can go together
And I knew, I'd cherish all my misery alone
A name is written on a polished rock
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
Don't let me make
Nevermind
But I denied in my capacity to love
This time
Drive me closer to this grave
Although it's last month it's like yesterday
Why are we so alone
Go beside you
I played a thousand times before
Harder to know right from wrong
And the weather will hold
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Your eyes have opened but you've got to go on
I can hear the soft breathing of the girl that I love
You gotta say what's on your mind, on your mind
And nobody ever knows when you go
Sing it's not just music but the pains not brief
Now Cain slew Abel, killed him with a stone
For news that you weren't getting better
Its gills will swim faster after a breath from the shore
You told me boy bite your tongue
So I won't worry about my timing I wanna' get it right
Now I dine alone in our old seats
Some devil is stuck inside me
This is how I'd die, yeah
It shouldn't come as a surprise
And if I let you down I will follow you around 
Where have they gone
It's what you told me anyway
Her cat was clawing the floorboards just outside of our door,
We didn't even bother to stay
I'll go to London there's a mate of mine I know
Well I won't be your winter
Oh, but you hit "send"
And did you know how much I love you
By a black little wind you were blown
The language is leaving me
I only fuck wit' queens
The sun upon my forehead it burns baby burns baby burns
Here in the nightstand drawer
You keep saying the past is not dead
Sometimes she wishes she was never born
It always takes my by surprise
Only told to stay away
As long as you're still mine, then its all right
To live today, so why not smile
You're cutting diamonds
Turn around, see me running
Miasma sky
Stay that way for the rest of the day
You'll rise up free and easy on that day
Blue, blue, black and blue
And so was I
Tell me what's right, is it my right
And we followed the river
No loneliness, no misery is worth you
And we're all gonna be, yeah
Are the ones you should've said
Here comes the first day
You're the failed attempts I never could forget
So that I can feel the rain,
I see myself change as the days change over
The damage is done
And I got high
I'll see you sometime maybe
And I know you did it all
At the bottom of the sea
With your lips and your smile
Cracked and growing grass, you see it all
Used to hang and he said
And I keep drinking the ink from my pen
And turn my eyes red
I keep getting snubbed
Some days you'll find me in a place I like to go
A new world, a new day to see
So don't send me letters
Tried too hard and I always lay
Waiting for you to remember
I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Will then the street light
Seven years went under the bridge
See, we are far less than we knew
In a world that she can't rise above
Am I coming back 
I carry your image always in my head,
The largest ones, that changed my life
And let the sunlight in my lap
So many friends now, and none of them mine
You said that your biggest regret
How can I expect anyone else to give a shit
She's a burning string
And I watch as her breasts, gently rise, gently fall
I put the past into the ground
And I'm living for history
You're not going to die any time soon
How can you know it when you don't even try
Is just another thing that
There's a light in your eyes
But when it's am he wonders where in the hell she went
I'm doing everything
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 
Pretend I'm okay with it all
And I'm hanging on your words like I always used to do
He looks all wrong but that's her alright
Seeing more and feeling less
God, I'm torn apart inside
And as I turned her down, I always do
It was near when I turned sixteen
I beat yo ass, you better not run to your father
That things were closing in and ready to blow
I can't forget it
PATRICK magpie, was it you who stole the wedding ring or what other thieving bird would steal such hope away magpie, I am lost among the hinterland, caught among the bracken and the fern and the boys who have no name
Its just that we stayed, too long
Cause you never know you might
Give me the truth
I'll be running the other way
Everyone I used to know
It's such a change from old routine
Tough girl whose soul aches
You're the reason why I burst and why I bloom
Please say honestly
Shield your eyes, conceal your lies
And I'm found too fast, called too fond of flames
Held tight, your voice inside my head
I'll have to leave the camp now anyway
And the friends you have told
Is this the end Are you sure
You need to be up all of the time
I could say that I yeah, yeah
Tie your hair and gently fall from grace
I only read a word or two 
I made a mistake
Your arms in mine
She thought it would be fun to try photography
And compared your Jesus to a thief
I am the first one I deceive
But oh babe, I really wish you would not cry
Won't have a soul for to wake up and hold you
She's lucid and departed
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
I know that you're dying
Not something she'd ever tell
You've got nothing to regret
I did go from wanting to be someone
But there's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
I'm sorry and I love you
That you don't want me there in your life
With a halo around my eye
And I shot the stork because I didn't hear it that way
We'll talk it over after I've had some time
Well I was almost honest
Three whole words and eight letters late
When she turned him away to remember some knave
Rape me like a child
My friend came back from being abroad
It doesn't haunt me at night
In three days time so you choose well"
Have a care, but don't stare
When I look back, never would have known that
But do you know we're in high demand
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Well, anyway, "I would any day die for you"
I picked up the phone and I put it down
But we let them get ahead of us
But if I go cold, I won't get sold
And every time I'm close to you
I hope it made you feel good
London halflife
They had the shows on till way after dark
We was dancing the hora
The ocean rolls us away
I'm not alone, no I'm just on my own
Because if I can't learn to make myself feel better
He's so cold he will ruin the world tonight
Every promise of forever
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me
Goddamn me
Late nights when I stayed up late
'Cause when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down
And you never got a chance to even open your eyes
Disarm myself
And I still don't know exactly who I am
And look out the window
Parking lots
You've told me so many times
It's a cloudy day
Everything we'll be okay 
Soft shining from our eyes
I always knew you would succeed
Upon the lips of everyone a curse they've never dreamed
It seems I'm losing something deep inside of me
I believe it's just because
Well maybe two is better than one
Well it's good to hear your voice
Red blood's a powerfuel
As you ate last night
You know with love come strange currencies
For all that you've done wrong
'Til your singing eyes and fingers
They are three together
That only cry
I know that I piss you off
The doctor told her years ago to take a pill
I tell myself a little harmless lie
Alone
Laugh if they try to be funny
All that fake love you showin'
Drive past the lifeguard stand
To hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on
Yes she did
And your body's a fire
And you said, "Don't give me nothing
'Cause I just want to hold you tight
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen
And at the wake I waited around to see my exfirst love
A woman calls my house once a week, she's always selling things
How could I replace you
For anything and I agree
Another day
That circus tiger's gonna break my heart
I got no trouble with that
Pour the wine, dear, you say we'll take a holiday
I was singing something
You hit the drink, you take a toke
What the fuck
Kneeling to the frozen lights
Now I could say that I don't love you no more
Throw it on the fire
Down this highway that I ride to Atlanta
And I hope you'll always be
Had a lot of fun living life on the run
Was it a dream
I saw you in another's arm
In the name of love
As I pass out into a dream
Our love is a tricky love
The leaves will fall to feed the ground
When you said you were an accident
Still alone and lost indeed
Never fall away
Turn to fly, go away
Mother can we start over
My fists are turning coal to diamonds
So here we are
She lay in bed all night watching the morning change
But while you wave goodbye
The winter here's cold, and bitter
How some things never change
Are the things that make you blow Hold your own, know your name
Now where the hell I've ended up
It's hard, hard not to sit on your hands
Something has died
You are a long way away from me  look at me
I was better
I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk
Things were looking up
All lines have broken but we need you to hold on
Not now, darling, you know it's true
Just to reach your house
And time keeps slipping by
Your shining autumn, ocean crashing
If love can move a mountain
Can I open my eyes
Gravedigger, when you dig my grave,
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Back to the thoughts that keep you awake,
He swung out over the crowd, I heard the hangman said
With my candles and angels besides
Another game
I beat yo ass if you jump on my couch
I'm feeling scared and you know it
When you're running circles in my head
If I had her back, I'd be as real as my age
And in time you will remind me
I searched the whole damn apartment from ceiling to carpet
I'm selling people things they don't want when I don't know what you need"
Pretend you don't know me so well
Worrying is the breathing that you need
Then picked a star before we lost
And your soul will not be free
The rest is easy
Our misery runs wild and free
You can't say I do nothing
I wake up lonely
Where we shared a sleeping bag
Saying goodbye huum
Succumb to the line
I've been lonely too, like you
The one thing you wish I'd forget
He said, "The slow fade of love
'Til they came to the river
Or is it a dream
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I could clothe a continent 
They stand to fight for nothing
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
While biting her lip
Just before she says goodbye
Were you here when I was full sail
Without holding back my mind
But I know the difference between myself and my reflection
I don't need a better thing,
That loved like me and you
The clouds crack and growl like some great cat on the prowl
And get yourself dressed instead
I've committed a crime, I've broken the law
And all of the people come and gone
You never did give a damn thing, honey
When I will get you alone
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
When the spotlight drifts away
Is this just a life preserve or a bivouac tenure
And fought your own child
This crystal city's gonna fall apart
But I'm so tired of days that feel like the night
But do they know
And I shall wait forever
I close the book on them right there
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you
Black, black sheep boy
The ones I dream float like leaves
'Cause I don't care no more, no
And if the night comes
Through variations of hell
When the days all seem the same 
And like pathetic stars, the truck stops and the rock club walls
Funny how the distance learns to grow
Were you hare when I was fox
I'm standing on the harbour wall
I remember till I cry
Someday you'll know
A nice heart and a white suit and a baby blue Sedan
Watching shadows melt the light
As it lights upon your eye
Giving up what seems your lifetime
'Cause after a while and a thousand miles
'Cause what we had was so beautiful
Oh, how could anyone not finally diminish
A word, a signal, a nod, a little breath
I'll be alright
You still feel it on your lips
There will not be a new one
Lay me down in waking light
As he buttoned down his pants
Where everything we say and do
She said, "I'm surprised you noticed
Working late in diner Citylight
I will stay, always stay
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Yes, I wore a slinky red thing
It's a funny thing that I cannot explain
Just to make themselves known
If I bent like you said was best,
I've been away for too long
It's all right, is what you told me
And you just walk away
To a crackle in a radio song
And it's finally time for so long
Let's light the night
And they say "Where's that crazy girl
But I'm not yours and you're not mine
Every moment marked
From rock'n'roll to love and cash
Far away but still on my mind
When silence gets too hard to handle
And lovers become trends
Did she make your heart beat faster than I could
I'm listening, but there's no sound
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
One that wanted to land
Another one in the basket
It's been there for a while
Oh, I am willing to give up this fight
I'm going to ask you to look away
When the swan flies to heaven
