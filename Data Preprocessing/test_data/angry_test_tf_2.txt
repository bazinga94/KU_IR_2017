There you are a tool of their firmiliar game
Beware of the soulsaver
She can hear water rushing underground
I hate everything, fuck you Fuck you
That you fucked up again
Grind away till nothing's left
And you know it
Fiend for the fans and fodder for the press
And I, I'm not angry
I'm a soldier on a battlefield
Eyes sewn shut, stilted conversation breaking up,
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
I find beauty in teaching you what the definition of pain is
Where you go, remember me
Fire, fire, fire, fire, no, light up ya lighter
I'm stickin' to the script, you nigga's skippin' scenes
And y'all steady screaming for war but want peace
'Cause it's been on my mind,
All'inferno porta e non torna mai 
Ik babbel met de gast die mij een glas aanbiedt
And your face will blur and fade away
I'm gonna be goin' against  niggas in one and you think you crazy
Your graveyard eyes unseeing
All we get is censored news
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Hey, ladies
Invisible transfers, long distance calls
And show you crazy
Into your fucking throat
Leading them is a mighty man with a mad rage in his eye
I'm going to kill you
You've burned out, your battery has died
Autotuning folk punk rockers
I thought that that might disappear but you penetrate
And God divided the light from the darkness
Razors cut away the pain of this life
A tu delirio de asesino
I walk a path I know so well
I find beauty in blood drippin from ya faces
One more time, I'mma spit at you some shit
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing to me
Point blank  They can kizz my black azz
One day she will tell you that she has had enough
And you know deep down I know
Fuck that How this shit look
So put a big smile on your face
Jubilate as you die
Shit changed, you sellin WEED over the damn computer
I won't let myself hold back
None of y'all niggaz don't really wanna fuck with the dread
Those most deserving will end up with the most
Alone with your demons you pray for the end
Thick skin
Till death do us part
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows
With the blood of the poor
God is a gun and it's targeting me
Sometimes I hate myself for what I've lost
Heart breakin', money makin' hothead fool
With claws of carelessness and fangs of apathy
This town ain't friendly now
I'm liberated "That it's time to stop goin along
Now here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Life kicks us when we're down but we
Who done did some time and wanna mitch new figures
I'm sick of it, sick of it
Somber thoughts of burning planets
Tot ik genoeg op heb voor een volgende stap
Ah it stinks, it sucks, its anthropologically unjust
What time's the ceasefire
I dream I work I bleed
Well good morning baby, hmm welcome back to town
He won't confess, no
It's not that I hate you,
I know there's something more
Oh god it hurts so much
Where were you when the mothers cried
Your ghost my pride
Be careful I may bite your head off
But if you want us to you sacrifice
Come girano i colori ed i sapori nella vita vera
But I'd trade them all for just another look
Dressed up, messed up, greeneyed sycophant
Pain's the midwife to your labor
Fuckin' up the sandbox since I was seven
To get 'em back without me
Everytime I try to talk it through
They call me crazy, they say I'm crazy
Is it my turn to show them niggaz we be stars on tracks
Take it away now
In front of a class of gawking fools who'll never understand  They'll never understand
Look at all these off brand niggas
This is the planet of the apes
It's cold when you're down
It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with
Nobody's gonna stand in our way
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
Straight buck foes when the nigga Ruck pull the snub nose
You follow me on the fucking street
E prendermi con se
To ever believe you want be wit' me
Sick with disease
Machine guns on a New York transit line
Now nigga you can rest in pieces
You may have enough money
Jedi Mind Sean P combine now
Oh Lily, I don't want to die, we've got so much to live for
And no one knows
No wonder that we shoot each other
"You gave me this tattoo back in '"
Signed "Charlie Scene" on your girlfriend's tits
Upon blood and soil
You still get no respect
We're the first ones to jump in line
I just can't bend the rules
C'mon now, I'm quick to roast fry boil and even toast a guy
I had a friend one time
You're gonna have to give me more than just a token lick
Hey Dad What'll happen now sir
And I fear that I can't find you
You're bound to make another mistake
Such violence on your quest for selfdestruction
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
And I die a little more
Do my dirty work
It's like a Pain in the Ass I'm Crushed by the longing for feeling
Plunge into the realm that lies
Payback  cashin' in your ticket
What, you think I just got lucky and didn't work for this shit
Don't shame me, for sinking the ship
There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part; you can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all
I offer no apologies
Run away and don't look back
You can knock at any door
In the end, all I want is to survive this
She believed him
I wanna live in THE PRETTY SUN
And people around me is tellin' me that you's a stalker
Rap his stick upon the ground
Can I bleed for the ritual
I hate you,
Now, you suck
I've got control for the candy in ya soul
Be it your best friend or any other 
No explanation needed, nothing can change the way things went
I thought these tears were gone
Here's a beat, it is a solid beat
Das ist vergangen, und bevor ich mich versah warns schon zwei Affaren
Poison thoughts in my mind
My friends call me enemy 'cause they're a fucking joke
It just withers like a leaf in the fall
It was a slap in the face, how quickly I was replaced
Government control
And you've got me feeling oh just like a roadkill
Sie liegt am Boden um zu sterben und ich lass sie sterben denn
Like a billiard player
You can't stop me
So now you're all alone
Hello pain
'Cause I got to knock you out
A few bridges were burned while your backs been turned
Go work in retail and spare the suspense
And while they treat my group like dirt,
I could never feel the same
They've got these magic crystals that don't do a god damn thing
For all the thoughts that I'm thinking
Problem with you you're afraid to die
Of a Republic for the workin' class, economic liberty"
It's cold when I release blood
At night when I retire to my coffin, to sleep for a hundred years or more
You think it's a game You think it's a fuckin' game
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up relentless, I smell blood
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn 
You call me your best friend
Multiply the ghosts like the world's greatest coke supply
And my dreams and there's no out that I can see
Did you really think I'd take you back
We will be the ones who are left alive
And I know we're all goin' out to get slaughtered, but I just can't take any more
Ich bin lieber alleine als mit dir zusammen
Injustice drives you crazy
In theory I respect your right to exist
Took you back in my life
My fists, man
I exit through the spotlight glare
Well well what the fuck
You may own the race track
But not the lessons learned
Ready to blow this bitch up at the drop of a dime
Act like you don't give a fuck though
And all my life, you won 't stop giving me your Jipp
And LA kids who will dance to the gun
I'm just another face
Spinning out of control 
A puritan soul, distanced from sin,
Disgrace
Ma soisin ja joisin ja valvoisin aina vaan
Seus presentes nao valem tanto assim
And I embrace the balm of sublime forgetfulness
Thinking back to times of yesterday, I could die 
'Cause I know I'm in control
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ain't no comin' back
I couldn't face the burdens of another week of worry; I was broken
Yeah it's the sex, the Gods, the freaks, the frauds
In life, yeah we cry
This is dawning of the age of the animals
Von deinem Sabbelwasser kommen hochstens Flecken auf 's Plattencover
Bis ich gewarmt an deinem hei��en Blut
Philipp Ich hab kein Bock mehr, kommt, wir vertragen uns
You're messing with a guerilla
Higher now
No ground to stand, nothing to lose
It's not all about cash Hell, no, not how much you flash
Und ich liebte sie nicht
Yeah, you've never been truly mine,
And sing your songs
You thought you had it all
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Im allgemeinen hast du die Stimmbander eines Eunuchen
Sisters Sisters, you've got the power use it
Dispute the suits I ignite and the watch 'em burn
Why must we die
You suckers wish you could ricky ross I'm in the bank
In the HARM WAY, we do it the war way, all day
Every rapper better fear me
"But it's also about, one's own selfrespect"
Careful, choosing what to say
And you keep thinking that you'll never get burned, ha
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him no
And you can never, ever, ever make a deal with the devil
You ain't drunk nigga
Don't wanna live, don't wanna die,
Victims of war, seeking some salvation
Cold run a train on punk hos that think they run the game
I've saved shining scars
You both mean shit to me
We don't mind
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin' the flow, slow venom any opponent
The earthmovers
Well it's good that I'm not angry
Trying to remind us it's time to awake
It's my turn I'm retaliating now
I would take every single prisoner out of their cages and put them back in the world;
Are just stoking the disease
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you're dogging
Your mind decided
Cry when you cry, run when you run
Raging anger,
You're running around science like kids with guns, creating a new world, while the world you've got is stinking, but, hands up, hands up anyone who thinks you've got it right 
Bitch you get no Love, love
'Cause when I'm finally done you'll know why it's called a crush
Them same superstar nigga
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine
Stare into space with a look on your face
I wanna hate it all away
Swallow me, then spit me out
'Cause in a minute you gonna have grandma bein the only family member left
I know you can
Yeah my friends all tell me but my friends all lie
Never think to censor the pride inside
Whoa now leave these niggaz shit tore down
Now look at me I'm still a fight
I know the drill
I cannot sleep with a head like this
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time, so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
And we ain't hard to find we just sleep in the daytime
Makes it hard to believe what you've done to me
Broken like a train disaster, I've had enough,
I know you said luscious pussy with a cover
Forgotten the earth is our mother,
The saints, across the nation
So now I'm gonna get up
And every time you knock me down
From this painful dreaming
And whatever you do, don't let them make a martyr out of me
I hate myself I want to die
Shedding innocence like falling dust
You're losing control
There's a new master of creation, and it's you 
They like to take all this money from sin
I wanna cry, I wanna scream
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
But this message really throws me off
Better watch your back  your spine
So you can go 'head wit' all that stabbin' me
Sun shines on my skin
The game has changed
Antagonizing and instigating my hate
Tombworms bloat on carnal blood,
You're still safe, crossed my hart
To suck my cunt when I'm on the rag
Ethnocentricity
Drive through a brick wall, pull the parkin' brake up
Goodbye to the let it happen stand
La que te hace bien la que no duela
Black man travel through the universe and back
When we've had enough
Your life's a total mess up, why the hell do you hang around
Tear down that wall, girl
Can you hear your conscience's crying
Undead, I see you duck when we drive by
Pungent odour of engorged flesh,
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
Sure enough it won't hold you for long
But when temptation starts, I will fight it off
The seeds that we planted you can never brutalize them
Summer winter spring I can't forget the fall
From a former life that we'd rather not hide
MC Ren, I hold the gun and
Destination death or better days x
Yeah I run it with killas homie, so what
All the twists and turns
Malte Lass uns lieber einen saufen und wir vertragen uns
Held you when you were sick even sucked your dick
Oh face it daddy, don't wanna have me no double cross,
Watch your back
I know he's messing with my head
Hundred treaties signed by your fathers' lies
We're rising up to show the world our scars
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore
My kind we fight in the club
As the years go by I can't deny the flame that burns inside me
I would take every single man that isn't in his country that's in a uniform in another country where he doesn't belong and bring him back home and take him out of his uniform and put him back in the world;
Oh, do me a favour, don't put me in the dark
A chain of sores
Well, you may not like it but you better learn how
Least I thought I did
Uh oh, I'm in the game
We don't die, we multiply, hit after hit, living platinum style
There is an axis of evil rolling into this neighborhood
All that I feel is agony
Your words are like a gun in hand
And now we're in the GPO with the bullets whizzin' by
At the faces I once called home
A mi delirio de asesino
With nothing left to hold
Now I'm ready for a fight
Such a pity I built no ladder from the roots
Uncluttered by the maskings of consumer addiction
Look up and see that motherfuckin' writin' on the wall
Fire All our guns and arrows
Let's be passionate  it's not like we'll get another chance to do this,
I'll sing you to your sleep
You never know who's planning to jack
Cities fall in ruin
I'm not kidding
The days are too dark
Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'
Makes me turn away from good to bad then to ugly
Bodies gon fall
Still, I'll never understand why you hang around
Because I'm black flagging
She reaches out her arms to me
You call me crazy, ooh I got your crazy
Covered with trash I had to lay back
My friends all lie
I got so many men that they all standing in line
It has a mind of its own
It makes him so angry
No need, no need to ever burn out I'm scorching and torching no time for front porching
You lead the way, you beat the drum
Pain, memories, shame
From the LBC to Helsinki
Look at me, I'm gonna jump
Father  Satan with fangs stained in blood
Diese Welt war nie rein
Southside tell me can you feel me
Systematic warfare  and an obsessive
That dumb ass will blow you away
Well, knock her up
In sickness and in health, 
So tell me who's pretty now
Fucking sick of falling down
I keep holding on to what I wanna believe
It's growing colder I'm growing older
But little did he know he'd lose a rib
This is a call to war
Then you say, "Right This is all mine"
I'm feeling so useless  I'm raping my mind
Just a little and nothing now it's over 
Silencio de miedos silencio de planes
The no go lane
wenn deine Metaphern trivial sind wie Spaghettiwestern
It's just the dust and diesel of the passing time
I would rather die than take your bullet
Ahha, thought I saw it
Do you wanna change it
A foreign sense of orchid scents before I lay my skull to rest
Kidnap your baby's mom straight earth the whore
Well, the note says, "Mrs Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
I believe in a better way
Is ever, ever going to end
I been seein' red and I don't know why
Don't matter where If you do it now
And as the silence breaks give him what he can take no way out
I told you last album
He'd better have a dream that goes beyond four walls"
He saw the bush where they had to stop
Said it's a pity 'bout the middle class Holden mass
Before I call for a face to face
To see our life's work in your constituents clout,
with rhethoric and bullshit that you cannot endurse"
So recall our downfall
They may drown you
Scrap wit no doors, four walls tighten
Come and get it nigga we wit it
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors
So you wanna go to bed with me 
This is where it ends
I ain't splitting nothing with nobody homie
Hey punk Another rock star wanna be
Strapped to my stomach screaming, "Let's get it on"
I promise I'll try harder now
Although I still bleed
IMF dirty MF
There's no preference
Another night, another life
Fuckface  that's where I'm gonna stick it
Fetishistic anomalies
Now I run from you
Burning my skin
One world, it's a battleground
This is an evil night
Shittin on your soul, welfare mother
You would let less than a motherfucker fear no one
'Cause you've had none of the answers
Nothings above us, y'all better back off
Well I'll tell you, my friend, one day this world's going to end
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own mom
I don't know what's wrong with me
If we come at lunchtime, we afternoon killers
Oh do you want to go to heaven
What you said, no, you're never gonna say again 
I'm falling into nowhere
You're furious, I beg you for sin
Don't listen  try to discuss
I can take the punishment of you and your friends
Reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
I can't understand a word you saying, you fuck
Fuckin' right I've got my gun, semiCartermatic
Learned enough
  makes you wanna fuck your end
I was helpless but still you pulled me in
Let's be passionate
I fear myself
It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight
Wie lang ist das her, ist schon die nachste dran
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
With the chrome Moss nigga
And I'm going straight to hell
Ooh, ooh, ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride
Yo, you know we had the baddest motherfuckin unit back in the days son
Throughout the veins of the night 
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
But he's never been love, not on the inside
In the bed and breakfast beck and call
Spend it all today and we will bill you tomorrow
I'll stab you through your fucking temple with a floorboard
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
Big mouth, big money
Or leave well enough alone and let bygones be bygones
This is a call instilling fear in all
I be that prime honorary nigga
This a motherfuckin' gang and we down for life
In a pretty picture on my wall
And I too was on my knees at the foot of my bed
I stare into heaven while I'm dying in hell
I hate myself I want to die
We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
Kill the best and buy the rest
Don't call me your friend, won't you understand I don't need
You manipulate me with your real catholic shit
Next time I warn you'
Take a life or two, the revolution's comin' round
Spend it on the uhaul dipping on the turn pike
I can't go on forever turning my cheek
Split poison ivy scratch rash
And the sanguinary sweetness of stealing someone's blood
And if you feel me raise your hand and show
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night
You've made the cut, and stayed to watch it bleed,
How does it feel to be slipping away
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way
It's been reported you've been drinking and running around with men and going wild
I've played a million empty shows to only family and friends
Might wanna skip a beat
Obey or not you fail
'Cause I am killing over
Beating on a drum you sing of quiet and peace
Against the same fucking wall
And it's looking right back at me
And I'm getting sick of their shit too
I'm liberated "They are fed lies, from the highest level"
Yes, I'm afraid to turn around,
I hate this song
Where's my money Where's my clothes
For a burger and some fries then they yell
Paranoia en twijfels en vooral veel dorst
It's all around you it's a tragedy, look
Echoes of the world, dissolved
So feel me and all that you hear me say
I could not believe it
If you wanna dance better take your chance suckers
He's goin' to fuckin' war
Till we break and we take back the world from these fake motherfuckers
Open your mind put it in your head
Sure to make enemies of best friends
I want to take these little minutes and try to find myself some space
I hate it all, why Why Why me
Just wanna see if I can fly
There's nothing here for me and you
We are breaking through without a warning
<Pop pop pop> was the sound I put the bitch down
Oh, ain't no comin' back, ain't no comin' back
This ape is crazily arrogant and out of control
Reach and grab what you want
No sleep till that man is found
Swollen eyes portray my pain
Worden door 't leven niet lang verwend
But no one wins wars by evacuation
Watch your watch your watch your back
We get a bit to play around with doesn't really matter
Another pawn, a pink flamingo on the lawn, and that's all you'll ever be
Of gods that close their stake in hand to fight vampiric habits now
Reasoned but with reasoning life only echoes mine
We are not alive
The war for oil is a war for the beast
E allora annaffio il muro con il mio veleno
Do what they want you to
Feelings that I shared with you are over now
Accidenti a questa vita che corre come un treno
The roof the roof the roof is on fire 
Suas historinhas nao sao tao boas assim
In verge of tears
In the Afghan hills, the rebels still fightin
See the blood on my hands
Look at you now;
Dogs of war and men of hate
Profit off the poor, fight the power
And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn
Eastside tell me can you feel me, whoa, oh south
Every heartbeat closer to the last
��destruyo a aquel con mi instinto de asesino
Don't patronise my fuckin' ass
You niggas soft
When I was a child the innocence was deafening
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
No, no, it's cool I don't even wanna go home Especially not after a twelve hour shift with no lunch break My reason for living is to serve YOU
If you want me, where's my dough
Its goin' down HC mutha fukin P the creators of the crunk shit we bout to tear this mutha fukin up den crash da club bitch
What goes on in the mind of a man like you 
It's a clean kill
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
You'll be getting your reward
Got a blackberry stain
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass
You screwup, you make me sick
There's nothing left to burn, to burn
Misguided by myself  full of fatal pride
Misogynists abound waiting to produce your fall
You're furious
And you're consuming spirits just to peer into the voodoo
I drink I smoke I fuck
Sie kann nicht fliehn
But you'll never understand
Leave me alone I've got work to do
One minute you're standing
No sleep till I can't hear the sound
Something burning inside, I get hotter and hotter
Decapitate and shit down your neck
All I want is my paper
Another day disappears
You're not on the battlefield not in the cancer wards
Cleaning up the crime
You thought you knew it all
Wielding instruments of pain
And as the silence breaks give him what he can take a way out
Call it what you want, 'cause I'm comin' from the coroner
Let me feel the fire
Out of step for what we believe in
Your master plan
I'm gonna kick your ass
I'm falling fast down
Hoping you don't see this doubt
They got just the tool, everything can move
Bbut you always press and you know I never stress
I can't get you from under my skin
It just sits inside so it burns and burns 
You ain't doin' this so you know you just talking shit
You make me wanna run around, pullin' my guns out and shit
I only want to be free
Che vorresti volar per davvero
That can fool you
First take what you want
mutta mita sina oot
Their sane is dead, they long to dish out
I bet you never thought this could happen just for pissing me off
Hey Dad What'd you do with mother
You'll never find with no one else
You'd have to kill me to take me down
'Cause it's built on solid Rockland ground
Ain't nothing to me
Got Phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west
I been in the cold
You are the devil
"My name is James Connolly, I didn't come here to die
You fucking praise him Yes, you fellate him with your trust
See the ferries passing by
E tu non sei qui con me
Ora che sono qui
I hate my generation
Coldhearted from the day I bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
They just send another nigga to the morgue
You bitch, you ain't that funny
Split yo' ass up like a Temptation
Court jester, don't kill the humour
Give me the real shit
Oh papa you'll have to come across
I moved you in
I'll say again, must I still question my friends
Yeah I'm knocking on the banks door
Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet
Mutta jos noin kusipaa
Pennies for your thoughts and dollars for your sins
Y no recuerdas que tus botas nunca te fallaron
No It's far better to die like a man on your feet than to live forever like some slave on your knees, Lilly
How can I know what I don't know
I need a friend 
Change your views or change your friends 
And you must die so that they may live
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill
bin ich 'n SechsGangeMenu bist du nur Tankenfra�� Danke, das war's
And have you feelin like you can't finish what you started
What we can not create
The pulse of death has arrived
Hit your mug with a  snub and watch the blood rush
Was Zuerst hie�� es, dass du cool warst, doch du nervst
You wouldn't believe what they've been tellin' me
See all these niggas When I step in the club, I'm bringing them
Them drag you out the yard niggaz
No I won't stop I just rock and I battle your whole clique
But you won't even know what are there
Yeah I'm running hot
You a homo you a trick silly faggot ass bitch
And put it to the jug we sip before fightin
Cut me, show me, until I am willing and able and never any danger to myself
And your bitch caught out there
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
That's that bullshit
They may shoot you
Your own arrogance was your downfall
Kids don't win 'cause they want to go mainstream
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
You'd better believe it
'Cause I'm like God, motherfucker, there's a price to pay
Plus die Konige der Meere
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say
Oh dear, oh dear and if I show you her dark side
No matter where if you do it now
Cardboard dinners and the saints and the sinners
Yeah, put the dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
Mad at all of us 'cause every song is a fucking hit
But I will run with you
An cryin' won't help you none
I would take every single rich person and take away their money;
If I gots to kill a nigga but I'm always down for the one on one
We ain't got shit, now had enough
Another chain will set you free
I did nothing, saw nothing
Aiyyo yoyuhyo, and now I hear no one
Runnin' on but never runnin' out
Ripping holes in the flesh
And you want to slow down but I just have to fly
A mound of flesh on which you feed
With a knife tight in your fist
Upper class
Something passionate will work real well
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain, or was my tolerance a phase
When in a black and white the capacity is two
It's all darkness
Chant slogans timed one step off beat
Is where it will fucking stay
per una dose di veleno che poi
We'll be losing media jobs and you make us your pet
It took us down for a few showers in the afternoon
You're just a player in the game'
Go buck and fuck and make a buck
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in
There's not a net, I'm so far up
Do you think you are ready for that much power 
What'cha really want, what
Dealin' drugs, bustin' them slugs
You were blood nothing more
Don't get smoke in my face
But we kept the sacred plans, now we carry
I cannot stand the way you tease
Then turn around and secretly text him
We barely left the ground
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
So, you want my love back
Now you call me a bitch in heat and
Got one now is dead
No one answers
On the run, got a gun
They like oh god there go t double
Padded with power here they come
Ooh, I got your crazy
Your pedestal reeks of death
And no time for your kind
I understand
Got a foreman and a crew, everything can move
Pop pop don't stop I need your heat
'Cause I'm mad, I'm bad, like Jesse James
Money money make a buck
Will you bite the hand that feeds you
If you wanna follow DO IT NOW
Hiding under tables as soon as I hear alarms
And you can't be wild and then be tame
As I studied hieroglyphics on her alabaster pigment
You're making me want to end this 
If I would shed my skin, the layers left
Better hold your fire till you see the whites of my eyes
If you want the position of God then take the responsibility
And then the unnamed feeling
Like old linoleum, battered and worn beyond repair
I whispered in her ear just to glare inside the fences
Sometimes I hate myself for what went wrong
Smash your radio It's a revolution
You know I think I'll get myself a maid
Junge, lungerst du noch an deiner Blubber bin ich schon langst startklar,
Now the working classes are obsolete
What you intend to ignore, but when it cuts back round,
God is a gun and it's killing everything
I'll get the guns, the drugs
The media incites civil unrest
I shed blood, for my people that'll keep you lookin' seethrough
I woke up in the darkness and I tried to see the clock; it was AM
There you go again you cut me off from talkin'
Call my man again and I'm a fuck you up
But there's no such thing
Du spielst dein Spiel doch drei warn eins zu viel, eins zu viel
Now he hates and counts the dates
In digging up our ground
Your arms around me tight, everything it felt so right
Tomorrow we'll ridse, so let's fight today
But generally speaking, nobody's got a hope
I'm moving out got no doubt they've forgettn twist 'n' shout
And indifferance turns to solace
Disassemble
I'ma break it down turn this world around suckers
And stand unashamed of what you have done
Maybe we'll fall in love
And I don't want to remember last summer in June
Ha, I'm sorry, but you were quite that offer to no secret
And blew a thousand kisses to the dissipated clouds
A fior di pelle avvamparono gli sbotti
Die Welt war nie rein
And then you call me your best friend
You're no one 'til someone
Never want to come down
Another grand surprise
How the fuck do you figure
Tin soldier
se ritornassi libera, se ritornassi mia
Doch all das stumpfsinnige Geschwatz
'Cause I'm trailing her tears
Do you want to be friends
Do you want to feel
It doesn't matter if I am your best friend 
Fucking die now
Just one more thing before you fall
I breathe life into Jesus Christ's carcass
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon
Stare into the eyes of blood,
A fior di pelle salirono gli sbotti
My clothes don't fit me, and my friends don't like me and the furniture is giving me a rash
A revolution never sends you an omen
I can't sing along to this at all
You make me sick
There, hey, hey, ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
I don't know if I'm sad
Ravening fiends unleashed to feed,
Don't you know that they call me the hopfrog
kohti vapautta ma pian matkaisin
Sorry son, there's nothing we can do
Poison years in my mind
Will you bite the hand that feeds
And a woman who teaches wrong from right
It's gettin' mighty dark
Clenched teeth 
I dream I work I bleed I say things that I don't really mean
I want you to know who I am
Or shall I sing and dance
E quando torno a lei mi faccio quasi pena
I'll talk to you soon
Don't you drink  the water of the earth
And it's hard to keep your sanity when spirits'll consume you
I'll take the fall
'Cause you be tryin' to kill my hoe, my girlfriend
I'm standing at the shore
We out here choosin' nigga
Hush little baby don't you cry
Tender moments with a burntout cigarette
I let it go  drive real slow
Then the unnamed feeling
There is no love left inside of me
Prove my innocence 'cause I did no wrong
Drunk on the violence 
So don't go with that, we leave you flat paralyzed from the neck
Niggas talk about greatness whenever they speak about me 'Cause I'm out here grindin'
En tahdo menna takaisin
I was a fool
You're temptin' me to run my mouth and call you out on this, bitch
I don't know if I'll die laughin'
Every ounce of faith
Well, it's the second verse now and I really like how this sounds
When the night falls you know who you are
Falling into nothing
Empathy, out of my way, I can't die
Mashin through the city yo, and the foot it don't lie
stanotte vado e spacco la citta
It never stops a smile on your shit consuming faces
Sick of this fucking apartment
Huuto nousee jostain mun takaa
Nothing's working x
Que saltes al vacio y que no vuelvas nunca
And they don't know
I know who will be there
You let jobs go into the distance
No, I just want a bed for the night
My spirit impurified
That's gon' get at you be fuckin' with your mind, stop talkin' shit
Who that playa with mine
Of paradise she dreamt with, the tears she can't contain
But words fail me
But I don't go around fire, expectin' not to sweat
Throw your hands up, take it to another level
The next second you're not
Forgive me father for I have sinned
We could go dancing if you want to, but I'd rather take you home
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
A swarming of disease
You laugh at me and knock me down
Clementine I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage, or whatever it is you've got goin' there If you wanna be with me, be with me
Cock back the hammer and just shoot nigga
I got one thing to say to punk asses who hate
All the shit you've given us is fertilizer
I've got a feeling
Exhibiting my power over the weaker, fairer sex,
And go to sleep alone
Is anybody else here sick of this shit
Spread your venom up my nose
'I'm gonna use my gun'
I've never seen you smile at all and all your teeth are black
'Cause today I hate everything
We are We are We are unbreakable x
Mouths move to fistfights to wage wars
Erase our lives, take back those vows
What that mean is that a tell a nigga byebye and pop him in his right eye
Go start a fire, get close to the gasoline
That conflict with anals, that believe in angels
Warum musst du standig uber Leute wie Puff Daddy lastern,
We've had enough
'Cause it's driving me crazy and I can't understand
Getting down, getting down, we have to make it now
Live in disfunction
You can smoke one to the head to this
You don't have to turn away
And get it made overseas
You should both be shut down in the coalhole
As you rebel to my sensual skill
It never makes no sense
I used to stand so tall, I used to be so strong
Only you know, only you know
Reach back into your mind
Permeated, soaked in darkness
You don't know how to root
The money's just doubled narcissistic, narcissistic
This is not an ordinary war 
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
Has never seen the sorry state I'm in
Losin' my shit since I don't know when
Town afraid from now on, this'll be where you're from
For you to make another mistake
Mascarada, incontrolavel
Shackled to the slimesmeared bleeding stone
"But there's nothing we can do
Just stinking of pachoulli while they choke on their ginseng
Oh, big grey mother, I love you forever
Stop messing
And it seems like such a shame
Onneksi joka MacGyverin seurasin, nainollen kinkkisen tilanteen selvitin
To be inspired or run
Words fool me
Hmm and if you can't play it my way, well now baby get lost
Runnin' gunnin things knockin' niggas out like Clubber Lang
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her
But I don't mind that it's the same old shit
I have fangs fucking  inches long
We're in a war that can't be won
Fingers once offered are now too heavy to extend
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
In the name of your dead drive on
Might as pay, turn away in disgust
I don't know why
There's nothing behind it
The fuck out you wanna wet duke squirt your four
Who turned away Couldn't bother to be around this now
Now every time you go to sleep
I throw it all away Don't talk to me no more
Pilot this plane our path remains
To pick him up, let me know now
You, are becoming gods 
Know you want me bad
Lil Wayne Imaa beassst, Ima Beeeasssttt
Who do you think you are you ain't foolin' shit
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
e piu che non ci sei e piu che voglio te
Every time that I turn around
Life  Above all else if nothing else
Tripped out of my mind
And Dre is back from the CPT
Swallow evil, ride the sky
If you want the big one
The fireworks say it's over
Now throughout the ages, we've been a' turning all those pages
I cannot believe this
Eminem
Give me money, buy me clothes
When broke powerless people grab any power they can get
There's no one left for me to be
I know it's gon be trouble
Now I know I've got to
Don't you know that call me a hopfrog
Es tat noch nie so weh wie bei dir
Would you now hurt yourself 'cause of my lying
This ain't no joke
We are We are We are unbreakable
Wall street crime will never send you to the slammer
A happy fuckin' day
You dizzy bitch, swallow this
Or your body's life you were fighting for
Take my life away or give back the answer you hold
I guess superpowers control for a reason
See we live for gunfire, kick in ya door nigga
For this world to believe
Hey punk In a year's time we will see
I wish nothing but
We gon get to the bottom of this shit if it takes all night
Ja huutaa naapurin kyylalle pain naamaa
And I hate myself
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
Four mutherfuckers goin' crazy with
Now I'm creepin' through the fall
Why not Why not
With a steady pace on the face that just we raced
Life  They fought and fell and died and never came home
You've unravelled DNA, and at the same time you're cultivating bacteria strong enough to kill every living thing 
And taste the venom left behind
In the north they saw my upside, my excitable and optimistic spirit 
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
That's why we made a promise
All you wankers piss off
And I'm a fuck you up
Enough enough's enough's enough
This is a rallying cry
I love it, I hate it
And drastic movement of people acting stupid
I don't know what you think you heard suckers
And any mutherfucker that disagrees
Why'd you abandon me Maybe it's not for me to know
In the south they saw my anger and my tears and my despair; they saw my mood swings
It seems like there's nowhere to turn
Oh, you know it had to happen
Du siehst Rauchschwaden, ich hinterlass 'n Flammenmeer
Daddys gunna sing you a lullaby
Under this burning flag
Your eyes resemble Mephistopheles, in fact
There's still a withered soul that now filled to the brim
Than take your bullet
Jetzt sind wir wirklich wild vor Wut
What's the thing you're running from
Should I bleed myself while you're smiling
Vinnie bout to teach you how to write some rhymes now
They're messing with me
Sober, sober, send yourself over
Shake your hand and kiss your ass
We fought them to a standstill while the flames lit up the sky
Most of ya mental scars outlinin ya inside bars gripin yo needle heart kiss my blood 'n' hata by heart when the fuck you gonna start to recognizin life is a game it's always da same da dice you rollin' ain't 'bout the change I'm snatchin yo change reinbersin you is the pain it's all on the main 'n' which direction he makes his fame I ain't bout that fame I'm bout that cheese 'n' its bout that brains so fuk yo whole name with few my papers lackin sum thangs I'm startin all ova the composition stinkin like odors n I thot I told ya when I come through I'm crushin like boulders I'm hard to top tru destiny my fetish come knockin' whatever I drop but even yo beast can't touch what I got you whilin or not if so bring all yo beef to the spot hope you gotcho glock I'm strappin no hesitant to pop so back yo words up 'n' keep on chokin out on that cock you like it or not its Everlast that ain't bout to stop
The blood on your face
I don't know who put them there
You motherfuckers wanna JUDGE me 'cause you're NOT me
What'cha niggas want, uh, uh
Sleepy from the poison, bitten by a snake tracking her so cruelly
I'm talkin liberation, it seems no matter how far you make it
Two graves
I think you wanted to be saved
I could try an' stop you cheating but I just don't have the time;
You tell me it's gross to suck my yeast infection
Do you feel like a man when you push her around
I've no land, I'm from nowhere
Alert the police, 'cause it's a state of emergency
Mm mm mm mm mm mm fist in my face
Just thought you were the one
PTSD and a broken back
You are blood
My heart is hateful, my tongue ripped
Without fighting to know you
Plies
I'm lining up the perfect shot
I don't want to run and hide
You don't wanna fuck with me today
Tell all the children in the arms of their mummas
I'm turning on, to different information;
Drunk and passed out on the floor
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
Has unleashed the dogs of war
They're bangin' on the walls
I hate the winter, summer, spring, I hate the fall
They don't understand what it means to you to see your dreams come true
But your sheets are on my mind
So throw your guns up playa and raise 'em up high
Kick you on the run now
Compton's  miles but, yo, I'mma get there
With you, I stand in hope
Follow me, go ahead, I'm watching your shadow
Sun, throw shadows cross the floor
That made him wanna draw an X across his last name
I can't feel anything
Yeah, I'm a God, motherfucker and it's Judgement Day
Be it your father be it your mother 
I would even be here if the walls were caving in 
Dicktricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'
I'll tear that fucking chapel to the ground
Ya niggas share one milkshake wit two straws
The universe is cold
Ualjen tvoj ponos
They'd better get their shit together it's time that they awoke
Half rappin' ass mothafuckers
I've seen women kill more careers than any whack album did
Since he left them both ten years ago to serve the ministry
We'll join the other fools
You gotta give something back to life
I hope you feel it
Clenchfist, beat chest
Lie undiscovered and unknown
I'll surrender what's inside
Gasoline for breakfast, Napalm for lunch
Is that a quote that sounds familiar to you these days
But I'll never understand
I grew up on by drive by's and LA gang signs
Free is your way  far ahead all your thoughts
Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way
She was young and she didn't know
You faggots act as bitch as Rupaul
I love reading Koran in pitch blackness
For your friendship to end 
There's no restraining order to keep me from you,
I'm feeling tired
Hold on now, not long to wait
'Cause it's making no sense to me
This is the sound that should not be
Oops, for all the lies you told
Till death do us part
Kickin these niggas
Friends have their lovers
And watch it blow up, blow up, tell me How you gonna see her now
Like an assassin for the better half
That shit's as worse as it gets, this verse is over, I quit
To kill the snake you cut off the head
From your heart in tears
The walls that surround you in a gentle caress,
Sometimes you gotta cross that line
io non ti lascio in questo nostro Vietnam,
Your blown mind reels in torture
All the riches taken back by needy
This oven's kind of burning
At the age of  how was he to know
Torn away from my warmth
Your drunken kisses leave a bitter taste on my lips
From the mess that you made of your life
Spill your blood to save humanity
You should be looking for the answer now
But nothing ever felt this good
On an outta work coked up, A&R guy
tu che sei rosa di giardino dentro di me
Another pawn, a pink flamingo on the lawn
This calamine lotion made our skin feel good
Your deathday clock is ticking
Its just a lie in my life
You make me sick
You don't need nobody to hold your hand
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference, when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
And work it good
Now that I said it I feel liberated
And it makes me, it breaks me
But you cheated on me and that's for it that now
Is something I don't believe in
Fire, fire, fire, yeah, you know, so light up ya lighter
But lord, when it grows late, I will fight it off
I've been up for days and I have no fear
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
Voor mijn verstrooide madam
You don't need nobody you're the littlest man
How rip I bars, walk through walls perform magic
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Drive me so far up the wall, I come slidin' down
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him
Ascending faster than the speed of sound
And on a lighter note
Turn so evil when they come in and pay
Swallowed sleeping pills like dreams
I don't care, because I'm not afraid
Why you want me to die
Yes, millennium shit
And mark the grave to burn when we go
Make me want to get you out of this
We're the only ones left
I could walk out of a classroom and be on my way to lunch and be killed just as easily as I would on the front line of a barricade in a demonstration
A dark tide of shadows follows me,
It's some real motherfuckers goin' rot tonight
Believe it
I just wanna get the fuck away from me
I'm living a life of sin, no I don't have any friends
Ignorance and understanding
K je k je e tolk bolan da je jasn kdo je nor
e di nuove lacerazioni non c'e' voglia
Curse my pride, I react Play yourself again
That would grace my lips, and the frozen tongue that was soaked in blood but it tasted bliss
On the capitol of shame
Why do you make me feeling like this 
I want you to know
We've gotta take cover we're flirting with death
Surviving from the vitamins you're finding when you take a bite
And now someone else can kiss your ass
Some days fine, others out of my mind
Fuck the world nigga ain't nobody getting out
You said nothing's to negotiate
Everything I say to you feels stupid now
As you fell on your face I had to laugh at you
Just lies and more contradiction
I can't deny it's killing me
A dotted line hit return dash dash
Hey, ladies
I refuse to die
We already dead ain't nobody getting out
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't
A union scarred by bitterness
So fast you'll hear the party spin the fuck right off
Ain't nothing to me 'cause I am the streets
We could go dancing if you want to
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
This one's nothing like Vietnam
And don't you come back
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in us all
I got these niggaz on shhs like I gone deaf
Y'all niggaz ready to do it
There is no way of any hope
Here we are back to play the same old games
And suffer with your fools
Out of the darkness the wolves will claw at your door
Eeeeeenough
Of your voice your voice telling me there is no choice
You need to slit your wrist, get pissed and go jump off a bridge
I see you swing by your neck on a vine
Go to dinner at the Governor's mansion
There ain't a fight and it doesn't mean a goddamn thing
I don't wanna
Every now and then I think about you
The answer to the question is we ain't gonna die
Straightedge  in your face
I always leave before it ends
Holds us back from a greater
Introduce the millennium STOMP nigga for the future
When you left me behind
Perche lo fai non rispondermi se non vuoi
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
The joke ain't canny at all x
Well I, I'm not angry
The sun now faded
A hundred thousand heavenly soldiers sent by Jade Emperor cannot defeat him 
Your song is ending, so don't cry
It doesn't matter what you might do
��destruye a aquel con tu instinto de asesino
If you want it we got it
Eat my fucking shit
And not another way
While Dr Dre videotapes you hell yeah
I found a ship to sink
Those who are in hell hallowed be thy name
You know you will decide
Smacked this whore for talking crap bitch
And gettin' jacked by the youknowwho
Say what you want to say
Show you machine gun funk
Najcnotliwszych k��amstw
Heatin you down leavin' you six feet deep in the ground
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack, uh
Hey Baby, machs nicht noch schlimmer Oho
All these people on my back
Want to believe
Was battle ich denn hier mit wack rappenden Edelassis
And move your tongue around
Just because I'm claiming what's mine
Some days fine, others out of my mind who was around when you were hungry
It's a shame we have to play these games
I know it won't be easy, baby
Now the fall begins, and our failing hearts
Revenge served cold, breakfast in death bed
I hit the ground, and then sit
Left me out in the cold
And now my anger is my best friend
Rope at the end of the line
More to the left
Sie liegen blank, gefroren, wund
All the bridges burnt, now the tables turn
It's an adrenaline rush, you feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
Why can't the girl just shut her mouth
In osladnosti ki nam kljuvajo oi
Words of wisdom nowhere to be found
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
I'm running with my eyes closed
I'm a renegade who wants to get served
The thorns are knots around your head
Catch'em at the battle of Zion
Now all the sudden, she wants you to get a desk job
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
Sing me one more song, ha, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
Put me in a homemade cellar, put me in a hole for shelter
You'll die quickly, when we apply all fifty
Or was it your mother
'Cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk
Blood on the leaves, blood at the root
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Except for the bullets, except for the bombs, except for the youth that's gone
A chain of sores 
Deep burned scars
So I grew a thick skin that you couldn't see right through
A black hole chaos theory
The dogs of war don't negotiate
Through another day of the drunk unknown
Maybe I should spit it in your face
A revolution never come with a warning
Life is a game that you know you can't win
In the planet and out through the opposite ends
Y'all pretended to understand the matrix
I don't mind if it is your day that I spoil 
You are the fire
yhen paitani panolla 
Black painted scars
Fake upnorth niggas screamin' for the cops
It's a shame, that niggas die young
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block
Bridges I've burned
Leaves are changing seasons of my poison years
Until another day is lost
The only religion I know is holy poetry
They used to be attracted to rock stars
My life starts where your life ends
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, till my hip don't hop anymore
So break down that wall, baby
'Cause I just want to know, I need just a little
It ain't my fault if you balled hard
Let me feel it
I'm sick of second guessing and I'm 
There's nothing left inside
You just tied me to the mast of the ship of fools
But my mind is numb and my mouth's okay
Sie muss sich mit ansehn wie die 
I'll call you a liar
I feel it in my heart and I know I'm not wrong
Don't just walk away unlock the chains from your heart
Fuck all haters I see 'cause I hate that you breathe
'Cause if you scream, I don't have to listen
Your lips display cancer and kissed my face after
Y'all motherfuckers is back
She lacerated me, exposing me piece by piece
Don't let the limelight you're standin' in blind you
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks
Good is the absence of evil
quando sei   disperato     come me         che muoio senza te
I love it, I hate it, baby
Oh, ain't no comin' back, baby, oh, no, no, ain't no comin' back
Talk is talk, and talk is cheap
No matter where you shoot me down
Swallowing this hurt
Why'd ya do it, she said, they're mine all your jewels
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
And no one's paying attention so I'm free to speak
Squamous god encoils the onyx shrine,
But I don't, I don't, I don't know how man
Just go back and hit 'em up style
The distribution of wealth
Plot the map plant the flag
Y'all been duckin for quite some time now
This life is sick I don't know why
And really don't know who you fuckin' with
Backbone, backbone, backbone, backbone
That have been lied to by their men
You gotta get up and fight
Face the enemy
And as she walked up to the blackboard, I can still recall the words she had to say
Temper temper, now, now, this is what you are
Ja tahtoisin loytaa sen kaiken
Now the FBI's all over my dick
I want it, I want it over now
See I do rhyme and crime so I can purchase more
That I don't have the words to explain to you what I'm feeling now
Ten years from now is anybody gonna bother
So just shut the fuck up and swallow
Il suo inferno porta portando guai 
Intend to deny, but when it comes back around
And your mother turns tricks
Living existences with no chance of scar
We sneak the guns right in, y'all keep tryin'
And never have to see your face again
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
Each moment here I die a little more
Evil is not the lust of men
I'm from where the war games fascinate you couldn't
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kids lips
This disease infested ball of lust and carnage
From these industry fucks to these faggotass punks
But you know I never stumble or lag last
Some memories never fade
Heads cracking up, biological depression, drugs aren't enough,
Cause mind control
Who walked away when the game wasn't fun to play
About these poison years
But you've got problems
I took the chance, I paid the bill, I nearly died for this music
Come on love, move over here
You can't do anything on your own but I'm gone now and
I wanna relive little minutes and try to keep the dream awake
A dispensable reject
And if you thought that you were free, well
This feels like a dream now, then it comes
Come on y'all your getting hit in the chest
Listen gravedancer, with disarray pander
Sink her to the level of the rest of us that inhabit the earth
We killin' so efficiently, we can't keep count
Caffeine addiction it feels so good 
Maybe I'm the same, nothing to take me higher 
Ritualize, please help me
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
I hold it inside as you sleep, as you hide who eased the pain of all your sadness
Don't be an optimist and try to rock with Bis
Put his face in the mud
I know I want you to know who I am now
Du spielst dein Spiel, doch drei war eins zu viel, eins zu viel
No making friends today
Oh yeah, straight to hell
I'm taking fire
Of course all the power I create in my hand
You are the pain
My rage is my strength  it gives me might
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
I don't want to go to heaven, its filled with pricks like you
That's why I'm trying to warn you people
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
I guess that time cannot heal every wound
But you accept it by drowning out the doubt
I gotta let you know got no time to play
I don't wanna love you, love you
Let me know boy, boy
I beg your skin, You buy a whore
There's a place where time stands still
Now all that's left of me, is what I pretend to be
This soil is dripping with the blood of angels
Cross my heart hope not to die
Under my skin
I'm sick and tired of the games you played
Hey girl, you know you drive me crazy
You don't know what it takes to get this motherfucking drunk
A blind man with blind faith is he your fuckin' enemy
I will never be dependent again
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms
I expose that dirty bitch for the ho that she is;
Beneath those deep black pools
Treason is the reason for my poison years
When I don't even know how to save myself
They wasn't up late night losin' sleep wit'chu
The one ashamed to be a man
Make cowards disappear into thin air by puttin' shit through 'em
Just tear down that wall, girl
As you struggle to break this invisible grip,
Too much government control
Run through the answers and you can feel the scratching
We see our heads collapsing until we find some kind of space,
No time for games, tonight we fight
It's cold when I touch you
For crying out loud
And don't let them fool you with their milk and honey
Do what you want and you're never gonna keep me down
Yo, maybe you didn't break the way you should have broke, yo
When someone disrespects you
Enough's enough's enough's enough
Ihr zwei klingt am Mic wie keifende Klatschweiber
This is a reason to die
Go 'head, with your games
Brother, Friend, it's not like I want this to end
So how does it feel to know that this is all you'll ever be my darling
With a motherfuckin' hole in ya back
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
Burn motherfucker, burn x
Sometimes I hate myself for being blind
After all you're not a fool
And do some drinkin' fast
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
Exposing all your fucking lies
But he won't succed as long as I stand true to my ways
They say things to you, because they want things from you
Instincts with imprinted cryptic code
I guess it, I guess it's over now
And the Earth is full of lurid madmen,
Come on, Ryde or die
Take your face out of your hands
Dude No, no, that's awful that tastes terrible
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
The money's just doubled
To the end I will not stop
It's fight music
Priviledge
I feel so alone
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in
Oh, foot of pride come down, ain't no comin' back, ah, ha, ha
Don't shame me for calling it quits
And if you've ever heard me talk about it you can tell
No, I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
You are dead and nobody cares about you
Me and Fred about to go half of Microsoft yeah
I sit alone and think of darkness while the sun is raised
Where were you when they screamed your name
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide
Pushy mother, lost brother in real hot pants
Gonna make you money, gonna make you a man
To suck in one good breath and scream,
Is half my DNA
The pain comes back in an ugly design 
I don't know if I'll cry
But I know I better bite the bullet
Don't know what you've got
I'm cast out by my relatives 'cause they don't want me around
I got a urge to kick down doors
I'd reek of hate disturbed
'I'm gonna warn, you just one time'
I can't die
You suck
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you
Till I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
Hook Eminem
To ever get back again
I will stab it dead, dead
It is no myth; no it's the Bible of the God
I'm running from the maladjusted boy I used to be, 
Aw shit baby, are you married
Your arms beneath me
That's not what I'm saying
Diese Welt war verlogen
But hasn't your donor card expired
That had seen her love desert her just like sleep
I'll call you a mother fucker
In the book that your friend signed yesterday
I'm not into Jailbait but my girlfriends only seventeen
Your shattered world is your piece of mind
Hey, hey, hey, ain't no comin' back, baby, ain't no comin' back
Secret sanctuary of my thoughts
Let me know how you feel
Is your exclusion of dissidence masking your guilt
For the blood which we dine
I thought I saw what Malcolm Little saw inside the game
Ask that nigga named Bryan, caught six in the spine
Etta ma en oo huono en oo huono
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap is tight but I'm
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
Did you ask if I minded
My need for innocence
All the years it took to build these walls
I laid my black heart on the table
I know it all too well
Look, she dresses Look at her a mess, what do you see I don't know
Crumbling in disgrace
They believe you were there why deny what I said
Do you want to go to heaven
Fuck the morals, does it make any money
You don't love me, you just hate bein' alone
Gotta work every day
Got to hang these bones out to dry
You may have your own airplane
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
Just us four niggaz
Is it in my blood to have to take you down
I want your heart, I want your head
Sister, Companion, it's not like I planned to abandon,
The truth will hurt more than lies
I wanna see ya squeal
Dabble in fall of failure
I been back and forth and up and down again
Someday you look back and you wonder why
Will crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels
Since birth I been raw hot like surface core
You don't really want anymore from me
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Where you can't holler none
Fuck with this discussion
Push me to the edge
That the cream cannot help but always rise up to the top
Tass'on nainen tuulen tuoma 
Wenn du mich schon betrugen musst, dann lug mich nicht auch noch an
Pig feed killing soil
I'm not saying forget
'Cause I'm sick and tired of waiting
Yeah tell the motherfuckers they were wrong
Reflections of another land
Now, some of us do but most of us don't that's just how a nigga feel
I hold it inside as you sleep, as you hide
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
Your confession of faith is far behind you now,
God is a gun and the bullets are free
Around your neck
When you hear him knock four times
Can help you dull the pain
But in the end I know I'll win
Bust my gun
You are blood nothing more
I've given you drugs
Now simple feet that flicker like fire
es jagt dich weiter durch die Nacht
So try not to feel like that today
Or is it just a lie
Wahrend ich mein Reim wie 'n Keim frisch in die Erde pflanz',
This time you die
These boots are made for walkin'
Yes, you're gonna burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
It holds the answers
Though none should save me
Gonna hang these bones out to dry
Got a union too, everything can move
Every single second I'm alive I'm a mess
I'm taking a ride with my best friend
It would be hell for me
Who look at your face from more than one angle
In the face of diversity
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger
That's right You don't hurt me And I don't need you No more Don't want to see you No more
Do what you feel you must
Be it your cousin or your uncle or your lover 
finche non capirai
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Shut the fuck up
But had no life, no purpose
Whether enemies exchange negative energy
Are you leavin' now, boy
We're only giving a fuck
With the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
My selfish ways are out of control
And sometimes I don't even want to be alive
At the end of this rope
Hey, no comin' back when your foot of pride
Always have to have the last word, no matter what
You feel like the fans owe you somethin' and you're gettin robbed
It feels like a broken bird
Fills all minds all the time
It's do or die, it's do or die
I'm pinned down but I need to move
Brings out in me the scent for the kill
This shit's about to go down nigga
Is ever, ever going to end
Watch your back
It's a revolution, brothers and sisters
In my weakened state, I could fall for you
Make her cry make her thighs twitch then cum on her tits
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
And I fail to be
Your little half ass, direct hits
Do you want to be dissident in the world that you've built
Remembering your face again
No love, no love, no love
The good ones died, the others just got old
Oh no OK
Don't give a fuck
Drains like water out the hole at the far end
You wanted the Waldorf Astoria
quando sei     disperato       come me      senza te
Drunken and pedestrian, taken from behind
We're gonna talk about mm mm
Then burn the flag down
You were blood that's all
Feel life the sweet life is all I want
Then go and get the straps nigga gunfire with me
Been a long time since I been serious
Hopeless but endless love story
Lightning in my bones
Fuck the bullshit I kick a bone out yo' ass
And the sad thing is I want you
I will kill it dead, dead
When you ain't got enough to get by
Play that fucking music
Meine Raps sind so hei�� wie in der Sauna 'n Daunenschlafsack
Na dno czary z onyksu
You don't know yourself
A slight grease fire, accidentprone at home
But if you keep preaching then you just might believe it
I wanna be
You keep tellin' me lies
You'd better spend it fast
I'm my strongest ally, living life as I know how
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't
More will my friends stand for
Protect you from a world of hate
You are the storm
Fools will be fools
Too afraid of anything that may not
I guess you fucked it up
And a cigar, a good cigar now and again
Where I walk hand in hand with death
Tired of wearing this yellow thong
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
But you raise me twenty, I'm raising you five
All your monoliths will crumble
Stupid, 'cause no one cares,
Say ya want to be wit' me
Like we don't know
Curb chasin, straight lacin, with a Mac blazin'
Yet your begging falls upon deaf ears
Make me sick, they're all pricks
But to me its just another tale from the darkside
But not enough for you to get off your ass off the floor and do it
There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind
Dont shoot the lame horse for bearing bad news
Our currency is flesh and bone
It will make you want to KILL YOURSELF
Ihr wirkt auf mich wie Witzfiguren oder die Teletubbies
Wraiths and fiends whirl to my bidding
Can't stop this pain
Tend to lead to mutilated daughters
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no
I'm the motherfucking ungrateful
Philipp Dann war' der Track doch zuende, war' doch schade drum
I'm careful not to break
Don't dare to be hungry
No getting out, no question of a head start fair or fake,
Burn burn burn burn
I feel like I could drown
Yeah, you want the big one
No non ce la fai piu
I've seen them rise and fall
Out of the flock, now you I choose
Everybody knock ya down
I was a hitman with no friends
Don't blame me for sinking the ship
Ich diss euch hemmungslos wahrend ihr mit NutellaToast im Keller posed
Cheery retard masses with evil osmond smiles,
And me that I believed that was wrong
Wait, stop and see what I do next
Stand your ground
Foot, foot, foot, foot of pride come down
Another life, another night
Johnny's takin' heads off of all faggots who hate
God is a gun and it's on a shooting spree
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
I'm on fire
Or somebody in the club gettin' shot tonight
This time you're asking why
So afraid of anything that may not come that easy
But to the light side it don't matter none
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
'Cause YouKnowWho snatched the mic from YouKnowWho
It doesn't feel like me anymore,
Tomorrow I'll be back home
There's madness in your soul
There is no place to call home
How many people does a smart bomb kill
Adam saw the garden and jumped the fence
Tulvassa kelluen, latomerta tuijotan
I wanna jump but I don't know why
Intense isolation is all that you know
" miles to their homebase, Compton"
All the remains is a strange kind of fear Yeah
The end of all the things you know
The only boy I understand
You're not that smart 
I hate it all, I hate my friends
Fuck fight music, bitch, this is losing your life music
Got a monkey on my back
Oh how the seasons change, and your mind will do the same
I'm not moved that much but what I just heard moved me to the left
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
I hope I'm crazy
The music she make, rubbing our faces in the feces of the daybreak
In the name of god you fight the unholy war
Patiranno il giro di vite ineluttabile
You better look me in the eye when you talk that shit about me
If you thought things had changed
The war on terror is a war on peace
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Is it me Is it really me I cannot stand myself
Let no heart be faint, let the battle rage on
Let me know, know
What you want me to tell you, I sold a little dust
And I don't want to be the one you're not thinking of
Go burn the whole house down, like anyone cares
You're a cancer causing, cancer having slob
Vicious lies that terrorize
Another group of monster teenagers shot up their school today What makes them do it Video games Marilyn Manson Oh, it can't be the parents, or the fact that school sucks, or that the jocks do get patted on the head every time they beat up the weirdos and the jobs you get once you graduate from school are stupid, boring, meaningless, and a deadend to insanity
The mattress hit, the mistress fooled
Your words just fuel my rage
But this ain't no headtrip honey
I won't kill or die for it
I don't give a damn"
Converting the world claiming your word is law
He talked of how it came about
How fuckin' stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this
From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by
Making a noise like an animal
The term they apply to us is a nigga
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out
I love reading the palms of bitch rappers>
All the friends think you're a fuckin' comedian
Under the gun to be a man
Every bit of something we call home
Well maybe I don't wanna know
The message stays the same,
I fear you
I'll fight for it
I'm so mad, I'm bad this mornin', like Jesse James
Your best friend today
Another human again
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain
So you better let him know that
Everyone I know
Evil are those who call it sin
Got a snow machine
There'll be no sorrows left to drown
Oh, Another face joins the crowd
My good boys good girls and good gods
I'm tuning in, turning on, and tuning in
Echoes of impermanence
Daddy's gonna die  wave byebye
Let me know if you will
Dieser Sippschaft, die du deine Freunde nennst
I don't even want to go
But if you get caught you're left to rot
And burn like candles in smokey spires
Can I hit that can I rip that can I lick that Can I get that from behind
To my head, it's probable, the claws are sharpened, sharp and ready
She can see the birds living in the leaves with their fucked up, fucked up language
I don't feel it,
 And roads of nonchalance grew upon
Can turn y'all into someone else
The captains of industry just lie there where they fall
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
It's a false state of elation, you can join the Prozac nation if you want to
Then something happened that took a bite
Another question you won't like to see
Those in the know, don't ever flatter her, they go one better
Sometimes I hate myself without compromise
Is ever going to end
Y'all know who the fuck I am
Bleed it, Beep it, whatever you want
Shoot the man, I still stand
Or simply hide it in the chest of drawers inside your room
Almost feeling safe
'Cause he's got nothing to hid you just put him down Go
I'm sick of seeing you around this town, oh
Place him face down on the bed
He lied to her, with a perfectly straight face
The backbone of this country is the independent truck
Zachowa��a pitno
What you do won't scar me no more
Someone hear me, please, all I see is hate
And there ain't no engine built fast enough
Another chance
The pain has gone numb
Chick You asshole You shit
Like fire in the rain
But I hate him just enough to get off
Und mich beliebt machen
Elevate the zone, ain't no fiction
Then Jem yelled out "Oh Citizens, this system is a curse
The dirt that I shovel to uncover the truth
No excuses, no illusions
Well I, I'm not angry, anymore
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me
Pasty skin and heroin
I start to choke, break in half 'cause I can hear the battle sounds
I'm a hammerhead who wants to get stopped
I ain't splitting nothing with nobody homie I gotta give me me
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
You may be an asshole
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
Sometimes we're all victims of depression and unrest
I hate
Either left or raving views
No Rather raise the Starry Plough on high, sing a song of freedom
It drive LA insane
Throw it all back
Now, we don't believe you should be bringing up your little girl this way" 
Go back to your rock punk
I'm bumpin' up the sweetness
Blast while you right hooking, right when your wife's looking
I'm not quite as well
You said you hope that I'm happy now
You destroy us all as you feast on the last of your own blood
Just the sight of one more child screamin' from hunger in a Dublin slum
Stand up, lay down for no one
Asshole  the shit is goin' down right now
For this world to stop hating
But you will never understand
Cocktail parties, personal talkers
Got another that makes two 
You'll pick a fight with anyone
Am ersten warmen Tag dieses Jahr
Someone say surrender so I sulk
You sing to sing his praise because you're lazy
But he underestimates my mind
This is a call to arms
The drugs don't thrill me, and my life's about to kill me and I'm pretty sure I'll end up all alone
I can take the fight
I can't believe the guy could be entirely dead
The belief of higher purpose is yours not mine
No more broken bones 
At first them chicks didn't want to speak to you
Using infrared
I know the haters are busy making up hater lies
It's so hip and it's so tragic if you're fortunate enough to be confused
While all LA's a fuckin' mess
I held her claws as we walked between the headstones
I'm murdering and stabbing so much vag I'm wanted for vagaside
Deine Party war an einem Sonntag Abend
So sick of your games, I'll set your truck to flames
The thought of you makes me sick
Who the fuck are they foolin
Raw paws won't stop these dancing feet
So you want it
Planning their attack
Did I piss in their gene pool
I am the weakness you cannot control
She knows his name Stopping all she can
You won't feel a thing
'Til you died But you're still alive
I said please, smile just before you cry
Watch me beat the case
And I'm right right, you're wrong left
I don't want to go
Get the bird, bring her down to the ground from out the air
I tried to scream but it didn't work,
Always sinking to new levels
Name this for me, heat the cold air
When there's no one left to FIGHT
Sie hasste mich 
So forget this so called dirt of mine
Don't want to burn up
It's not like we'll get another chance to do this
My live niggaz in the spot
Landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
You're not the one impressed
Who won't take a stand
What the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my life
What's she thinking Does she really believe
The Diva de los Muertos is just swallowing my skin
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
Wipe that prada smile from that rada face
The fucking wars
Always gone too far  always over the edge
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
When you're near, my blood runs wild, and I see red
A restless reaction to what I witness
Something left that a kiss could not destroy 
Got locked in this cage of a cold cold world
Keep my head up high, looking toward the sky
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
Perche lo fai disperata ragazza mia
With the rest of the mess that you made in your chest of drawers
Now I can be controlled
How would it feel to have to be real
Where the hell is my father shit it hurts sometimes
Sano aaneen se kulta
Father forgive me for my sins
Hardrock nigga I kick a stone out yo' ass
It's a revolution Baby, you're a smash
I want it so much
When you have to face me, you're never as bold
That she's above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets
You can fake it, that's all right
You end up in an icedout sarcophagus
These devices do not function
You've been playing games
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
Ryde or die
Friend you'd better think again
I said before that today I hate everything
I am your savior, you await my return,
Well it's good that I'm not angry, oh anymore
They got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names
If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave
You don't come home to me Oh, no
Don't you turn away
All my questions all are meshes, wallowed sections
The best fuck you've ever had
Ah, I feel better now
Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear
When we die, we won't make +Jet+
And if I could, I'd turn my eyes
I'll put it in black and white
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
Now when colors turns to grey
Look at her now
Matches the color of the one on my face
Every cop killer goes ignored
Droppin' some shit that's DOPE
The best heroin that money can buy and
Now at the age of  tin still won't turn to gold
You're no one 'til some one
And on this dark night of my soul 
Spinning out of control
Words fail me
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna
I don't know how a creep can sleep
I'm not angry and I've never been above it
A fucking waste of sperm
Or his mother slavin'  hours a day for the scum
Is death the only way to get attention
Out of the darkness wolves will come
Who makes the gun into a sacrament 
My thinning blood, reactionbased anxiety,
I don't mind if it was your day that I spoilt 
Don't point your finger of blame
Faded and fell to the ground
Who render rage a necessity
I really would die to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto 'cause it houses minorities
I'll keep you closer now
Your eyes will not tell a lie
Io non so stare solo
We're living what we're singing
Standing in the middle of war
But who the hell am I cursing those whose skin
I punch through the wall as I break my fist 
Davvero come deflagrasse un mondo
This is war
So scream you, out from behind the bitter ache
Take a look at where your money's gone seen
I want to relive little minutes, but they just keep stacking up on themselves
You knocked me out
You make me feel like a piece of meat
Into the floor we'd sink, with another drink
I hate myself
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
Make you move like an animal
Increasing the weight
I'm frantic in your soothing arms 
A stupid fucking bastard
Dead eyes live lies, I know you're sore
I'm off the deep end
And why your talk is always cheap
I don't wanna hear it
I know you did what you had to
We will fight them off
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
There's no one to protect you
I would take every single person that's sick and tired of working jobs like on the auto lines and things like that, who's worked for years and years for nothing and never getting ahead;
You say you want things to be even and you want things to be fair
Maybe it's what keeps them always coming back
Happiness is a state of mind
Second to none
He danced upon the bonfire
It's cold when you are down
So call the police narcissistic, narcissistic
dass ich mich rachen kann
New soldiers now say
One minute I'm cool, the next minute I'm up on a nigga, rippin'
It's on your face that I'm gonna sit
Fuck the world nigga ain't nobody getting out alive
Territorial and pissing
Why'd ya do it, she screamed, after all we've said
Street logic and demonology
But I see now
Sweetheart, I'd send you up to heaven
And he says, "I know you"
I hate the trees
Tin soldiers
ala nosta edes kattasi
You go your way and I'll see mine
Flatten every surface, destroy difference
I feel it beneath me, giving way
Oh baby doesn't that feel right
I think I'm crazy
The flames burned out, still embers glow
mika sina oot
It's time motherfucker for the shit to go down
Believe what you want, but I think you don't know
The truth isn't easy when you live in fear
Classic, cases of fools made from plastic
This song was written about how much I hate you
That's a fact got a fear on their bozack
Parting the waves of those few feint friends
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast
Hello, hello, hello
'Cause I'm a nigga known for havin' a notorious past
But inside your heart it is black, it is hollow and it's cold
You wonder to yourself how come that man hasn't burned out
So you wanna go to bed with me 
A loaded gun jammed by a rose
Oh, oh, ain't no comin' back
Start slimin' up the walls, leave him in his draws
Don't need the lies
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I've seen enough to know that I can't see at all
Give me the pain that you feel
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Now I lay in your arms
Psycho shutter speed
We all have a dark side, to say the least
I'll be singing
The more I think, the less I've got to say I don't remember you no more
And nobody knows what to do, what's your point of view
But staring at you now I'm glad he did
I know you are but what am I
Shine out ends
I'm not yours to control
The turnin' point from which things could never be the same
To another place it ain't worth these tears
And you are the storm that's raving me
The walls are closing in on me
A thousand faces stare you down
You should have thought it through before you blew it
Dispute the suits I ignite and then watch 'em burn
They shot him in Kilmainham jail but they'll never stop his cry
Shed my skin, time wears thin
Chili di silenzio sulla nostra pena
That can kill and reveal the front of your grill
And no substance
A disgrace without integrity
We loving the broads, there's nothing to applaud
Feel me, feel me
And I'm here to remind you
And you keep saming when you ought to not bet
I've given you too much thought
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm
And a mess out in Brooklyn, HIYAHHHHHH
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called
I don't understand why
Trying not to see exactly when and where you failed 
No more smokin' on the plane
Just turn your head and I will be replaced
There's not a lot of difference between a foxhole and a grave
You're making me want to end this relationship 
I could never believe you'd do me in
Xzibit's on the track
That he lost his truth, so caught up in believin' his own press
Don't hate me for what you've got, I've given you love
'Cause I believe that miracles
To standing around being abused
I've now introduced you to your future ways
Wbi��a no i kwiat ludzkich trumien
Well, it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
Voiced in a distant rumble
Feel me, feel me, feel me, hey, hey feel, woo
Of my chest, the small intestines, large intestines, all a plexus, all digested
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The only religion I know is dripping from my pen
I can't go one day without y'all in my face
So let 'em all kill each other
I don't wanna go to work but I must
Got the whole world shocked now
You are the answer
All he wants to do is survive this painful cancer
Your parasitic existence terminated, piss on your remains
And for God's sake, don't let them bury me in some field full of harps and shamrocks
And the businesses that burned us all
Then I'm coming back for you
I'm sorry if I'm a little confused if you're leaving
See TIP don't like the game
It's cold when I'm near you
I fuckin' love you
Goddamn thing
No, I'm not sorry
I just want you back
So put your fist down until sanity can be contained
You say you have all the answers
Get away get away get away now
No need for talking, have my dough
Your run slows to a crawl
Is there hope for the blood of live
Two kills to me, two hearts too far
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
Scattered thoughts and scattering masses
es schlagt mich weiter durch die Nacht
You want another chance
Running wild
'Cause I'm running from these things on me
Do you have yourself a boggle here that I can help you through
Welcome back my friends
The universe is so cold
There is no turning back
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit, and start over from scratch and write new ones
Collecting guns they rape your daughters but its nobody's at fault
I don't know what put me there
With the gun I bring its straight for beatin' you down
And ya know I'll do it too
No time for reason  I'll pass
The Earth will be burning
Leave me alone now
Too afraid of anything you may not have seen before
Don't wanna be that guy
'Cause I gotta knock you out
A revolution just arrived like the morning
You are the anger
'Cause it's your turn now
I'm a dickhead, yeah, yeah
queriendo cerrar una herida
For with death you have been kissed
Can't help myself
I thought you should know
Zdaj ni ve nabijanja v prazno
Crushed and shit your bones and blood siphon
Where platinum comes in eight stack, bitch
We burn out before we fade away
The light flashes and the mind goes numb
A sole voice to justify a reason for so many to decry
I just can't stand your apathetic motion
Wish I could turn around
Well, I can't stand to feel your touch
Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't cum oh
Over and over and you wouldn't talk about it
Say we won't lie to ourselves like those bastards you swear
Look at me now
voglio ancora le tue dita     che graffiano la schiena
Our kids die in deserts, they been sent that way,
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
I won't fight for a cause that's been lost
I tried to leave but it didn't work,
I couldn't even step out the baby blue Bonneville
Pissing in
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
And I'm a fuck you up, ooh I got your crazy
He knows where he's taking me, taking me where I want to be
Or burn your star with  points
I'm liberated "A republic for people to have in them self respect"
Where were you when the babies died
'Cause it's just another one of his
The will to deny and I'm standing in the dark all over again,
All your bones corroded and they hide inside decaying flesh
In front of a class of gawking fools who'll never understand  They never understand
Yeah my friends all tell me but my friends all lie
Talk shit and ya dyin' if ya think that I'm lyin'
Still you're the only one I want
I'm raw lightning my power extends
Good daddies won't let you die
You'll surrender to your creatures
I will wait until the end
Can you get up off your knees
Oh, no, yeah
When a faith is sealed without you
It's not that I hate your world
A petridish community's token of infection
And knowing that you dug your ditch and climbed in anyway
No one's gonna give a shit when I die
Bass drums and tambourines
Repented all my sins to scientists that came in a dream,
All that heat that you feel
Who had a teenage daughter that attended Harper Valley Junior High
But I've got   niggas strong
Don't try to fight them, it's too late
Time and time you fucked me over
All her thoughts would compose a careful symphony
Move you move like an animal
Hah, bitch you get
Than your fucking soul
This calamine lotion made my skin feel good
'Cause it's sick
Kicking and screaming, thinking that I meant it
I'm not angry and it's never been enough
When I got a sawed off, bodies are hauled off
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
All hell Xzibited lick
BITCH throw your fuckin' guns up, put your fuckin' hands down
And drag 'em back to the harbour for the local photographers
You cheeky devil you, it's not even dark
It just don't matter
Touch gloves take your corners and come out fighting when the bell rings
They call the revolution
Oh, now dance for me you fucking puppet
With no better plan
I've got no more inside
I can't fuck with them overseas
Nobody but you has to, hold onto the fight
Vinnie Paz got more hoes then Jim Duggin
'Cause innovation's really hard to sell
The fire started long ago
Grief's the mother of invention
Swear I'm gonna kick it
mita sina oot
When you could rescue yourself from the fear that drives your hate
Oh, oh, oh, ain't no comin' back, you know that
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct 
Because you caught up in the matrix you blind you sleeping homie
You said you want what now
A point scored they could give a fuck about us
 Enough to ensure,
When there's nothing behind it
We've got one chance to break out
I look for power within me
Choked screams appear
Selling junk only cowards will buy
And now the pain it takes control 
Ich ertrage es schon viel zu lang, oh, viel zu lang
The return of Goodfellas Part Two
Son of a bitch you broke my heart
Chick Oh, that was great and everything, but you know,
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere, but straight to hell
Let's blow the motherfuckin spot
With Loki DMS, JJohnny to my left
Another little piece of me
I just don't know
To the sound of breaking glass and sirens calling
It's all that I can do to get up off the ground
I'm falling into darkness
Jedi mind tricks
Making it lie down
Or swallow potential heart attacks
I've thrown half credit, and I know I'll never get it and I'm pretty sure I'll end up all alone
I have no friends you still actin' up
Why'd ya do it she said, why'd you let her suck your cock
You lost nigga
Ring the alarm we come to wake up the snoring
How you feel, what you think of me
'Cause I don't know what to feel
Must be some new niggaz
Dreams of tomorrow as darkness descends
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
The dark down road of his approach in constant rain was drenched
Drown the crunch out with your headphones
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I will never let you die
To retain control of an open mind
Out of the dark the wolves will come
Kuplassa istuen, latomerta tuijotan
Well, I'm here to remind you
Just another shooting star
��destruye a aquel que se imponga sin sentido
I'm not the way I used to be
With the sound of gun shots
My name is James Connolly, I didn't come here to die"
Dark boys on the black gas see they don't black mask
I'm about to break the spell you cast
No direction, my compass is broken
It cuts at me like a knife
I know what really matters
Well, can you feel it
You've been kissing when you ought to be ascrewing
There is no resolution at the end of the day
I wait for no one
You can't to a psycho like a normal human being
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
I know you think it's a real drag
We see right through your display
You're a fucking prick
That's the word don't you know
I'll be cold walking through the backbay flinging bricks
weil ich mitleidig zuseh' wie dein Style in Schutt und Asche fallt
Raining teeth, blood and spit
A gun to your head
When there's nowhere to run to
Take it back Sisqo, you know where it belongs thong ththong thong
Dell'inferno ulula la realta 
People standin in the park
Perhaps my raps will paralyze a bitchass and make him collapse
Why should I lose myself in this fighting
Instead I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
With no intent to change
Is somebody there to catch my fall
This is what I feel, ooh, this is what I feel
Quando sei   disperato come me senza te disperato
Fuck this let's just kill them dead
Du bist jetzt 'n MC und endest doch als Industriekaufmann
Turn you into anything that they want you to be
Tibetan Black Magic, I'm a warlord
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
Yet and still you want a try
You still want love, love's ugly, smooth and delicate
You love to pass your time
To make me and scream and bleed
And it knows my name
Can you feel me
Where were you when the war began
With speeches you repeat that mean a lot to you
It's through the fight, it's time and I
With some innocent intents too intense 'cause you said "be gentle"
I've lost my mind
I get a bloodlust when I see a slug bust
Bring that shit back in
It's just a little bit of ghetto blasphemy
Leggero ed impassibile
Clementine Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive But I'm just a fuckedup girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind; don't assign me yours
God, help me to believe
Another tragedy has passed
Sometimes I hate myself for what I've done
Verbal abuse It's totally your fault
To the cries rapidly becoming screams
Y'all ain't ready fo this shit we finin to crash da mutha fukin' club dawg
They're in control now
Light a cigarette, flick it at them or spit it at them
Ma naan kun sa poistut pystypain
And throw my crown upon the ground
So you say I'm not real
You recoil in revulsion, but that will soon pass,
No one now is getting dead
So what the fuck you know about being a gangsta
Don't you know that, killing is my business, and business is good
His true fears he left without a care
No sleep till the location is found
Wir waren beide jung, ich hab dir verziehen
I'll shed no tears for you
Understanding
I left it in your hands
My innocence has been tarred
You are not alone
I drown on the streets and I'll never learn
When you need my help I never tell you no
Ey, wahrend ich Mic's burn wie beim Grillen Kohlebriketts,
Not to mention, you're just following a trend
Watch your back
You're shit
Is this supposed to be my golden years
Why do you gotta be such a dick 
Can't save your house god burn your soul
Blood in face
Ain't nothing to me 'cause I am the streets
So charred and black
While forests choke under a 'lever sky
Would you like to be friends
Your will to ignore, but when it cuts back round
Oh yeah, I'm so mad
Are you brave enough to see
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
I guess you fucked it up this time
I feel around me
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you spit on my snatch
When passion becomes status end
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I come down in a couple of days
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
Down on my knees
I don't want to remember summers in December
Maybe we're the same, nothing can stop the fire 
Here's to you, Lily, the rights of man and international revolution"
I'm not a nice person
Eat grass; and little else
'Cause we drunk drive Cadillacs, we never go far
Fuck just like a whore and smell like whiskey and some Listerine
Defeat the Monkey Defend the heavenly throne
You carry rocks in your head and pitch them
You are the end
So far from sincere I love you, fabrications in my ear
Whenever that's why my shit is hot, can't keep it real
Bitch you get no No love
The stupid hippies, too stoned to see their lives are fucked,
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
Divided we stand and united we fall
You'll never understand
Now you can rest in pieces
Tell me where to start, think I'm at the end 
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine
But not without affection, no not alone
You wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh
Now I'm not afraid to kill this
And show you how to hold your tongue
As I have said, none resist my charm
Le nocoj ta pomlad je le za naju
So fly the fuck away
Yeah, use your rights but don't imagine that its heard, Oh no no
Started as a sketch in my notebook
If you wanna see tomorrow better get out of town
'Cause today I hate everything Buy
Every time you knock me down
May I help you
Le cose opache li' intorno si muovono
But if you were, yes, if you were, I wouldn't want you anyway
I'll kill you
Sie war gegen das Leben
Famous has made you shameless
Always making certain that there's one thing left
Take me back to days of summer
Nobody gives a fuck about you I'm ruined
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
Say no possessions but get all that you can
You're losing control narcissistic, narcissistic
You make me feel like I'm nothing
Leaving scars and fucking stars
Won't take it back
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
But I can't erase this pain
Fuck this lets just kill them dead
You ain't drunk mutha fuka
I'm bout to crash the club break the law throw some chairs crack your jaw if its killin' season ain't no reason ain't no need to stall I'm the one put here to abosrob all this energy and pain none stop pop to the top of the clip and your glock I still don't feel ya man cause of that crown the coke now I'm fuckin' a puond of drow when I'm on the leval and wit my killas you'll be found on the flour I must confess I ain't bout shit but if you think of crossin me bitchand let them stank and walk the plank and empty out your pocets bitch break the law break your legcrash the club and crack you neck with these issues that I'm facing dayly I should toll the tec get respect that's no option all the haters fulled with toxin walk right through this inturupt the crowd and pistalls get to flossin cousein problems dodgen bulets soon as I currupt the sceen leavin' damage makin' habits reaction fuckin' wit me chance of your desact go though my head when you ignight the flame lead to your disaster befor it hit you brain
Walking pile of shit
E quando sei     disperato come me      senza te
Send George Forman
And I don't understand
No one to tell you when to stop
Stare into the eyes of blood, 
You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
Better come back on the inside, 'cause you got too much to lose
Get the fuck out of here
You fuckers never should've let me out
You see the rest they lookin' like they need a rest
I feel your warmth on my face and these thoughts in my head
The power of the trucker comes from his truck
Rough gets smoothed, everything can move
She's so raunchy, so vulgar, not me, why the hell her
Now point four fingers and watch through binoculars
perche non vuoi che il mio amore ti porti via
Just before you cry
But I'ma raise hell to the bitter end  I'm a soldier
Destruye a aquel que se imponga sin sentido
You paint the sky such beautiful shades
Step on its fucking head
But not for something that I have never seen
You're too many tears too late
And my night stands are full of open Bibles, uh
Killing is my business, and business is good
Now she tellin' you you're not givin your heart
You can't make it fit when it works like this if it becomes a job
Last time you saw that nigga is the last time you'll see that nigga
The cycle continues time for your crime 
Vicious lies being heard you stand there how absurd
I'm looking for a fight, at  on a Saturday night
I state it perfectly clearly so that you know I ain't playing
We don't even care what you know or think
A subtle prick, a blatant lie, your denial
Can't you help me be uncrazy
Two newspaper editors like playground sneaks
Imploring "Another melody"
dove non entra piu neanche la polizia
Passing themselves off as leaders
I'm the shit bitch
Don't you realize you're killing in your sleep
There is the gleam of blackened steel in the flickering torchlight,
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
It's no coincidence bitch
Takes war to make us live free
Voor m'n vrienden, die ook vanavond weer de weg
My head beats like a drum
Man you're seeing that you're sinking over time and you're blind
Don't leave me now 
Sway  so hypnotic x
You had your chance, but you built bombs to bring hell on us
So fuck you
Strung out on your wire
I keep my head in tune with my thoughts  are always clear
Verbal abuse I guess you want some more
This is a sad day To none is it sadder
Trying is not enough
And I'll be left with a broken heart to heal all alone
From across the room
I've had enough, morning papers chill me to the bone,
Back in time for those you know
I ain't no puppet on a string
I am so aware of you
You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell
The size of my game
Bass
Fuckin' with the hard hitters, DTay my nigga
I know you weren't afraid
We ain't no cute niggaz
You step in my way, well now I have a little more to say
The sinking ship the grand applause
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck
Run away run away run away
die mich auf diesem Track storen, wegburnen
Nessuna cosa al mondo sa come si disperda
Insect gods
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
To recoup the losses and fall in line
Maybe I'm just losing my mind
Are you upward bound or will you burn in hell
Fire, all our guns
That I've fallen apart infront of an audience,
I told you, I was the street talker
'Cause I don't give a fuck about you or that shit that you're saying
Some say, they wanna shoot the game
Those filthy mother
We'll let this battle pass us by
The rest of you could wither away and not a piece of me would care
All I see are daisies for miles and miles
Every note that I wrote will make you choke like joe smoke
I get mad as hell but that's ok
I want to hear your voice
If you're not yet a woman
It's confusing to wake up
Please listen to me and don't disagree
I will kill ya if you move in next to me
Fuck If you like it or not
And every now and then I think about you
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
There you'll go now you know
On a day like this, I'mma break my wrist when I write a little bit about the strangest kiss
Bacchanalian knowledge
Call me crazy
My drunken belligerence
Well I, I'm not angry, angry yeah
I rap like no one out there can fuck wit me Prodigy
Ain't no comin' back
My tender jewel my precious pearl
You will not get it without a price
Some people got no heart, that's just the way it's always been
And now we're through
But you won't get to see the tears I've cried
It's what you wanted
Managers fake friends, wannabes and visions, pop idol television
You know it ain't easy making me smile
I'm sure that god hates you, he thinks your an obsessed fan
The dogs of war won't capitulate
Still you cut your tongue out 'cause you don't want to taste it yet
Now I'm the terrorist see how it feels
Scared to believe
Your libidinous urges long repressed
I wanna DIE on the DARKEST NIGHT
You were the gun in the hand of the killers
Ain't, ain't no comin' back
'Til you see a carcass at your feet and then you feast upon it
Hai gia pronto il piano di recupero
Come on now, explode
I'm big enough to be a man
sita mita sina oot
She can hear the water rushing underground
The double lives, the awkwardness
I don't want you
Listen to her try to suck me dry
Cause I can't breathe, no I can't sleep
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
Is in the fight of their life
Sometimes I hate myself for who I am
Think its fucked up now it get worst for y'all
Niggas talk about greatness
I don't need your money, your position or your caddy, Daddy
Ran fast enough
The scent of magnolia sweet and fresh
Lend me your ears for just another page
Westside tell me can you feel me, hey, oh
Me and Fest don't know if we should write more songs
Frustration isn't helping, turning black, decisions suck,
Discovery is to be disowned
These faces haunting me, I'm looking back and they are mine 
Wipe Ammonium Nitrate across the side of ya face
Your mind drowns in the crypt
So shut up and swallow
Keep my hostile thoughts to myself
Peel the top of your fucking face off like an orange
 The mind cannot mirror the soul
Mascarada, Incontrolavel
With no emotion
They label us as the love hate kind
My revenge on you will not kill you
And then you clenchfist, beat chest
Without attempting to overstand its basics
I feel so scared
Got a sick fucking mind
And my escape became my only game
I can feel the daylight
I hearken to the grisly murmer of nameless fiends,
The blood still tastes the same
I watch him struggle with the fact that he's become what he said he'll never be
Chances are usually not good
Cruising on the highway
But now they tryin' to get backstage to sneak a peek at you
You niggas flies
The fight was only mine
I'll realize all he really wanted
I moved you in, took you back
He lied to her
My summer's over and it's time to face the fall
'Wanna know a mystery
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em
To further burden divided friends
I am falling
Two steps behind me, stalkin
I'm a rock I'm a roll I'm a shock to your soul
Just bullet holes and broken bones
I have become my enemy number one
See go to war nigga, hard hitters we buck wild
In fault the line extends
She knows his name
There goes the Citizen Army with their fists raised in the sky
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
We could go dancing if you want to, 
'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time
Now what a fool are you
Hey, ladies, when your man wanna get buckwild
But there is really nothing left of
Archin' my back and on a straight rough
You never know who's around
Neither up nor down, just been turned and turned 
Cause this behavior, is gonna get me nowhere
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
You cannot crucify the dead
You still playin' games
Don't hate me for what you're not
That drops niggaz
So I'mma run till I can't run no more
'k Heb succes gekend, 'k heb ellende gekend
Ripping the rest
And all their lives, you won't stop giving them your Jipp
Leggero ed impassibile 
You made me feel alright, for once in my life
Touch my man again and I'm a fuck you up
They ain't showin' no love
Without warning, Happy drunk
You see me burning hotter and hotter and the years go by
Hope they know that around me talkin' about what you got will get you hit
'Til you died but you're still alive
Shut the fuck
You talk rich, you bitch
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Right now feeling pain, make it go away 
Your brainless, y'all don't wanna test Vinnie Paz patience
If any nigga looking too hard, we Rodney King'n them
I don't need no fame
Yeah once, once is real conniving, it's easy now,
I think I'm going out of my mind
Well you believe what you want, but I think you don't know
Another life, another night
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion
Your ma ain't trippin' now
Why'd you do it, she said, ain't nothing to laugh
Knock me, tryin' to stop me from my monopoly
I'm aiming your gun
J'veux de l'amour, j'veux de l'amour, in die hel
Blackness tossed against the wall
Je reste encore ouh, ouh
The rappers in their limousines just want to be loved
I want audience
Oh, no
I can't feel my heart, but I feel the shame 
I've had enough, my thinning blood, reaction based anxiety
You gotta hate that
And now I hate your every little everything
Or people in college, because I had to quit school, because I got so fucking paranoid, because after Kent State, after Kent State, I realized that I could put on a cheerleader sweater with a "I love America" pin and the people that were shooting wouldn't even aim and it wouldn't do me any good
You grip that throne to drink from hearts until their blood is drained
Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock
If you are able, sucker
Got somethin' to burn, and love to waste
Oh enough
Tryin' to knock boots nigga
I know a house upon a hill; we could stay there if you will
The chirps, I turn them into screams
Heart breakin', money makin', earthquaking, love fakin'
'Cause I really don't believe that you've got a headache
'Cause she had cobwebs up her fanny and I believe in giving to the poor
Leaving scars and crashing cars
No shut the fuck up
And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters
It ain't my fault you dirty your Victoria's Secretes
You've seen it hurts me not to fight
By turning countries into labour camps
Could not prepare me for the fall
Just another pierced goon of little faith
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
You may own half a city
Don't give a fuck
Es hat noch nie so weh getan
Your blood it flows in torment
'Cause you out there runnin' your mouth
Take a look at what they spend it on
I see you watchin
And I don't give a damn 'cause it's making no sense to me
Straightedge  in you face
I hate this bad attitude, I'm sure you hate me too
And pick up where we left off
Then we hit these niggaz spot up with fifty rounds
And as the cash box rang, I thought everything away 
I know I'm a reasoning guy
Of the mess you left when you went away
Nobody gives a fuck about you, or me
They're stupid or they're lying  or a little bit of both
A dispensable reject,
Y'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I say
One step forward and two steps back
They call me crazy, I think I'm crazy
Set to attack x
For the people who don't deserve it now
Squeeze your neck harder when you start to cough
About the fact that you fucked up
Who told you to beat it
Ain't but three comin' back
Si dejas atras la pregunta de como saldran
And it feels so real
I never wrote one single thing for you
She knows his name The devil treads the sand
 Unending questions driving me into insanity
Say, one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in
It's the bird, it must have been the bird, disgusting critter, it must
��destruyo a aquel que se imponga sin sentido
Haven't I been enough of a fool for you
Es ist vorbei,geschafft und du wei��t genau du hast schei�� gebaut und keine Frau wird dich so lieben wie ich
Ain't nothing to me 'cause I am the streets
A bleeding romance
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
No really its nothing
By the blaze of the burning skulls,
Far away from anyone's face
Is just the breath of the dying god who once ruled heaven
Waving his pistol in my face
Burn, ya burn, yes, you're gonna burn
For the fate of all mankind
No sleep till he's kicked right out of town
I am very sorry that we got your order wrong
Every now and then I know it's over
The general says we never miss a shot
But I will be on guard, I will fight it off
The number's even  now I'm leavin'
Reading a book at home they know what heat is
He got my wife
Arbor hospital, you never should've let me out
It's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now
But I understand him
All my niggaz
As if money is the cure
Well I've been there, and it's bitter
Quit making up stories, ah, give me a break
A lot of people say she's crazy
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Ora che sono Ora che sono qui
Never stop to rest
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
No time for all these games
This kin is a knock knock knocking on your door
come un gattino sopra un tetto di guai
Can't escape this place, I deny your face
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up
Go fuck and fuck and make a buck
Fire, all our guns and arrows
Geh jetzt, oho, nur diesmal fur immer
I feel so exposed
I can fake a smile of a kind that you've never seen
se tu volessi vivere io non ti lascerei
Grab what is left inside
I guess it, I guess it's over now now
Once I duct tape ya to the front of a Mack trucks, face ya
No sleep till that man is out of town
Give me a reason to fight
Hip parties and sunglasses at night they help him not to see
What, you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit
It wears me as skin
Come and go to summon hope with cryptic, fake glamour
Promises me I'm as safe as houses as long as I remember who's wearing the trousers
costretti all'immobilita', noi carne esanime e sfinita
These feelings are gone, they've been buried along who eased the pain of all your sadness
I'll put it all on the line for these gangsta ass niggaz of mine
Every move I make your ass got something to say
And did our laughter, did our tears
Let the bass paralaze
If we talk with them it would mean the end
Make my lungs black
So save your breath and the money you spent
olla sita mita sina oot
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it
My thoughts you hear and you begin to fear Fear
'Cause I hate everything
Leaves soak they drink
I'm running hotter and hotter and hotter
I feel, I touch, I breathe, I cry
Right now
But now you've no choice in this carnival game,
Exposed and bleeding 
"Go to hell," you said
Don't cry freedom 'cause you've stolen mine
Now they can't stand my black ass
The broken, breaking through
Another stain on you and me
Sleep to the sound of a chainsaw massacre
That I can say peace and the gunshots will cease
Now now learn to buck up
But it ain't there no more
Deine Raps sind stillos wie Sandalen mit wei��en Tennissocken
And I know y'all been lied to over and over again
Premonitions of sorrow and anger, even so
What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big
I fucking hate you; I'll take your drawers down and rape you
To hell in a heaven
There's not a net, there's no one there
There are hardly any left to penetrate
So lie your way out of this one again
I will choke it dead, dead
But mostly when I drink too much and I'm smoking too much coush and
Don't hate me for what you've got
But I see right through your skin
Cunts are still running the world
Our government is fucked
e non c'e' pace latente da cogliere
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy
This is the fuckin' shit I be talkin' about
It's dark, but love is so light
Seein the roof fall, feelin' the floors heighten
"We'd like to help you" the consul said
If you're lying there expecting me to suck your dick
But if you wanna get well then why the hell do you hesitate
Tomorrow, your worst enemy
See you ain't heard I hit a lick
Seeing you, it kills me now
I yelled out 'Ice Cube sucka'
Back until end
I'm sorry that it comes down to this 
Luchas contigo esta vez no puedes salir corriendo
Talkin' that shit  you're mine
Kick off these shoes 'cause I'm here to stay
We're breaking everything, rrowdy like a classroom
Takes war to let us live free
Just the dust of a plague, left that whole, left that whole
Tell me what y'all want
But there's nothing more sadistic than an infant
Yo, but Dre's a nigga with nothin' to lose
Resonating like a scream no one can hear
Don't want no trouble, I got to be the boss
And when the feelings come, I will fight them off
And you have the nerve to tell me that, as a mother, you think that I ain't fit
Till death kicks in your face
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers and made them drop his coffin
Primetime of the mind,
'Cause you a devil like the Canaanite in Sackcloth
A thick film of denial now coats your veins
Well it all dies anyway
Well good morning baby, welcome back to town
Factory farming killing flora,
What a beautiful cover, a talk show makeover, and you'll lose some weight
Policemen are my friends so why do they always stare
To you it's another day
Which proves to be a case of history repeating
You might come home with one less leg but this thing will surely keep a bullet out your chest
And gave it to a bird with nothing in her beak
Awake but entranced by a force that's unknown,
You know what I quit
Well death is a sick way for attention
That technology and reality would collide
So shut up and accept your fate
Prick my finger
To choose your fate
You think I'm vulnerable to your violence
Let's just fuck our brains out my love
Image is nothin' you frontin see the thirst in y'all
Rattatattat and all the punks scatter
"Nowhere to run to, baby Nowhere to hide"
I guess it's over now
Who turned out to be the younger wive's nursing schoolgirl crushes
What'cha really want
A lush that love to drink, drunk driving a tank
Isn't so messed up to be witness for a man who won't confess,
Den Herrn der sie liebte und der sie nun niederrei��t denn
I would take every single hungry person and feed him;
'Cause I'm mad, I'm bad, like Jesse James
You're furious, I never taught you to sing
Mit deinem Mundgeruch kannst du am Bahnhof sogar die Penner schocken
You can't stop what has begun
The creation of world war
Do what you want and you're never gonna take me down
I cannot sit back, shed my broken skin
The great spring of life runs dry
I will fight it off
So call the police
Now is the time, now is the time for your friendship to end 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ain't no comin' back
This is fight music
If you wade around forever you will surely drown
No sense in wishing no transmissions ever come this way
So call me a bitch in heat and
You are my blood
If at the age of  you fall in line too soon
I'll kill all you
From fly over country, back through Mississippi
Rising above all
Peace  They fought and fell and died and never came home
Hit my niggas LA Re to Cali
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Every single second I'm alive
Thank the blood red skies
Will you chew until it bleeds
'Cause everyone has said the same damn thing to me
Taste the venom of the wicked
My niggaz Berkowitz and that other motherfucker Fizzy Wo'
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude
Whoever said to get down on your knees
And I'm gonna push back
They got everybody singin' my "Fuck Tha Police" song
That you can't hide the fake smile
And I know just what to do
Take a shot for nothing rather than not
But I can't erase this pain
Another bloody election
A straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'
Lost, ran at my own cost, fearing laughter, scoffed
Y'all motherfuckers attack
My soul is the grounds
Jogging over skulls and leg bones
Someone say sequester so I sink
To move on with me or step aside
We don't need your war
What if the critics hate you
Over bodies and cases
You'd be a fool to leave
Melting ice and rising waters
But the being you should most fear when you turn out the lights,
The sum of all your fears
Right to smoke in it's place
And I'm prepared now
Bastard magic should make you cry
Sometimes I wanna fly far away from here
From your smoke attack
Same old thing, same old game
All for the loot nigga
Better indict me now
When I flow niggas know I'm like malcolm on dope
You cowards can't, you never will, don't even try to pursue it
You got no business playing this
It'll be a drive by homicide
Take your time please remember
When my mother died, she laid in bed and cried
Even though you're the one that's bringin' in the money
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind
By the bleeding stone I am enraptured by ophidian eyes
Bitter resentment that rocks you to sleep
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom come
Never give a fuck about niggas y'all not Nutso
Wake to the sound of a dumptruck backing up
Don't lose your faith
Payin' off a loan, mass eviction
A loaded fist, a rusty blade
Money outweighin', problems on the triple beam
Better start runnin' 'cause you're gonna die
But people make me angry
Fuck this lets just kill them
Yeah it's the sex, the Gods, the fakes, the frauds
Manic thoughts
I thought I saw what Malcolm Little saw
I just want to tell you you're a lousy Dad to hell with you
I don't know what I get but I'm willing to bet
But for now, here's what I'm gonna say to you
Lady it's your turn now
Hey, ladies, yeah, yeah
But when you see us motherfuckers, better know who we are
There's no slacking off with an unprotected stroke
Another bloody election 
So for now pack the gun and
Also, entschuldige bitte, das was du hier ablieferst, das soll tanzbar sein
Oh, there ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
You can wiggle you can jiggle your tongue on my clit
Don't give a damn what you 're worth
Get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
And you can hear her pain
Not saying you deserve to die
I feel sick
No one's gonna save my life when I'm drowning
Anything can happen now
That's why drugs seem so lovely like a way to escape
You Liberace's, Versace's, and you Nazis
Watch your watch your watch your back
All alone, I fade to nothing
But you know that I would rather take you home
That summoned all my scars and the ghost of serendipity
I wish that we could just get back in line
Of market hungry military profiteers
Day the Earth caught fire
loihdin hatakeinon hammastyttavan
Lost my faith, forgiveness too
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothin' bout her
Buddy Dann war' der Track doch zuende, war' doch schade drum
Every cry a wasted moment
You keep dressing ways you shouldn't be dressing
You need not say a word
Oh Tonight I Don't want to sleep alone
Tente guardar um instante pra nao se sentir tao malamada
Now clever feet that flicker like fire
I know you
Je ne fais pas que passer
Three boys dead, non that I knew from
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
He's not your friend
I know you ain't bringin' that lame crew
Wanna feel the sun of the new day
Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers
Ora che sono
Who wants to get stomped on
Steady when you're treading, careful not to fall in love
Without the mind to congregate
And nobody knows what to do, what's your point of view
Identify the enemy, remove the source of fear Start to change my life
Into little cubes that chill my drink
Dumb cocksucker
But they don't understand the things you do
Temper temper, now, now, temper temper, now, now
Your telephone's the one that helped
The wyrmhorn sounds cross Dagon's mere,
After the sunshine we duckin' for war time
Have you running out this fucking club in your drawers
And when you're runnin' your mouth, our razorblades come out
So listen to what I'm spittin' at y'all
Okay, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
Sick of this shit sick of this shit
Hey my friend I thought you knew it's all an illusion
I blackout in extreme pleasure from watching you writhe in pain
Get the tools niggaz, let's show the world how we abuse niggaz
Sie ist ubergossen mit leicht entflammbaren Mitteln und warten auf den Todessto��
Metaphors started menopause in your moms before you were born
Sometimes I hate myself for thinking twice
Hello darkness
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway
Now they all know
And you have no fucking purpose
How dark it could be
You're going to burn you'll learn you'll learn
When I told you not to bother to holler
When it's over then you die
Tell me where you want
And while you niggas that's been to jail before know it's about to get thick
HCP Hypnotize Minds introducin
One stroke of the brush paints my macabre delight
Come il cielo impassibile
Yo His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
Ma che discesa gloriosa
And nothing could tear you apart
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter, fire, fire, fire
I hate my generation now
The Time Lords returning
Oh, baby, baby, ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
People if you hear me now I wantcha to say
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this
AI don't know if I'm happy
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
This all would work out right
A Philistine is what she is, She'll do wondrous works with your fate
Nam je dost tele butaste norije
Ignore disasters and say that life is great,
City to city and then we knock it down
You're crossing the line
I don't know what to do
Don't be embarrassed
I know this
Nothing's working
Ich werde singen und tanzen und es mir
And there's nothing you can do
Each new, hot generation has a statement they wanna call their own Tattoos Piercings That's for Moms and Dads What you wanna do is spend your allowance on devil horn implant, Elephant Man head, designer tails, third leg, fourth leg  everyone a hermaphradite
And left a sting
Why do you make me feel like this 
You'd come running right back to me
Out to nourish a salty dream
Not just a drug abusing lonely alcoholic
Now he knows the truth
You just tore all our kisses right in half
Dark laughter echoes through the vaults,
In een kano, op het strand, in de lift, op de tram, op de vloer
Oh get down, getting down, so much money in the ground
I'm getting sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit
It's a frame of mind
Be ashamed of this fact
Venom
Immortality, a fallacy
Are we out of love now, is this just a bad patch
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
Your smoke alarms and barred windows
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died
Rippers that'll rip your ass
God I know we don't belong here,
The monorail
You think I don't know what war means
Sometimes I feel like a sociogenetic experiment
Without a single fear, say they has no fear
You can't just come in here like that no more
I'm on top of the game
Full of broken dreams  always on the run
Nothing left to say, soon I'll fade away 
I paint a picture that's perfect so you can see what I'm saying
There's not much hope that I can see
Is your lack of selfrestraint
We're watching the world pass us by
Enough, I call the bluff for manifest destiny
You can't overstand the mathematics
Go fuck the world because I can
Oh, no, comin' back when your foot of pride come down
I hate my generation yeah
Death comes knocking again
I don't give a fuck, keep giving 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up You get no love
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck
Why do veterans get no respect
Optimism wretched in my throat, no working parts,
Think I give a fuck
She lacerated me, and now I have nowhere to go
These feelings are gone, they've been buried along
Rich bitch, sugar daddy, whizz kids, city boy
Who's black  don't wanna role  sells his soul
And talkin' all the while
It is returning through the dark
She shook here head and gave me a blow for breakfast
When a nigga stretched out, with his chest out
To ever come back, to get back in my arms
My real niggaz, hard hitters they ride with me
The NME meant nothing to you
You gotta follow all the rest
For you a charade, for me a disease
The tears that she cries 
Just enough to want him
I'll topple the noisy creatures
Or you'll get the straightedge in your face
I'm so mad, I'm so mad
But I don't care, you know why
He told me "Son, I've really got you now, boy"
But he ain't gonna attack
What's been said has spread like fire to all
And they're not even in season
I can't believe that I ever thought
You're helpless and hopeless
No love, no love, no love, no love
Who was around when I was hungry
And I just don't know
My inner vision, dulled and darkened
And I don't want to be anywhere not near you
A flick of the wrist, you'll be gone
Covered faces,
I can almost touch their hands through the ground
Yes all your lies
Is this love or is this hate
Can't find hope to believe
Swallows up that city light
Where were you when in the darkest night
But I break, know what I am saying, this is how it goes y'all, damn
Now the tables have turned all I gave you return
We will fight it off
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh
Scourge of the earth, verses are merged into dirt
Your vicious infestation of the weaker mind
I want to know therefore I go
That if you want to get down now
It's all the same, we're out in the cold
Do or die, it's do or die
And there I stand in the middle, and I was
The cops won't arrest me, and the hookers won't undress me and my manager is tired of my voice
Are you crazy
A fading hope now lost in time
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
It's a revolution you know we can't be denied
I know it was a setup
I slip away, genocide
Few get what they want, and fewer get more
And if there's nothing
No one can listen to anyone's answers
And drain the consciousness from my mind
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our Tshirts
But later on she made you feel like what you do is wrong
Awaiting your call but I hear nothing at all
I got reason to believe, some of you niggaz feel
Give me something good, now 
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds
I love reading the psalms to bitch actors
Girls and boys hear the bass and treble
You know you're beautiful,
All that I touch is tragedy
No matter if you're rich
As the Master of your fate
You see me burning like the sun in your eyes
I mean I'd smack the shit out you twice dog and that's before I start cursin'
Sometimes I hate myself for hating me
Try to deny what you don't want to hear
Let me know, let me know baby, baby
People wander aimlessly
The girls won't ride me, and the boys won't fight me, so my self esteem has hit an all time low
And my friends all tell me but my friends all lie
I followed you to the deep end
Now drugs and booze keep my alive
The redeemer said he bought us with our blood
As tears fall like the summer rain
They kept me in the deep end
And what the fuck you know about being in danger
Working after dark
Die Frage hallt im trockenen Mund
Enemy, and you are so damn dirty
A dystopic creation dividing a nation
Even if it means we have to die this way
Can't find hope to believe in
Iiii, I know the meaning of life
You say that the business is a whack
Break down that wall
And it feels like I must be blind
I know you were not lonely
To stab you in the back
'Cause it sure as hell does
You know why Because the customers always right, right The customer is always right
You want to help out the homeless
Been dragging your cross all over this town
You talk rich, and that's your cover
On that hydro so high so I don't know where the time goes
Yet Cube, they can't fuck with the darkside
I bow down to no one, you like the faith
It's cold when birds fall from the sky
And I'm caught in between your lies
Rumble in the speakers and it make you wanna rebel
Oh, don't mind any pain  it gives me wisdom
Forget the lies, the money
See I work so hard just to get ahead
A pretend life in a make believe world
Something I never wanted
But when Brits get caught they're left to rot
"Into this news Four fugitives are on the run"
Con le tue mani da violino, perche lo fai
I can tell by the weight in your face that you can't be trusted
Paranoid, star lover
To get up off the ground
You stink like shit and smile through it
Never comin' back
My mind was slick  my temper was too quick
ich sanier' deine Fassade mit 'nem Blatt Papier und meiner Fullerspur
I don't need no fortune
Will fade like the hopes and the tears you denied
I'm running hot
I mix up that vodka with the chronic and I feel that love
Retrace the mockers of intemperance
The war has just begun
Them four hard hitters nigga and we back
And she said, "Mama, I got a note here, from the Harper Valley PTA"
I'm gonna be drunk, and slight broke
I can't be your friend
Don't let those other people make your life a mess
With all these conflicting thoughts in my head
Turn it, burn it, cure it, endure it
And I'll be singing it out
With no cause, we don't discriminate
Keep your chin up, I know it's tough
Your blue lips are so cold
Even our masters don't know the webs we weave
It's a circus we're the clowns as the giant ones disown
I'm already gone when you turn your head
And now you know how roles can change
Every now and then I dream about you
We are the answer to
The land will be covered in darkness
The snakes in the grass get caught by the rattles
DJ ZamZoe turn it on
We tried, we cried, we fell, we lied
A princess' work is never done
It's inside me I feel it growing nowhere to hide my anger's showing
'Cause I've been eyeing you ever since
Lets ride everybody gonna die
Your pale skin in the light
I'm dying to know what doesn't happen next
I'm going down with up interest
I hate big brother uh do you think it's too late
Spreading your venom polluting the will
Me if you feel it
Moses to Moses, watching the flock
And a voice in distant thunder
Till a bullet pierced our leader and we gave up the fight
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
I don't know where I belong
You get to feel how this runs so deep
So come let's drown ourself and end this nightmare
I don't need no razors
Fuck your enemies
'k Heb gezongen in Aalst, Peutie, Zwevezele en Genoelselderen
I know, baby I know
Is in no way human at all
Get the bird, catch her, shoot her, I don't care
There's not a net and there's no one there
Moved on to the next trend
Keep pushing me and I'll stand my ground
What do you want them all to see
And with hate in your mind convict me
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
Well now, represent the ashes
The game don't stop, I'm still gettin' down for whatever
I don't care what nobody say
You need another try
Empty prayers fly through the air like burning papers
Pain causing fear
The world around me falls apart
I don't know if I'm happy
When passion drives then hold the reins
Rather stand alone than divided
Paid assassin
With the rest of the mess that you made 
And those motherfuckers are wack, I travelled a rocky road
Brag on my face
Now wearin' my dyes, 'cause I'm not stupid, mutherfuckers
So what if she's handicapped, the bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap
They don't care, no no no
These eyes have seen no conviction
London town is traffic hell, it's freezeframed in D
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
Force his face down 
Just a little and nothing now it's done 
But you're afraid to get your teeth caught in my pubic hair
I want you to know me
But I am not solely race, nor environment, nor destiny
To watch you point and whisper like a child
polkimeni painamalla 
Teachers are my friends so why do they make me stand
And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment
Yeah, back to Compton again
I've got a need to kick them down
If I did it wouldn't matter
For the storm that tries to shake my roots
I was a child, and now it seems so long ago
They said that nothing's forever
Open for business like a cheap bordello
Over your skin
Seems to go nowhere
McDonalds goes ecofriendly 
Every time I see your dick I see her cunt in my bed
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed
I know you're really proud 'cause you think you're well hung
The shotgun kicked  and it murdered motherfuckers
Lets ride yeah everybody gonna die
Dices que asi no estas bien pero no cambias nada
Du spielst dein Spiel doch drei war einer zu viel
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow
She will fight it when you steal her love for your lust
You just weren't interested, I guess, I guess
Requires some compassion
I've got no ambition to show
You turn it around and make us out like david and goliath
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
And squeeze a little harder with your arms
Don't want to see you No more
I hate the world, the birds, the flowers and the squirrels
Come face to face with a world of darkness
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
But I'm backed by the Dungeon Family
I call you a liar
Well I've nothing left to say
Raising havoc in my peaceful society
I don't know the face
They've locked us out, they've banned our unions, they even treat their animals better than us
I just want to tell you that I'm really feeling bad
It would not undo what I have done
Now your turn is coming around
This time I refuse to die
I got HU tatted on the front of my arms
Hello memories return
Verse  Eminem
If you want to get down now
Down on bloody knees
Hand out some beatdowns
Stubborn ignorance
The devil walks in the sand
Tthree months from now, you won't stay
But y'all wasting your time I got you haters figured out
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
Turn on the lights, paint me a tapestry
Want, touch, feel so much
More cars and endless car parks 
Don't cross me no more or you're dead
Lets ride motherfucker we all gonna die
Ladies and gentlement
There's a monster in the garden you call him god
But who's left to stop the bleeding
Hast du's kapiert, dass du das Battle verlierst
Just how deep do you believe
"We are now approaching lunar sunrise, and, uh, for all the people back on Earth, the crew of Apollo  has a message that we would like to send to you
Fire All our guns
Got a knack for knockin' all my loved ones down
But your motor skills still speak in slurs
The room feels so cold
God I wish that I could feel sorry for you
Strange  On no man's land for no man's land
I'm gonna be tired old and bitter, and really messed up
Meine Methoden kommen krasser als Chirurgen mit Kaffeetatter
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon
If you have a racist friend 
Face down in the dirt
Voices from the grave
Fuck freedom if I'm not alive to live it
Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying
A mountain of fulsome, son of god
It's not fair to deny me
Now we're spilling blood for oil
We should have known better than to trust
I hate my
Don't you feel a little bit humble
Someone find me, please, losing all reserve
I guess it's not that easy now
And it's good that I'm not angry
Impassibile
Please hand another rum and coke
They can be a terror to your mind
It is so sweet I lose everything I'm lost in my mind
Once, once is real early but twice came back
Can't the girl just shut her mouth
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying
Lost all my fear so I hold on
All that was given me I choked it all away
Spells scrawled in blood and frosty rime,
You call me crazy
It's the darkest place like beneath the stairs
Got an overload of hate
I've lost the feeling, it's dead skin
Do you really believe in the stories you tell
No need for talking, have my dough
Listen, young man, listen to my plan
E non sei qui con me
As we move toward a new world order
You gon think it's a joke until they no longer remember your name
Or the pain that I'd inflict
Ci sono istanti che vivere e una merda
And helpin' with my blues
Who's Who, The Orphange, The Minor League, Greenhouse
God doesn't keep the failures from me
Ni ar den stora graa massan
It gets inside and it tears you up
Here is a strange and bitter crop
To watch me fall apart at the knees,
No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Over and over it breaks my heart 
All my friends try to tell me I'm the greatest
Envy and hate feed the demons within
Back home they'll remember you in papers, on TV
And I suffer from this deadly disease
And here comes another
Tossed from fist to fist 
But under oath you cut my throat with sickle blade laughter
The emptier, the easier to break
Piece of garbage with wings and she has the guts to sing
Y'all just hate, I can't take no more
I'm with my friends
Two tarnished golden hearts
Tombigbee, Tombigbee, help me hang these bones
The street brawler stomp your face into the back of yo' head
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
And Bobby Boochet yo' ass, G, yeah, yeah
Because when you're caught you're left to rot
Now It's calm down around the place nothing recalls
Sleep with my enemy
And fill my heart with disgust
Of their final breaths and their blood
And it's just another bombtrack
And you've been smoking up the ends 'til you explode
But that's so hard to believe
You can't just empty your sins into a pit of salvation
We go to dinner at the Governor's mansion
I will never understand
Will you stay down on your knees
I cannot sleep in this downfilled world
Be it your cousin or your uncle or your brother 
I can still hear the screaming in front of the
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
The tears that we cry 
I want to live a life that you
This must be a dream now, till I feel
Don't tell me how to sing my song
Embraced by delirium, witches' balms anoint me
Why'd ya do it, she said, when you know it makes me sore
Drop dead, a bullet to my head
All I think is about yesterday, I could die
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
It's just spend a buck to make a buck
And we need it now
Suck my dick
'Cause revenge is better than money, you see
Intolerance and faith confides that death is product of peace in time
To show you who the boss nigga
I fear
He wants me right down on my knees
I hear the High Ones whispering ancient spells in the longdead tongues,
That I can take another day
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused
I thought the fight
'Cause if we die we still gon' be some dead niggas
I want to tell you all a story about a Harper Valley widowed wife
To grow to praise me I'm making them go crazy
When a life breaks it is silent
New day new way all my friends can say
Of a subtle disease 
And I must gofor youto comeand I will praise you into heaveni will raise you to the sun all risefor here comes the sonall risethe fatherhe is my kingand I am just a throne awayi am the heirone breath awayi will rise as your sonand I will be the one and to the warmth of the sunyou willcomei will love and guideyouas you were my own to the sons of the suni will praythat no harm on them will comeit won't ever get in their wayyou will rise as my sonyou will be the oneall rise
So what comes now
Straight at yo ass
Malte Der Lied ist sowieso zuende
I watch him struggle with the fact that he relies on people that don't really care,
Activate  burn it up
Serpenttongued priestess bares her pale flesh,
I don't want to go Regenerate
I know you feel me nigga, you feel me nigga
Sometimes I feel like I haven't learned anything
No more deaths
You will never know me
Tulvassa kelluen, latomerta tuijotan x
And as the silence breaks
Only you know, only you know different person
And I can feel you under my skin
Sono le volte che proprio
Blow his head back right in front of the precinct YOU HEAR THAT
The bells and bombs, we'll fight them off
Like throwing up, nausea restricting loving host,
I want us
And I know  I know a lot of people, and I 
Go fuck the world because you can
One day you're going to rise from your habitual feast
Sometimes I feel like I can't lead my team well enough
Hello, hello
Stop messing with the people's head
One crown, two kings, three wars, four more
Then if I were to speak my mind about this house"
Sending our successors to the battleground
Like an angel lost in hell
She can hear the birds living in the leaves with their fucked up, fucked up language
The bird, the melodies she play
Miracle drugs, discount bulk purchase
Your dick it would be shrinking 
To distract from the mess I'm in
You're getting used to the sickly, thick fog of indifference and you think that's all right
But now I'm gonna pack my things and go
Poisoned blood, your mothers worthless breed
There's no restraining order to keep me from you
I always knew you were pretty with all those scratches on your face, look
Lost in limbo like pink shit camouflaged in a pig farm
I'm running in circles to get where I started from
No, they only want your money
Where my niggaz ready for war we right here
God knows, God knows, God knows it's been fun
He's burgundy for breakfast tight
Hey chump You're better off, don't fuck with me
We raw nigga
And I'm a fuck you up, and I'm a fuck you up
It's the rage, I know that you are hunting
Don't ever come back to me again
I thought you knew
And evil is the absence of good
MTV moves too fast, I refuse to understand
Ich flie��e wie ein Wasserfall, da hilft kein Rettungsring
And grin with foul teeth and skin, when you go to bury daisies
No I'm not dying
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
What you know bitch, you got a lot to learn
Now there's no providence
Cops chase me when I'm standing still
A venom on my lips, a poison
But I think it's time you learn how to use your tongue yeah
I can see all the veins in my lids when I close my eyes
Your lies still smell the same
I wish I could drive all night
And I'm not alone
And they last too fucking long
Put your claws around me baby
You just know  that's the new shit
If you wanna loaf of bread
Eyes plugged in to my veins
The Eternal Fiends exult in rapture
I feel this darkness coming over me
To keep their guns from firing rage restrained
You don't really give a flying fuck
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Oh lie on me, that's all I want is you to lie on me,
I just feel better when they're not around
'Cause police and little black niggers don't mix so
Ein Seitensprung, das kann passieren
They stick their tongue out when they bow they head Cause We Da Best
That'll voluntarily blast the last, Tom and Jerry ass nigga
Preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed
'Til they bring back Gallifrey
per te, per me, per noi
I'm almost home so I better haul ass
Du denkst, du bist der krasse Held, wenn dann nur bei der Mullabfuhr,
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
lei non e una via d'uscita e forse non ce n'e
No one's gonna give a fuck when I die
How do you think I feel when I gag on your erection ugh
And now you'll never know
International loan sharks backed by the guns
Oops, there goes the house we made a home
The suckers the girls roll
I thought I saw you touching my guy
Ve se entende agora
Boulevard brass knuckles in the back of the car
The travesty of science waking up, I've had enough,
Drama brings you to your knees
It takes no strength to pass blame
Drink to much, passing out
All you people that I know will have died long ago and your children will have died  years before
I'm tired of this fight
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Let you back in my life
Y'all motherfuckers don't know how to act
She took my hand and started running all the way
Undead, why won't you punks just die, die, die
And we both know, like everything, that's one big fucking lie
Are these not words of heresy,
At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls
Wake up, wake up, wake up right now
Watch your back watch your back
But wherever you go, you know they've been there before
Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a coma
Our golden sun will rise
I'm a cruddy nigga leave you all bloody nigga service with a smile
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
Enough
You can play the game your own way
He's looming like, like the god of blunder
What'cha niggas want
How Christ turned his cheek or came down from the hill
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
Now all I have are these three fucking assholes
But you don't know shit till you been in my shoes
Put to work to destroy
Those lies came straight from your mouth
You're a hopeless liar and a hypocrite
You said you wanted to be loved
Taught to believe that ignorance is strength
Persevere until I spill blood
They don't believe in mercy, ah, judgment on them
Have left me silent,
La que no duela la que no duela
Now is the time now is the time 
I was isolated by the way I thought and felt; they saw my mood swings
When all I can do is just to break you down
Another dope track, know what I'm sayin' what yo
I suffocated my shrink just for talking
Oh, baby, ain't no comin' back when your foot of pride come down
Du spielst dein Spiel, doch dreimal war einmal zu viel
Losing time and not changing anything
It's coming down all over me can't feel no love tonight
My love, you make me sick
That leave you in the dark nigga
You got to go back to Mother Earth
Will you profiteer or ransack with the soldiers you kill,
It's like a fight every single day 
My knees are weak
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks
This coup was made of incognito x
Cyberhead punch in your code then you can go
I'm afraid to lose total control
Something you call love but I call sex
Undead, motherfucker, time to ride, ride
But to fight for the rights of the working man
Your parents' parents made this happen, yeah eat your words and fold your napkins
ja mersujen nokasta merkit varastaa
Sacred in the forest, fast food in the kiosk
This is for you who made me what I am
And everything you are is on the ground
Only Heaven's silence for an answer
Who was around when the world was falling down
Drink and smoke upon his breath
Be it your best friend or your uncle or your lover 
Ah, ain't nothin' left here partner
Warm in the comfort that darkness will bring
I am not your pretty thing
Anything we had So now you're on your own
Now the rain is coming and I'm running from myself again
I'm a renegade who wants to get stomped
To take away the pain
Motherfuckers don't know but you better watch what you say
Assassinate your best friend now I hurt you par
Runnin' around here like some brand new pussy that's about to get fucked
Nobody knows where Osama been hidin
I know the meaning of life
Watch them take the poison that drives them all insane
Squamous orbs, black sword, drink deep, blood oath
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
'Cause I'm a real mutherfucker from
It's burning it's burning it's burning tears right through
How many times do I have to tell you rap niggas
Como se um copo tivesse arrastando um corpo
So I can feel alive
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
Don't you run
You cry alone and then he swears he loves you
Theocratic agendas breeding fear from hate
Will the decibels work as bifocals
con questo ago disperato in me      senza te
'Cause I'm not dying
I hate you so much right now
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
Wanneer het minder goed gaat, wat heeft ie dan nog
You know why my hands are so numb No
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean streetbrothers
A shoulder to cry on a friend to depend on 
So hungry for what I seek
Step the fuck back
You don't know what that shit does to you
Which classify order species, subspecies
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum
And you can fake what you can't achieve
Another funky radical bombtrack
Out of me and into you, I feel sick
No one 'til somebody hates you
Follow me again and sing an hour with the wind
Hast du je gefragt wie schwer es war
Celebrated when I made mistakes,
I spit on your thoughts of hallowed ground
Surprise, niggas
And nothing's right
You doing so much travellin', never know when you'll be round
'Cause the joke ain't funny
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
I've got breakneck delivery
Buddy Ach, hor doch auf mit dem Schei��, wir vertragen uns
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope
Tell me what's the problem, is there something I can do
Nauseous, raising the stakes
Auf meiner Reise endest du hochstens als gro��er Tourscherz
A procession of smoke and mirrors
Them anytime goin' right ain't no bar nigga
Got an army on the battlefield
Another night, another life
It's the way that I work, it's the way that I am,
Lord of the bitch
I refuse to wake up one more time bleeding on the floor
They didn't have to earn respect in the same scene as you
You are the doubt
When Sport Utility Vehicles are no longer enough you need The Terminator Stuck in traffic in Lost Angeles Drive over the tops of everybody else You'll crush 'em before the cops can catch up with you Your precious artefact child needs to be safe They're talking to a kid whose skin is a different colour Grab the kid and mow 'em down
Undead, motherfucking, time to ride, ride
Give your ground, or try your best to please
She said I've finally had enough
I won't say a word  except right now
Blackwinged, cruel as envenomed steel
Nothing's working x
Hide myself inside my mind
It's these voices inside it's that darkness above me
Beyond the witchsong, darkly sweet,
Diplomat on the fender of the phantom I'm the winner
Everybody's beaten, everybody's down, oh everybody's down
Sie hat nur noch wenige Tage und wei�� es genau 
Good so I buck fo' shots from the roof
This unhallowed ground
From the guys that's running the show
Cure me and my producer calls my music a bunch of noise
To lost limbs, backstabbed twofaced turncoats
And people on the trains play little games
I hate everything, fuck you
Nigga you know the protocol
I've had enough, my thinning blood, concentrated therapy,
Don't want to hide
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male
Here come the black skies;
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
Sometimes I feel I've got to 
So fuck the POLICE
Heart full of hate
'Cause there's no hidden agends when they speak to you
unfassbar, ihr seid lastig wie Krumel im Barthaar
Lips likened to poison in a rat trap
There's a retired businessman named Red
Maybe I'm just crazy enough
Do what you want and you're never gonna kick me round
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' sucotash
Quicker than email to your ass sayin', "Kill kill kill"
These are tales from the darkside
No rage or battlefields
Plastic and translucent like the lies that I tell
Death is the sickest way for attention
You coulda saved me from a disaster
I used to have friends
I'm going out to get a heart attack
And I'm not kidding 
But I think that I am just a little pissed off now
So step right up and pull your fucking reign again
It's not that I hate people
I still lead the league in assist
dentro di te non basta mai
That you fucked up
Well you got some devotional for pain
Empty words lies from the start we stood strong never apart
Kiss the ladies shake hands with the fellows
I'm drinking while I'm taking a piss
The time is now, the time of do or die
Shut the fuck ah
The only religion I know is the heat of her body next to me
But use your brains, we know who's to blame
Straight to hell
Maybe in time these indelible lines who was around when you were hungry
One more mile to go through the dark streets
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
You know what they say about bein' nice to the right people on the way up
'Cause no one cares if you're a man
I can't find my piece of mind I feel like I'm losing touch
The futures stopped, do you like the view
Me and Missy, we get it straight pissin'
God told Moses pull off your shoes
Put down the kid and run
Knock you faggots unconscience
Waiting for the end
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
I don't want your war
You love me like an angel, but you treat me like a fool
Got contracts to get 'em, lyrical spitter
Fuck, I hate it all
When you hear 'safe sex' you snicker under your breath
Even as we fight, it doesn't matter to me
I see you duck, you little punk, you little fuckin' disease
Ich trag' so dick auf wie Kleister auf 'm Tapeziertisch
I took a green and yellow pill, washed down with filter coffee 'til it kicked in 
Feels so good I am compelled to sing this song
TIP on top now
Then I gets mad
We the Best Season has returned Akon 'Cause I'm out here grindin'
Loving couples, smiling children anger me
I serial kill shit
What's with you what's the problem
Butterflies of love rain on me
Destruye a aquel con tu instinto de asesino
But I can not stand it anymore
Poison coffee, diamond blood,
Step back, heard your point of view
What a fucking scam
If you worked hard enough
I think it's your turn to go down on me
My eyes are filled with pride
Don't mind me
Got green lights standing in my way
The ghostly first wife glides up stage whispering to raucous talkers
Never mind the mess, we're going to mars next
I will continue to pray for us and try to remember only the good things
Until you stand before death so now you can create
I didn't know life was this hard
Let me know if you will
And I know you
I know that you've been calling my guy
You been lying and there ain't no believing
AIDS is our problem, we've gotta talk
Step back, now that I know you
Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose
I can't remember what I'm missing
You just got to stand in line
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace
I know, you're down for no one
I've had enough, my thinning blood, concentrated therapy
I've been pumpin' stomachs since the age of 
You'd fuck any guy in town
For hard cash, we will lie and deceive
A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch
Your young apprentice has worn through your shoes
The only religion I know is my lips kissing her skin
Undiscovered and unknown
Your mind has decided
Go with the flow into the shitter they are sucked
But as hard as we may buck, the king of fools is still in place and fit to rule
Will blacken everything, but don't you worry
I bleed, I burn
Smiling eyes disguise their lies
Profit is the goal, the revolution's comin' round
We don't need to talk
Ash to ash, back to back, and dusk to dusk
O veseeno malo nase bom gledal
You bring a knife to a gunfight
komm' deine Raps peinlich wie 'n Typ mit Pferdeschwanz
Sorrow and sickness, you reap what you sow
Rotten core to the bone wit no way home 'n' destination bitch I see you flyin by n u implyin that I've been tradin bitch n I helped ya out I put yo name across the nation bitch n I got the chance it's all the jealousy up in ya bitch now how do ya think ya gonna get a piece of my wealth I created scopin 'n' made myself I'm froucisiouley gifted lyricly raised in hell if you want it come get it you beter brace urself my purogitive locked and I'm weddin hoes on sight it's a ractive disaster curutal upon your flight better watch out we're riding especially at night got a bullet and chamber commin after that reise white so befor you come trippin' you better think about life you only got one to see and you better live it right ride or die is my terms and I ain't gettin' fucked twice think your gonna come out ahead come on bitch role your dice
Do more to turn my joy to sadness than
��Que dia no salio el sol que dia no despertaste
I'm not your prey, I'll make you die
You bit my lip
Now my money right
Lookin' like the jack is back
Like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
Expose the nature of this crime
To a hollow kind, don't mind
What is this I see I don't believe this
I see the one that you made cry
Degenen die, zoals ik, werken op 't sentiment
If there ain't a fight then it doesn't mean a goddamn thing
And gotta rest my case
I made a promise but I broke it every day
Hey knock knock
Innocence can't be bought with a confession
My real niggaz, hard hitters they die with me
I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fi'in to get thick again
Maybe I'm to blame, maybe I'm a liar 
And twisted around for a whole fucking week
Baby, hey, hey, hey, hey, ain't no comin' back, oh, oh
Or I'll have no choice but to kill
No love lost, no love found
Another face in the crowd
Do what you want and you're never gonna bring me down
Oh, heh, how considerate of you to come in and order five minutes before we close We already shut everything down, and cleaned it all up But we'll go right ahead and fire those grills back up, just for you, champ
Why don't you set it aside 'cause he's got nothing to hide you just put him down
You're all liars, inside you are dead
You, you, you oughta know
"My name is James Connolly  I didn't come here to die
But not blameless
Leave the dregs to their fate
Get your face between my thighs
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
I feel lost in a familiar way, another memory I can't explain
In the vaults of the dreaming gods,
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
My feathered friends' end will justify the means
My thinning blood, reactionbased anxiety, I've had enough,
Like the pain inside
Don't back down
I don't want you to hate me
