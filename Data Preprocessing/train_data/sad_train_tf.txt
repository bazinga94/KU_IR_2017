I just want to love you when you're not enough
"Maybe you didn't know him at all"
She says
But baby i
She loves me and she knows I won't forget
Come come to me
Depression seeps in on a lonely messiah 
I'm never alone; I'm alone all the time
Keep your head on high, keep your head on high
Her father doesn't know what to say
A million miles ago, you seem
But years take their toll
For we are in love
The minutes drag, then there's a world between us,
Now it's over and I'm feeling like
This wave always breaks,' I said
Breathe truthfully at the garden glen, that grew masterfully over your
Stolen from our very eyes
Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah
Don't you think it's quiet around here
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
You'll see that you can breath without no back up
And a blow to his own head
Will you say to me when I'm gone
But baby wait, "It's too late dad, you made the choice
You said that you would die for me oh oh
If you're looking for it
Still they leave blind the will to begin
There are twenty years to go
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Her diamond curse, it comes with mine
So I thought hell if it's over
I saw tears were in his eyes
They talk though what you show
And the world so far below me
For my heart lies
Rings of flowers 'round your eyes and I'll love you
Please let me show you where we could only just be for us
Another day for all the suits and ties
And what I wanted to say
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Taking all light from my view
I'm half the man I thought I would be
Oh yeah yeah oh oh
And still you're in my heart
She walks alone from wall to wall
You turn in pain
Is there anything I can do for you, dear
Brother, won't you steal away
With all the things you took from us
She is your marrow and your ride home
One hit wouldn't hurt a bit  
She's got a baby
Life is a oneway street, ain't it
Can't get out of bed
The water will dream for them
On your face, on your face, on your face
Where is my love
It's never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
Then it's your fault
'Cause I know I'm good for something
The dream carries me on
I wish I had a river so long
That you've bound and gagged, you've shot and stabbed
But it's ok, she don't want the world
'Cause it's time that will tell if it's heaven if it's hell or if it's,
Drew a line between love and hate
The weight of the world
Except to those who hide their needs
Told through jealous eyes
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Then you'll die, you'll die
I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
In the ashes and the dust
When they know they're your heart
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
And you treated my woman
Deserves a quiet night
I'm like a son that was raised without a father
Oh don't misunderstand
Brothers lie in shallow graves
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
Well, just look at me
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
We shared the years, we shared each day
And still you chose to do without
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
And I built a home
Whisper you mean it, say you'll stay
I'd die right next to you in the end
Is there only pain and hatred and misery
Hello, how are you
Is it time to set you free
Under the stars and stripes
It's not my time, to wonder why
Wakin' in the dawn of day
Try to hold back my tears
If he had've stayed you never would have taken my hand
Now this applies both equally to you and I 
I listen to you cry
If we only have one turn
Soul mate dry your eyes
I've got loads of pictures
Jetzt könnt ihr noch jemanden aufnehmen
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
And knock me back
Dancing, dancing girl
In rough blue waters in your eyes
I heard a little love is better than none
There's no need to argue anymore 
I guess that's how this one's gonna go I'll be the giver and you'll be the taker 
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
To spend my life in spitting distance of the love that I have known
And then they handed her a folded up flag
But I took the one thing that made me beautiful and I threw it away
Don't leave another piece that this puzzle needs
Throwing it all away
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
Out of mind
Shadows fading in the haze of what I couldn't say
And I'll throw you in the current that I stand upon so still
And their tongues are full of heartless tales that drain on you
You are, you are, you are my everything
That night he found the key
Oh Where Where has my heart gone
I'm writing a song all about you
Never had a voice to protest
Come on skinny love, just last the year
This is one for the good days
Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
To face what I've done and do my time
And it's cold in my apartment
I just wanna show you
You're connected to the heart
You were in all my dreams
That all of these clouds are
Now the baby's in the trash heep, ballin'
If you could die and come back to life
Go or go ahead and surprise me
Are you scared to death to live
Her ankles clasped, her arms so rudely pinioned
Said and done
Still love's all I see
There's no rhyme or reason
"You know, those red moments where it's thin, like, pretty, early on, and But then, simul I also, like, include the like the tinted blues"
Your life is not your own
You've always been there, you're alaways been
I met my wife at a party when I drank too much
The night we took that year
Deeper than the sea
I know I can't feel what you feel
Like the tears in your eyes
His picture worn and weathered
He's not a fool
You'd never change, but that's not true
Gonna shoot everything everyone
Some I remember, some I forget
Future's above, but in the past, he's slow and sinking
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
For some answers, to this fire
Pinch the head off
The best things in life are always free
And you are by my side
But a broken heart took her song away
Sometimes I think so hard I can't remember how your face looked,
Such awful thoughts
Give all my things to all my friends
The champ goes down like a clown in the second round
And I'm hearin' what you say but I just can't make a sound
Because nothing like this ever happened to them
Couldn't stay to watch me cry
You couldn't hate enough to love
She's all I'm always wanting you
You could say I knew it all along,
This is a modern fairytale
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
Oh, how do I show all the love
'Bout a home I'll never see
A silver rain will wash away
But I would never want to come between us two
One will love you so much
That once we said goodbye
All you wanted was to live for a while
She wore blue velvet
Suspended like spirits over speeding cars
Well I'll write you a letter
Get your picture all over the world
Let's take the country road
Will bring life into my deepest hopes, what's your fantasy
How does he kiss
Look at all of them beg to stay
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Afternoon, there's always something happening
We should all wear two lifesaving layers
'Cause I will be coming back
The recklessness in water
In the white sunshine
I was never more alive or
And turn it into nothing
One more time, let me kiss you
See I could have me a good girl
She broke your throne she cut your hair
No you will not be alone
For things to be quiet
Walks on his own with thoughts he can't help thinking
A daft life
Now that I have found someone
Like the sky on summer days
nothing bleeds like
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
Dreams of a place with a better selection
Promise you our love will carry on
I'll walk you till your fears are numb
How in the future it will affect me when you go
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
But chilly, Mr Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candyapple Caddy
Sometimes I remember all the pain
Who cry when they see you
And nothing's gonna make this right again Right again
Sings so soft as if she'll break, says
But your heartbeat in my head
One more night, that's all they can spend
You held your stopwatch in your left hand
Oohoohoohooh
Get rest while you can
I have choked my roots on the earth, as rich as roe
He's found the answer that was lost
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
Let them be calm so I finally can sleep
The telephone number I got from you says nobody's home 
When you walk by
That it just is, 'cause everybody dies
Yeah yeah they cheer  can they see my hand in the air
That I didn't break your heart
Fell to my knees and I wept for my life
For something real
I hope you're not waiting, waitin' 'round for me
You should've never gone to Hollywood
Underneath a winters' moon, The last we saw on, how we came too soon
Till I let my pride cost me one
I was dressed embarrassment
I'm finally happy now that you're gone
But I work in his factory
If you've still got some light in you then go before it's gone
Will no one lay the laurel wreath when silence drowns the screams
Is still without a rocker
And God's silence
Now help me to carry the fire
We waited and I guess we're getting older 
Desert wind and a perverse desire to win
'Cause both my shoulders are heavy from the weight of us both
I got her to come on and move in with me
She is the one that I adore
And she says it's high time she went away
Though she may seem an awful bother
Like it's always been
Daddy gave life to mama's dream
But I can't breathe
Don't know what you are
Who do you think that you are
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
What I am to you you do not need
Leave it all up in the air
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Or paint my shelves
Our blank stares and empty threats
I hear Kate Moss talk
You're not the only one
To make it through the day
And have a dream I'm falling down
Traveling endlessly
You'd kneel down to the dry land
She run, run, run, run
We'll live our lives I know we're gonna find our way
And the last thing she said was "I love you, mom"
So hard and It never was the time for us
Don't let the days go by
Before I open up my arms and fall
I'll be right there
I want a perfect body
I know how I feel when I'm around you
Did they follow you to town
On Saturday I was an angel shining fair
It never crossed my mind that there would be a time
The doctor said, she's in a better place
And even at the bottom of the sea
And all the way home held your camera like a Bible
He belonged to everyone 
She's laughing in her sleeve, boys
Like a mother's mourning dress
Wonderful people everywhere
She didn't say a word, just walked away
Borrow water off this man, here goes nothing OK
It's just after pm, I see kids leaving school
Some things are better left unsaid
Could we stop and sleep for a spell
She We gave her most of our lives
I knew you'd feel the same things
But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face
When it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it pass
New straw for the old broom
So let me know the truth
Watching us fading and watching it all fall apart
Four men in uniform
Many friends I hope
Feel, my skin is rough
Never going by your door
They said 'Stop'  but we went on wholehearted
To pick the shit up, leave it clean
But do you really feel alive without me
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
What a day I have had
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no
Walked away, heard them say
She's standing inside but you surely repeat
It was his devil twin
I was lost, I was lost
When I and my mother would disagree
You wait with me, because you know
Well, they're lining up to mad dog your tiltawhirl
Then up the stairs he would carry me
You gave me all your love
I wait for the good Lord to make me feel better
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
You've been the only thing that's right
This could be the last train
You'd better crawl on your knees
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to stay forever
Leave it open for someone else to
When I look right through
Am I ready to leap Is there peace beneath
But there's no easier way
Like a living Chinese finger trap
I love you the first time
So now it's your time, time to pay
Where a man with missing fingers plays a strange guitar
As we lay in this bed thinking out loud
The Litebrite's now blackandwhite
On the streets you were policin' that was you
Know there's a reason
Fistful of love, love
He was sleeping on the streets and homeless
I'll put his picture down
But I was gonna set things straight
'Cause I got three little words
Together you and me could be so special baby
She is wrapping him up in her bat arms
But they say it will work out fine 
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous
But I was just thinking and thinking, merely thinking
When he finally found her he said that it was different
As he goes left and you stay right
You're still the only one I've gotta love
Around your neck and tug you off your cloud
I'm keeping my promise to you I got ya back now
'Cause I was always late
So your heart is warm for ever more
I am trying
A million miles away
I'm sick and tired of the way that I feel
Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name
Walk away
These things are wrong
Take care
It's no wonder that you feel so strange
And run
Not for myself and not for you honey have no fear
And I was born to tell you I love you
Tell me baby, where did I go wrong
But if they just knew 
She no longer needs you
But tonight I just wanna stay in
All these words I just don't say
I was deceived by the wrapping
By their color or your fear
You haven't seen her for a while
We're so far away
My Cheshire cat doorstop with fear in your smile,
But I had to start with ya name
'Cause I don't feel so good
It's funny that way, you can get used
I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear
Here comes a regular
When you're gone
But it's missed when it's gone
He said, I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
Our feelings are positive, negative, positive, negative
My dear, my darling one
With the airlift or the rescue
Tell me you love me
Making out with people I hardly know or like
There will be times
As if they're someone else's days
Couldn't love you more; you've got a beautiful taste
And I did feel like coming, but I also felt like crying
Salt my wounds but I can't heal the way I feel about you
Stoppin' baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no
And the future hangs over our heads
Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do
If the ground is black and yellow
All hearts could be warmer
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
And that's ok, she don't want the world
So stay with me Evelyn
Oh, but wise men know when it's time to go
And all those oceanic vistas are so divine
I'm writing the folks back home to tell them
Bring me back to you
When they said they'd call you
That's the one thing that he could never do
Walk away again
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Always be mine
Send me away to san quentin
But I'm the one that's drowning now
I wear this crown of shit
It's all I do, babe
'Cause you're the best paint life ever made
I hopelessly,
if someone appears, 
I thought that I needed some space
That happens all the time, love, yeah
'Cause the gentlemen are calling
Can you listen I am on your side
I hope you're with someone
You're the shit and I'm kneedeep in it
My stray dog freedom
I'll be wallowing in sorrow
I can't take my eyes
His father was a very mean man
And when they asked us how we knew his name
I understand what I am still too proud to mention to you
Got a feeling my love
And then she prayed on her knees
And your day was rough
I'd rather die than be with you
"I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain", you said
There's so many times I've let you down
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, woah
Those angels can't ever take my place
And your son is smoking cannabis"
I thought that you'd be here by now
I can't escape the echoed words
Like a cat tied to a stick that's driven into frozen winter shit
Do I care anymore
There's only hate
A little girl came through the front gate, holdin' a fishin' pole
I thought I could live in your arms
These toilets are a piss take, queue's bigger than the door
To leave, believe it
The sound of lonliness turned up to ten;
Now you're in my arms;
You were far away
And the moment's magic swept us away
I'll be alone, but maybe more carefree,
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
I wanna hope to die
This town has dragged you down
Life is ours, we do it our way
To get out of our little heads
Wanting me to come over and keep you busy
Forcing everything metal to shine
Release my whole desire
And sometimes I have to say, yeah
Tonight, when I came home from work, hurt
I've got the feeling we're gonna die
What the hell am I doin' here
Served out his time, became a circus clown
Screw all my friends
That they both are satisfied
I hope that you're well
There're some things that I should never
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
Or just how wrong you are
For my love
I took the pictures in my head
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
Every time we do this
As he appeared, he spoke
A heart that's full up like a landfill
This lady of the flowers; her electronic haze
Sleep or die
What makes winters lonely 
Maybe, some part of you just hates me
We can't get back again
But as the scenery grows I see in different lights
I had the notion that you'd make me change my ways 
But honey I ain't goin' nowhere
You stared into the sky 
When you first said that anything goes
And they shall enter from the back
Well there's just an empty space
Why carry on without me 
Don't call me, don't write
And he loved me so naughty, made me weak in the knees
Sometimes I find myself alone 
When they say,
And you promise to keep it between you and me
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
The bartender's singing "Clementine"
I'm not half what I wish I was
You leave all that we were undone
There is a part of me that I try to hide
Hard to find the strength now but I try
Nothing much to speak of but a rough diamond
A star sign out of whack
But I've broken all my promises to you
She wraps her fingers 'round mine with the softness she's blessed with
Like dying in the sun
Honey, I'm a roller concrete clover
Your life's colors 
Tunnel vision lights my way
Just to prove that he was sorry
An angel kissing on a sinner
Oh and I don't have a show to say, yes, and I sin every single day
Seven loves you so much
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
Ain't gonna be alone
See the love the love the love the love
You'll be the pain
LA lights never shine quite as bright as in the movies
What can I possibly say
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me, here's the key to my car
Over canyons and waterfalls
I'm goin' to a place that has already been disgraced
I died a little bit inside
Oh we, we could hold each other tight
As if I could live off words and dreams and a million screams
I guess it makes sense
I could love, in this dying world
I felt so ugly before, I didn't know what to do
Even God himself and the faith I knew
So come back and we'll take them all on
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden
Sinking feeling
On such a breathless night as this
Remember the good times that we had
Will you still kiss me if you find out
It was a slippery slippery slippery slope
I believe in you
Lucky that you found someone to make you feel secure
Oh find me, find me, nothing more
The lights go out
Hey, open wide, here comes original sin
When you've fallen on the highway
I know it's hard to tell how mixed up you feel
When I'm still so close
And don't ever think of trouble
My head, oh
Or look so brown
Let's go down to the water's edge
I'll send you all this message in code,
Life and the soul
He looks at you
Like a swallow
Winds blowing lightly and I picture you
I left you in the cold until you shook
You were mother nature's son
I didn't get around to kiss you
Keeping ahold of what you just let go
You make this all go away, you make this all go away
'Cause I'd do anything you want me to for you
Every part
Sell the rights to your blight and you'll eat
I hold a force I can't contain
It don't matter 'cause I have no sex life, and all I wanna do now is inject my exwife
How do you love in a house without feelings
Five stops, change the station
You can't get anyone to come in the sack
I'm just falling to pieces
My eyes been stung with dust, I'm blind
Let the whole world fall away
And this is why my eyes are closed
And now you're lying in the bed again
All be lost in time
He brings her to her feet and smacks her down till she falls to the ground
I wish you'd make up my bed
There's no one to know 
For years and years and years and years
But oh, that's a thoughtmy own revelation
To the story of me and you
And all the lovers with no time for me 
To truly hate myself
Cry like a child, though these years make me older
They laughed throughout their talking
And the sorrow I have seen since I left my home
And I got spun
And I don't understand the same things as you
Breadcrumbs lost under the snow
The things I brought you
You won't open up; It tears me up
Breaking your fingers 
Lookin' to find a way through the day, 
Losing your mind for the sake of your heart
But one can't carry the weight
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
And then the cold came
She said please stay
I know you have a lot of strength left
Red roses fell to the floor
Yeah, for the rest of my life
As soon as the storm is over 
There's a place in the sun for anyone
To sleep at night
The smoke sank into my skin
The chocolate, rose, the kisses
I tried to find a cure for the pain
You're still there still as you were
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
She wouldn't say
I got to fight for you, yes I do
Someone caught us in the kitchen
School holiday that she could do without,
For trying hard to become whatever they are
To hold you
You have to take me right now,
It may not seem like very much
But we can still support each other
Lay with you all night
And sleep alone tonight
It's not hard to dream 
And I miss you still
I would show you off like a trophy
Some future in my eyes, bright
Your presence dominates the judgments made on you
One thing I would never
Put my heart in its recipe
Des malentendus
And my skin is burning from the wind
There always is
Blankly telling me, "Have a nice life"
Now that the candle's falling smaller in my mind
But I don't know what we were fighting for,
But I've done it enough
Back when we were kids, we would always know when to stop
The ghost slips away
You bloody mother fucking asshole
It's always you 
"I don't care for this careful behavior"
You won't feel any pain
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Your silence makes me hold my breath
You held me in your hands
Away without you
You still support me after all the things that I've done
I have to kiss them
And just as your back's turned, you'll be surprised
Didn't know what it might be 'til it was open
Every night it's only you and I
Oh, into the sun, ah, into the sun
Overfired
When no one's really listening
The rusted signs, left just for me
Only you can mend
Oh, now, baby, don't cry
'Cause I knew he'd never love me back
Well I guess I should've listened
And over my shoulder as I walk away
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
Let's do some living after we die
Even if it's alone
Better run
As when we used to fall
And sometimes I find I catch myself letting you back in,
I love your depression and I love your double chin
I only did what I had to
We were made through one another
And I am calling long distance, don't worry about the cost
I still dream, dream
'Cause I am afraid of the light
God knows I've got to live mine
And hope that you won't let go
Withering son
I'd be patient if I had the time
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
And I know, 'cause I've heard talk
And there, you got me, that's how you got free
The fool on the hill
And if I went with you I'd disappoint you too
'This dream never ends,' you said
You can choose to believe
I'm sick of all the games I have to play
When I think of love, as something new
Your eyes don't like me no more
Ice water
With a view of the runaway
Had a second alone with a chance let pass
So come back to your old black sheep man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry, and I held your face in my hand
But I'm standing on my feet
And I get lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
We've got a light here that's not going away
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you
You said, you said that you would die for me
Always one
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
Goodbye,
Without hearing what I have to say
And cruel as a grave
You stayed inside
And still you call me codependent,
Oh heart of steel, you reel me in
Facing the ghosts that decide if the fire inside still burns
I thought it was funny when you, missed the train
So precise and so pristine, a perfect pane of glass
This is where it has to start
I'm as worn as a stone
The pieces don't fit anymore
There's a ghost in your old bedroom
For  years I've been trying to believe and confide in
Is the pain of the fighting starting up again
He doesn't play for the money he wins 
And on my deathbed, all I'll see is you
Every city's got to have 
I can't lose the sadness
There's a meaning
No fight left, or so it seems
Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies
It'll kill you in time
Such bad dreams
I'd rather fall myself than let you, drag me on down
You don't need my help anymore
Given you meaning but taken my place
All the hard things we've all gotta do
I think thoughts that I know are bad
Like you've lost all hope and your sanity
You can save face but you won't ever save your soul
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Wondering when the call comes
Feels like I'm starting it all over again
But somehow never quite this clear
My head, oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Now that it's time for you to leave
Love, love
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
You're just a man, you get what you can
"You're making mommy cry, why Why is mommy crying"
All my life 
One kid with a promise
Oh Grandmother 
Shoot myself in a different place
You will never dream
Everything gone white, everything's grey
Sing the anthem of the angels
I'm following suit and directions, I crawl up inside for protection
mis dias sin ti son tan oscuros
As long as he doesn't love her
Oh, you had me, honey and me, oh, sun and the moon
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
I see him die a little more inside
So far away from where you are
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
I hope that you don't laugh
And I don't understand all the things you've seen 
No lies, we're losing time
That aren't soaked and stained red 
His eyes are burning
As dog cries for a master and
Hate me tomorrow
So maybe I do, but that shouldn't affect 
Give it all away, to have someone to come home to
Turn down these voices inside my head
Oh, river of sorrow
But I was never the one for you
Seven miles above the earth, 
Let me walk astray
In my lover's arms I find relief
And my father told me, "Son,
Everyone around you has murdered someone's something sacred
In your eyes"
And then begin to breathe in
Like it's gonna be your last day
I love you though
A hundred times around
Strange what desire will make foolish people do
Covered in warrior paint
I've heard there was a secret chord
What it seemed so hold these
Look at my hands
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
For ye and me it turned
But I guess I'll just bite my tongue,
The genius next door was bussing tables,
A woman weeping in despair says
Damn their lies
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
Your name, forever the name on my lips
And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands
Of the days so young and sweet,
How can you mend this broken heart
No one knows where we are
If they don't put me away
So let this heart be still
And I won't fear this
The time will never come to slip away
I'm gonna miss the wind
What if all the world you think you know
Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
And I shut my eyes
Just our hands clasped so tight
It's cloud illusions I recall
I just want my life to be the same
It was extremely kind, in a tiny  jar
It was so simple in the moonlight
No matter what you say, he'll be back for more
Leave tonight or live and die this way
But mostly the view is accurate
The subway that only goes one way
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
That dream of Paris in the morning or a New York window view
What I look like
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
And 'Someone Save Temptation'
I keep my head from getting lazy
While this town is busy sleeping
Our very favourite fearscape
My head's above the rain and roses
They take the simple things inside you
When you walked out of my life
I know she's havin' a baby
I'm gonna call my home
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
Maybe you'll leave the light
You've really got a hold on me
Walking in the countryside
You're just a baby, you cannot fly
There's always something in the way
And we are, we are
Give me a little fool love
I'll stay up all night and crash on the plane
After school in the back of a bus
You've been lying in bed for a week now
It's washed away
The walls of my heart
I would find a way
Christian brothers gonna take him down
So as I write this letter
Can't forget the years she's
I can resist anything but, the temptation from you
With a broken sink for a face
In the world
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly
You know that I need you
Without pain, without fear
Just remember who's still around
Waste some time with you
In my living room late last night
I didn't need you to reply
Propped up by lies and promises, saving my place as life forgets
I won't do too much scheming these days
Such a pretty house and
There's a man on the horizon
Why can't you look at me like that
Just one look into your eyes
Emphasizing these things you won't allow
But you've been cold to me so long
Derramar no céu, se purificar
Hope you're not lonely without me
Something unusual, something strange 
We were sad of getting old
Show me all your figure paintings
Like bones make the walls of a prison
I told you not to believe in me
Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
Need someone to numb the pain 
The sky
As memories came flooding in, the tears blew up my eyes
All the hopes and the dreams
We are leaving new friends, leaving this town
Seems like yesterday
And all of the angels, they'd sell off your soul
I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here
The children, they cried
And the silence won't cease 
For today is a new day 
I look at that open road
All walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall
And I should have given you a reason to stay
Sunday night, when I cleaned the house
Do you love her
Hey little train We are all jumping on 
Once I was a rich man 
And wade midway into that porridge,
Ran my whole life in the ground
Yesterday lingers on
So hold on, hold on
Well the paint was all cracked
They call her Mississippi
It will just go black 
But more than this I wish you could've seen my face
I just want something
Always for you, and
See the things that I've been missing
I realize that music then
In the morning, I'll call you
In a small Montana town
No matter what happens now
Room where you've got nothing to hide
These things can be scary, not always what you want
I think that we both need to relax 
My sun is your sun,
It's still me, I never changed
I'm in a car
The one and only heart
'Cause you are, you are, you are my everything
Halfawake and sleeping on my feet
Of kindness linger on
Jemanden aus dem Westen
Under the waves in the blue of my oblivion
These people aren't your friends
Close your eyes and look at me
You're a part of me
I saw you waiting by the roadside
It just walks in where it left you last
You touch her skin and then you think
Our bodies will dissolve the chemicals in due time
It's not him who come across the sea to surprise you
I've got two Henrys and a dealer to pay
Break my wings and fall
I've earned through hope and faith
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
I tried to make my breathing stop
Cry alone, I've gone away
To be with you, to be the one
And even the toughest white boy, yes even the baddest white boy
Right now, I wish I could hear you say
Do you care to see
Mummy's in the doorway 
I cheat and I lie
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
You know I don't care
All I can do is keep breathing
Is she standing in my room
I'd put you in the mirror
Cry on my shoulder
And it might be wonderful, yeah
So let's just say goodbye forever
Where did I go wrong I lost a friend
And the sound it makes when it cuts in deep
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
When all I wanted was to be good
I need to get away from ya
You gotta be strong,
As heard on  Baron Von Bullshit Rides Again
To wish impossible things
So simple in the moonlight
When time stood still
Like to say I've got no past
Then you got sick too and guess who took care of you
As you're still burning the dress you wore to senior prom
When the trees start to sway
Did I make it that easy to walk
Fine lines of love and hate 
I yearn to say good bye
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
Just a boy and a little girl
But you wouldn't let me take the fall
Just died, yeah
Alright
How can you know it if you don't even try
To change
You wake up in the bed you make
The distance from me to where you'd be
It's such a shame for us to part
Summer in the city
Take me by the hand
The white queen walks
And came upon a man
Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping
You promised you would be there when I go
And I'll take the truth at any cost
As she wakes up alone again
My regrets, I'll face in the end
Why she was late may trouble you some
And all the color drains out of the frame
He opens a window just to feel the chill
Dear my love, haven't you wanted to be with me
There's a possibility it wouldn't show
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Goodbye on the hand
She's running out the door
'Cause you're not right within
tremors that warn us of ourselves
If there's love in a house
No one will love you
I stood too long in the way to the door
That night that you planned to go clear
All of the moments that already passed
Pain is just a consequence of love;
But it's alright, why don't you tell me my friend
And no one really knows what they are searching for
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
I open my eyes 
Almost lovers always do
Feel so close to everything now
But some times you lose sight
Ants are in the sugar
Sometimes love is not enough
So we say don't let it go
Inside the times we never had it right 
From a long time ago
But we will know that you are gone
How did we ever get this far
I don't want you to hate;
I don't know your face no more
I'll never feel that way again, no, no, no, no, no, no
On my own here tonight
This used to be my childhood dream
In the fairest of the seasons
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Only had one call
I wrote you a letter, darling, tried to make it clear
Leave a little life today
Don't you even try
My sweet love
Go ahead, everything will be explained
Winter howling at my face
What you've done,
Now you got me
So why can't I find my way
Couldn't wait for Saturday Saturday
Got your bible, got your gun
You fixed yourself, you said "Well never mind
But can you take me home
I have nothing left to give
Burning in my eyes to blind 
And its falling down,
But even more it's the one we hate
Where darkness is the only thing we see, and cold
I thought she was Mary, Queen of Scots
In your life you were larger than this
For you  times
You're just skin and bones, there's nothing left to take
To hear your voice, to see your face
It's over now, I'm cold, alone
And I guess that I miss you
I buried nails and string and hair
And I'll always be
It's not about the scars
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down
You changed yourself and I changed me
I think I found a place
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far
And stop crying your heart out
And if it makes you less sad
I'll be waiting outside till you're ready to go
Tears run down my face
Why it is though she's the door Always, she can't be the room
And I wanna come home to you
I walked around my good intentions
Before you take a swing, I wonder what are we fighting for,
Now, Brenda really never knew her moms, and her dad
Do you talk to me
I see eyes of the white menace
Tell me what your telescope says
She tried the last one on, it couldn't speak fell off,
Baby, let me explain something, it's all down to drugs
Same old story, not much to say
In disgrace with a shameful regret
And tonight 
I die when he comes around
A bitter aftertaste and a fantasy
Well I had better end it quick or I could lose my nerve
Hold, draw me close, close to my lips
Open up my hands
And all these days I spend away
The men in black ties arrive at the house in surprise
Am I ever on your mind 
They pissed in his hands
Oh, in these  hours
I'm dying, I'm crying
Don't you say hi
Why didn't she tell me where to go tonight
But now time will destroy us
Here we are still trading places
It could've been me and you until the end of time
It's a human sign
Hey little train Wait for me
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours
Can take away your pride
To say the least
It's a long walk and the music is loud
Will he tell you everyday
So take the streets if you wanna
Kiss the ground that you walk on, baby,
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs, that'll never take work off
We'll be here forever
"Wake up, paul," whisper clouds rolling by and the seeds
So I'll keep my head down
Dropping through sky
I never meant to let it get so, personal
Real arms around me
On my side of town
I wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die
The ones we trusted the most
Lays like snow at the foot of the Roanoke
'Cause I have lost the force to fight
Pull your mouth
You got me sippin' on something
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you
And you can tell me that you're sorry
It's too dark to see the landmarks
When the sky can't offer none to me
I picture you in the sun wondering what went wrong
I wanna make a big mistake
An ounce of peace is all I want for you, will you never call again
We all want to kiss her
We're high above but on the floor
Accept family and obligation
I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
Silly errs postponing your despair 
Is it fast enough so you can fly away
I promise that I won't bite
Our life, is always on the line
From up and down and still somehow
If you're lost and feel alone, circumnavigate the globe
And the voice that made me cry
If I'd only knew
I never knew my father neither
They don't make stationery like this where I'm from so fragile, so refined
I loved you with a fire red
What about the sweetness we knew
Seems like it's been forever
'Cause you're nobody girl
I thought we'd be healing together
Only to find, I've come alive
Park the car at the side of the road
And we'll never have to go back again
And she wonders where these dreams go
My eyes are soaked all way through
There is my trust in what I believe
You're the only one who finds it strange
When I looked round you were gone
All the shots and all that come
I'm happy to say I had better to do
I'd lay down my body I'd lay down my arms
I pace around the parking lot
Your father cried on the telephone
The face that we hide in
Solace my game
And gave those children everything we had
Or feel the touch that I adore
We'll call it Christmas when the adverts begin
You can say I've been most all around
Don't speak with someone's tooth
Then that would be my worst mistake
There's a world outside
Oh heart of steel, I can't let you win
I know you by heart,
I looked deep within myself
"There's no time for running away now"
'Cause if I could see your face once more
She was twelve years old
But I know you are here with me now
'Cause I know that in time
Well it takes one to know one, kid I think you got it bad
I spoke the words but never after the storm
Forlorn from today
I got a beauty queen
Your hands are shaking
Smoking your cigarettes, and talking over coffee
Won't you stay with me, please
Things cannot stay the same
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
When there's fuckin' change in my pocket
Wha, What's written in braille upon my skin
I can't be sure that this state of mine
I touch the place
Your coal black hair
But I found you before I drift away
I feel so useless, do you
I know it sounds lame but it's so true
We got into a bad fight
Spending my time
And she walks through the night with her child in her arms
This lady of the flowers and her hypnotic gaze
Happy Birthday
Old men kneel to accept their fate
I knew that somebody did
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I'm lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
Oh I never had just whatever it is you want, baby 
That we will meet again somehow
This is to a girl who got into my head 
Where the fun, it got no end
And now I am sure my heart can never be still
There's still a few holes that let in a little rain
I watched the whole thing fall
I've spent an hour with you, should I want anything else
Then all at once, you have to say goodbye
You're talking at me but I'm still far away
And I now know that life's design moves around white lies, white lies, white lies, white lies
Do you remember
All the rest is predictable
Then close your eyes and I'll be on my way
Our social graces have been displaced
Lost my mind
Stop pretending, 'cause we're going down
I belong to here where noone cares and noone loves
Is sweet and heady
Inside the time I have to forget you
And your dad set his jaw
Where we all change
Is nonsense, right
She's keeping count on her hand
Because she was making it with sisters and brothers
You're tearing me apart
And gently smiled
Drive my heart into the night
The sound and the thought of God 
I was born, born
Chasing through the city with their stars on bright
How unfair, it's just our love
And telling me how sorry you were
And visitation time
The maestro says it's Mozart
I want to keep burning
He was thirteen years old
Haligh, Haligh, a lie, Haligh,
You said the past won't rest until we jump the fence and leave it behind
Told me you were not alone
Once again to find a home
So I play the numbers game
I shut my eyes
They all end up broken
Nothing survives
When the hour is upon us
I know I would apologize if I could see your eyes
When told he'll give you money if you just pray the right way
How could I be losing you forever
And that's life
I hear your voice, "You must learn to stand up
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
I know we haven't spoken for a while
I don't wanna walk around
While looking through your old box of notes
And I wish, I wish it was a small world,
She walks up and asks how you are
But I know it's just a reflection of the moon
Too late, I'm sure and lonely
Sometimes baby, you just need someone else
I'm spending my time
Just one touch and I'm on fire
This is life, life immortality
They had lights inside their eyes
To give her the priceless peace
Return to the clouds
I'm not saying anything you haven't heard before
When Monday comes, I want nothing
Been there done that
You notice all your fingers pruning up
I could kiss you, with lines of escape in my mouth
Solid gold now, solid, solid gold
So why am I ten feet under and upside down
No you can't stay mad at the setting sun
You've been thinking about the time, you've been dreading it
So go ahead and lose yourself in liquor
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
From this second story window I can hear the children
'Cause there's just an empty space
I already forget how I used to feel about you
Couldn't see that I, I was so blind
So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home;
Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry
Something has taken you so far from me
A life of barely breathing as she walked out of this place
There's a ghost on the horizon
And I'm so sorry
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
Light up when you smile
There is no night time, only a passing phase
They had a master plan, wanted to tear us apart
And I can't sleep
It'll grow back like a starfish
Sleep tonight
And all the times I had
Spends her light on the Bayou
Softly in her sleep
You're callin' me back, yeah, but that was no good
Take this sinking boat and point it home
for me nothing's easy 
He took a suite of rooms
As it chokes on a bone
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
These clouds we're seeing
I die a little
Pushing you away
I didn't think so 
I will not run
Look inside a skeleton 
And in the night
You suggest the struggle goes both ways
And in that deafening pleasure, I thought I heard someone say
Anyone can tell you there's no more road to ride
Nobody else 
Don't you know she's got a know know know know know know know
The seasons have changed from the present to past
Underneath a winters sky,
I don't do too much talking these days
As I talk in tongues to myself in my bed
Try to burn your changing name
This is the best feeling
It's time to say goodbye
Separate from the rest, where I like you the best
Rain rushing, window pane, oh well,
And there's nothing I can do
The days have come and gone, our lives went by so fast
Secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight
Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
Beautiful heart
I don't know what to believe in; you don't know who I am
So when I go home I'll be happy to go
And I can't face the evening straight
Only tears to dwell upon
And I thought that I had control
Can't you see I try
And It must have been an hour
There's gonna be a little one and she, says it's time to go
I'm sober now for three whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
drowing in my tears, 
Everything's complex
We lift our hands and pray over your body
Still cries at a good film, still kisses with saliva
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
It's just the way I feel
This was my first love, she was the first to go
Keep breathing my angel, if you go down I go down with you, keep breathing, just keep breathing
'Cause they'll be losing bodies tonight
We could smoke 'til the sun goes down
You will always be a loser now
And we talk till the evening fades
'Cause every night I'm talking to the moon
The monster your mother made you to be
Still tryina find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I
Can I say
Up the stairs to her apartment
Without talking
And I'm underlined already in envy green
I don't care to say what
Because the last time you saw me
Weep not for roads untravelled
Darling, please
Pick up all the pieces, fight to hold on
You tidied your things into the bin,
We meet here for our dress rehearsal to say
They will stay there forever
Hell is asking to be loved
They slip away
Young boy, I wanna help you
Can't hide what has come
But remember when I moved in you
'Cause I will never be forgotten
I've got a woman
You're all getting drunk instead
Oh, to turn and see her smile
Side by side in silence
How do you love with a fate full of rust
Say 'Sorry, babe, I had to meet a mate'
Is that space that you call mine
You won't feel any
Try to put a word in for me
How can you live in a place like this 
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
Oh, but you just don't believe that I'm sincere
And the cold wind's hitting my face and you're gone
I wanna stay inside all day
There's only lies
I seem to remember a home that was better
You are the smell before rain
But she's stuck against the wall
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
In the morning, I got in a fight with myself
When the night comes, when the night comes loose
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
We had new inventions had new inventions
But there was once you,
The wild and windy night
And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view
I'll keep them still
My mouth was a crib and it was growing lies
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment
And hold you like I used to
Stand behind bulletproof glass
Just as high as the door
And not a reason
I'd draw myself going in the right direction
But if you wanna show, then just let me know
So, I wanna live in a wooden house
Like black night
Cover it with semen
Oh, come on, you know me too well
Oh, I Thought I knew it all
Move your hands across me
I've looked at life from both sides now
Going through every out I used to cop to make the repetition stop What was I supposed to say
Well, I'm a sucker for that feeling
Under the covers I'm okay I guess
Oh wild horses
I never once in my sweet short life was waiting for desire
Tear me apart and then some
I'm a fool for you
Freeze is well cheap though, so I'll take three if I need to
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
He calls down the day
Yea when my world is falling apart
This whole life it's been about
And a place
Calm these hands before they
No one gets hurt
What I was isn't what I am
Together we cry, oh, we cry, we cry, oh, we cry
It's to Jimmy Eat World and those nights in my car 
Hands are scarred, heart is charred
Let me hold on to you
I stay at home with my disease,
I know how I begin, and how I'll end
Songs about memories
When every man is torn apart with nightmares and with dreams
'Cause you are not alone
And after seven years in advertising you are none the wiser 
She is far away
I guess that's what you want I could still fall in love with you
She thought that she'd be the one who could change the world
And dear my love, haven't you longed to be free
To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn
And blew away as I collapsed
How you kissed me at night
The ghost of your smile is always looking
Become someone different
I guess that makes you found
I steal a kiss from her sleeping shadow moves
For you to race me home when it was nearly getting dark
I've got all the change
Until you're sleeping 
Take it with the love it's given
And these are my many letters
Even when you died
Future in my eyes, bright
She knew the crumpled up promise of this broken down man
How did I get to this point of things playing
And all I really ever need is some love and attention
She's a myth that I have to believe in
I was looking for another chance
It's the end of a broken heart x
All my eyes can see is all I know;
I've been waiting but oh tonight,
Funny how it rained all day
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
There's no meaning anymore
And my heart caught fire
So shut your mouth
Or think about the day she found you
I knew who she was
Blackened stones, I beg you, speak
Well the chambers of my heart
I wanna kiss you goodbye
That's the wrong thing to do
That keep on falling from your mouth
It brings me right back down
And take my hand and cradle it in your hand
So please don't get me rescued
And we can cast away those doubts
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
Samson went back to bed
And you always found a meaning
I don't ever want to go to bed
Nothing is important to me
Or something that could ease the pain
I want you so much but I hate your guts
So please remember me mistakenly
Though I still believe in everything
Turned away
No one will love you, love you like I do
And like a deer in the headlights, I meet my fate
But your undecisive mind shows me that 
Now I bade a friend farewell
My father's house stood shining hard and bright the branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
No sleep today
Improvise, do something really clever,
And now that he's gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time to push my pride away,
No more little girl
And many times I've cried
Crying in the peaceful night
Around your neck and tug you to the ground
He takes your hand
it's useless to sleep, 
Our love is dead but without limit
Yesterday was cold and bare
We can chase the dark together
The game you're in is just a game
For this heart's a little bit older
I won�t hold you to nothin
Broke a promise 'cause my car broke down
At attention, looking backward in a pool of water
Its two am, feelin' like I just lost a friend
Doing things I wanna do
And watched you reading with the lord
My feet will never touch the ground
Bdbbyebdbdyebdbyebdye
I'll think of England this time
I picked at it, it never heals, it never goes away
And if you were with me tonight
I've run out of complicated theories
If you want, I'll try to love again, try
I'll carry it to my grave
In the woods one Christmas Eve, waiting
And it's one more day up in the canyon
They don't know you and they don't watch you walk away
This could be the end
When all, all that I did was for you
Those that she'd loved
And he come home and he'd say to me
Everytime you told me to leave
I'll never glow the way that you glow
We broke your glasses but covered our asses
And how we're guiltstricken sobbin' with our heads on the floor
He waits to hear her say "forget"
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
We all learn to make mistakes
I'll hide all the damage that's done
You'll never return to this place 
Difficult not to feel a little bit
Look cross the land, shake this land
In fact, you have become
I'll tell you why I don't want to know where you are
White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
And we sleep inside of this machine
I wish that I could stay
No one knew me, no one knew me
And the days go by so fast
Oh yeah, said I felt so happy, my my my
Knew it all along
When you're scared to accept
Your scars concealed
A true song as real as my tears
Stay right where you are
Let me take my fall
Things don't work that way
So I'd like to start this one off by saying
I'd rather fuel a fantasy than deal with this alone
So the house might dissolve,
Gotta live our lives
"I'll be going through withdrawal of you for this one night we have spent"
Lady lights a cigarette, puffs away, no regret
Oh, right
And the hours that ran wild
When flowers gaze at you
You just say you're out there waiting
That's unfair
And there's no doubt he's at home in his room 
The past
Then she laid her eyes on mine
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
I'm empty with the need to
And this time,
I'm gonna miss the sea
I still press your letters to my lips
And a light that just won't shine in the darkness
Round here, she's slipping though my hands
And seeing mine warning me
And besides, this shit is making me tired
I know I'm lucky in a lot of ways
Try, bleeding is believing
Guess I don't wanna die
Omit myself take myself from your eyes
I've looked in the studio, study and all
It lasted twenty years, seven months and twentyseven days
And all those things you said that night
We were only freshmen
Her wild feral stare, her dark hair
And she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me
An eagle comes down 
She tried to sell crack, but ended up gettin' robbed
Reply to single M My name is Caroline
I don't recognize this street
Everybody's screaming 
Slowly those feelings
I saw you outside
Oh, It could never be the way
Deep within the corners of my mind
You are one of God's mistakes
We might make love
Wash yourself in your tears and build your church
Anyone, caught in your mystery
And I said I'd find a better place we could spend eternity
Gave me sunshine, made me happy
And tell him that now, that you wish he would die
But you'd always wanna know what I was about
And the more we tense up, avoiding pain 
Till you came and made sense out of everything
Never opened myself this way
'Cause everyone feels just like you
And you think I ought to shake your motherfuckin' hand
I tell her I promise its fine, but she cries herself to sleep
One more, one more night, that was a good one
Sometimes the first thing you want never comes
Pale white like the skin stretched over your bones
"Sweetie, the moon has raped me 
I'm a singer without a song
There's clothes all over the floor
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
For I do believe
You're a cause of sorrow
It's a beautiful world
There's a dead man trying to get out,
All shall fade to black
A picture of you holding a picture of me
Doll eyes
Two tickets to a film I don't remember
I can feel it in my bones
For a quick hand of gin 
You left another message said it's done,
Have you got a key
And the night, it never ends
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
It hurts my soul
Hold onto my hands
I'm finished, all I know are the facts
To love me
Oh my heart can't carry much more
That this life is easy
But not for such as you and I, my love
If I ever break away from you that day forth,
Somewhere far beyond this world,
And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see
At night I trip without you, and hope that I don't wake up
So blood is fire pulsing through our veins 
And it was raining cats and dogs outside of her window, and
Animal or Angel You were carved from bone
My own words I guess
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
I heard voices of friends vanished and gone
It was you, you're the fool
See you on the other side
Far, far away, find comfort in pain
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
The fear of getting caught
And you were walking down below
Sinking under the river,
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
How can I just let you walk away
Come back home, you know the place where you used to live
"There's plenty of ways to know you're not dying
I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do
I wish that this weather would never leave
I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
The librarian and secretary's son
It wasn't fake it
Even if no one understands
Undone for the last time
Stone cold
Jumped into the river
Yeah, some people wanna steal her heart
I feel nothing anymore
I'd swear that I could hear him tell me he was sorry
So just give it one more try to a lullaby
Like there's no sunrise
But when you come and see me in California
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
Brothers and lovers, she and I were
You can say you're the first to know
My friends, I'm gone
If you're looking for it looking for it
With the wordly goods you stashed away
I've been outside
And I can still remember giving in
Moody It's got me x 
Because I took my own insides out
Heard your name the other day, it's been a long, long time
Even if it's alone
Such a lonely day shouldn't exist
I hope you're keeping some kind of record
And I can't suppress the memories
Only sadness
Could I have eased your pain
Want to keep you inside
Will you still miss me when I'm gone
Tell me the truth
I can still hear it all of the time
Lipstick still on my mirror
I have no regrets for the past is behind me
Someone else you'd rather phone 
And it feels like I'm flying above you
They'll kill you in time
All the ones who hate
How can it feel, this wrong
Save the life that here awaits
Almost as if to say
And prays to hear him say "I love you"
As I walk on
Now he's sitting in his hole
A son's heart's sewed to mother
Your apocalypse was fab
First night of your life, curled up on your own
And I feel you
A collage behind my eyes
And there's nothing much left of me
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
And there were barricades to keep us off the street
Out there in the spotlight
Go ahead say it, you're leavin', you'll just come back runnin'
Oh mother, don't look back
Now I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive
Saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
Speak to me baby
I'll come, come, come
She dreams him as a boy
See you some time, ask me if I care
The hour or the day, no one can tell
Can't get no love without sacrifice
And if they ever become too clear
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven
The best thing I can think to do right now is leave it alone
Always with that melancholy smile
Offer up your steps so I can climb
And for the moment you can hardly breathe
Brenda's
You should be the one I'll always love
And we'll go to sleep, but this time, not alone, no no 
Grab ahold to what I got
'Cause when you showed me myself I became someone else
And head for the door
I wish, I don't wish I still smoked
You're the one who's always choking Trojan
Do you miss me, Miss Misery, like you say you do
Swearin' up and down you can fix what's been broken yeah
Gotta be honest
Happy birthday us
"Put your hands in the sky
Probably end up a stranger and crazy
Sure i'm gonna say 
But I'm busy mending broken
I know which one I prefer
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
And you never owed it to them anyway
You can't replace me, you can't
All the good things you are
I know it well, ugly and sweet
It was January, 
I'm so sad, so sad
When things start splitting at the seams and now
Brenda's Brenda
Sometimes I breathe you in
She once fell through the street
The best thing about life is knowing you should be here
There's a different song 
How can you offer me love like that
On the night train 
Because before too long you'll be a memory
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Please say there's no regrets, and say you won't forget
I sleep with windows open
This love's too good to last 
The angry are animals
From all our favorite songs
Midsweet talk newspaper word cutouts
Never letting no one take it away
The fool who wastes his life, God rest his guts
Is this the way it's got to be
I like drifting through the air
When I'm not around
Can't lose the sadness
My story has been told 
Your resentment grow till you're all alone
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Left this haunted town
You make it hard to breathe
Is there love there, even when I'm wrong
And I just need a little time
And everywhere you turn
So just say yes or no, why can't you shoulder the blame
You're there through my wasted nights
I know if I'm face to face that she'll come to her senses 
I've got this feeling inside me
I was always looking
Tonight
And don't you mention all the good there would be
And everyone lifts their head
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
But something told me to run
So please don't ask me any questions
There's no one in town I know
To this western town
And caught a long wind
Sometimes I wanna call you but I know you won't be there
If I wait for stormy skies
Keep my faith even through the darkness, yeah I still believe in love
I'd do anything to have her to myself
I didn't think much of it then
Can't lift a finger, can't change my mind
But this time fleshed out full face
Ooh my love was punished long ago, if you still care don't ever let me know
Shifting the dream
When I'm much too far away
I'm going out with someone too
Nothing left to fear
I know, I've gotta let you go
Little voices whispering
Please don't let this turn into something it's not
Say it one more time, baby
These are the very words she uses to describe her life
Lie to all your friends
The holy dark was moving too
Just like a child again
Dreadful sorry, Clementine
Let me walk away
The daylight aiming on what we do
Remember those classes when we thought we were so smart
Maybe I oughta mention
All of New York town
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
The only one who's ever known
That it was wrong or it was right
Of you knocking on my door
In the cold light
To keep my head
Just to occupy one minute of your day
They won't change their minds
trash on the floor, 
And it's opening time, there's noone in line
Oh, I will stand arms outstretched, pretend I'm free to roam
You don't need to worry about the others
I want you to remember
Oh, he says, bye bye bye to all of the noise
Goodbye, my baby, don't cry
So all of the businessers in unlimited hell
Find the reason of another's pain
The mind that knows itself
And let me go alone on your way
On this barren road 
Well, baby, I've been here before
We won't have a thing
I don't really mind if I just Fade away
And I hope we hang on past the last exit
Just because you came across it and lost it
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
For the life of me, I cannot remember
I put on my hood and walked away  that doesn't mean I don't like you
These scars of mine make wounded rhymes tonight
Our friends speak out in our defense
To fuck up their lives
But you ain't leaving without a fight
But if I had to lay it on the line
Let me find a way
Before he'd ever learned how to talk
This time next year, we'll be no more
And I'll tip my hat to those who can't believe it's me
And we can fly, fly, fly away
And there'll be no crying soon
How could we know, that song, this show,
To navigate adulterous waters
To anyone about anything 'cause it's all been done remember
When I was checking vitals I suggested a smile
There is nothing left to say
Stop this pain tonight
Because everyone has hopes, you're human after all
The endless inbetween
Until Jesus comes
And you're scared to accept
Round here, we stay up very, very, very, very late
Everywhere you go red roses
And never again will my letters start
Along with place and time
I would have stayed in your bed
Of children wishing they were safely underground
And this loss isn't good enough for sorrow or inspiration
We lost a friend we lost a friend
But I'm dyin' on the floor
It don't matter when you turn
The same dark dread every morning
With the door closed, shades drawn
To our love send a dozen white lilies
I can remember where I come from
Call, break my own heart
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
And the bed where you lie
No encuentro forma alguna de olvidarte 
I was never told about the sorrow
Just make me fall apart
And no poem or song
But, I'll be okay Is that what you want me to say
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no one can touch me
And I can't let go of your hand
And maybe you can cry all night
Oh don't take it all to heart
As wars rage before me
Oh Left my sweet soul
Who would have thought
Through the cold of the day
You are the blood in my veins
Just someone to keep my house clean
Why you're so far away
And I hope to God I figure out
A friendship turned to a bond
Nobody cares at all
How can there be so many personalities
I stuffed it down, it's back again
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Crossing my fingers and my t's
You may change your mind
A time for us and the words we'll never know
Some people think he likes to go out dancing
"Wherever he has gone I have gone"
So they took the registration and the car keys and her shoes
Open mind for a different view
Do you come
To handle everyday
Looking kind of anxious in your crossarmed stance
So I just don't start, it's getting worse
You've got to calm down
In the storm, by the storm 
I don't know why, I guess that I just do
Except back to you just one last time
Happy birthday us 
All the cracks, they lead right to me
And fall, fall, fall 
It'll feel like it should
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
There's so much I need to say to you
While he's turning around the open sign
I always was one for crying
I need you to stay
Choice to live my life extended
From his family and his friends
The scenario is grave but I'll be braver when you save me
How could this love ever changing, never change the way I feel
Do I stay
And the way your innocence tastes
Blowing out wishes, blowing out dreams
And meanwhile heavens falling
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
You have given me something I can't live without
I wanna start everything over again
I don't want to hear you say
Blow the roof off the place
So don't look now
I wake, just to feel the weight
Tonight, when I came home from work
Guess I think I feel alright
Love, it taught me to cry
Looking at you, looking at you
The rain was warm and soaked the crowd
We first met through a shared view
The sun's in the sky but the storm never seems to end
This is me down on my knees
I never thought I could fail
I was waving around a bleeding open wound
Because I can't live without you and
Take the pain away
And boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Red wine and sleeping pills
So take me to town, I wanna dance with the city
I know that you are not mine
All alone on your face
Still, we've got our hearts on safe
The town all dressed in white
And then accused me of trying to fuck it up
It was peeled off of the wood
No, I don't wanna fall in love This girl is only gonna break your heart
Years go by and I'm here still waiting
The love A woman of your kind is rare
Nothing to ruffle your ends
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please
Pass me that lovely little gun
I don't need your reasons
My dear they will dry off your cheeks
Were full of hate, I was so angry
And I know you're up in two hours
You don't hear me when I say
This conversation has had no face
There was a time, dark and divine
Nothing's wrong with you and me
Where the cave man died 
We slave for days and weeks
But that day will most likely never come for me 
Well she tossed all night like a raging sea
Scratched in metal, name erodes away
Shake your ass out in that street
The world shrinks
Talking aloud as they sit round their tables
Trouble, oh, trouble
And tell me how it feels, tell me how it feels
Wanted everything to stop that bad
And kills me for the rest of my life
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon, too soon
And rid of all the shit we hated
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
"You will always be a loser
Now all my days are filled with tears
And your sheepskinlined coat is eluding me still
So choose your last words, this is the last time
Taste my need
Your day breaks
Just after doing you by the sight of My Kodak delights
And time is running me still
Makes me wanna cry oh yes it does
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
And rejoice despite the fact this world will tear you to shreds
Your name is tattooed on every boy's skin
Everything reminds me of her
She says she has no time
And it's the only thing worth knowing
And a bad taste that she left when she was leaving me
And it will make you more aware with its absence at night,
There isn't anything you can do
The ground is now cement and glass
Where are you tonight
Right I'm on the plan, I wish the bouncers would go away,
I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you
One day you'll kiss your rabbits nose, pick up the phone
The evil it spread like a fever ahead
I made my baby cry
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
The wick is burning returning what we have
I kissed your mouth
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
I let my faith fill the air
Because if you throw a light
Unill the break of day
Has left a pool of tears
Crawl across toward your window
Just thinking of the women who've taken your place
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower
Goodbye my lover
Or I don't want anyone
Oh my God, we see it on the floor
I'm down to just one thing, I'm starting to scare myself
You better watch what you dream
You won't have to wait too long, yeah, yeah
The problems lie within
So tell me, did you really think
I'm ready to live with my family, I'm ready to die in obscurity
I've got an open door
That I was brave enough to die
And it's one more night in Hollywood
Yeah, she'd wanna kiss you all the time
I walk the water
I can't change what happened
His voice is overwhelming, but his speech is slurred
And so it goes a man grows cold
Hey yeah
These arms will not be taught to need another's,
Some of us will always stay behind
And they made you change your name
And sometimes I find I catch myself letting you back in
All we got to show what we really are
Lights are blinding my eyes
And I'm the only one who laughs at your jokes when they are so bad
Yeah then I saw love disfigure me
And street light caught in falling snow
It's the fault of no one 
I was here Oh, ooh, ooh
He's never going home
To turning tables
I don't think you know what I fear
I've got something in my throat Beneath the bedclothes
I could be lonely
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
That's why it's blue
You were always the mysterious one with dark eyes and careless hair
I turn around to see
While you dance to "Purple Rain"
And godsend I don't want to go
All of your life you have spent
No one will find us
He said, "Son, have you seen the world
And I'll let your smile just off and carry me
Lost him lodged inside a flue
I'm coming back around again
Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet 
The light will fill our eyes like cats
I don't know where we are headed for
You've dreamed a thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
To a place where I am blinded by the light
I'm the orange clouds raining in my hand
Stuck in honey
Listen to the breeze, whisper to me please
That fills me with the hope to wish
And it doesn't matter what I say or do 
Oh, all our love fell down to Earth
Into something I am not recognizing
All the days you spent with me, now seem so far away
Gripping tight the phone in her hand
And she's holding him tight in her bat arms
For we're like creatures in the wind
Irgendwo sind wir gescheitert
She asked him in a casual way
Some would say a man grows strong
The future that we hold is so unclear
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
When the summer turned to spring
And there's someone who
Hello I'm still here
Now the bombs drop around our feet,
That without love will wilt and die
I'm trying hard to breathe
You grabbed my hand and we fell into it
You told me again you preferred handsome men
Mais leur chanson est monotone
Times have changed and now I find I'm free for the first time
How does he taste while he's on your lips
But what's really worth living anymore
And you know that there's a place in the sun
Down the stairs, you were there
Or did someone do somebody wrong
Nights of light so soon become
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
We stayed for the winter
Drink my worries down the drain
I never thought it could happen
Something slow
The boxer isn't finished, he's not ready to die
In fact, I am told that a lot
So maybe don't give me cold shoulder
Oh, trouble
No wind in our sails
Now I'm staring at what once was the wall
That was Wisconsin, that was yesterday
Together we always pull through always pull through
Or a young girl
I view visions of you, then you're gone
The ticking, and the western man's need to cry
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind
Music starts
Our skin up off from the bottom, leaves our ankles bare
I had the feeling that you'd open up my eyes 
Take comfort in your friends
Should have been a father
Is it your fear of being buried that makes you so afraid to speak
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
'Cause come the morning, I'll be gone
Time can come and wash away the pain
Am I making something worthwhile out of this chase
Take your hand and walk away
Oneway love I took for ours
Let your son grow
I know I've been mistaken
Lookin' to the left slightly, then lookin' back down
Who took that look away
Scream back at you 
I'm tired of this smile that even I don't recognize
And would you get them if I did
And damn, this place
Stone
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
So far away in their bulletproof cars
And even if you're in the arms of someone's baby now
See that girl coming on down
I'm lying here tonight 
Hoping you would come around
I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I am staying right beside you
So for the rest of my life
Like the taste of your smile
I may not say the words as much
It feels so right
I will hold the candle until it burns up my arm
It's way beyond control
To get back to who I used to be
I've been hallucinating you, babe
Your beauty is beyond compare
Nothing to left to win
Of the curl of your bodies
Oh, summer in the city
I'm no longer yours and you're no longer mine
Oh, oh, ooh
But I hate the way
Solve lots of problems solve lots of problems
Ada, hold onto yourself by the sleeves
What's in front of me these days
Waiting for my father both of us were scared
The ones where we all laugh so lame
Well I had better end it quick or I could lose all my nerve
When not too many people
What a sad trick you thought that you had to play
Well today is grey skies
But now I'm asleep on top of a mountain, I've been covered in snow
Just because they knew your name
Better run run run run run to me
He could not choose one
A reason to fight
I always wanted that myself
How can we make things right
Inside it's warm
I had to try to keep my mind outta this
You're gentle now but I recall
You already know I love you and I sound like what'shisname
I never knew what it was like
It seems are slowly fleeting
I don't think I'll risk another these days
But this is me swallowing my pride
Pisspoor, ride in her sun bathing fireside
Give me a little time
It's been a long cold winter since that day
Ineffabilis totus desiderabilis
And it's colder than yours
Well that may be your worst redemption
No pictures left in the hall
And from the first to all the last times, all the signs
Lying here, lie,
What I want from us, is empty our minds
Now listen to the truth
A mind that knows itself
I remember it well, taxied out of the storm
Maybe check the news
It's you that I hold onto
I wished your love away
But with brand new broken fortunes
Always crashing in the same car
Meet all their demands
To live without despair, and to be without disdain
With excellence industry
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
"Hurry Come inside"
Have no fear anymore
Never had a lot of fun
Conversation lost its hate anyway
Sun has gotta rise
I don't really need to anyway 
That you were just with her, and I'll still be your fool
That they think I'm immune to the pain
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
And a dark way that leads to my house
Laughin' and kissin' it's a match made in heaven
A cracked polystyrene man
My one
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss
I know the past will catch you up as you run faster I know I know
Your life anymore 
Crooked spin can't come to rest I'm damaged bad at best She'll decide what she wants
I can see me darlin' ahead on the motorway
And you've got your share of secrets
There's a tear in your eye
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
I'll meet you on the other side
And I was promised
In this hole that we have fixed
But they've thrown away the keys
It's only fools  they make these rules
Beyond my dreams
Though she doles out hurt like a puking bird
Give me something
I'm just a huge manatee a huge manatee
They come and go, as early warnings
For when I really come around
I will go down as your lover, your friend
That everyone
For my bones have found a place to lie down and sleep
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
On the one you're leavin' home
'Cause now I see I'll never stop this train
As I take my last breath
Eighteen forever first kisses
Away, away, away
When we were children we'd say
Now I'm outside your house
People die, but real love is forever
'Cause every place I go I take another place with me
Get your bags and hold down
Little lies cross overboard
Why wasn't God watching
I spent so many years learning how to survive
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
Hide and Seek No, no, you don't care a bit 
Is to be home
Our conversations are circles, always one sided,
Well there may well be others but I still like to pretend
My face is all lit up
That there's anything worth trying to save
All those years
Tell me, how can you stop the sun from shining
I thought I'd see when day was done
I washed your dishes
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
You thought that you saw him, but no you did not
Stay a while, my baby wants me to
As they chart up your insides and put them on display
But the strength I always loved in you finally gave way
And if I should ever fall in love again
Great story of
El cielo está cansado ya de ver 
Except we always woke up,
Keep this scene inside your head
'Cause I wanna know if you can see the stars tonight
I know that you're alive inside
And I know I'll find deep inside me
And the mother of gloom
A child
And if I told you that I loved you 
Hey, are you awake, yeah, I'm right here
And I'll accept your invitation to the blues
Call it off, sorry refused 
Still we figure out the keys
They kept the door closed at all times
Don't hang up this time
Not to regret and not to sleep
Has started in me as
I guess we're gonna argue again
I'm sick of looking for those heroes in the sky
Just one smile and I'm wild
She sees an old friend as she walks through the crowd
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
I lost my love my life, that night
But always know, always know, always know
Coming after people you watched collide
' Hudson in the garage
But I would walk  miles
Just when I thought I had forgotten
In a year or so
You are always gonna be my love
You appear just like a dream to me
For these thoughts here to leave me
Oohooh oohoohoohooh
I've made my mistakes
That sings so we, can heal the harm inside
The dog days are done
Goldenrod and the H stone
And fully clothed, I float away
Mmm that you only meant well Well, of course you did
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face
Where the land is low is
Since we both made up our minds
The tragedy starts from the very first spark;
Before you walk out of my life
Oh we're shadows
And go home again
, , pussy stays on my mind
Just a nobody girl
In fact you may just want to run away
Reminds you of home
I could never be the puzzle pieces
And I walk down to buy her flowers
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Poison hearts will never change
Tracing out a path right out of here and now
And I can't live with myself today
'This world never stops,' you said
Watching trees decompose
Well it's time to surrender, it's been too long pretending
You just might wave hello again
Got in you and ripped out the seams
I had these dreams, in them, I learned to play guitar 
The Face could laugh and cry
It's not like me to beg you to stay
I've got a roof over my head
Always
Before it's coming to an end, yeah
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
Can you imagine us years from today
After all, I'm still a jerk playing with matches
Watch my life
You're fighting with your mom again
The contracts are drawn up,
On love, On love
Because the truth is that gossip's as good as gospel in this town
And you coming back to me is against the odds 
Sometimes a man gets carried away
But I'm always wanting you 
Putting all the vegetables away,
If you're feeling kinda nothing 
And I'd be inclined to be yours for the taking
I'm always wanting you
And there's a sky that's changing and a bird that sings
I will never sleep again I, I, I'll never even close my
Why do we call this love
He talked about you, Mary, and how much we loved you still
Knowing that for someone you're an angel sent to save
While I'm staring at my phone
Should seen the look on my face
Hey, shit happens, Uh huh just blow it off woo
And I'm complicated, you won't get me I've trouble
And in the river made o' light
And hope that my sanity covers the cost
With my scalding tears
Daddy I've got nothing left
But what can I say now
Gave away
To work for your bread
And so there's a change, in your emotions
So let's pretend that we're rich
Where would you like for me to hang my head
To let you walk away
We are shadows
Dissolved in some dream
Still waiting for the swollen Easter tide
Gotta figure out how you stole my heart
Who asked for your hand
I really don't know love, at all
I search myself and everyone
They say you ain't grindin' until you die
The battle becomes blinding
And I've been facing this alone
La verdad es que también 
The rain falls hard on a humdrum town
Never, no one
My mother's always tried to change herself
Am I being paranoid, am I seeing things
Put me inside
Mr Postman, do you have a letter for me
And that old tooth I believe was a bear's
Don't wanna try don't wanna try I 'bout just had enough it's been a rough road
That form a wall to hide
Shattered all the pieces apart
I really don't know clouds, at all
My fingers in creases
I can see whomever I choose
This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues
And build a new reality
Their eyes are sparkling
Waiting for you to come along
By the light of dawn
That eventually in time
A sadness I can't erase
Baby, never should say never
Come on, come on, come on
Be running up that building
It was you
I said, "Hey little girl, where do you hide
I think you're crazy, maybe
Hours slide and days go by, till you decide to come
The signals grow on radios
My heart My heart, my heart
A paperweight, junk garage
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
She wrapped the baby up, and threw him in a trash heep
And she walks the night
To a whole new world that had since been in disguise 
I need you so much closer
He said 'I bought it for you because I love you
Friends
Run, run, run away
I take a drive in my car
For people and things, that went before
'Cause the sky is breaking
I'm back on the motorway
Garbage pails and darkened jails
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon
So she got on an aeroplane
And in the morning you'll awake feeling new
It's in my mouth
I'm still not sure
I could pull you from the fire
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
Is the one thing that I had, 
Sons could be birds, taken broken up to the mountain
I see pain but I don't feel it
Pictures and some memories 
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye
Talk to the sky
Says "I've seen your picture on a hundreddollar bill"
Where September was long
He was not that much older than I was
And I can't stop dropping everything
When I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
There is no other way
My lover's gone, 
Why do I have to fly over every town up and down the line
That was me, me, me
I could never leave your beautiful eyes
All I need's my railroad boots
On the past
I go down to the river filled with regret
So we've got nothing to lose
Whenever she walks by
You're still the only one
Now starts the craft of the father
Will you hold on to me
I don't feel the joy
'Cause I'm too tired tonight for all these games
When the silence beckons,
Better things to do around the house
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling
The wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
Yours was mine through to my bones
Will you stay with me 
Maybe I'm foolishly overreacting
The everything that takes you back
But sometimes I still just can't
Like the leaves of fall
Put on my coat in the pourin' rain
I never knew 'til I met you
You can do whatever the hell you want to
Head of someone 
Five in the morning it all comes out pouring,
Ice water for blood
But I got, I got away
As I try to find the will to forget her somehow
And I can't shake but I can't breathe
And all I wanna do is ride bikes with you and stay up late and watch cartoons
I will leave behind all of my clothes
And every time you go to sleep
The morning light has washed your face
You say, "I wanted you to be proud of me"
It's nothing to you
Don't feel too good
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh
If someone else comes, I'll just sit here listening to the drums
Like the one that just passed
When there's no light to break up the dark
No one is moving
Where the fuck could they be still not over in the corner,
I did, I've done
Car wash also on Sundays
But my heart is open
Would always make you feel better
We can change the colour
We came together but you left alone
Let the wind blow through your heart
So tonight to celebrate I will
It took everything I got
And she may drive me crazy
This whiskey got me Feelin' pretty
It was not what I expected it to be
That I'm the one who has got your back 
I'll be here when you come back
'Cause I don't care
Now you've gone away, don't worry it's okay
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
Between the busy ones and the ones who don't care
And there, you got me, that's how you got me
Don't wanna try don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight and say the things
Never seem to get in the place that I belong
"I'm down at Denny's on route one 
She must be tired of something
And if you come and see me, you will upset the order
The hardest game to play
There is nothing as lucky
As each day goes by
I'm a little bit scared of what comes after
Oh, I'm still alive
But I've walked them straight lined
They rain and snow on everyone
He had a try out with the Sixers
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
And I know I did damage
What makes the world go round
Jackie ooh,
Cause love is a mystery
Strangers are singing
Can you forgive me for trying again
Silently sharing the same fears
That old blanket of sorrow
When I get home, I turn off the alarm
Standing in your shoes I turn
That it's harder to be friends than lovers
As she begs for her fish from the water
One day you'll be a sergeant major
That all you want is to find home
'This sun always sets again
I never needed you for judgement
Well don't stop calling, you're the reason I love losing sleep
For new bodies to haunt
Moody It's got me Mooday It's got me
tan faltos del aire
I lost my mind, I lost my life
I tell you I love you
Engine drivers headed north to Pleasant Street
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
I hope it's not as long as these country miles
Everything turns to shit
Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Well, you're just across the street, looks a mile to my feet
And the games we would play
And with her my heart, it disappeared
Hear the song our heart is beating to
And you know your reasons
Why does my soul feel so bad
I thought we were supposed to be
And I've had recurring nightmares
With all these fucked up things I did 
So tonight I'll sit and pick apart your pictures 
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
There's no song without love
Though your whole world has gone up into flames
Stay, stay and watch the coals
Across your carpet of stars
You hold the best you can,
No hero in her sky
They've hosed you down, you're good as new
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
Will you remember me
Her eyes were bright, tonight he finds her,
I prefer peace
An uneven trade for the real world
And I still hold your hand in mine
Nobody here
I should have known, my family they never did pretend
It will light up our way forever
Just looking for shelter from the cold and the pain
To try and save your swollen face
But they'll take mine
We fell asleep on Beaula's porch
Been inside many heads in different positions
To see those tiny tears in her eyes
PS I love you, too
Probably maybe, possibly love
I spent two years alone with you
Where'd it go to tonight the sun shall see its light
And I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross,
I cared for and loved
We never get so close to death, makes you so alive
I guess it was a lot
It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving,
But all the time, all the time
No one to get on
The sun's coming up
I never cared about God when life was sailin' on the calm,
Seeing my past to let it go
You could have one day of pure and simple happiness
Sometimes I feel I've had enough 
Is the monster you fear
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
Beats the hell out of mine here
When the night's so along
As I walked away, heard them say
The way we play
Miss you want you by my side
Hoping for a better day
I'd fill your every breath with meaning 
How this felt one year six months ago
But now she looks at you
The woodland spring has put the darkness from your thinking
Day follows day
My love A kiss goodbye before you leave
The windshield of your little car is frosted through the glass
Economysized dreams of hope
Before we were lovers I swear we were friends
You're the only one
Alison Krauss
Wishing one more time to face her
I found you before I drift away
But I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise above
Ten different ways to enjoy this night 
Lackadaisically so
And the people they come and go
Don't you take this away, I'm still wanting my face on your cheek
And, I want to speak these words
And I guess it's worth your time
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Another perfect day
Sometimes I'll meet you out there
Nothing unusual, nothing strange 
And here comes another panic attack oh
Meeting a man from the motor trade
Don't feel bad
Gotta take what you can these days
No one knows who's in control
I'm trying not to wonder where you are
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know 
You are the river 
All the nonsense that you just left but yet
Steal the pressure and the pain
And it may take some time to patch me up inside
I can think of younger days when living for my life
An empty house is not a home
The time always comes to slip away
I died the day you disappeared
I suffer the dreams of a world gone mad
Should've done something 
Come into my life
Between two hearts
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
It might not be something you would do
Walk me down your broken line 
I almost forgot who I was
Whenever you come around me
When the spring is cold
But no one asks the question why
To the long, winding road
Don't spend another night alone
Just wanna make this right
I hope it has a heart attack
I know how I lost a friend
I dig in this ocean and I try to fill it with gold
You listen for the truth
Of how I predicted my world
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
A monument to commemorate our time
And if it makes you cry, look ahead, dry your eyes
So my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read
Baby baby
You peel back the layers
And as the moon fades
As if it's hell down here
Before life began to tear us apart
Stepping in my heart
Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more ooh
She said it was in the singing and the strumming
I have heard the crying sound
Close my eyes
Every time the day darkens down and goes away pictures open in my head of me and you
Only when we get to see the aerial view
my days without you don't have nights, 
But for now we'll go on living separate lives
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
All head south, or what
To pull you from the liquid sky
Here comes Frank and poor old Jim
I've looked at clouds that way
I carry it on 
You're still a liar
The call to arms was never true
We drive tonight,
My head starts to sing
There's just a few things comin' my way this time around, now
And I can't sleep alone at night
I don't want to waste another day
Even if it's alone"
Is it time to let it bleed
As your skin starts a scratching
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
And moonlight would provide the spark
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
Like brothers on a hotel bed
And I'll never get to show you these songs
On this new spring morning
Am I the only one who feels ashamed
From those days
One lie short of true
May your smile May your smile
I've forgotten how good it could be
Showing all the things you hide
Should've said something 
Could not describe nightswimming
�Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough
Was the year I came up for trial
Number nine with my head on the bar
I lost myself in pain
'Cause I don't remember anymore
I don't care about what they say
It's not 'cause of you
Old men comprehend
And knows what all my imperfections are
Says she's here to waste time I said "That's fine"
At least I'll try
I will pack my bags just to stay in the corner of your heart
And I want to go home
If I thought of joining you
I know you wanna stay
If you ever come by here
That you love me
Let me rest in pieces, pieces
I know you feel the same
 months and  days ago
We'll welcome the New Age
And coming up only to show you're wrong
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
Loose change, bank notes, wearyeyed, dry throat
The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts
There's no one in sight
I will not run 
Why do things have to change
And now we're stuck on rewind
Hide inside me tonight
You thought you'd found her but she knew you all along
Look underneath the house there
This town is crazy
That's from the path that you made when you said your goodbye
Some love holds, some gets used
To float far away
Slowly I relive a better past
But I've still got me to be your open door
I turned it over in my mind
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
I got more sick
The hollow shoulder, across the waters
As for the clouds
Everybody cries
And a band of angels wrapped up in my heart
And anchor this lost soul
I heard the wind rustling through the trees and ghostly voices rose from the fields
But their callous words reveal
Where I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
All I have has left me gone
To someone I don't know
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything, but I got nothing here without you
And I wish I wrote you one original note
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
Here in my hands
I just want it back the way it was before
How can you hurt someone so much your supposed to care for
The story that 
All of the sun is gone away
You won't say the words
And brought me back to you
And I need you
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you I don't believe you
So take a deep breath and count back from ten
Thought you said you didn't feel pain
See more of your friends than you do your kids
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
I still maintain
It's hard to believe that I would let myself get so wrapped into you
But all his troubles on his mind
She doesn't want to feel this way
Nothing compares to you
Don't back down, there is nothing left
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
It rained for jewelry and for credit cards
I was there to comfort her
But my heart is overflowin' anyway
That you're relying on to lead you home
Uns Vertrauen gelieh'n
'Cause it's time that we'll tell this tale,
But now he's gone
I keep asking why I keep asking why
Mayfair mistress of the satellites
My hours are slumberless,
A cure for no real sickness, cross your hopes and die
And in the twilight of this hour
What did you tell me that I wanted to hear
So we raided their liquor stash and walked down to the riverside
The world in my hands
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles away
If I fall to his feet tonight
Lulling me to sleep
On a black I mile
Backhand, reversible roles
And I'm struggling to breathe
Run, run away
All the tizzy, fizzy idiot things must get done
A bruised full moon play fights with the stars
And it's dark in your room
From the corner of First and Amistad
The wind in my hair
You'll always be someone's baby
Out of the dark they carry my heart
It has me led to the backroom
And the rains poured down
Sitting back, looking at
Shadows are falling and I'm running out of breath
Honey I was just a kid
I feel the pain and it feels good
I will not pretend
But time doesn't matter to them yet
Hide and Seek Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth 
So she named the baby Elvis
A vacuum of sorrow to swallow up the day
And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth
A song to say
None of us are strangers anymore
I'll only make you cry
My heart is just too dark to care
Weil immer was geht
Lots of love, just keep it comin'
So I tried to intrude through the little holes in your veins
'Round my hometown
Heads out sometimes 
She says I'll wait for you like in '
But I look at this way 
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
As vicious as Roman rule
Is the fire of hesitation
I'm crying 
Can't help looking back
And it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
One day you'll see the clear blue
'Cause we'll hold each other soon
So I gave myself a few more days
Staring out into the world across the street
From my eyes, tonight I wanna cry
Why your father was so resigned
Thought of you as everything
And it starts, sometime around midnight
And now there's a robot that lives in my brain and he tells me what to do
It never goes away
And you may smile when you find that you've been wrong
What a mess I've made
And someone has to speak
And all I ever learned from love
And we're all under the upper hand
You show your kids the truth, hope they never lie
Afraid that I have made mistakes
Nananana, yeah, yeah
I look to my Eskimo friend
I won't fall behind
I know you're looking down from heaven
Time will never, never ever change it
No, I'm not crying
Lonely, own me nobody ever shut it down like you
Nothing to fear inside
But I can drive you home
Yes, I know I'll suit you someday
Many's the time I ran with you down
Give me a little fistful of love
I called the limousine company
Who they'll kiss before they get home
It felt great falling, great falling
And all the time I waste 
I've always been in love with you
Microphone
Unbreak my heart, sweet darlin'
"Build your castle, stop collecting stones
Walked back home to my place,
He made what became the world we know
Hello helicopter, will you be my friend
Out of time and I can't breathe
Better stop now before I start crying
I won't forget all that I've done
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter
She's mostly gone, some other place
I loved the footsteps that she made
These days, I haven't been sleeping
And it's true that I stole your lighter
And out into the morning
You said this hill looks far too steep
I thought I'd spend my last days holding your hand
You really got a hold on me
It is the evening of the day
Will you walk right up
What we both knew was true
And life 
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
Your hair, it's everywhere
How many times can I blow it all
And I hope you're thinking of me
I've got enough on my mind
I thought I'd drop you easily
I know what I've done, 'cause I know what I've seen
Remember how we used to dream
Things were all good yesterday
It is my time to make the most of it 
And I always find, yeah I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
Time can come and take away the pain
You'e not the only one to blame
You were born inside of a raindrop
Should've held my ground,
There is room beneath your bed for me
And I want to keep burning
I loved you all so
Never knew pain, never knew shame
I've been feeling, feeling for you, my love
So you build that wall build that wall
I heard from someone that you wish you could
Because I hold up the weight for the team
It feels like standing still but I know
And angels with their gray handshakes
You think of the past,
Has got to last us quite awhile
I was waiting, waiting to be found oh, no
And I was kinder
And when the night falls in around me
There's no one in the world who could replace you
I am falling 
Photos on the wall, she's my baby, she's my baby doll
You're gone 
No matter what they told you, you're not alone
Where have I been all the time
This of life I know is true
It seems that the winds have stopped
Who can spend the reflection that they see
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me
'Cause I had to say goodbye
And be with youooh
When we walked in fields of gold
The passion to find the utter truth
I know how you'll die
My riches can't buy everything
If it takes you forever, I want you to know
I don't want you to change
If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Before the last one
Well it's your hometown
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
What is gone is over
All the blossoms come sailing down
Doin' things I used to do
Heaven, heaven's bodies
On my weak body,
And that's what I've got to face
Think I'm goin' home
Feels like you're still there
Come sunrise, surprise surprise
Every time I ever cried from fear was just a mistake that I made
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Careful who you're talking to
Is leaving Never a thought for ourselves
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me,
Sallowskinned, starryeyed
I will look him in the eye
Let me fade into that pitchblack velvet night
To believe in something
Quote, hey listen 'cause I'll only say this once
And I just wanna stand outside
You are someone else, I am still right here
But she just hangs her head in pain
Oh, but even if I fall in love again
Pitch burning on a shining sheet
When you reached down to take my hand
I need
How do we call this love
And everything I held so dear
I'll cry on your shoulder
Knows he's gone
And now I know that love is dead
And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
That I will try but
I know what you want to say I know what you want to say
Long horses, we are born
You made an even call
How 'm I gonna keep myself away from me,
You were crying out
Wherever she may be
But you have your heart
without silvery moons, 
Yellow hair
These hands would not be taught to hold another's,
Every day like it's your last
The party gets boring 
I will bring you home
I could live in a different place
And they never came back
When they called you a hurricane thunderclap
And what do I say
There's something inside me that just won't allow me to
Changed my mind so much I can't even trust it
Let's slit our wrists and burn down something beautiful
Baby, won't you breathe
It's slipping away, there's nothing we can do
Fly away to someone new
You know, every minute someone dies 
If you've got visions of the past
Sunny days and rain
I wish we'd had a better goodbye
It's just a simple line
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts
I was wrong
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too; that shit was phat
And nobody nowhere understands anything
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
All the hell I put you through 
'Cause I have spent my whole life
She can't sleep at night
But everything's the same, this town is pitiful
I still don't know what love is
But the fool on the hill
So I'll sing this song for every word that's come out wrong
You send me to the path of nevermore
We gotta get out of here
When you love someone but it goes to waste
I'm far too comfortable this time 
What was your question I've got the answer
What seashell she is calling from across the world
We have nothing more to share
Friends we've been for so long
Don't you remember me, babe
And I fell asleep with you still talking to me
Once insecure about your scar but I think you got over it So right
Think not what the season will become
I won't regret saying this
And I pat your hair down 
Black sky will burn
Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
I remember a song
Bereft the weight of our summer clothes
So baby let go, got to let go
There's something here
They can't look me in the eye
I've got your letter I've got your letter, you've got my song
And the bird girls go to heaven 
I love you mom
Wait out the weather that howls in my brain
The things you once told me,
Hide my face, hide my face, can't let 'em see me crying
I keep holding on too tight
His boots no longer by my door, 
Crosses her fingers and follows behind
And both of us sentenced to time
I'll give you nothing else to do
I knew it was a dream right away
Clothes of sand have covered your face
First the glass, then the leaves that pass, then comes the snow
When you're dreaming with a broken heart
I want to change the world
Now there's red spray paint slashed on the wall
I need you in the world, my simple girl
Get it off right away
Goodbye to evening parties
Baby, I find it hard to breath
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
You'll show them your progress
From your fingers and your thumb
So take a look at me
I'll be marching through the morning
Girls, forgive my human mind
Instead I sleep
See the wind come to my eyes
That alright with you With you
Is anybody waiting at home,
In that event, she knew just what she would say
Is taking me home
We heard the rain on the window
And if you look at your reflection
And I'll see you when I get back
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
If you don't, if you don't love me
Rabid sleep through benediction
He starts with her back cause that's what he sees
Dreams that deny for all these years
Someone to talk to
It made us restless
Can't I stay an hour or two or more
He'll know all that has spoiled in your heart
Jacqueline was being such a big girl
Do you carry the moon in your womb
Lucky stars
So I'd hide yours with mine
Don't despair, you're there,
"I can take one thousand showers
So hard and to the point
So go on love, leave while there's still hope for escape
But I can't find enough of anything to drown out what you said
You're protected from trouble and pain
Sag mir was ist bloß um uns geschehn
The last time we slept together
And if it's alright I'll beg you
Just you sleep a little baby
We're older now, the light is dim
I love the things that you've given me
It's like forgetting the words to your favorite song
Hello from the other side
Oh you bloody
It doesn't matter if
Through the summer and the fall
And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone
The one that makes me seem to feel much taller than you are
As you turn,
And you can have this heart to break
Now the feelings are right where you saw
And when we got to New York everything felt right
Don't say you need me when
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed 
And free yourself at the same time
He's still up on that hill
Well you know that's a lie
The Lord made you to prove something
We can get right tanked up and and go home and have a fight
I was young and at home in bed
Something drove you down 
All you did you did with feeling
Pretty face, ugly mouth
I am displaced, I am displaced
Up to your door
No more his song, 
Too much time spent
We haven't had sore bits for about a fortnight
And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides and a dark wind blows
Lately I just can't seem to believe
To the lighthouse my friends
And I can't go back
I'm only here for awhile, but patience is not my style
'Cause baby time has changed nothing at all 
If you had a part of me, will you take your time
No matter where life takes me to
I remember how you used to say
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone
Making the world look gray and alone
Every night I rant, I plead, I beg him not to go
My mother said just keep your head
And all my life I never felt the tremor 
So the water's thickening 
Our feelings get greater
You are taller than a mountain
And I could liken you to a lot of things
I just want to hold you just because I can
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets,
It's time that I got moving on
And maybe get some sleep tonight
Frightening
No wind or waterfall could stall me
I waited for an hour, I finally gave up
Waiting for my phone to ring
For a second I was in control
The information's unavailable to the mortal man
There's no greater power
And all the friends that I was telling
Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
I ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on, I ain't nobody's crutch
We're closed to the earth 'til further notice
Went out, and had a church of kids
Somebody to die for
I wish you thought I was the reason you are in the world
It's that sorta thing that makes you think too much
Now I'm done with my coffee break
I'm thinking no yeah
How I'd love love love, to dance with my father again
And pain was the price you paid
And in the arms of endless anger
And though you have forgotten
It stung like a violent wind
And now I guessed I should've listened
But my brain knows better, it picks you up and turns you around
Throw it all away
All the things that I had to havelive
But I cleaned up my place like you so I could see things straight
I know you've fallen again
Of the murderous hand
My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
World was on fire and noone could save me but you
And she don't want to go outside tonight
Come alive, I've come alive
On closing doors
Beyond love
Trying to beat up the faults in my head
But no matter how hard I try 
But I will fight for you, be sure that
In a fleabag apartment
Oh she just couldn't believe it 
And no one
Tiny flickers in the night, always looking to be right
Two to one
If you say no then no it will be
Or maybe I even saw it coming
Why did you turn out the lights
How to feel
The only things that you really tried
It's called breakup
Oh don't try so hard
No perfect endings
After soakin' the body of Jesus Christ in blood
I won't see you tonight
Now, smell the rain of london, it still insists
Now I'm darker than the deepest sea
They call your name out loud and clear
And I always will
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
Stole the urn while they
It's a beautiful world we live in
I'll be everything you need
How can you just walk away from me
And I drove all night to find my child
Just the sweet pain of watching your back as you walk
Oh but I know love as a caging thing
Mr False Pretense, you don't make sense, I just don't know you
Screaming out your bloody orders
I found it there today
And those of us with ravaged faces
Just because
Never thought I'd fall so hard
Cause it will come back to you
It's not the storm before the calm
Yes, I still remember every whispered word
Outside the world wages its rewards, I'll rest in peace as long as you know
A voice is calling,
I've done enough
And read my lips
Everybody hurts sometimes
I'll take a quiet life
Keep my love as light as a feather
Maybe then you'd know how I feel 
And I wish that we could see if we could be something
For the rest of your life when you're ready
We walked the  blocks to the middle
'Cause I'm still alone in my mind
Oh I wish, I wish you could have stayed
I have seen what I choose and I've seen what I need
All the fires of destruction are still burnin' in my dreams
When I see them try to fly
For the windless breezes
Are you sure what side you're on
How there is light in the river
I lay down on my bed and fell into a deep sleep
You never see my bleeding heart
You took everything but it left you empty
They will come, they will go, make us special
This life could be the last 
And did you think you could just take it all away
And now my family is one again,
We've been around on the side
Yeah, you were right about me
Please look at me, oh please look at me, my love
A carried aloft by a parachute in June
To die and to keep silent
When people run in circles it's a very, very mad world
But my mother does
And there is a barber, who's cutting and cutting away at my only joy
The only love I've known is a chimney sweep
I'm just hoping you're not seeing his face
You're my sweetest
We could get a house and some boxes on the lawn
Subway, she is a porno
A head hung halfmast 
I wanna see looking right at me
And the eyes in his head
In your regret that sounds absurd
Midnight's calling 
So where'd the years go
Maybe if I don't cry
We can't even look into our eyes
I will tell them of your ghost like a thing that never, ever was
She's my angel
Do you ever get lonely
Words long gone
For all that you've done
I hope, I love you all my life
Will you say when I'm gone away
I'm just asking you to hear me
You turn every head but you don't see me
And where are you when I need you around
Oh I need you to turn me over
You've always been there, you're always been
Until I can see nothing at all;
Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden
Here we stand, there's nothing left for you
And I'll tell Saint Pete I can't come in
While whispering those words
Hold on tight, hold on tight
What my mind has seen
Dead men lying on the bottom of the grave
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
Get me through Grey Gardens tonight
A new improved version of me
Let's hear what you think of me now but baby, don't look up
As the day begins
The day you went away
And then the guns rang one last shot 
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
I close my eyes and disappear tonight
She lives with a broken man
Now that I've really got a chance
But I won't lose no sleep on that
You make me feel like I am fun again
And they were all born pretty in New York City tonight
Burn up the pain, my thoughts are strange
Then you at his house
I remember watching as you slowly loaded up the loom
Your ship may be coming in
Your head 'round the door 
If you don't love me
I've made a commitment
Carry her, my angel
Our world under command
Do you want to go with me tonight
Given you a reason to stay
In a place where no one knows what we have done
Say goodbye to Ruby's arms
I was never, no, I was never, no
And we can sup on summer skies
We'll shoot to kill, and kill your lover
I try to see but I'm blinded by the white light 
Paris or maybe hell
Like I have something to give
You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down
We are anticithere it is There it is
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
I just can't wait to get back home
Among the trees and by the river
Do I stay or do I go
'Cause these nights I think maybe that I miss you in my living room 
Turn my head
When each and every angry word
But I feel too sad
Nothing's the same when you give it away
They fell through my hands, on me
But I need someone different
Her name was Naomi
When we're together, I feel perfect
Haven't they heard we won the war
I fell in love and I needed a road map
And the wind makes them groan
I miss the way the sunshine would light up your face
So I'm embedded in the frost
Like a little clock that trembles on the edge of the hour
And all I need is
I pushed her away
That's because I am
Getting through a Sunday
Meet me out for coffee, where we'll talk about it all
Something separates me from other people
But I knew her too well
Don't give away the end, the one thing that stays mine
Oh my dreams come back to me, back to me, back to
So overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form
And show you the way to go
This sick, strange darkness
Regress into a dream
And I'm not my body 
Right here by my side
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Und das war unsre
Oh my mother, she betrayed us, but my father loved and bathed us 
And I'll be gone and I'll be gone
This is the part of me that wishes it was with it
I'd hate to intrude
The shattered surface, so imperfect, is all that you believe
Me, I don't show much
I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
Others said it must have been the weather
On her Nishiki, it's out of time
Better sell it while you can
The cake has grown mold but the memories are sweet
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
Or change the fate of two
I sat down, got a fat frown
Choking on the thought of leaving
I'm getting by in other ways
But still I don't know why, no I don't know why
But if you take that train under water
Could have me feeling the way I do
He's all over primetime news
You can see it everywhere you look
It's cruel, somehow
Two points for honesty
Your mouth should be working for me
The window sill
It feels like I'm looking at life 
I didn't feel angry or depressed, I didn't feel anything at all
And you know I see right through you
Below the tamaracks he is crying
Pipework  I lay it down for the
Trains derail
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
Before our innocence was lost
See the storm is broken
And it's turning in hours
I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
By the moon on rocks collected
Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
Says what's up, where've you been, is something wrong
Show me something ugly and show me something pretty
Don't believe it, and you will find it
The Friday night charades of youth
We're afraid to be alone
But sometimes a someone is so hard to find
Can turn all your colours to white
I don't need words
Put it up too much to call home
Although the summer's past, those mythic dreams would never last
You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
This is never ending, we have been here before
Feel the hollowness inside of your heart
It's four in the morning, the bars are unloading
But I'm not too good at that shit
Fifties, baby doll dress for my "I do"
Maybe I played my cards wrong
And cry on my shoulder
I keep coming back here where everything slipped, ah
Confessantly, this is the first time I've loved you
And he's talking to me
Purple kiss of stardust
You'll start to wonder
I'll be alright when my hands get warm
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
He's looking right through me
Que tu comprendras
There's nothing left here to pretend
Changed in an easy chair
And the young man's dream was almost seen so plain
And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
Once he was a lover sleeping with another
And all these places we went to see sights just gave them excuses into the game
Things your body wasn't meant to
To rid the disease
Give me a million reasons
Ah yeah
My Konstantine came walking down the stairs 
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You lost the love I loved the most
For the rest of my life
If you take him back 
If he had've stayed you might understand,
I'm gonna do another I think Yeah, one more, these are shit
Once in a while, when it's good
No one knows you, till it's over
My heart will be unbroken
Now the part is through
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing  on the freeway
I've got something in my throat
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
Scattered yesterdays, the past is far away
If I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
You and me alone
They say life carries on, and on, and on
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
And I saw your hand
From this situation laden with hearsay
I know you got history
I'm turning my cell off, just to breath
He told me to close my eyes
Your skull outside that wall 
They never wanna hear you say
The quiet voice she gave him
Perfect blue buildings, oh,
And all of those birds
So holy light shines on the things you have done
I'm scared
We really wanna know beyond love
I'm not a film star beauty, I'll send a photograph
It's a dizzy hot and just damn forgot
Call out your name
But you're all smiles
Settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends
I guess it's high time you found out
In my dreams I can see you
'Cause I'm not big enough to house this crowd
And, Martha, all I had was you and all you had was me
If all the statues in the world
And my father locks the car by the store
I still look for your face in the crowd
It's getting to the point where I can be myself again
And as our eyes start to close
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
He's got lines on his face they tell the story of his pain
Cold You broke me from the very first night 
Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me
But I need you
The spinning top made a sound like a train across the valley 
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
Some search, never finding a way
You've got one hour
Already I'm so lonesome I could die
What's the time, seems it's already morning
I cry for less attention
Is pouring out to rest
I was just guessing
Returning as if dream
To pay me and the one I love
Is the same kind of scars
So I try
You just stand there in the glass looking at me
Our love is broken
Thinking 'bout the good times
There's just too much that time cannot erase
Bring him home again
A curly headed darkeyed boy
"Son, your life's an open book
For the first time, there is no mercy in your eyes
Mutual misunderstanding
Believe it doesn't hurt
Found the lake was wet
Shuffling days and Lonesome nights
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
I died in my dreams
Solid gold now, nothing's gonna stop us
I've got what it takes
Singing I never meant to cause you trouble
Girl you got to let him know
She coulda been a movie star Oh no
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
Hold on to myself and don't look back
In the morning I'll call you
Autumn's hue in those sad eyes
Sewer line touches the edge of the suburbs
Felt like a lifetime
But there's a lot of feelings that still remain after you were gone
Or dashed to bits on the reef
You hated that, didn't you, didn't you
When his dreams are running wild
I'm tired of calling you, missing you, dreaming I've slept with you
Ev'ry night I just wanna go out
Still with eyes meeting
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
But I�m still hoping for a change of heart
Worse than the fear it's the lie you told a thousand times before
She's looking for a new beginning every day
I won't try to take the sadness from those eyes that I love
To make a trap for fools
From my own true love lost at sea, lost at sea
Tell me I was wrong
If I only could, be running up that hill
Some words are best unspoken
No one's laughing at God when it's gotten real late
Made of gold and silk, Arabian thread
But it�s gone
A man can be happy with the weather
Bittersweet
But the sun will always rise
She tends to faint at the sound of a drum
There were many invitations
The words that were spoken
Never tell the one you love
And I'm lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
Falls on the round toes
I'm not an addict, maybe that's a lie
My hearts a tiny blood clot
Because the hardest thing is never
So use your chemicals and take this to your grave, 
Defile my life
Can you stop the fire
The bathroom stall
Advance the tallowcolored walleyed deer
Still I must obey, still I must invite
Your voice is soft like summer rain
Believe in you, believe in me, we're meant to be together
I know they say you can't go home again
I return
Or sells love to another man
All the battlements are empty
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
Be still oh rusting river
Is there a chance
Go a little bit suburban and go crazy
My heart had a crash when we spoke
Oh could I be the sky on the fourth of July
And this time we spent together
I watch your eyes
Don't look back 'cause I am crying
I, I can't take things slowly
I need to get paid
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light, that shines on me,
And telephones, they can't replace
We've been alone too long
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else
Oh, I love you
Through myself and back again, where I don't know
Oh I wish, I wish, I wish I was born a man
I say, where are you now
They say that promises
Nothing much happened all the same
Got no resolutions, no clever anecdotes to say
And my skin is clear and you can see what I'm thinking
I'm never sad like we were sad
How can you love me if you don't love yourself
I want you here tonight, want you here
And I just blame everything on you
The caravan comes back for me
A blanket, some matches, this pain in my chest
The dream is on
Borrowed house for a borrowed crime
Still a little hard to say what's going on
Who's the loser now
And throw a living past away
Take my pain away
And breathe me
From the work of sorrow
Is a mind that knows much more
But even without hope
I thought I was someone else
The colored birds above their running
All those sorrys, we can't go back to the start
Some say I'm crazy for my love
But I was happy to explain
Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
Still the sun can't warm my face
I'll try to put a word in for you
Watching all the world inwar torn
Four will love you so much
I'm far away from home
Ever found a way to say to you
And in that town there's
When they saw that the explosives in the cargo hold
Flames fell into orbit
Around here
Is made up on your side
Nothing will stand
We'll throw these books In the fire
But if you fall and take a tumble 
And all I am, all I have doesn't even matter now
I believe in you, and I don't really give a damn
And I'm tired of justifying, so I say to you
Repress and restrain
I picked up the song and found my picture in the paper
I won't let this happen to my children
If my stone face cracks again
Here in my hands now 
It was so like you to visit me
Tell you I'm sorry
Do you read what they're saying about you
And it's your final last call
That won't ever come
I will steal away out through your blinds
Somehow it feels so familiar
It takes the pain away
And managed to slip through 
And how you held me in your arms that September night
'Cause we lost it all, and nothing lasts forever
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Fire and rain, now
All around the frightened trapeze swingers
Why wasn't God listening
The only girl he'd ever love
And sit here cold
Shoot me to the ground
Not feel scared
Even new wine, served in old skins
Oh, hate it
It illuminates your sleeping skin
This is the part of me that thinks that ants are cavemen
Everything short of "I love you"
Take my money, take my wallet, take my credit cards
Just tell me why you had to go back
Will the rain wash away
And I watched you falling to your death
And you're so independent
Do I get the gold chariot
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was "love"
Disappeared without a trace
You can watch the sunset from the bed 
Because I learned, I learned to be alone
You can tell me, I can handle it
From the way you talk
Some ghastly predicament of mine you'll find
She, a punk who rarely ever took advice
My curly hair and a voting booth
I'll take the fall, fall for you
But no one saw,
I hope the fences we mended
While the whole world turns the other way
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
Haunting yourself as the real thing
As I wander through this night all alone
Let it flood right through the houses 
It's hanging around aloofly for a while
With the fucking phone
You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted,
And promises are sweet
And his woman is free
She always loved the sound of your strum
Don't waste your time on me 
Stephanie says Stephanie says when answering the phone answering the phone
To change the names
Oh I love you oh
I knew that something was wrong
Faded like your name on those jeans that I burned
But I'm not the one if we're honest, yeah
Got the skin and the bones
I know just what you're saying
Of falling out of your mouth
We know to fear what others fear
Think I'll get a lover
But there's someone that I've been missin'
Never let the summer catch you down
There's nothing you want me to do
You have come to save me
Praising every moment because you're my only light
One by one you can cage them in your freedom
S'efface de mon souvenir
At the ankles of our fear
And I used to talk
Twentyone is such a good number
Being a mistress on the side
She was nobody's wife
Well it's an Assisi lie
What you truly wanted to become 
I got all my fives
I realize I made a mistake
Well I guess I'll go home now
God would they vomit and run 
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
And we are still alive
Waiting to light
But I know that that wont come true
With her darkest secret safely packed away 
They can come and tear my house down
May no man's touch ever tame
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
When my father runs undressed
But I won't be home again
Go wait in the car
Oh, sometimes love is intoxicating
I cried a little bit, you died a little bit
In a wave you say goodbye
That's taken its place
Had no one never
Even though I'm not her minder
Ah, what did you think
Is this the feeling I need to walk with Tell me why
Find that all these funny faces look the same
Kiss my falling knee 
Couldn't save you from the start
You say it's a good thing
Look lovely look lovely
Now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
Guess it's clear he's gone
And when no hope was left in sight
To the people who you met
You'd think after  years I'd be used to the spin
Before you kiss me you should know 
I promise baby, one day I'll come back to you
But now I guess it's just too late
As I turn out the light
I know this song
Wish I could learn to let this sleeping dog die
They call her name at seventhirty
That this would come to an end
Yeah, I get lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
Please keep your hands down, and stop raising your voice
Can't forgive, sorry to say
Of father can't you see the pieces that have fallen on the ground
I know you didn't bring me out here to drown
What we need
Last night I had a dream that I was in the graveyard
And now, I guess,
Water, water on the seeds
Sleep alone tonight
What's a game of chance to you to him is one of real skill
I'd love to believe it's all about love for a child
You're so endearing, you're so beautiful, 
We don't have to sit here in silence
Eager to wet the paper heart of children birds
And without a sound, without a sound
And with my Xray eyes I strip you naked
Just look at who I have become I am so ashamed
It's just like being alone
Tell me everything that happened
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
Spinning me around once more
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Living, inside you play
You are mine
'Cause it's time that will tell if it's heaven, if its hell
I had news to give the wind
If you don't listen to me while I talk to the wall
Walking in that room when you had tubes in your arms
Little white flowers will
On that starry, starry night
Exquisite music Alexandra laughing
Another day will dawn
All of a sudden it's cold and we're falling apart
Take me in your warm embrace
And always is this
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
Turn around and see me cry
You know that you are not alone
And then they went on to say that the pearly gates
Do you still remember how we used to be
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
My mama went off and left him
Shatter in the blink of an eye
And in my eyes, your smile
You've been waiting a long time
He told me he was sorry and everything has changed
Oh, so weak in this need for you
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Lift me back up to the sun
Now you sit there thinking feeling insecure
Pay your money, baby
Nature has its own religion, gospel from the land
But at the end of my life
Upon my face we leave no trace
Forget past indiscretions and stolen possessions 
Where is someone
My heart don't beat like before
Just give me a sign, there's an end with a beginning
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening
There's nothing left to salvage
You've done me no favor
And cause each other pain
It's all I really need to make me stay
They scandalize my name
And I know I can be self righteous
Nothing wrong, nothing right
And I'll follow you into the dark
A quiet picture drawn each day before it ends
In a very sad, sad zoo
While he's roaring and biting, I wash off the mud
They fed us on little white lies
And I don't want this world to shine
Up against the fire, don't feel any heat
In the night we fight, I fled you're right
Alone without you by my side
Lying here in your warm embrace
Well, darling you may do your worst
Did you know I kept all of your pictures
Come on baby, now throw me a right to the chin
We're backdrifters
Blankets wrapped and drifting off to sleep
This family's breaking down
A warm December with you
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you
Take my hand and we can outrun time
You know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
You're givin' me a million reasons
All the things I should've given
As your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet
But I don't wanna fight anymore,
But tonight you're on my mind so you'll never know
What the hell do you want
This is my plan, run away as fast as you can
Way home
Here in line where stupid shit collides
Army dreamers, ooh
To the vines and no one saw it
A mutual friend's parents left town for a week
Open heart, open heart, it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart,
Beside my window
When you said that we could make it through whatever, ever
I had the feeling that those looks you gave me were real 
But you may lose me here
Oh the person
Home We gave her everything money could buy
And just to taste your lips
You were talking so brave and so sweet
He wasn't fighting anybody when he was on a shelf
And if I don't come back
I don't love you and I never will
I'll be the one, if you want me to
You told me you loved me
To take a little nap while the road is straight
But how many times can I walk away
That's the sight and that's the sound of it
If I can call you, and tell you I care
You're life is not your own
Your eyes forever glued to mine 
You got a playboy mommy
The fact that I can't deal
Friends go floating gently by
Wounded warriors took her song away
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
I remember shooting stars, the walk we took that night
A very violent flight
I hate everything
Oh, lover, you should've come over
Fluorescent lighting sets the scene
All the ones I've loved calling out my name
You're the one that I love
I know I can't take one more step towards you
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
But if you never try you'll never know
Once there was a man, who had a little too much time on his hands
But the words don't fit the mouth
The shadow in the background of the morgue
Saying goodbye this time, the same old story
What kind of way is that to treat your wife
I feel all alone in a crowded room,
Left the only worries I had in my hands
And when you're no longer searching for beauty or love
I'm gonna be your friend
But so's another line
We can't outrun the past
Has anybody ever told you it's not coming true
Seasons change in a gothic way
"And it's so cold, it's like the cold like you were dead"
So if someone could see me now
At seventeen I learned the truth
With your inlays of mother of pearl
Let me run
Oohdon't wanna try no more
To say goodbye, nice try
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line 
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do
You cut your hair, we never saw you again
And there's nothing I can do to keep
If you really want hell, hell
Drink up sweet decadence
Tuck the whole thing
I hate coming to the entrance, just to get bars on my phone,
When you abuse the one you love
And I love my sister, Lord knows how I've missed her
whatcha say
We've been around when he gets high
The boy that you loved
When life was new and it was fun
We'd forgotten one another
That you used to love
When the bird has flown
I am your whore, without a name
I think sometimes you forget where the heart is
Sometimes honey, it just takes someone else
Takes me wandering through the street
Lit through the darkness at one fiftyeight
Are running out of time
"Hold me like this for a hundred thousand million days"
Well you don't mind me being headstrong
I jump to the sky for my people
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Run run run run to me
When the waves
Oh and you see everything in red
Words that scream and bounce right back
I wish I'd never seen your face
Left my heart out to bake
Shakin' dust from my shoes
And lives that were over before they were spent
I just hope it's worth the fight
Come on, baby
Run an electric shock to my brain
Oh lover you should've come over
And that'll be me someday
And shake my rattled bone
On a bad day, looking for the great escape,
Underneath the sky that's ever falling down, down, down
Keep on aching the same heartbreak
The demons in your head
Everyone has their obsession
In a tight little world
My heart, I wear you down, I know
Jasmine, I saw you peeping
My love for you's so overpowering 
There were sounds in my head
Give me a fistful of love
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
Impossible things
Steam from a cup and snow on the path
Now that everyone's an enemy
Am I the only one here today
Sleep may be the enemy
None of it was planned
Happiness ahit her like a bullet in the back
The birth of a child in the form of a man 
All I know is I'm sick of everything that my money can buy
And kiss your face just so you know
We'll leave our sins within the carpet twine
You say we have turned
Out here forever
Well I held you like a lover
Won't you be the new one Burn to shine 
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
She said she won the world at a carnival
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
It's gonna be all right
If you feel like you're alone
'Cause this'll be our last time
Or my heartbeat slow
I wish nothing but the best for you 
To make a better life
With her hand in your head
Papa was a rodeo 
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time I push my pride away
To say the least, I'd thought I'd seen them all
And this song's my sorry 
You look so fine
You gotta help me make a stand
It steers the whole ship
Diaries left with cryptic entries
Find a place where you can see
Here I'm thin between darkness and light
I can't break through your world
Or just hold on to love
I lie to my heart 'cause I thought you felt it
Of loving someone so much that you need
This day's a spinning circus on a wheel
I've promised to send out for you 
Yesterday you asked me to write you a pleasant song
Keep dodging lights
We as people are just walking round
Still I don't understand
Or he'll say he's just not the same
Everything gets smaller now the further that I go
This time to face the day
I wasn't shopping for a doll
Staring into glassy eyes, mesmerized
Plastic, go back to being plastic
Just the memory of your face
I thought you'd ask me not to leave
It's not over till you start again
How can I give love when love is something I ain't never had
I've finished kissing my death
Keep an eye on my back
Misty sorrow swoop unbound
Then we will never die
If you never say what you feel, feel
There is nothing left to do but sleep
Down, the flames of hell they give me hope, I drown
Stop this train
All you maggots
Any names, faces, or lines,
I've been dreaming about you and only you
'Cause we were all so young and foolish, now we are mature
Won't come your way, yeah 
My father would lift me high
But I waste, more time than anyone
But maybe I'm just too young to keep good love
It's like a movie playing over in my head
Wish I could go back and change these years
Or in a holy wall of fire
Man that kid made fucking up look cool
All hail the heartbreaker
And I want for you to be a good man
'Cause I can feel it crawl beneath my skin
There's nothing here that you'll miss
But for these past few days
So do it with your mouth open
It's a cruel thing you'll never know all the ways I tried
How I wish I could surrender my soul
yet etched in cold
There are no candles in here
Tell me lies, slap me on the face, just
Knowledge is a deadly friend if no one sets the rules
But if you're trying to break my heart
He's lost in the rain
I'll be staring at the sky
Respectful to his mother
They come and go
Now his part is over
Days when I can still feel alive
I don't wanna be without you baby
And I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive
And there's no one allowed in
Fly away 
Near our bodies unexpected
Come let away, that's what they all do
I think I got them all
Slightly bemused by the total rejection
Trouble, oh, trouble can't you see
No one, what's your history What's your history
I'm gonna be alright
When you're drinking by candlelight 
Don't turn around and see if I'm crying
The DJ was the last to leave
Know they're right, and have done it right, could I get to be like that
Your face has faded but lingers on
Didn't seem so bad until I knew
And things have seem to changed
Our little army boy
Make sure I know who's taking you home
Little bit of love, love, I feel as if I'm wastin'
The confessions of a broken heart
If my heart's soaking wet
Hard to find a new soul, as silence takes it's toll
I kissed your mouth and back
Although we need each other, things have changed  it's not the same
A guiltless twisted lie
I'm not made of successful things
And I carry the weight of the world on my shoulders
And return her to the harbor where she goes to bed
And I am alone
I've got the one of you in that dancing dress
Of that leak in my soul
Mmm that it's just what we need You decided this
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
Yeah we'll share our fears 
Some simple thing that I've done
When you were an island to discover
Open your parachute and grab your gun, falling down like an omen, a setting sun
Cold wives and Sunday papers
I found those pictures I took
It's a match made in heaven
Yeah, I know you care
If you were here beside me instead of in New York
But I'm just a ghost
Unknown the unlit world of old
Mommy won't stop crying
Maybe I didn't realize
Your fingertips across my skin
A prayer gone blind
You look so beautiful tonight
Oh, my god
Stillborn the trust in you I have lost all trust I had in you 
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
Although my heart is breaking
Why's love gotta be so tough
And when it's done oning it's just on some more
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
What you got
Only ever calling out, "Cuckoo"
Between the trees and the pond, you put your hand in mine
How your promises rang hollow
She'd been there with a fixed stare
The morning will come
We're afraid of everyone
That I would be loved, even when I was fuming
I mean it's always never like this
No one laughs at God when their airplane starts to uncontrollably shake
Four score years, living down in this rainswept town
But your footsteps give you away
I know a ghost can walk through the wall
Until today
Try not to care
And that's you, baby
I wish that I could cry
Think no more about it 'cause I couldn't find it in you
She had seen her own body outlined in chalk
Hell bound Airlines, time and price
The smoke, it sank into my skin
Shadow on the things you know
Make no difference what you say
It's aimed at you, baby, baby
To carry home my little soldier
And if you can't tell; I'm scared as hell
No they're a part of me
Just to be over this, back to another one
Cracked eggs, dead birds scream as they fight for life
And well, try so bad to tell me that you
'Cause it's been forty years or more, now, Martha, please recall
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
Don't make your home out in the snow
Into his side
I'd be the father of your child
That the young man came
Call up on Geezers to rid these green trees
And the jokes, they're always bad
Than I did before
Tell me, what did you do, what did you do the last time, why don't you do that
I'm falling over
There was no chance of us at all
And somehow I knew you would leave me
The man who isn't me
Like the time we thought was made for you
I have seen your face and it's too much, too much for me
A little bit of heaven but a little bit of hell
Time's tide will smother you
I didn't mean to hurt you
And you'll grab that piece of gold
Near me, touch me, feel me
I think I need to change my attitude 
But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend
So take a look at me now
And though I may have lost my way
Something's been missing
Pick your favorite shade of black
Oh, mine has learned to kill
So I'm feeling used
Just like in a storybook
You gave up the fight
All the deer despair
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Wish the clock had no hand
But still I chase
And this ship went down in sight of land
Did you know how you would move us, did you know
And every time you overdose
Now, I'm coming home, on my back
She was eleven years old
Don't you know she's got a yes, she is
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
For something to believe in
Crumpled and puffy faced
Just turn the music up
They say I'm better off now than I ever was with her
They want you or they don't say yes
Can you feel my trigger hand, moving further down your back
And the feeling still remains
Honey won't you hold me tight Honey won't you hold me tight
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Where you should be, no one's around
'Cause there's no one left for us to blame
Well, winter's gonna end,
And I know it's out of love
So why'd you fill my sorrow
You took advantage of a world that loved you well
Empty glass
You, I thought I knew you
And now the old flames will pass away
'Don't end my life your all I need and darlin' I will never leave never leave'
But to take on the world at all angles
Bodies rest in motion, fighting night and day
Was just like her scuba day
Fighting back the rush of emotions
I've done it again, another number for your notes
And I'm still alive
Somedays I hate everything
And now, it's time
They sing in the rain
Turns whole to half
Who restrains
I believed I was strong
You're gone away
But I don't make you lonely
Cause it ain't like it was on back in those days
The sun gives her no mercy
And anyone who wanted to could contact me
Pulling me closer, pushing away at me
For me to have to walk away
Your eyes were on the living room, your eyes were on the closet
Please don't walk away, Please don't leave
Steal my love, steal my kisses
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
A light that might give up the way
Out of every sorrow
To keep good love from going wrong
Lighting the darkness of my soul
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
No one's laughing at God when they see the one they love
And my eyes are bursting hearts
Last night your shadows scampered up the wall
And on the autumn leaves that fall
I was stone, stone, stone in love with you
Believe you're gone
I guess it's true  cannot live without you;
What am I sayin' here
That if I lived till I could no longer climb my stairs
Will you miss me when I'm gone
I'll use your light to guide the way
When I was three, three maybe four
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
'Cause in the end I'm a sensible girl
When it was dark, I saw shapes
You know it don't mean shit 
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Outside
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
But I'll try to leave behind some days
For the wind to carry me free 
Never do change
My brother would remember sitting in the hallway
It's no sacrifice
Where the sailors' sorry racket falls for maidenhead
Every time you say you're learning
And I am helpless sometimes, wishing's just no good
Where the Iceman's mule is parked outside the bar
We will be right by your side
I'll be leaving on a train
Did he die for us, did he die at all
We seem to never end 
Can you please stop time
Know even less than what they say
It's taken me a long time
It's nothing to cry about
I don't need
Brutal wind of snowy harlot
No footsteps on the ground
But he washed me shore and he took my pearl
The roar of the Forth road bridge
Made my mistakes, let you down
Please say you didn't die
Now that we are apart
It can make you feel like you've gone crazy
We might kiss
Our minds are empty, grave as well as
Under your thumb, I can't breathe
Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Not the foolish, not the wise
I see some flowers on a hillside
Nobody gives a damn about me or anybody else
All these years gone by
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
All of these ghost towns I keep traveling through
Been walkin' my mind to an easy time
I can move on with you around
The darkness that has been
'Cause my feelings never change a bit
And it looks like I'm burning it down
Was he everything I'm not
Älä käsilläsi  Not with your hands
And something slow
Souls escape fire
I hope you're not lonely without me
There's a hope 
To cold wind
Oh, you couldn't face the freedom on your own
Ist es egal geworden was mit uns passiert
Or when the crazies say 'He hates us'
The names
Now there's flowers in your window
Turned me away so many times
In red, blue, green
Try this figure out memorize their words for hope
For the way some people are
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather
My heart feels so still
A lie to run
This shadow suits me well
I never thought I would say this
We're all in tears for the world is broken
Been so long since I seen your face
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
Should've done something
I am the spring, love is blossoming
I will turn the rooftop inside out 
My sweet prince, you are the one My sweet prince, you are the one
When you try your best but you don't succeed
Frost killing hour
But for the surplus that loves, what's to become of us
Nothin' always comes to mind
With eyes lowered
In the crowds of all the people
I was on your porch last night
You will never stay in my home, on my way
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
If I'm alone I cannot hate
Leave them to rule in hollow point hell
Do everything you did
The only thing I'm taking is
Turning the sign around
Doesn't matter where she is tonight
And if you take him home 
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Won't you take me by the hand
I can't stand another fight
Don't you know she's got a
If you set me free I will not run 
Sometimes I wonder what might
I'm gonna give you only one reply
And I don't know how I'mma manage
You're everything I thought you never were
Just remember what I told ya
Will I ever see your sweet return
As they flew past
 minutes, a blink of an eye
Like the one that fell that I am now underneath
All of these stars will guide us home
We turn onto our backs and see
I need to stay afloat When nobody's around
But now they only block the sun
I never really dreamed of heaven much
And look no further for happiness
Wash the stains away
Somebody who gave a damn, somebody more like myself
My dear Johnny, my dear friend
Leave me when you cry
Hello, hello there, is this Martha This is old Tom Frost
Work it, work it baby
'Cause I want you to stay with me
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
This is me, baby
I'm gonna search for someone just like you
So this time don't think it's a lie
We never knew what friends we had
I awake so alone
How can you stop the rain from falling down
There'll be no last chance to promise to never mess it up again
Got turned around
I needed fulfillment
Stars so close you can reach out and kiss one
To yesterday
And every time I see you in my dreams 
This gnarled, weird face
I don't know anything about her
I shared my body and my mind with you
Translates by tone
And I hope you feel better
I can't write a song for you
So good luck to you on your way
And all the things your money can't buy
So darling if you love me
Is fading away like tears in the rain
Baby, I love you and all that I want you to do
But I just had no intention of living this way
I'm throwing away pictures
What my night was coming to 
We had change of the moon
That keep me alive on this January night
To bear to hear the truth that you have spoken
I came down over the sleepy mountains where
So you've got a playboy mommy
Sometimes darling, you just need someone else
And put nightmares in your hands
How do you turn what the savage tame
Rather waste some time with you
Wasn't it written all over my face, yeah
nor traces of the sun, 
If you feel discouraged when there's a lack of color here
Crawl into the dark
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
I'm sad not sorry 'bout the way that things went
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Need your light
It's a shame we're all dying
I've been out walking
And under red lights, I'll show myself it wasn't forged
And I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose
When you say that it's gonna be
No, I'm not sorry and I do detest you 
Millions of rolling eyes that still cling to me
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
The drunk kids, the catholics
Or with whoever she spends her time
Imagine us combined light up the room electrify
'Cause I've got a plan
She wears her tears on her blouse Confused and racked with selfdoubt
And if I chose to walk away, would you be right here waiting
Take my tortured heart by the hand
And those whose names were never called
'Cause my mind has lost direction
Hand in hand, I'll show you the way
And never lets it show
And you, you bring me to my knees, again
Of the sun on the steeple
Lord please lift his soul and heal this hurt"
I had not forgotten them
Trying to break your fall
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
How I wonder where you are
Look for the rainbow in every storm
I got tired of it day after day, after day
Both singing along, yeah arm in arm
Push people x
I'm pining for the moon
And it's so hard to do, and so easy to say
In my life, I've loved them all
I try to call but I don't know what to tell you
Take a chance if you should go
And the rushing wolverine flies past
Leave me alone
I cannot drive the streets at night
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
While they are in each other's arms"
All I feel all I feel
Or only one way that it was always meant to be be
God only knows what we're fighting for
And I'm staring at the moon
She told me that you made some money
My face is all wet
Yeah I'm weeping warm honey and milk 
Don't lose your selfish ways over me
Carve the way for your pride
Baby, I die every night, every time
On the floor, at the great divide
I need someone different
It just don't seem right
They were boys with their cars
So many things I wanna know the answers to
That the end of the century 
We've still got time
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Babies turn blue when they're ignored
Where I feel your fingers have been 
Lookin' to find a way through the day
Can make a good man turn bad
Will love Aladdin Sane
We will walk in fields of gold
When your day is long
Much too blind to see the damage he's done
With my dead imagination while you're with some other man
I can tell somehow
Oh, what have I got to do to be heard
But as long as there's a road
Somedays aren't yours at all
Cold skin and bones and this latitude we ain't payin' until the heat comes through
Till the light comes pouring through
And nothing like I thought you could've been
Isn't someone missing me"
And left a bleeding part of me
I will love you till I die
They're waiting for something
And I'm sleeping in your living room 
Baby, I'll love you to death, I guess that's what you get
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memory
All the silly frilly things have to first get done
Where are we fucking going
But some things remain
You, you're the lonely one
I will not leave you all aone
Flashback
It must be for real, 'cause now I can feel
In the living room, the living room,
And I fell apart but got back up again 
I've checked the phone, no messages on
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
So, you're leaving, aren't you
So boredom captured another fool 
While you're sleeping with your pride
With dying shooting stars
Spirit falls from grace
When it hurts so bad, sometimes
Every option I have costs more than I've got
In your name in your name I find meaning
'Cause I can't say no
And he's all that I need to fall into
Or will we leave each other alone like this
No you will not be alone then
Been throught a million kicks looking for the one that sticks
Fireworks and hurricanes
And sometimes when you're on, you're really fucking on
To keep sober like the rain that's falling down
I'm just trying to say
Son, you've got a way to kill
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
But I still get lonely
Talk about tomorrow, girl
And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself
Once I was a hunter
I hope that it will stay
And I fall, I fall, I falter
But I was caught in between all you wish for and all you need
And tell you everything is all right
I gave you everything, why do you hate me so
Gonna be good for everyone
Mother forgive me, I sold your car for the shoes that I gave you
I can see, nothing
On your way to some everlasting
On that night right by your side,
Everybody's gone at last
But I fall apart when you appear
When the sun would fill the sky
There's not much left to believe in
Three will love you so much
We want us like everything else
The last time I saw him
Up, up and away, away from me
Peel off all those eyes
I wish I was the last thing on your mind before you went to sleep
That miserable rotten slut couldn't turn anyone away
I'm gonna write a song
No one laughs at God when the cops knock on their door
Can I never let anyone in
A long December and there's reason to believe
One final step
I sleep with eyes wide
Inside, your cover's always blown
Don't stop talkin' to me please
To strip his clothes off by the dumpsters,
You took your life, as lovers often do
Lady sing the blues so well
'Who the hell can see forever'
I make believe that you are here 
Then you smiled for a second
Wrap them around, every fucking thing
Always fade
I needed to pray or see a priest that day,
I've got no claim on you now
Wont you come home
That you feel the same
"I'm waiting on hoof and on hand
It's hard to make sense, feels as if I'm sensing you through a lens
The lover, a Martian
And I'm burning all the letters
Only heartaches remain
They say a few drinks will help me to forget her
And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out
I still need you
And even if I need you
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls
But if I'd known how that would sound to you
It dwells and grows and grunts
Your hair and dress in ribbons
Just trying to bribe me
I thought you would be there when I go
And the license said you had to stick around until I was dead
Oh dear, you look so lost
And it goes on forever and forever but iujhiuhiuhiughi
Cause you are the greatest
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
You're just one more hand me down
And prayers that are sad,
I could wait with you for the winter to come
I was through with doubt and pain
Can he tell that I can't breathe
So here's my heart I'll give over and over again
Inside it's cold
You were the lonely one
But kiss me out of desire, babe
Like, "There's still a hole where the phone was thrown"
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse
You don't come through, babe
You already knew where you should've been
And the cardinal hits the window
Blue blood pumping like a hunter's fist
Cold I loved you from the very first night 
It's getting darker but I carry on
And what you never knew
Believe, relief, believe
There will be tears
I went and set the Thames on fire
Every hour we spent together
All that is left is an empty shell
I must be strong and carry on
Your hair is everywhere
Rolling my way alone
Grass looks much greener, but it's greenpainted cement
We had love but we still said goodbye
And I can picture her standing right in front of me
And the stars were new in the sky
Even if I tried alone
You left, I died, 
There's this boredom that drowns everything
Are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes
Do things I never should do
Right on the inside
But I don't care for myself
That you found a girl and you're married now
See who am I to say this situation isn't great 
You can break everything I am
Hey just let the bullshit pass push people
And I wish that my condition was new but I'm old and rusted
Where you hold me down, fold me in
I tell you sad stories about my childhood
We never talk of our lacking relationships
I try to think of things to say
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
Oh, my hands are strong, I'll take any man here
But awoke in each other's eyes
And I can't stand the pain 
I'm tired of dancing on a pot of gold flake paint
And all the things you said to me, yeah, yeah
What can I say
But if you'd known how that would sound to me
Don't you know you can't leave his control
The pen must have slipped to the side
Though my skies are turning grey grey
Is the only thing that's in my mind
Now that we're living living separate lives
I held my hand in the fire
It's not enough to say I'm sorry
I need someone to ease my mind
I'll keep an eye on the road
When you look inside, all you'll see
Tell me you love me Can't go on, ooh
Bad day, looking for the great escape
And then you bring me home 
But sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
Now I'm finding truth is a ruined, nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
I've grown tired of holding this pose
But no one's gonna say it
And yes there are times when I hate you
Who knows, maybe he's not deranged
Where she may come from
Alexandra leaving with her lord
If it's gonna be like this forever
I was a river, I was a tall tree, I was a volcano
You would have taken it back
You'll be sorry when I'm gone
It's a motherfucker
Her eyes were red with anger
And part of me died
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
We take our daily breath and thank our unlucky stars
From inside his mouth, I lick the blood
She's lost inside, lost inside
I looked at you and I
But everything's the same, this town's gone pitiful
Of where the light would land
To the lighthouse my friend
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah
Maybe I'm not up for being a victim of love
I hope I find a place where I feel I belong
Oh, and they knew how to play
I'm not upset because you left me this way
Take them back, take them back to your red house
Oh, Caroline, no
If it's good shit you won't know
You don't have to love me, all the time
Now they meet amidst the broad daylight
Lord, stay by me
We were merely freshmen
New, new world
But in time things must change
And holding his bleeding heart
You know that darkness always turns into light
There's no place left to hide
Breathless moments
Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
These feelings I can't shake no more
And all this waiting, for the power
Take it away and I want more and more
I'm tired of postcards, especially the ones with cute dogs and cupids
And I know that in the morning
And just watch your face
It's coming apart
Policeman are walking, walking in lines
The way things go
I watch it lift up to the sky
Carry me to heaven's arms
So now you know the words to my song
But she didn't know what I knew
My open eyes to lightning storm
Suddenly everything has changed
Oh my god
To wake you is all we got
So the morning light can shine on you
So for once in my life
I always was one for tears
All my time is frozen motion
No one seems to care anymore
We walk right into the strife 
I won't always live not stopping
Back through lamplit streets and dew
When our child was due, but I said, he'll have to wait
Two times I fell asleep in a dirty basement
The dog days are over, oh
And here tonight while the stars are blacking out
Not a girl and not a jewel
Near me, I thought you told me
You give me flowers of love
Of your broken little hearts
I know you're always telling me
But now I'm taking you home
Can you see the handwriting
What do they keep on fighting for
If you're searching out for something 
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
But as the sun rises on Mary, it sets on him
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind saying
You never know when it starts
To feel the rays, love again
And I can't breathe
Looking back at ', reflecting on those things we could have
And across my heart
And I can love you till you drown
If the sun's on its way
A stick man flashing a finelined smile
At the backs of other women
swingsets pay
Cold, now we're so cold, mine, and you're not mine, say never 
And the sad act like lepers
So you're gone and I'm haunted
It was from you, all the times that I've cried
And this song is for the stick pins and the cottons
Ya, I try to believe you
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
Feeling the monster climb deeper inside of me
But I'm nonetheless 
Or sell love to another man
I'm barely making sense
That losing me could mean something
Now this place seems familiar to him
I'll kiss you again, between the bars
All the promises I made that I wouldn't break
You have been the one
Did I say the world was fair
I only think about you when we're both in the same room
And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
I'll say goodbye
You make it hard to smile because
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe
When I was a baby
Where nothing's heard for miles but the sound
And I would have stayed up with you all night
I've been wanting to do anything for a long time
Oh baby here comes the fear again
Write me a love song
And the TVs try to rape us and I guess that they're succeeding
Saw you sitting all alone
When the flood calls
And your mother loves your father
Have to go back where you begun
The words that you whispered, for just us to know
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
Am I destined only to die the same way that I lived
In the backyard of a friends place
How you looked wet from all the rain 
Taken from a distance
I kiss her still,
In the garden with my mother
A love that should have lasted years
Even after you're gone
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall
And I'll do anything to keep her here tonight
More than anything I want to see you grow
But he calls me up
See the safety of the life you have built
Nobody said it was easy
That's when you've got to play it dumb
When you start doubting me
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
How can you mend this broken man, yeah
And I'm sorry every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
I know that I can't take back all of the mistakes
Like my memories, I don't need that
I'm still breathing
My knees went weak and you saw me cry
We don't need to fight and cry
And you can't say a word 'cause I leap down your throat
You'll start to think
 minutes, to whisper your name
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
Causing you pain
Have a new name and face
I had hoped you'd see my face
We all need that person
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are
I can go out every night of the week
And a part of me keeps holding on
Stronger than you found the grave
Oh, the corn has grown stalks
We're here to play a game of who loves more than whom
I've kissed your lips and held your head
A fragment of light
I never needed pain, I never needed strain
And what will it hold for me
I own one
Oh, I cut his hair myself one night
West Memphis please, I'm begging you to stop praying for me
Holding each word he spoke,
Good things we been through
The minutes pass away
Sometimes everything is easy
To our love send back all the letters
You sound like a song
I never cared before, I never cared before
The time I waste just to say goodbye 
I thought we'd be family together
And its killing inside
I'll do a dance to make the rain come
Yeah, they're talking back
You can stop the world, but you won't change me
And you will never be forgotten
They beat the pain
Well, maybe there is a God above
I'm sorry, but it had no place to grow
But they might suit you better than the rest
I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye
And time won't turn
Just savour every mouthful
In a bunker underground
Of the hole that we call our home
Dance around this floor much quicker than you
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
All dreams escape fire
To start over again
Figured he'd never let you leave anyway
Set down with due care
Without your love
And everybody does
Will take me through the lonely night
Where are you my angel now
Remember all the songs and the way we smiled
Why can't I dream, why can't I dream
Never let it go, oh yeah
And for a moment I lose myself
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
A place called hate
So pray for me child, just for a while
From all around the world
'Cause dumb is back
If you began to wave goodbye
Oh, I don't know, the past couple of weeks I guess"
Could've been something
By the second verse, dear friends
The morning rain clouds up my window
So I'm waiting for this test to end,
The sidewalks are watching me think about you
None of this was planned
And like a new disease she's still too young to treat
You can call me if you find that you have something to say
Anything
Count yellow highway lines
The blankfaced stares on the subway as the people go home 
At the comfortable glow from the porch, the one I will still call yours
And all the words we said
It's not an habit, it's cool, I feel alive
This was never my world, you took the angel away
From so many thousands of feet off the ground
Come Armageddon, come
I recall
I don't care
You kiss me, with your kiss my life begins
Like the sun's just gonna drop
The days were slipping past
I try so hard to be happy
And Barbara, she looks just like my mom
PS I'm still not over you
Is there I still longing there
And everybody's been abandoned and left a little empty handed
Heillos versunken, trunken
My brother had a daughter
Down in the valley where the fields are green
Yeah, I took your love for granted
There's something that I feel I need to say
My heart made the sound of snow falling from eaves
A stoic mind and a bleeding heart
No one ever said it would be this hard
We've lost it all, the love is gone 
Don't let yourself fall down
We all play the game and when we dare
My cave is deep now, yet your light is shining through
Careful, gentle, trying to keep the water warm
Let her go, learn a lesson
I wanna have her baby
Without sounding an alarm,
You're always right
I would go out for a walk
What if everything around you
'Cause we kept your clothes, we kept your business
And it's all predetermined can't change your destiny
He walks, you say, "Sit down, it's just a talk"
And where is the harmony, sweet harmony
Is it wrong to swallow whole
Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide
I hope you get along
The face that fills the hole
Every night, every night alone with you
On the day I sunk in this shunt
Who knows how to love you without being told
And I can't believe how dumb I sound
And the wind is blowing cold
Swear I haven't got a clue
And it felt like a bullet in her heart
Crawl across the river mouth 
And the only thing I know is
I wish that without me your heart would break
Baby, can't you see if there is such a thing
Let's pretend the fog has lifted
It's a good time for Superman
Yes, you could say we're a team
I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
Promise you'll stay with me
Holds a truth I can't erase
But I admit that I provided a full moon
When our mouths are filled with uninvited tongues of others
But we're all right
And when did your eyes begin to look fake
So many things to say
Like clouds in the sky
Like in a love affair, when the love has gone
The silence is hurting
His hands are shaking
Do you still come last night clear eyes pale
Like she wants to believe in me
Let me hold you, let me hold you again
And I'll be holding all the tickets
Mommy's in the manger with the little kids
I didn't know it was over
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
Those days are dying in the dark
That you've been gone
I walked alone on those Jersey nights, and I
here everything is worse 
Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
I miss my mother, I miss it when
But, I'll leave my window open
Mr Higginson, am I not good enough for the world
Group of kids, lines of cars
And the darkness has won
Am I the girl that you dream of
Leaving me with nothing to disdain
No one else will know these lonely dreams
Take your psycho little dogs
And if you're ever around
Tell me the truth, did you ever love me
Where Sophie's down in the valley where the church bells cry
It's still not real
And I'm sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of the shoes
With the sleight of his hand
So much pain
With you tonight
Quiet like the snow
I hope to lose myself for good
All we can do is keep breathing
Into the dawn they carry me through
Either way, win or lose
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
However long I stay, I will always love you
Did you think I could hate you
With his sword, with his robe, 
Spit out all my air
Wedding ring, a honey pot
I want to feel through you tonight
So will I ever find that place they call good love
Whenever you kiss him
Oh rejoice, your father's been calling
Satisfaction guaranteed to you
You are
Why she's given half her life to people she hates now
No one's gonna fool around with us, no one's gonna fool around with us
Sweet, sweet smile, and it's fading fast
'Cause I don't think you see the places inside me that I find you
When she was just ten years old
I walked around alot
Brokenhearted girl, no, no
And find a brand new way of seeing 
But you still hurt me
It's here and then it's gone 
To take you home
For my wings
Sadie G, she's crazy, see
Remember your families
In my lover's arms I wait for morning
You might be right but I don't care
I had so many dreams about you and me
I'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found
High all the time
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Looking at my father buried in the ground
Did he fill the empty spaces
They say life only grows short
Nothing I can do
Don't be scared
To please come save me from myself
'Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
Were spent by the telephone
Nobody came
I've given a lot of thought to the nights we used to have
Doctor says the baby's fine, but you'll have to leave
But don't forget to entertain 'cause this is your first defense
Made me feel so glad to be alive
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
I won't always love these selfish things
At Mann's Chinese Theatre show She was gonna be a star
Take my voices, learn to love them
But I remember everything,
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain
Stop asking me to stay
Right in back
Palms in the middle, hands in the middle
Never thought I'd fill with desire Never thought I'd feel so ashamed
Well it looks like an early winter
Some shattering find for this candor to die
Don't act like I mean nothing
Same old boy, same sweet girl, five years down the road
Now if you don't mind
Ran into you yesterday
Riding bareback
And I'm so sorry now
Our heart are in the blossoms
Just you wait and see when you turn, turn 
Catching things and eating their insides
The surfaces verses
I kissed your mouth your back
Spending little time with you
A smile from a veil
And I'm starting to scare myself
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts
I'll leave them over to your eyes
I was lost from the start
"It's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead"
Get a little bit suburban and go crazy
Baby, how can you stop that ol' sun from shining
That's how you fight loneliness
'Cause it was you that drove me to
Just tell me you love me
I'm at the finish line and you're just way too far behind
I hope you find the love that's true
I should have wrote a letter
The world is sleeping, I am numb
It's a feeling that you cannot miss 
Don't leave me out in the rain
No one's laughing at God
The hours grow
Counting the days that pass me by
With the windows clear
But I got my hands on you,
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
The city blocks can't hold you
And we both of us knew how the end always is
That played when you died
It's been a long, long time since I last saw you
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
Don't feel bad for me
'Cause he was right beside me
And the pavements they are a mess
Hold on, dear
Oh oh oh oh, coming night
It takes a steady hand 
Your head laying on my chest
Alone and crying
Turn on the bright lights
Though I never knew you at all
So I could make up my mind
And you still won't let me in
I'm going back to the start
They cut off my hair but it looked alright
The only thing that's real
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Who said that I wasn't right
Désolé, if someone is prayin' then I might break out
It looks like darkness to me, oh
Creation comes when you learn to say no
Sharpen my bones and stab you once for each time I thought of you 
Said goodbye, to my best friend
Just keeping the peace between the sheets
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can
'Cause I'm a bad loser
Crying for the day
And run in little circles till circles are
You'd maybe think there's something wrong 
I will settle in and watch 'em rolling back
Lock the doors 'cause I'd like to capture this voice
Turns around in front of the mirror
And it's turning me round
It keeps on falling
Come on in, I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
Of color she left in your black and white field
Talking 'bout stupid things
Listening to each other breathe
For no more shall we part
I feel me slipping in and out of consciousness
You said that I was an asshole and I'd pay the price
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I should be laughing right now
As well as the sun
You can't find one good thing to say
'Cause I let you stay
I couldn't ever love you more
But when you said that I wasn't worth talking to
You draw lightning from the sky"
What it was,
I'm half alive, but I feel mostly dead
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
But he always got caught
To feel not good enough
I think that you lie
I won't be back here though we may meet again
I think we've gone, and lost the fire
Ooh, this unrequited love
Many times 
Thousand times
I used to fill the sky around
And keep you from the loneliness of yourself
There's a corner of your heart for me
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
I beg my god to speak and tear me apart
So I quit school and that's what I did
It's all a falling through
Except we keep coming back to this meaning that I lack,
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
Disappointment you shouldn't have done
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
But she is dead and gone and lying in a pine grove
Leave a note for you, my only one
No no I can't change
I'm no brokenhearted girl
That I've always been dying to tell you
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
And who's gonna be your woman
All fleet snatch is laying waste my gore
Stuck on you till the end of time
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
Waitin' for Superman
So please put your sweet hand in mine
Oh, my babe, just say goodbye, say goodbye
And honey you know me it's all or none
Maybe, maybe you'll leave the light on
Everybody taking different sides
Or have something more to gain
It's been a long day without you my friend
Everything I do I'd give my heart and soul
Seen how things are hard
I really need a raincoat,
To hold off the real slaves, paid off and staid
And like the night we camouflage
If you'd just stay, I'd subtract
In your name I find meaning
This is a song about Susan
Well a person can work up a mean mean thirst
You'll soon begin to love again
But that's all I wanna do right now
When it all, ooh, went wrong
And it burns a hole 
I'm as calm as a fruit stand in New York and maybe as strange
I guess it's time I run far, far away, find comfort in pain
Never meant to cause you no pain baby, believe me,
Tell me that now is not the end
Thanks for your time
But I am asking please
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
And I walk home alone
Burning slowly, my one and only
I still hear them
Because one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
I keep on looking through the window again
For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
I know a ghost will walk through walls
You can�t feel me, no
Can you stop, please
Demons despise the sound of shaking paper
You were born on a black day
Goodbye for now
Pantyhose running in the cold
The power of youth is on my mind
Here the nighthawk call
In the pain is there healing
And daylight comes and fades with the tide
Tell me how's the way to see
I was fighting, but I just feel too tired to be fighting
Till the day he croaks
If you don't mind catching up
'Cause I'm a bad habit
Why did you have to leave me
You got much closer than I thought you did
There's a hole inside my boat But no one hears
I'm not sticking 'round
Wipe the tears from yesterday,
I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday
My brother told me he saw you there
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
Just that one moment, ended their days
And I miss you, yeah I miss you
Lie cold in the ground like you
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away
A brush through her hair, children kissing upstairs
Wait till the day you finally see
Dropping her petals in pain unknown
In you when imp so damn scared
She put her fingers in the imprints Ooh
We'll just sit around like broke down cars in the lot waiting for repairs
And I flew into a frenzy searching high and low
All this pain, begins to feel like pleasure
Picks up the letter that's lying there
But tonight, you're on my mind so
Brings a change for you and me
To the one I now know most
There's no one in this life
One generation's length away
For they'll come back to you some day
And moonlight would provide the spark
And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
Just hold me close, don't patronize
And you'll fight it, you'll go out fighting all of them
And I feel that you do inside
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Where are you when I need you
As there's mistakes I've made 
I see the sun disappear
When we cheat and we lie
If you don't believe it
Tallulah, find the words and talk to me, oh, Tallulah,
If I laid on the earth 
You can have your own car
She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes
Because they know your playboy mommy
Who could deny these butterflies
The child is on the moor
No time for being patient
Don't wanna look, �cause i know how it ends
Welcome to lookin' come back tomorrow
Is getting away, away, away, away from you again
They said start as you mean to go on
You will not see me fall, nor see me struggle to stand
Oh, oh yeah
I was dressed for success, but success it never comes
And I find hope when I'm let down
For all that you've done and still do together we always move on
Blast those yellow reds to hell
How could you send us so far away from home
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
I feel like my life is flashing by
Quote you are my soul unquote
Any thought of anywhere but home, my home
A daddy to hold me, that's what I needed
Is there anyone
His collar's pulled, begin to be aware 
Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Nothing left to hide
The shadow grew as he approached the ground
Be our best mistake
You told me this has always been worth living,
And drove the car into the garden
Telling your son a joke 
The broken seams along the way
Tomorrow tomorrow
Laying in this cold field
With brains that could explain
And I just wanna show you
Paper paper obsolete
And won't feel sorry for
I'm so sorry
Would it all subside
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell
Than the power of goodbye
You tell them my name, I got a few friends
And now we must eat those tears
To keep it light together
There was no way to compromise
I know another moment will break my heart
Make 'em wash
Everything has changed
Of the shadowlands 
Came to this world by ceasarian section
Hey  yeah  yeah 
And the smoke came out our mouths
I miss the way we breathe
And you can throw me off a train
To hell with this pride, let it fall like rain
And I can barely look at you
But the day looked so bright Bright
All that I know is I'm breathing
Who died and made you in charge of who loves who
And it's all been said nightswimmers
A tribute to false memories with conviction, cheap imitation
But stay with me a minute, I'll swear I'll make it worth it
I'm not like all the other girls
He tossed some tatty compliment your way
In the way, in the way that we're constantly moving
Never dream of you again
If I have my way, I will love you
When I say out loud, I want to get out of this
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Our love could be so divine
Oh you should be careful of who you keep talking to
Oh, William, William it was really nothing
For we're like creatures of the wind
And so it seems only in dreams
For things to be be quiet
To the furthest place you'll ever be
The clouds shift
This girl is only gonna break your heart
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
They don't leave when the moment comes
The crescent moon above us
We know full well there's just time
I really, really, really need a raincoat,
That you don't want me there by your side
I've got to get out of this hole
Through the roof of your mouth
What the heart wants
She was with another man
And in between it always seems too long All of a sudden
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
I just want them to know that I gave my all, did my best, brought someone some happiness,
The window is broken out and the interstate is far
Heaven knows it's high time
Every chance
As someone long prepared for this to happen,
What would it take for things to be quiet Find your way into my heart
And I feel your burning eyes, oh
I wasn't blind but
How much my heart depends
These arms will not be taught to need another's
I shook the hand of time and I knew
At the sight of a beautiful woman, they feel nothing but
Bows and flows of angel hair
You are true honeymoon child
So for the time being, I'm being patient
I want back the
And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit
As you turned around to leave
In a dream I saw you walkin'
Down beneath the radar screen, she's lit up like gasoline
To tell by his voice that he fell
The train that goes to the Kingdom
That brings you back home to me
On my own in a separate sky
Anybody could've told you right from the start
The face I came to know is missing too
The woman on the bed
It's such a silly thing to do
And I knew you
Sometimes I feel so happy
I see you with your man, your eyes just shine
To give a love, you gotta live a love
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
For fear I'd have to say goodbye
Evil's in my pocket and your strength is in my hand
Sing a song for the new breed
But fear's the only thing I saw
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
To see the empty road at happy hour
He Keeps me away from you
You should look through some old photos
Of a sinking feeling
I don't want be a bad woman
And got lost in the sea
All that's left of yesterday
It's the loudest sound
Every night I hear you calling
Wake from your sleep
Before fire could catch me
I loved you so I told you, but it didn't matter much
Calling out my name This table is set for one
Racing thoughts and wasted time 
Whole body feels so weak
With shadows I spend it all
A place where I can go
And fell asleep in this layby
We ignore because
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Four months at sea
Their small town eyes will gape at you
Got dressed drove the state line
So it don't make you stay here, yeah
These are the words I've never said
These open doors, these open doors, these open doors, these open doors
We have got through so much worse than this before
But I think I'll be returning now
And they whispered into your brain
It's not that we're scared
Oohdon't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try
Or anything
Days go on forever
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Stuck him and killed him and then ran away
Many times I've been alone
Whatever was at hand whatever was at hand
It's funny how
Through a telescope because I'm so high 
I'll be okay, is that what you want me to say
'Cause love takes time
Baby how did we end up like this Where are you now
Stumble as the moments pass
The stickler is you've played not one beat wrong
Or break down the door to your heart
Laying alone in this room
Don't fool yourself
We lost ourselves, the love has died 
I've been trying to be where you are
Ran out of time, no kiss goodbye
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
It all just goes to show how
In a hectic test a no one protest
I was born into this
Ah she kissed me and got out of our bed
Wanna stay not to go
Never, nothing
Never to see any other way
We lost control
You saw who we are, Jenny Wren
Better not look him too closely in the eye
I heard all you said and I love you to death
Take care, honey, I know you're under a lot of pressure
The world is falling around you
To be moving Moving Moving my way home
Sometimes, when sailors are sailing
Misguided ghosts
Ill show you
I will make it through the day
Here it comes
They would not listen, they did not know how
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
This has got to die
But a cold stone's all I see
There's not much entertainment
You're quiet, you never make a sound
It's not your fault
And stay awake through summer like we own the heat
To have a song that I can sing
Drag him out your window, dragging out the dead
That's if the choice were mine to make
I will remember
Let's get together and talk about the modern age
But her eyes glaze over, like she's lookin' straight through me
When you've seen it a million times
No alarms and no surprises let me out of here
The kind you'd find on someone that could save
'Cause you know that I can't trust myself with my  am shadow
You cannot have fire if the candle's melted
This is the part of me that believes in heaven
So why couldn't you have met me halfway
And still he's more than I can take
What if all the world you used to know
We are everything we need
Standing on a doorstep full of nervous butterflies
Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
And love's so distant and obscure
'Cause I love you
I hope that womb's not too warm
And hid in the shelters underground
Let it die, and get out of my mind;
I don't think it's happening, this is what I say
I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
It's colder to turn on your side
I'll never know what we were fighting for,
'Cos you gotta get high somehow
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh'
When the sun is high
Just in case he didn't want to go with her
My hands don't work like before
That it's either black or white
I will give my life
My God, this reminds me
You're working so hard
Believe me I, I try
I know you feel like it's hard to stay
You don't need to bother
And hours of making love inside
But I can't contend
Everyone of us is scared, not you
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long
Don't hold on too tight
Now you've got me right where you want me
And when I die, I want to go to Hell
All he wanted was a toy;
And spend every moment I had with you
I'm going to ride this plane out of your life again
Damn, this place
Yeah their lives were stole
There was something that was not there
It's in the water now
Yesterday I went outside
When it's our time to make the most of it, 
I hope you find what's right for you
I knew it would
He was made to believe
We looked right in their eyes
Emerging from the gentle grip of night's unfolding arms
If the sky is pink and white
And these fights
As I walk out the door
I feel estranged every now and then
Instead of accidental running, always running
That you're gone
And if I sold my soul 
We're losing ground
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
And this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips
Fade into the night
All I pare off to a road
I feel these four walls closing in
It's not my fault
Take back all the things that I said to you
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Bright waves roll easy and still,
I'm not as strong as I thought
For all of the loved ones gone
Just goes to show how wrong you can be
The cars and freeways implore me to stay away 
Little light, will guide them to me
I was happier
With no one to share 
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
Bring my baby back home
I write down good reasons to freeze to death
Hold the gun
Caught painting a dotted line
I wish we'd never met, then met today
You put in my hand a loaded gun
Mama please, let me back inside
I've turned my back
The wasted youth
Look at what I love today
Who can be sure of anything through
We are a fucked up generation
And you got down to tie her laces
And side by side in silence
It's ok, don't need to say it
Oh, such a perfect day
It takes strength to live this way
Started a search to no avail
It's not the kind of ending you'd want to see now
And one's pointing his tree branch at me
Took your soul out into the night
You got some kind of nerve
Rear window with the room in the hair
I'm in thoughts
And something's gotta change
Happy hands and your elbow in the appropriate place
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
And I carry on
Wherever you are
And I go back to December all the time
On the corner of First and Amistad
In form of future youth
You'd better say it now
And she went down down down there, down there for me, right on
Ooh wild horses
She had on that scarf I gave you
And those who fear are lost 
When the game's been fought
I don't mind
You leave with everything I am
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Now I'll always be right beside you
Will you take me to the other side
But now I'm scared that's how I like to be;
With his face paint white and red
As I'm doing my hair
It's gonna be that you're scared
I know all that you need
Passing by with every departing flight
How can you love me if you don't love yourself I love you I love you
Until it disappeared
Peuton jamais savoir par où commence
Is it always like this
It's the end of the discussions that just go round and round
Fill your heart with smoke
Down in the heat and the summer rain of
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap
Saw you crashing round the bay
I will never let you fall
Cut in deep, to the heart of bone again
And in that house
He only loves those things because he loves to see them break
How can I love you if I don't love myself I love you
Like a river running dry 
Looked through the paper
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
And I now have nothing
She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
Should've kissed you there,
Sunshine been keeping me up for days
�Cause I don't wanna leave this dream
Hey girl, look at my mom, she's got it going on
And please yourself at the same time
I need someone to be one, I'll take anybody I can get
Apparitions worth their weight in gold
It's a shame what your father did to your brothers head
Or scratch my arms till they bleed
She coulda been a movie star
In colors on the snowy linen land
I can't help it, baby, this is who I am am
In my happy home I barely breathe
Daddy was an alcoholic
Just because I don't say anything doesn't mean I don't like you
And I don't want to speak these words
Guess I'd better wash my mouth out with soap
His name was Charles
Below this same remembering sky
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
It was bound to happen so just
A kiss upon my cheek
My love is music, I will marry melody
After so many words
We all need somebody
Turning and turning but never returning to what you once had
And make everything be wonderful again
If you ever get back to Hackensack
Into your house, why don't we share our solitude
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
I wanted to talk to you 
Visions of love and hate
Drown in someone else's tears
It was like everything, like everyone's been broken so
Can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way
Has a mind to kill the other
Some words when spoken can't be taken back
They long to ring bells of warning
In my secret life
Die for anyone; what have I become
A time for change, take the pain away
Begged him to stay in my cold wooden grip,
And if you would open up the door
Makes it so hard not to cry
At least that's what I've been told by everyone
Love in our life is just too valuable
Like a joke or a memory
Good night my love
Work your way 'round that room
Yeah yeah yeah, oh oh
Own their seething lies
John, honestly we'll never stop this train"
I walk through walls, I float down the Liffey
Arise oh brother mountain
Tonight's for fighting
Fake everything
I swear I've got three lives
If you have to go, don't you cry
I believe in days ahead
Yes, too much love will kill you
Can't quite see the end
Tiny tears
And maybe it's wise
Spend all your time waiting
Hoping for that call
Got into a car,
This is a progressive dance but
Earthquake in your pajamas huddled in doorways
I knew this was our time
In the tower above the earth, 
And then the devil took your breath away
And like the stars we burn away
So sad but it's true
Are becoming clearer
Und alles war erlaubt
There's not a love that's perfect 
Stella I love you
But there's never been a song or a melody
And this is all I ever dream
Oh all the times I've tasted love
What I want you to remember
I'm not comfortable with how we never talk
Stepping outside she is free
Take off your shoes
Will he love you like I loved you
And these nights I get high just from breathing
Ah, the last time we saw you, you looked so much older
And it's never burning out, Never burning out
Ah Where you come from
I feel so far from where I've been
Your sweet young skin was shining then too
The boys you left are men you didn't raise 
The echoes and silence, patience and grace
Your voices aren't clear enough after all
If I close my eyes, it's all the same
He took his anger out on her face
Put your hands on the wheel
And I'm thinking about the only road, the one I've never known
Spend a day to make her smile again
There's things I can't imagine doin'
You made my body feel heaven bound
Memories made in the coldest winter
Heartache calling me
Then it saddens me to say 
Until you get out of this mess
Then finally make me do just what my momma said
A battle that lasts a lifetime
Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
My worries weigh the world
Now love me if you dare
Oh, I know you know how we felt about that night
So old in my shoes
And she's always gone too long
The boy you can fear
We'll work it out
Under the moon
I know you care, I know you care
Easing my pride
When you turn your back, she pulls out a flask
And Eve says let's give it a try 
You just walked away
Silent and cliché, all the things we did and didn't say covered up by what we did and didn't do
What's right my love
I know the way you feel
Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
Hang and black out together
The car is on fire, and there's no driver at the wheel
Frozen memory
You catch me if I'm falling
Where she may go
Oh, all of this and her dark hair
Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair
So I softly slip away
We will stay warm together
They've been knockin' me sideways
I'd always love you
Oh feel our bodies grow
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Making islands where no islands should go
Feeling him gnawing my heart away hungrily
As you lie in fields of gold
The rich relationed hometown queen
Where you've had me for hours 'til I'm sure what I want
I still believe
You look like a movie
Will you see me in the end
Sometimes I am so in love with you
My heart and I have
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away
And I'm too afraid, much too afraid to fall for anything
All around, all around
I'll break off my own arms and
Roads that lead away from this
People on the soldier side
I keep on trying, I should just let it go
I've got a sickness pounding in my head
All I need is a little love in my life
Long for one last showdown from a box in a crowd
'Cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays
Twistin' and turnin', we're all intertwined
Hey, come here
Look at him working
It would be a lie
They say life carries on
I feel sad
I never really had a problem because of leaving
Been searching every corner of the earth
I don't know how I'll feel
Lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights
What have I done 
Please tell mom, this is not her fault
I know I'm not your only, but I'll still be your fool,
So close to perfect, swear to hell, thought it was you
It ain�t the same since I'm living without you
Searching for the things to say to keep me right here waiting
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
And I accept and I collect upon my body
Apparently nothing at all
And I listen I am on your side
She quickly loses breath
Days die off and hope cannot last
I wake up to the sound of music, mother Mary comes to me,
Take a look at my body
But it's too late to think of the value of my life
You're using your headphones to drown out your mind
If all along the fault is up for grabs, 
You've got me paralyzed
I bet this mighty river's both my savior and my sin
Floor twofoot high with newspapers
And so I'm asking you
Your eyes won't open wide enough
The automatic gauze of your memories
But I wasn't one
With the windows all closed
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
I'm keeping up with the moon on an allnight avenue
For reasons unknown to me
Looking for something to open my eyes
So are you gay Are you blue
I just want to find where you are
Haben wir zu viel versucht warum konnten wir's nicht ahnen
Don't let the forest grow over that path you came there by
I got so scared that I forgot my name
I can't find the words to say
If someone took a picture of us now they'd need to be told
Burn my knees and, burn my knees and pray
In the shadows counting these numbers down
This can be better, you used to be happy, try
Oh no, we came to love you
I don't wanna be there alone, oh oh
Lonely failed experiments
Will someone put me on a train
Now the rain is just
We kissed, time slipped, hard edged, tight lipped
There's a fine line between love and hate and I don't mind
I can't find my way in
He hasn't been sober for days
And the gifts stayed wrapped until you got home
The stars at night turned deep to dust
Keeping things clean doesn't change anything
With your darkest secret safely packed away 
All the times, that I've cried
The God of Wine comes crashing
I've no need to stick around
As I try to find the will to forget you somehow
And I don't really care, no, no, no
I see it all now, it was wrong
I can't remember how 
 minutes, to make up my mind
Talking to the walls
Everybody that is, dear, everyone but you
To bury my love under this bare light bulb
You just walk away
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And you'd help me out of the dark
And now I feel too warm again
To stand beneath my window
Reckless, unfrightened and old
El cielo esta cansado ya de ver 
Now you say you love me
And now you're back, you don't get to get me back
Says, man, you should try to take a shot
Happy holidays, sad sick savior
And there this was
Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
Would you call me a saint or a sinner
For yourself, 'cause I can't always be around"
We'll be light
Will you walk into the grave with me
An act of God and nothing less will be accepted
Other people not
I'll find somebody
Night time resurrects fault lines
And when it's dark we'll be light
But I'm still looking to breakout
And each time I feel like this inside
So if you want to see the future, go stare into a cloud
You're waiting for something
As he begins to raise his voice
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Did you ever love me
Secure for future generations
Like you knew it was time to start things over again
Trying to get the other kind of control
Will sacrifice
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
We're alone, we're alone, we're alone
I can see the stars
Of the dark, dark water and the engine breaks
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
Changing a rope for a size too small, people all get hung
Well I'm gone
Tell me, help me mend my, my broken heart
There'd be no tear to wipe from your eye
There's no need to argue, 
Some people wanna steal her heart
But I'm not sorry if I do insult you
I can't say
And I hope you'll find your way again
But that makes it worse, yeah
And you're all laughing in the garden and I'm lost somewhere in your mind
Puts on her best smile
They disappear as reality is crashing to the floor
Please don't throw that away
I guess it couldn't hurt me
And I don't need you telling me how
Now there's nothing here for me
But I guess it's the soonest
Everyone says I'm getting down too low
I know it sounds like someone else's song
My only friend
I could bring you the light
What happens when you become the main source of a pain
I've watched him while sleeping and seen him cry
I'll do my best now, but you've been gone for so long
You'll never feel the heat of this soul
The star that I just don't see
Wait until the snow covers me up
See the liar that burns within my needing
I'm in the way
'Cause they took apart a picture that wasn't right
In death I will survive
Don't wanna lose the time, lose the time to come
Call it mystery or anything
She was left alone
So keep breathing
Now I've been dead for twenty years
Saying goodbye
It has changed you
Driving alone, finally on my way home to the comfort of my bed
And we saved them for a rainy day
Turn out the light
And mend where you are broken
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes
Thank your lucky stars
No change in his
And fought it off and fought to feel
To never go home
Here's a phrase that we all know, but I can't make sense
Am I so insignificant
'Cause I'll always miss her wherever she goes
So come on, come on, come on
These streets we travel on will undergo our same lost past
I leave the door unlocked
As you stopped to say hello
Can go home with anybody I meet
You can't turn back the tide, ain't that a shame
Now's your chance
I thought we'd be simple together
In the fake plastic earth
Your voice is the splinter inside me
Winter has come for me, can't carry on
Can't erase the words so the reality grows
From the world 
It's the same outside
Give the people something they'd understand
I can't believe you're gone
I'll go to sit beside you 
I was here;
And how we fell apart
My imagination runs away
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
And you'll realize that you love me, yeah
And I'm so high, not even you and all your love could bring me down
That it takes to make a perfect love
I know you don't love me
Sing from a book you were reading in bed and took to heart
Threw it all away
After twelve long slow years gone by
A shehive stare and chase 
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
As you opened up,  miles wide
Communicate through pursed lips
Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Where once there was only a girl
Be with you all night
Soon I know I'll wake from this dream
When you walk around, know you are beautiful
While I do my thing in the background
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful
Like a wall of new TV's
There's so much ahead
That and give other people hell
Although the sun will never shine the same
And salt betrays my eyes again
Drink up, baby, stay up all night
To be honest, I really don't care
Something borrowed, something blue
Should've never said the word "love"
Remembering that night
The way it shines for you and I
They spotted a sleeping swan
Oh yeah, everything is wonderful now
With me still
Pulls us from out dreams
Or I'll lose my place
But this you, you surely knew
And take the pieces and build them skywards
Through the center of the storm
Nobody else can see
The color of the night
He used to call me poison
We are, we are, we are, we are
Your parents had arrived
Lose friends to the air waves and the airlines
So please remember me, finally
And I remember the day
Not a number, not a name
His life was stole Stole
They say bad words that makes me wanna cry
The only one
See no use perfecting love with strangers
There's nothing I wouldn't do to have just one more chance
I'd take another chance, take a fall
They're taking her children away
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Black hair, like an electric space
I was just a girl then
Sat on their park bench like bookends
I still forget just how to
I'll check tonight
We believe
Wasn't air meant to last
She can't find her place, she's losing her faith
If you leave my life, I'm better off dead
Those wasted moments won't return
It's been a long, long time, how are you
Then the magician disappeared as quickly as he came
I know you'd rather see me gone than to see me the way that I am
I guess he wanted to kill himself
Don't you know I have faults like anyone
Sometimes I'm so full of shit that it should be a crime
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
What do you do when you know something's bad for you
So why you looking at me like you're a lady
Eyes closed, head down on the pillow
With impressions chosen from another time, time, time
Bleached and blinded by these nights
All my dreams and all my balance
Fuck your normal vase, let's steal push people
And present it in my mouth
Counting stairs with double meanings
Waits at the window
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
Since you're gone nothing is like it was
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Started carrying her books and doing lots of drugs
The angel from my nightmare
Again I waited for this to change instead
She found there's a better way for you and me to be
My eyes are just a little sweaty today
You're gonna lose what you love the most
It's a wonderful place
Ev'ry day I don't wanna get up
Now I feed the birds Day after day
Throw an old line out to sea
Would've sung to your beautiful heart
Close your eyes and count to ten
That I will be there at the end of the day
Surrounded by so many things 
So if you have something to say
We don't need much of anything
And snow
How's the view there
But the wind keeps blowinme around
As every fairy tale comes real
Just to sleep underneath your bed
All my time until I die
Believing in everything
A pity invitation to an awkward house
I'm so far away
Walk on water, pretty Mary K
My heart is in my shoes, yeah
'Cause now she's left me crying on the shoulder of the motorway
Guilty roads to an endless love Endless love
Like I used to feel you breathe
Come baby let's drown
Heaven from Hell Blue skies from rain
There is no one, compares with you
Left me alone when I needed the light,
Sweet Adeline
Something's just about to break
I wander the halls along the walls and under my breath
A face is smiling in the light
Don't call me a Contra
The ragged men in ragged clothes
'Cause these are the days of our lives
You can't build a house of leaves
When they call it a lover's moon, the satellite
Wild flowers on a cross by the road
But this might take all night
That it just is, everybody 
I was stone
The fall, the fall
Never thought that I could be affected
Don't be afraid my son and trust me,
And I'll borrow words from all my favorite paragraphs
And Eve said let's give it a try 
As we said all our goodbyes
Like sunspots or raindrops
I'm tired of the weather
Evil's in my pocket and your will is in my hand
I miss the years that were erased
I only wanna make things right
I didn't plug my ears 
Like a bird on a wire
I can't wash away your scent
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
To see that little light
Drags his bones to see the Yankees play
Have tired lifeless eyes
I'm on my broken knees, no end of sorrow
Further along, we just may
Every time we've no control
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know
The end of paralysis, I was a statuette
And there's plenty of ways to wear his hide tonight
This is the place where time reverses
They stood on the stairs
Adia, I thought that we could make it
How I'm supposed to feel
This is suicide season
Then I swallowed your words, and spit them right back out
Our faces painted white by midnight
I loved you like you loved me oh
Though my vision is strainin'
There comes a time when every bird has to fly
Slow down on us, wind
Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old
No never have I turned to any other man
And why does it matter Is to love just a waste
But could you find it in your heart
And the clouds all form a geometric shape,
Won't you sing me to sleep
I won't give up till it's over
And you're not the only one
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
All I want is to find an easier way
In a bloodstained sky
Lives in a dream
But with hope prevailing 
In spite of what you say
When I look back I'll be able to say
Well, I don't think I care 
So I said that it was time for a change
I don't believe you when you lie
But I can't take it so I run away and hide
Her love's a thousand miles away
Electronic surgical words
I will settle for nothing less
More than the weekend
Dry your eyes mate
The buttons on my phone are worn thin
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
All the distance in their prefix
But they did and so did I that day
Winter blues, no love for you
Carry all your thoughts
But some things they just change invisibly
And why leave me hanging on a star
And all of the lights will leave
It was pain
Find him in the bat's mouth
To translate what we truly dream about
It was long ago and far away
Like michael back in the day
You lied to me all these years
May we see clearly in a different light
Can't hide the past
I follow your steps in the snow
You got me, you got me, baby
Now it's just too late, and we can't go back
The first true love that folded at the slightest touch
There are some things I'll live without
That I don't love you no more
Could not kiss, just regress
And one day we'll get the best of them
On the first try
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene
When he was eight years old
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving;
Stupid girl, I should have known, I should have known
And every road you take
As you are so beautiful,
Bear careless, turnip snare rampages
At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral
And you just see right through me
How different I've become
For walking in my shoes, ah
Regardless of what they say
Pushed my head beneath the waves
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
Will I ever see your sweet return
I've seen a man killed by his best friend
It's just you and I, my friend
All the time now from you people
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face
You can leave them for another day
The preacher man said "let's bow our heads and pray
Sticking around for this shit
'Cause it's quite alright
The day's beginning
This town's so strange, they built it to change
Someone to cover, safe from the rain
They don't know I used to sail the deep and tranquil sea
I still find pieces of your presence here
In the skies over black Venice
All my time I've waited
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
Another day goes by me
I don't understand that sound no more
When the storm broke our second anchor line
But not for you, my love
An early winter for us
But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java
How do you sleep at night
Your windows my door and nothing can stop me
"Come home, come home
No matter how I try
Because in my dream, the girl was very young
Fear, fear, fear
In the shadows stood up high for all to see
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know
Now our impulses will bite
He will be alone
Thy nervous blood will become undone
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine"
Ooh yeah
Of all the things we should've said
I just want to hold you when the goings tough
And though my edges may be rough
Without wearing a stitch of clothing, we were both deeply in disguise
I never thought that I would find myself in bed amongst the stones
And I see it coming, and it's on its way
Lonely and so untrue
When time stood still and I had you
Will you be my man
Goodbye
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
You're still a lawyer
I got a soul to feed
Some snow would be nice
Don't die, don't die
I'll do anything for you,
The parks lay empty like my unmade bed 
These tears, they tell their own story
And make everybody late
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
To tear inside you
Seem to wash away
and light and light
To wipe the blood away
I wish I could remember
Reply to Caroline Thanks so much for response
I should have stopped you from walking out the door
I'm trying not to go insane
Somethings will never wash away
And freer and broil and toil and foil die
To kill the sound
Twenty years from my life
'Cause I want to be a good woman
Where did your long hair go
Go 'head and laugh 'cause it's funny, I would too if I saw me
You know I'd die just to hold you
I'm your becoming, so I'll always be nothing
I don't need a remedy
Or it can make you tired, tell you lies and make you fall
Whatever you want
今は�だ�しlove song
And all the people who really understand
Watch you disappear, yeah oh
In the pocket of my blue jeans
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell,
Dream new music to calm down
And I looked around
I know that you love me
I ain't got to be afraid, my broken heart is free
Viktor was born in the spring of '
In these jeans of yours with her name still on it
GLORIA is love
Unlock your heart
When Johnny came home with a gift for me
I remember it all too well
Avoiding a fight with this man
And seen behind those eyes
Problems all left alone
If one day you just up and leave
Of this frozen town, I'm stripped down to move on
But not all things will pass away
The lights in the sky
Have faith that when you call my name
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Heads on a science apart
But we really don't care do we
Next time I'll keep my hands to myself instead
Stuck by the phone again
Picking up astral signals
Feels like I'm never getting back what I give
So I never want to leave you and the memories of us to see
I cried so many nights
It'd be all right, it's all right 
You say what you want maybe I didn't get my way
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
And my eyes see it all so clear
With promises that might come true for a while
But that girl had so much love
As I read Rosemary's letter
The seconds ran away
Sounds as loud as a lover's words
I've forgotten how it felt
How can we go forward when we don't know which way we're facing
I always used to leave before I went to sleep
That when God took you back he said, "Hallelujah
It scares you witless
Yeah, I'm less than nothing now
You made fun of me for singing my song
Even when I cross the line
My feelings swell and stretch; I see from greater heights
And a place to be
Run fast for your mother, fast for your father
As the world is soft around her 
Makin' my own way home
But I'm just too afraid of all this change
I know that no one
And my burden to bear is a love I can't carry anymore
Falling to pieces, forever in doubt
All the memories of the fights and nights under blue lights, all the kites
The wind upon my face
I'd change back, but I don't know if I can
You're gone and I gotta stay
And a pattern of stillness 
Ooh, the years burn
There's distant lights
If I was flying on a plane above your town
I hope that you'll pick me out
There was never any place
Next door yelling cries mercy she is begging please
Waiting by your side
I'll walk that line
I'd rather spend it bein' close to you
Then they expect you to pick a career
In living every day
Your mom just smiled and sighed
In the window of the tallest tower call
It's an inside joke
Don't you dare tell me we gotta let it go
That maybe I can live without
That this time was forever
What you have shown to other eyes
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
I never needed you to question what I spent
Yeah, he'll claim all that has spoiled in your heart
I feel like goin' home
Better call the porter man, he's been caught leaving
To kick your heart around
To bring you back again
I'm working hard on walking out
Frank's in there, and I don't care
The memories of your devotion, ooh
With hope to explore
Iis harder than I ever feared
Now I've been sent to my room, I've been sat in a chair 
The flames of hell they give me hope, I drown
And maybe follow another sign
That's the day I knew you were my pet
By the waterside and knew
They're not good thoughts
Why does it have to be so unfair
The streets in search of anyone who'll take them home
It seemed a place for us to dream
Just like a stone
That the last sight they'll ever see is a pair of hateful eyes
And daddy lost at the races too many times
So many people to love in my life
You're still the only one that feels like home
Shining like stars and screaming
Come here, oh my star is fading
In a photograph of time
You're so much to everyone all the time
And go on and try to tear me down
Baby, baby no I can't escape
You'd been to the station to meet every train
And this is dangerous 'cause I want you so much
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister
If I close my eyes
I fell into your arms that night
Possibly maybe probably love,
But you always keep passing me by
If I could just speak up I think I would say 
He may conceal a king in his hand 
And when we look to the sky
They make me feel I'm falling down
You'll be a bitch because you can
Be president
But what can I do if I do till its gone
I'm needy
I'm here and now I'm ready, holding on tight
You'll be the scar
I guess we always settle in, and we know
Yeah whoa stay whoa oh
When I think of yesterday
With my wide eyes, I've seen worlds that don't belong
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
To make me feel this way
No words from my cutting mouth to your ear
Try to keep myself away from me
Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
I didn't mean to do you harm
If I'm gonna rob, I'ma rob all night
Acoustic guitar, how lovely you are
To almost nothing
I may have made it rain 
Wine left to rot an' a voice that can't sing 
I've got a question and you've got the answer
It's so typical of me to talk
When you've become inconvenient
It would be a lie to run away
Because you're not done, you're far too young
All the world is waiting for the sun
And took Poor Edward to Hell
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Screaming at the moon, another pastime
We're spending
The Lord took her, away from me
We'll float in space, just you and I
Hope so much your race will be all run
Here on the nineteenth floor
I hate it here
I want to be your friend
Cold comfort for change Did you exchange
Be true, 'cause they'll lock you up in a sad, sad zoo
When they came to firebomb the house
If the door wasn't closed
But tonight I'm gonna give it one last time
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be
Fall asleep reading science fiction
And if we turn back time
Nothing left to say
Ghostly fingers 
You are such a funny bear
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely
Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Atlantic ocean, New York skyline
But you're so far away
It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
Your lonely windowsill They'll carry you off tonight
Don't build your world around volcanoes melt you down
We'll carry on, but then again
Drive until you lose the road
If I say shut your eyes
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Look up, look up
In sorrow known
And all I can do is watch and cry
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
And the weight is crushing down on my lungs, I know I can't breathe
Like I won't know real love till I've loved and I've lost it
We wish our lives away
My mind replays
Feels like time is on my time
But you have always keep passing me by
I went to bed, I was thinking about you
Tout peut s'oublier
I hope your heart won't have to hurt anymore
Ruth seems out of her mind, swears she won't give in this time
Well, all the apostles, they're sitting in swings
And I know I'm not alone
I don't want to hate
You were the one I tried to draw
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
But I miss you when you're gone
If you're scared and it shows 'cause you're watching them grow
No one knows who we are there
It's not an easy thing to learn to play 
But they still turn me inside out
So take my hand
I think I'm turned around
And watched the sun make the shadows long
He's determined to call her bluff
To be your mother
Oh rejoice, and holy fuck you're bleeding there
It's time to settle the score
Let's join the little babes
I need this, I need this
We could go to the pictures, go and see something funny
I just need to lie down
But don't think me callous
I forgot fools run
My body aches
Every time I pay the price
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
But I love her
I don't blame them for their curtaincall
When the dreams, and the words started falling down
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
Take it away, I want more and more
The most loneliest day of my life
And I miss the lips that made me fly
Life carries on in the people I meet
Was an empty sea, until a silver fox
But there are some things even love won't allow
But I guess you don't care
And I'll talk real loud, goddamn right, I'll be heard
This tide always turns,' I said
Same old game
Nothing's been the same
"I've got your mind," I said, she said, "I've your voice"
Here comes ya ex
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
But now she feels no sorrow
But please don't leave me now x
I never made promises lightly,
To put us all away
 minutes, to shoulder the blame
He'd tell of places you have been
To be in love with
I only wanted love from you
Let's talk about all of our friends who lost the war
Isn't it funny how we don't speak
Has summer gone so slowly
And missed the most important thing
'Cause I could be the one
Then in the evenings looking at stars
That the empty feeling turns from black to blue
It will light our way forever
Oh babe I can't hide it I can't even find it in you
Ooh, ooh
Is it by mistake or design
They don't know you anyway
Last night I dreamed that I was a child out where the pines grow wild and tall
I saw you talking to Christopher Walken
Just turn around
Forget all the things that bring me joy
My body is aching
And I am ready for you, baby, I am ready for you now
Bells and footfalls, and soldiers and dolls;
i think that one time i was unfaithful 
Well I guess it's fate
Tethered with tears in their eyes
Let them over to your house
tremors that hold us
So do you think that we could work out a sign
But don't say that you loved me
Come to me with the worst you've said and done
I sent the message on did you get it when I left it
And tonight a little rain never hurt no one
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
I'm calling softly from the street
There's nothing you can do
I wouldn't cry for anything
And I'll be down on my knees begging you,
Looked in on my fairy pet
A year ago today we stood
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
With every word he'll say
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I
We spend our days in heaven
I still want you by my side
And all those mornings watching you get ready for school
Forget your dad, he's gone
I need a big love,
I work to eat and drink and sleep just to live
Oh, my babe, just say goodbye
I travelled the whole world around
Your little feet
And think of someone you physically admire
Hush child, don't make a sound
Sometimes I find myself sittin' back and reminiscing
pero al menos aún respiro 
I gotta stick with you, my baby
So you don't have to call anymore
Waving good bye at the end
I have all I need, haven't quite lost it
All that I keep thinking throughout this whole flight
I still adore you, you never need me
When the water filled every hole
'Cause he'll never hurt us again 'cause he'll never hurt us again
Send it farther on
Corre o que correr, custe o que custar
But it turns out just the same
Now she's feeling more alone
And what did I see
But you loved me
Cymbals crashed, the lights went blue
Stormy inside
Let's spend our last quarterstance randomly
And so we ask you, please
Then I would survey all those open miles
Just in case it hasn't gone
But I got 'em back
I'll be on my knees to feed her
I wore when I was with you
And its water will wash away my sin
Bring you back to the bar Get you out of the cold
You burrowed like a summer tic
A monkey and a man, a marching band
That I first saw your lovely face
Through the glass of the roof
And your mother and your dad
And I know the mistakes that I made
But when the sun hits your eyes
It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us
The patchwork girl has come to cinch the deal
Because your eyes are always saying goodbye
After walking all day through the first winter's snow
There are children standing here
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Take back that sad word, "goodbye"
Not knowing if I should try a little harder
And everything
The desperate are water
Why do you keep on running 
You are my only, my only one
It's bold and dark, girl, can't you see
You got out and said I'm sorry
But he speaks with his eyes closed
 hours
He's not half right
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
Of sorrow has taken you
The drying of your tears
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl
As crazy as I was I, guess I wasn't much of one
I remember when, it was 'together till the end'
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her I'mma name her Bonnie
Please kiss me
And somehow I knew you could never, never stay
I swear our jet is crashing in my mind
And you'd help me out of the dark
Your hot, hot, weather in the summer
i always knew it was better 
'Cause if assholes could fly
My nose isn't that big, it looks nothing like me
We couldn't take this on, the story goes unformed
Here I stand I'm all alone
And when it comes to loving me he's worst
That cause my comatose to begin 
No, no, no, no Melanie C I will be with you every day
I'm both a patient boy,
Ashtray floors, dirty clothes and filthy jokes
Has no one told you she's not breathing
When people see me 
A fool to let you slip away
Where the selfishly sick and selfabsorbed
That way
But you won't stop crying
Your people and your land
They never say, forever gaze, if only
Disappointed and passed over
Do you see the truth
Cool as the deep blue ocean
And still they echo me
And when his life came to an end, he tried to grasp for his last friend
But the day after is darker
Just because, I want to know
In his head it's like the weather
But, you know I hated to close the doggone door on you
A broken promise
Standing, smiling on some fantasy island
You see twenty years ago
But don't judge me so harsh little girl
I guessed it couldn't hurt me, yeah
There's always some reason
To the vengeance of the sea
And I will love you all the time
And in a wide sea of eyes
And only you can give the breath of life
When I look and I find I still love you
Speeches won't be made today
That job's not mine
Why am I the one
Angels will call on me
And I don't mind if you say this love is the last time
And get really pissed and go home and have a fight
Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
We both know the day will come, but I don't want to leave you
That no one knows the days of
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand
We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day
Where we're living in this town
My life your tarot, and my picture your fate
Girl I understand you loyal to ya man
I'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens
See, the life I've had
I know where I marked the signs
It's the work you saying you're doing
And sit alone and wonder
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Never cared for what they know, no
Remind me why we decided this was for the best
Through the mouth of your eye
I hope that our few remaining friends
Now you need me, now you don't
Losing all control
I could sing you your favourite song 
And I have torn my soul apart from pulling artlessly with fool commands
So the tide won't get us below the knees
Intake eyes leave passing vapor trails
I couldn't even look at him
I tried to stay above the waterline,
I love you
You look so vulnerable, I feel scared for you
A breeding ground for hate but
To fight the feeling that is growing in my mind
I wish I didn't have to make
A hero of war
You just might find if you give it time you will wave hello again
Only air, that old breath
I want him but we're not right
When they say you're not that strong
Recall the deeds as if they're all
Is it what I need
I knew you'd be gone as soon as you could
It's in the pants you borrowed in the driveway
So come rain on my parade
It wants what it wants baby
I bowed to save my head and
Just about got it right
A flower in the twilight
So this is where you are, and this is where I am
'Cause I killed all the flowers
And even now I hate you it pains me to say
That I'm the same the way you left me
She hides in no way
But you weren't happy the day I watched you go
The hospital asked should the body be cast
Wellmeaning teachers
When my dad died the worms ate out both his eyes
And to lie to you, rather than hurt you
You know no one true, till it's over
'Cause it's always raining in my head
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
Sad songs in my head'
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
That man knows the sea
Brenda wants to run away, Mama say
I need some distraction
That love was meant for beauty queens
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
But when asked to make a point I tend to whisper
Too many years built into memories
No my heart is gold My feet are light
To know me as hardly golden
And I leave, my burdens at the door
All the things that you wanted for me
Hey this kind of trouble's only just begun
'Cause I feel like going home
I'm sick of spending these lonely nights
Bring that minute back
People have the right to fly
Laid out ahead of me
When it's all the stupid things
But since you've been gone I've been lost inside
Maybe you're the rainbow
You make me feel like I am free again
I'll take the long way 'round this time
All the world is waiting for the sun 
You had plans for both of us that involved a trip out of town
I'm brokenhearted, I can't let you know
It's come to this, release me
Tears and fears and feeling proud
Your heart burns through
walk away
Training myself not to care
Mess me around
Will you ever slow down Will I ever come first
And let me rest in pieces
The most perfect day I've ever seen
Everything we had
I'm on fire
They'd go away
We'd buy the Sunday newspapers
Don't say you need me if
And a girl from class to touch
Trust just don't come easy
Or ever was
I'm stronger than all my men
I feel as if I'm wastin'
I tried to be your friend, you made me shamed, so I'm getting even
For every step in any walk
Nothing you can do
Washes yesterday's garden
Try to keep from missing love
Who regrets the things they've done
If it'll slow down my higher brain
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
How the years would go flying by
Then it was Jed then it was Jed
Life can show no mercy, it
A man in the park read the lines in my hand
Sacrifice, sacrifice
So they went, years and years
You and I have been through many things
The pieces of my heart are missing you
Catch his dreams today
Please don't call me self defending,
I got paid to fish 'em out
No I got a good talking to
I'll wait for you, babe
Made everything look wrong 
Now waking up is hard to do, sleeping's impossible too
Pretend it's all the same
But lt's the way I feel right now
Drove the night toward my home
Oh a beautiful world
And it starts just where the light exists 
And just try me
I got all my ones to choose from
Or break your heart
In your life I'll take my cover echoing what is not
Your baby doesn't love you anymore
It will open up for everyone but you
I lost myself in sorrow
Since you're gone there is a heart that bleed
But standing there with all of my possessions piled higher than a house
For someone else to be called and called by
Can't you see the wall you built for me bis x 
Can you make it feel like home
Those conventions are taking their toll on you
The more you shake, the more you give away 
I always feel like shit
And I have lived so many lives
They'll tell me that you're mine
The sun will rise
And when just one remains
But she just drops her pearl black eyes
Those days are all gone now
If you're looking for love 
Well, I fell in love with your sailor's mouth
I can't believe this never happens to you
So, it's sad this doesn't suit you now
And time changes many things
But baby, I don't even ask
You're the night, Lilah
She smiled at me on the subway
The buildings aside
I know my place
Compile thoughts and compile thoughts and
How can our love be true
Let's take a dive swim right through
But still I never learned to live
I love my, get down for the
Hopeful for awhile
I'm listening to a song inside my head
Sweep me off my feet
I go down and I wondered if there was any reason left
But I can't help the feeling
In the longest of nights, stir him at your breast
For girls in the eighties
Lie beside
And every time I've held a rose
See how well you fare
Someone said that you're fading too soon
I want to taste the salt on your skin
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
Even though we've become without
And you will not be alone
This will make you love again
Skies are crying, I am watching
I never knew till someone told me that
I cannot go to the ocean
And time stopped moving
Joey will come to see your flowers
She says, I'm free
So many reasons why
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Yes indeed I'm, alone again
You can fall back on us
Now they're all dead hearts to you
Her perfume was so
Pretty when I cry
I won't be the lonely one, sitting on my own and sad
Like everything I'll never find, again
I think you made a big mistake
And you wanted not to cry
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
With the blue quilted violets across the breast
Oh, you'll be the end of me
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside
Through the streets and through the playgrounds
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
But one last time
She's a little better than the one that used to be with me
In the night time we are found
I didn't mean to waste your time 
My son is married and tells me we don't talk enough
Yesterday's a million miles away
And now the music divides us into tribes, 
And the bodies you left lying around
I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
Now it's time to prove
The lights went out
And someday you will ache like I ache
Too many tears
Don't lift a finger let me show you
You'll notice something funny if you hang around here for too
Tell me how's the way to be
Or will you cower in fear
In the pain there is healing
In my happy home I read the signs
Every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
And filled up our garden with snow
When I'm not so kind
Oh, my heart, it breaks
And I hope you blink before I do
Every night when I go off to bed and when I wake up
Couldn't wait for Saturday
My last night's lost tune
Until it all just falls apart
Will make you a brave man
I've given a lot of thought on this  hour drive
I can't trust no one
And all of that jiving around
Or the black bear
If it makes you less sad
You believed in
When there won't be a moon and there won't be a sun;
Look at ya, look at ya Ladies and gentlemen
Even when I'm alone I hear your mellow drone
I could wait with you by the water
But the day will come, Jenny Wren will sing
The world was wide, too late to try
Sing me something soft,
One night
Especially when I have to watch other people kissing
Born and raised for the job, someone always does
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
A child afraid to even cry out says
Lose my hands to use my heart
But I promise you this
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
Sing to me of the song of the stars
But there's nothing I'm planning to take
I hang on every word
Your hair was wild, your eyes were bright
To find the house where we used to stay
And I miss your face so
In my life, I hope I lie
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
If I got to go first
And ev'ry day I wanna dooohoohoohooh
Just think of all the places we could be
They grapple till she's safe within their keeping
I am crying in the bathroom
And I want to tell you I'm sorry
And why do you look when you've already found me
You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
Blankettes who can't find their their thread and their bare
How do they sleep at night
I've been getting calls in these hotel rooms
Seemed to be a lie
Sweet Jesus I need you
Someone's gonna show up, never fear
Sail away with me honey
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
Yeah, anything to make you smile
Her winter lips as cold as stone
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more
And the day draws to a close,
William, William it was really nothing
But oh, I'm staring at the mess I made,
Somehow I knew you would leave me this way
Oh, love takes time
Feathers fall around you
Now I don't warm my hands in your coat
Just one more chance to say
Is she someone I don't know at all Is she someone I betrayed
On lonely nights I start to fade
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
It's sometimes just like sleeping
Now that I've finally found that this is not the way
With you as something new
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Waiting for your call, I'm sick, call, I'm angry, call, I'm desperate for your voice
He says the choices were given,
And I knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for me 
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Need your light in my life
But no split hair�s gonna get me down
Looking in your eyes
I am hellbent on extracting all of my revenge
Everyone ends up alone
I close my eyes when I get too sad
Try to hold on
Something that I just haven't got
Inside of me and such a part of you
And the band plays some song
Just a turntable to watch
So you can tell everybody
So I can say this is the way that I used to be
And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space
It was a straightfaced lie
And I was always so impulsive, I guess that I still am
I wish you'd never forget the look on my face when we first met
You're talking to her now
When I look and I find no change
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
I carry the things that remind me of you
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
I can wash your sins away
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love, you had to fight to have the upper hand
I'll be an outinout, bornagain, from none more cynical
Sometimes I feel so sad
Wir haben irgendwann wieder jede Menge Zeit
And if she seems as lonely as me
I know they're still talking
In the car behind the carnival
I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
Change of season, love can die
Baby, I'll try again, try again
Every time I close mine
Things are never gonna change, mm mm
So I can't tonight, baby
With every round
You're the truth, not I
Words are broken down
You are someone else
Than the owner of that kind of heart
Was there one you saw too clearly
Wondering, when savior comes, is he gonna be saved
Broken down like a mirror smashed to pieces
Through your eyes I can see the dismay
And can you explain this mess
New wings are growing tonight
It will greet you every morning
No longer fun and so far from interesting
Man, it's been a long night
Into big black armour
I don't know where this road
And I'm ill with the thought of your kiss
And I knew that
Black suit, black tie standing in the rain
Unsalted peanuts to stretch my miles
Oh this town
Houses burnt beyond repair
Do you think that you could see your way
Everything's falling into place
For me too, yeah, yeah
In one ear and out the other 
She tried to show him love
Don't know when I'll be back again
and without you everything is so boring 
And so we watch the sun come up
Gotta get rid of this pill taste, what are they chattin' so much for
Ooh, ooh, baby
Relief, believe
Then I had to move away
And we do what we need to be free
What a cruel price you thought that you had to pay
Oh, sadness I'm your girl
I'm under attack again my dear
Sky is womb and she's the moon
The words I've spoken
Ten times removed, I forget about where it all began
Then I got dressed
Here comes the pain, Here comes me wishing things had never change
Will carry me over
And then there's one just for you
Bending up my Nikes
Do come and find me, oh
Where I stay up all night
And the world, stood still
You're always gonna be
Somehow I knew you could never, never stay
'Cause you broke all your promises
'Cause they will kick and they will scream but there's no way they're ever getting out
So break me to small parts
And this is where I live but I've never felt less at home
Thought I knew myself so well
Of everything I see, the world ain't half as bad as they paint it to be
How amazing it feels just to live again
Cinders of gold
I knew they'd comfort you
And I hope that I change
Really too late to call
But everything you say I only see
And here I am left in silence
Better at your game
Your moon in a bella luna and
And now you've decided to show me the same
At the turn of the tide, is withering thee
And make myself renewed again
I'm drunk and I'm tired,
The few words I say they mean nothing at all, at all
In his arms I must stay
And everything went up in smoke
But I hate when I feel like this and I never hated you
I still love her, loved her more when she used to be sober
Oh, I'm not crying
Aprender a dar foi o que ganhei
Army dreamers
I look at you
Right before my eyes, you are the saddest sight I know
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet
Everybody's gone
And I guess I ain't too good with money neither
By your side
And I lie, here in bed
I want to give you whatever you need
And I'm frozen in just the wrong time
I know I'm not the only one
All the white horses are still in bed
But you're not alone, and you're not discreet
Don't let me darken your door
Coming to you and then going away
Oh, yeah
You've long since faded from their eyes
Tried not to move but she was armed
Alright, alright
And so much has gone misunderstood
To tell me she's sorry
It was worth it, feeling abandoned
You've got to choose a wish or command
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Like a first love,
I like lying naked in my bedroom
You're still leaving nothing but bones in the way
His thoughts echo round
I'm a moon that never shows its face
We gotta leave, leave, leave the city
For the fear that I find in these chords
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
That hides behind the cause and the effect
Just smile back
The stars are dimmed by clouds and tears
It looks like an early winter
Most of you was naked
Away from here
And convince myself to lay back down again
Our minds pressed and guarded
They was hanging in
I could be right
Will you keep an eye on Baby Birch
It's a lost fight
That I'll take to my grave
And you were right, right from the start
Losin' what I love today
And let me kiss you, oh
Couldn't, 'cause it's true
And we're still making love
U tellin' me that you really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark
And the fear made you so unsure of me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart
Can I have a moment
And at the funeral, the university
Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain
Who's gonna look
Hey child, things are looking down
Burn it backwards, kill this history
But I can try, I can try
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
How does it feel 
Your face is so unclear
A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
I take it on the road
Everything she's ever known
But I don't see, either 'cause I live across the street
Goes all the way down those tracks
You hit the road and left me an ocean
I can't believe what I cannot see
I never knew what it was to be alone no
And on your face,
So far This face in front of me
I'm such a fool I can't believe I let you in my life
In each seething bacterium
How can I go forward when I don't know which way I'm facing
To carve my own and set it free
Before my nights' vacation with you
The day before the day
Swing wide your crane and run me through
She loved me
You're the saddest sight I know
Stuck by this river
We used to have fun
No one to roll over this night honey
"But it's just rain" I smile
Hey, I can't make it go away
Body of water, toxic and timeless
Blinding wall between us
Moments that I have shared with you
Baby bring me love or something else
And only love was learned
Driving back to her apartment
You're gonna give me all your sweet mother love
Fell out through your teeth, push the pieces in place, make your smile sweet to see
Fifteen years gone, I still wander this parapet
I sincerely saw your skin for the very first time
A savage Beast, I've got nothing to sell
No tomorrow, no tomorrow
Shed the clothes that become my skin
Thought we'd be on fire together
And those days, too
The snow in Montana was three feet high
Oh, I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
The night's so long, yeah, the night's so long
Do you believe she said that
I've been thinking about you, baby
The air around me still feels like a cage
Because your candle burns too bright
'Cause your presence still lingers here
Any feeling
Now I am searching how to get alone
There's a party getting started in the yard
I don't expect anything,
How long can dust wait
And she walked along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
With the noise in the background from a televised war
Well I must remain in tune forever
Oh stay with me, Arienette
When every time the sun comes up I'm in trouble
Into our lives
Found a way to understand the things I'm learning
I wanna live life, and be good to you
While the world waits for an explosion
A million years ago
Yeah, it's a long way down
For things they can't
Come on, oh my star is fading
Cut out the only thing that was right
'Cause we are born innocent
What was your question Love is the answer
And warm me up again
And they smell like sleep
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Turn back the hands of time
It's gonna kill me for the rest of my life
Everything is different nothing's really changed
In your own home
The man that you think you see
And you never say a word
Oh oh To take it all away
So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
And why do you look when you've already found it
What would it take for things to be quiet
But I don't want to be alone
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you
Echo through the house
Where we are all going to
I love you 
What would really happen if no one ever came
So let somebody else devise a cure for it 
Where justice he delays is always justice he denies
I see Christmas lights reflect in your eyes
Punch drunk and the blow
The actor's gone, there's only you and me
I wake up every morning 
Would you put on the fire for me,
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
Said, "I died for you one time, but never again"
Please stay where you are
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel, comes out, just when you need it to
Hey Lucy, I remembered your birthday
As we die, both you and I
People talking without speaking
I need a place where I can make my bed
All alone in my car
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
To a place I've seen in a magazine that you left lyin' around
You got me writing lyrics on postcards
The jaded underworld was riding high
Yes all that we were, all that we knew
I need answers for what all the waiting I've done means means
Of someone else
And she may wisely cling to the ground
Give me the mysterious love
What to be done with her
Your name is the splinter inside me
Return to me my love
His dad looked down and smiled, said we can't leave her behind
Getting tired and sleepy in her bat mouth
'Cause they make you stay real still in a real small space
That you will cry in spite of you
From the only place you've known
All the timegive it time
Two heavenly spirits
I knew it the moment you walked into the door 
The hearts that I touched will be the proof that I leave
Two hearts fading, like a flower
I'll miss the things that grow
At least we both know where the other one sleeps and lets end this tonight
She took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue
With her cup of tea looking out of the window
Today
Jump off the end
And I swore I saw you smile
Oh, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
I'll be waving, I'll be waving goodbye
A good boy
Leave me bleeding on the bed
Maybe that's your way
When autumn comes
As even broken hearts may have their doubts
You told me lies
I feel good enough
Now he's dying to get inside
'Cause it's worked each time before
Here comes that sun again
And I know I like to draw that line when it starts to get too real
I'd set my course for land
This isn't just goodbye
A walkon part in a war for a lead role in a cage
Come around come around no more
I need you tonight
And kissed me till the morning light, the morning light
She stops and waits until they go back in
Show up anyway
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel
It rises all around me
Babes, old bags who say
They stick to the shadows
I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall
For you don't love me
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease,
What if I'd been born  years before you
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
Everything I never would miss again
What a mess I leave
Nobody cares if the people
Oh, actions of mine 
Shadows on the hills
They remind me that houses
And give you mine
Being poor was not such a drag in hindsight
Boy and the ghost
And you don't need my secret midnight call,
I lie alone, the clock strikes three
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Where do I go when the land touches sea
But not today, no
All our dreams come true
I'm not the boy I used to be
Don't you tell me to lighten up
I've had enough, of this town
Easy come and easy go, whatever
They will know how I love them 
So can I please
He says his body's too old for working
And the snow is softly falling on her petticoat
They laugh at tragedies
The night, it never ends
To make you feel loved
And I'm nothing now without you
Seeking out the memories I hold dear
Maybe not in words
I did what my body told me to
I got something to say you know but nothing comes
All the words that I said that I wouldn't say
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
And we'll run for our lives
Touch me as I fall into view
He'd say "Music was the home for your pain"
But I'm nothing so good, no I'm nothing
Jenny was a poor girl living in a rich world
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
With a smile on your face
She is ten times heavier
An idea from an another man's mind
I just found a friend,
Stupid shit you just play
And they turn around, smiling, but
With no one to reach to
Don't forget to keep your head warm
You keep looking but you can't find the woods
I traced the cord back to the wall
To hair and contentment
Oh my friend, we have all come
And sailed on shooting stars
Faded away with tears in the rain
I'm more than a bird
It might be my only right
I am small and the world is big 
I dedicate this song to you
And I will return
This love she feels
I'd feel rather depressed and out of place
How you always haunt me
There's no eyes in your own head
And you will catch me if I fall
All god's tears for her, they cry
To me it's nothing but a one man cult
I may not say the words as such
Press my face up to the window
She didn't know what to throw away, and what to keep
A little jetty fight
Come take me high above our time
For this I gave up trying, one good turn deserves my dying
Everybody bow your head for the greatest inspiration
Did you ever make it out of that town
Because of you 
I am falling
You may tire of me as our December sun is setting
After the fact
It hurts to face it
No one can stop you now
A hotline, a wanted ad
From moving ground
She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
Looks like no one will ever
Wish that bar lady'd appear; and come serve over here
Never make him love me
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
It's cold as a tomb
When I found out you had cancer of the bone
'Cept you my love
When you laugh about people
They could sleep on the floor
Of what is and what was
I could still hear inside my head
Why is this my life
No idea how it feels to be on your own
And I go back to December
The dream that comes alive at night
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
You're just like an angel
The colour of the earth that day
I like the ivy and the ink blue,
I have dreamt of a place for you and I
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
And someone can say they love me truly
Stripped and polished, I am new, I am fresh,
There's a hole in my heart and it's beggin' please
You, me and mum, y'now, anything was possible
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age
You raise your sticks and cry and we fall
Who'd will the meaning of
But I'm writing the answers on cheap paper napkins
Long nights, strange men
And we race out on the desert plains all night
Round here, she's always on my mind
There is Emmanuel of mothers 
And I'll come back to you
To your existing family
We found our life's been changed 
Now I work in a market as a checkout girl
Have you ever heard of anything so absurd ever in your life 
You will always be inside my heart
They all depend on you
Open heart, open heart, it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
'Cause if you take him back 
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
It's not an enviable lot
And stay down
All that you've loved
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart
That you don't want around anymore
So oh, river of sorrow
Glass on the pavement under my shoe
Struck from a great height by someone who should've known better than that
I'm spending my time
And lost forever now
And tell me how I'm supposed to feel
This is my all time low
Deep in the cell of my heart
It's so crystal clear now
Stay alone
And laughing break against your feet
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
It's painted with roses and thorns
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
Three o' clock in the morning
Take our time in trials
And on with my life
Better come with an army
That's not the shape of my heart
God resigned from hearing my old story
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
One may think
Between the iron gates of fate, the seeds of time were sown
Sweet summer days when I was feeling so fine
Cause you got me
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
You will have to say goodbye
This used to be my playground
It's a river spanned
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
Let's pretend, happy end
Some people say she's funny
To find some beautiful place to get lost
Put it to my brain and scream "Die Shady" and pop it
Don't you think the colour has gone
She waits all night for him to call
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
Oh wake me please when this is over
Sometime after all this bliss 
Maybe I shouldn't have done the second one, I feel all fidgety and warm
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I think it's time, we give it up
I've gone alone, took all my strength
The way I fell before
Or raise my hands to you
The sun was always shining, we just lived for fun
Newborn life replacing all of us, changing this fable we live in
Over the ridge into the distances, written on your ticket 
I'm outside your house
All the lies that you tell, I believed them so well
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love
And maybe one day I will free her
And we did it when we were young
Anyway
She's still too young
For any place
That I've been messing around
Comes from nothing at all 
But who could love me
And death is saving me
The way
Walking circles around me
Sometimes they just get caught in the eye you're pulling him through
Polished off the whiskey tonight
You're living for nothing now
I hear it beating far away
Singing lines
I've been living in the shadows of your song
Mother don't worry, she's got a garden we're planting together
On rumors of summer
To try to turn back time
Lately I've been dreaming with you
My hands are broken
All I wish is gone away
Anytime she goes away
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say
It's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion
But no one cares
Like the dream of you I had
When you can't even define what it is that you are frightened of
Tomorrow is tears,
She been dreaming about it since she was a girl
I hope that you find it
If you think you might come to California
The things we used to say
Trying to change the whole wide world
My shivering halfmoon
There were times I never really knew how to feel
Me your love Me your love
Remember me as you fall to sleep
Or hate'll sing the ending that love started to say
And if I could only stop the car
I hope my arms
'Cause time will fly, upon my baby's back
'Cause our love's the slowestmoving train
And I feel, all this pain
Well, I have sown untidy furrows across my soul, but I am still a coward
Gets time to become resigned
You could rule the world,
I hope to find it in the end
Don't fight when I finally find
And hold me for goodbyes and whispered lullabyes
It's about time that I came clean with you
Will you worship moons in winter's night
Lord, I'm needing you now, tell me how to stop the rain
That alright with you
It's just a matter of time
I listen to you talk but talk is cheap
I have a hard time as it is
Let's run away, I'll take you there
So you got ahead
'Cause I knew you'd want it
She lives in a world she didn't choose
His money on the side, money on the side
And the city I walk in, the city I walk in,
Well my dad was sick
While the hands are pointing up midnight
When I die, will I go
I was drinking you goodbye
A loved one laid his head on her lap
I'm back with scars to show
Away from me
I can't stay for long, I'm sorry
We're all right
I'd kiss the ground that you walk on,
But I can never find the words to say
Would you love me a loser or winner
Living alone
And I know how it feels to walk out on your own
And disappears inside of her head
One is the loneliest number, much much worse than two
Here's to goodbye
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life
This time Ill take the chance
I guess there is nothing to do, oh well
All I wanted was to sing the saddest songs
Never knew quite what I had
And I cried all night
Johnny's daddy, was takin' him fishin', when he was eight years old
With a broken heart that's still beating
The moon is a sickle cell
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
And I've heard it said too many times
And I miss you love
When everyone would offer up a hand
In heaven, where we never say goodbye
When I am falling
And sign up with evil, Angeles
I was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt
Make it that you're sorry and the
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
I can't believe you actually picked me
Thought that I'd forget all about the past
No your lips they stay perfectly still
That oh, my heads to blame,
How can we go forward when we don't know which way to turn
I'll be wallowing in pity
I started losing sleep and gaining weight
All the things you never say
In your arms Don't hurt me
hunting reasons that make me believe, 
We were having the time of our lives
I felt something that I had never touched
So you better run
Sailing over Coney Island
Mad world
Well, that's because I am
Cool as the deep, blue ocean
Your house beneath the hill and up until
It's been two days and  minutes too slow
Kiss me goodbye
oh how they hurt, my days without you
And you'll see me return
Only I can save the lives that blink within this canyon
If I died tomorrow
my days without you are so absurd, 
Five will love you so much
And now all the good kids are messing up
We're singing a song, we don't care if we're wrong
Watch what you say to me
The one on the only, the all for all
The words were scribed on every page and now there's
A lighter heart A lighter load
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
There is a view that reaches far 
Strong as I feel
So tired of life
Her elephant with the laughing call
 years on that hill
Well, she was my catatonic sextoylovejoydiver
Ignoring the phoneI'd rather say nothing
As I say goodbye
And true love waits
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
No way
No, I can't forget tomorrow
I really don�t know why I have to care
But I'll still love you more tomorrow
Come on, come out, come here, come here
I'd always want you
I just need something to believe in
So sad her eyes 
I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck
Getting nothing in return
As you walk away,
There's a skeleton in every man's house,
I will leave this town just to sleep underneath your bed
I thought I sold my soul but he kept the receipt
Really wanna prove to us today
Take me I need your help
And you're coming up roses
All the way through
The smell of death is in the air
I didn't mean to waste your time
And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars
Where no one knows my name
Now there's a hole in the head of this wounded liar
Can't find no poison, now I've got no cure
They look at me with scorn
Some people take her for granted
'Cause you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
If you knew the man I used to be
And all of this and her dark hair, oh Lord
Yes, I feel too young to hold on
And I remember every word you said
Whenever I run to you, lost one
But now you never show that to me, do ya
Please, please, I'm begging, please
And it never would have gone away, no
I had a feeling once
I close my eyes and the room is spinning
And I fell so fast in seth ott's bedroom
But the lows are so extreme that the good seems fucking cheap
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
And I'm on my way
I took some time away for understanding
You'll never return to this place
Collapse the light into earth
I dreamt a hydrant
Say that you love me
I'm waiting for some kind of a miracle
You called me out
Oh I was living on borrowed time in a
A black wind took them away
What have I got to do to make you care
C'mon it's time to go
To let you grow into the person that I know, that I know you can be
God can be funny
I got the antiChrist in the kitchen yelling at me again
As I'm watching you walk away
So I'll know it's you and that it's over, so I won't even try
I'm still driving away
I wish the way that I dressed was your favourite kind of style
'Cause, honey, it's over
That I'm the one you really want to grow old with
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right, yeah
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
Conversations competing for space
He left with my heart
There is no one here but me
I pray that something picks me up
Nothing could be bring me near
And just say the things I'll probably never get a chance to say
Even practice and parties seem long
She talks about her love
I'm the moron who dances, ah
A magic trick makes the world disappear
Left in a disguise for the faraway
My life is good, my love's a mess
Well and I can and I die
I heard that your dreams came true
So remember me when I'm gone
These aren't tears of sadness because you're leaving me
Oh yeah
The reflection in the water showed an iron man still trying to salute
And they ask you how you're feeling
Fully loaded, deaf and dumb and done
'Cause it's gonna be alright, why don't you tell me again
I hate my life, hold on to me
'Cause black is how I feel on the inside
Torn into pieces
I started to fade away away away
Colours fade and turn to shades of grey
Unbreak my heart
And never as bright
If I was to walk away
Every drunk step I take leads me to her door
Hasn't anybody told you
And then I'll cry so hard to these sad songs,
But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
It must be your skin I'm sinkin' in
And glows in the dark
Baby, you're a lost cause
You can't remember, you try to move your feet
Drop me a line
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
They might be psycho killers but tonight I really don't care
Ik wees was Sie jetz denken  dat denken viele Aber ik bins nich
I wanna run too
I couldn't love you more
Tell me its just a lie
Twenty ways to know
Out glaring geezers' stares
I heard you're coming back to life just for the fourth
Knowing you don't care
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you
About a land far way
There's something wrong
Ship it out and turn it into fuel
Every time I rise I see you falling
A boy spotted her from afar do be do be do do,
I just wanna go back to being the same I wanna go back, I wanna go back, baby
From the city to the south 
That you were an island and I passed you by
It's like a lie I told a thousand times
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
I'll never forget, the sound that night
Not pushing you down and all around
All I really care is you wake up in my arms Wake up in my arms
Sunshine for a brother Old man winter's in the air"
The streets are empty
Farewell my dear ones
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
"Shall we look at the moon, my little loon
For a while, with the vertigo cured
Give me these moments back
Do you ever hear me calling
Don't hold on to the past
A house where nobody lives
See I thought love was black and white
My head will burst, my life will end
Always trying to pave the way for women in a man's world
Oh shit, I'll go cook myself a brew
And as for the clouds
I see it all now that you're gone
Here I am, there's nothing left for you
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
She would change everything, everything
No one's left to stop you now
I'll think of days when there was something to believe
In my lover's arms I move in time
Think we will ever die
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Everlasting like the sun Melanie C Everlasting like the sun
Wake up from this dream
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow
Give me your lips and with one kiss we begin
Into another day, another day
And she said that I was the brightest
I could feel myself under your fate
You can take anything
Well, go on ahead and take this the wrong way
This used to be the place we ran to
What's that you're saying there oh well,
And keep that song out of your mind
I never was free
Yeah, I've made that mistake before
I am sorry that you came to find
But both of our hearts believe
Oh I do believe
We may race and we may run
But the same ol' song
She looks in distress
The sun on the sand, on her knees and her hands
Child has arrived in the darkness 
Riding on waves, walking on sand
Is that a fact Delilah 
My most is nothing more
To say "I love you" right out loud
I know that kiss will be my last, 
And though I love you
Today I stumbled from my bed
Goodbye sunshine
A carefully laid plan
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
That kept us apart
So I'd prefer to be remembered as a smiling face
You're everything that we can't see
Be my friend
Waking up from this nightmare
My point of balance was askew
On the first train to Mexico, ooh
Yeah I just wanna die without you
And I won't answer if you call
Your mouth was so dirty
And they say 'We've got some bad news, sir'
I'm running fast
So long, my luckless romance
It's a day that I'll never miss
As the days go on and the places fade away
And I'm sorry if I dissed you
The straight to your heart times
Sweet lover, you should've come over
We found him with his face down in the pillow
I see you give that look goodbye
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
And I drink a little more than recommended
Howling hallelujah
Now we are one
Another way around you
To wash you off my skin
There's such a chill
Oh, are you one of them
Her baby's on the way, with nothing left inside
Do you care if I don't know what to say
There's no force behind my mouth
Fall in between the crack of the bed and the wall
Many years have passed since those summer days
Oh my love
Your neighbors were screaming, I don't have a key for downstairs
We need to find
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
When I'm not, ooh
Well, is it true what they say about the Son of God
I hate to show that I've lost control
He deals the cards as a meditation 
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Even though I know you're not comin' home
In the middle of the night they
It's worth my time
Hey, baby
It's just that he's not around to play along, yeah
Lights from the jungle to the sky
Your friends that turn to liquid
Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes, and never really had a chance
Hear the nighthawks cry
Where there's no one here but me
Mother I lost it, all of the fear of the Lord I was given
Shiny guitar hung on gold lamé
I'd feel sorry for us instead
There were times you really made me cry and
She painted filigrees, she was the acid queen
You never really can fix heart
From here to Birmingham, I got a few friends
You have no home, you have no walls
But it don't matter at all
Try to find out what makes you tick as I lie down
And everything about you
Withering where some snowman was
And laughing break the mirror sweet
I fell again like a baby
Look at me, I'm falling and I'm falling
Your eyes blackened by 
Witness trust fade away
You said you hated my tone, it made you feel so alone
I'm just killing time
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
We all end together
Autumn, I will bring you back to life,
Severed myself from my own life
Or say things to hurt you
You come to me with a bone in your hand
Or mistakes
Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven
Nothingman
This is her dress that I loved best
As I go moving crying the tears
I wanna run with the wild horses
I'm with you in the morning
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
Holding tight and try not to hide how I feel
Washed up thirty miles west
It seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
And let me run
Pleading one word
Of the life you could have had
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
To fix this one last time
Ask the moon
And love is blind, but that I knew when
And it was easier to lock the door
Don't waste your time on me
I might believe you if I didn't know
What is there to answer if I'm the only one
It's only 'cause I wanted to
Our last dance together
It was only one hour ago
I guess somebody got somethin' they
Look right through me, look right through me
Lying here, lie
You see your breath in the air
My head is empty
Take a deep breath, take in all that you could want
But she's not afraid to die
If these arms were meant to hold her
I remember it clearly
That I'm sorry for the things I've done Uh
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me
Saying please forgive me
But now the sun shines cold
And nobody ever asks
Just to break me like a promise
Someone I could become
Another coughing, shaking fit in a bathroom
The river flows
So close, no matter how far
Driving down the pitch black road
Is it fashion or disease Postironic, remains a mouth to feed
When you need directions
It is a better side of you to admire
After he's flown away
I don't want to play the brokenhearted girl
Eli, the barrow boy when they found him
Call girl, no phone
Because they said she was not a good mother
It's gonna take her to get home
Pretending life is worth the fight
I kissed you
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
The caves of our mouths are bear's bellies
Really loves my company
And she's scarce above the gunwales
Oh Jesus Christ he wasn't to know
You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while
Selfless, cold and composed
Tease me, by holding out your hand
This man comes to me
That can mesmerize the soul
About your Jesus, and how not to look back
Let the funeral start,
Always so much fun to me
And how much did it cost
Slip away
To cover the thing he was scared of
The reasons all have run away, but the feeling never did
Leaking rain on the phone
Never reaches ears on distant stars
I believe there's positive, negative, positive, negative
Show your rays when things come undone
Fly away from here
We hope that you choke
I've felt you touch before I know your way
My, way home
And run to them, to them, full speed ahead
So let's give up the ghost
I will not watch the ocean, 
He was a sucker for your doubledose
Why wasn't God there for
Get your Tbone
Oh where oh where, can my baby be
Sorrow in my soul
Time heals everything
And I'm thinking 'bout calling on Jesus
Maria says she's dying, through the door I hear her crying
I'll sail away
But I still hope
But they believe her
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny
If I was standing on the balcony
Yes for tonight I'll lay here with you
Wherever you're headed
At the end of the line
As they put you down inside
You look like a skeleton, a little dressy thing
To remind you where to stop 
Love of mine
If I lived till I was a hundred and two
Two can be as bad as one
Now I must come back down
I got a joke I've been dying to tell you
I need your money, it'll help me
Well, I no longer hear the Music when the lights go out
If you don't wanna tell me you love me babe
I feel the pain and I cry out
And all along the fire below would rise
And they got nothin' else to think of
I'd love you anywhere
I was just thinking that I have been missing you for way too long
Blood on the floor,  fleas on their paws, and you cried till the morning
Calling for his mother, then me
I can't believe my hearts still pounding
Immerse your soul in love
Calls me on the phone
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I want to leave my mark so everyone will know
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me 
Fire's not burning
Beside me today
Through these towns they built to change
Warm canals and pools clear blue
And where was I before the day
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
You're there through my wasted nights,
Ash and urn and silence
A while ago somewhere I don't know when
I thought we'd get to see forever
That with the door closed, shades drawn
The littlest things that take me there
Catching teardrops in my hands
I wonder if you have the same dreams too
They'll do their best to change you
The aching starlet
Looking very somber looking for his mom
In circles 'round the well and where it spells
'Cause I been caught in between all I wish for and all I need
I'll sing it one last time for you
I got away from you, I never thought I would
Did it all get real, I guess it's real enough
The heart wants what it wants
For today is on my mind
Dead hearts are everywhere
There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive
She has started 
How 'm I gonna keep myself away from me
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
For every second chance,
If we don't move together, come closer
Just hand me down, give me a place to be
And everybody's got to live their life
Looking out on my roof last night
You poisoned all your children
I couldn't face a life without your light without your light
Son I know you don't want her to go, but someday you'll change your mind
But no bonds can hold me from your side
Stare as I hang, it's all the same
All the things that you needed from me
You're like a dream come true
O, Katrina Why you gotta be mean
Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
All the angels praying for me
She thought daddy was a wonderful guy
The letter's in your coat
Finished if who we are incomplete 
You have no right to ask me how I feel
I could still feel you in my bed
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
Ha ha ha You died out long ago
Hate me today
Got a broken heart and a name on my cast
To trade a common comfort for a view
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Said, "Do you kids know what time it is"
She lives a life she didn't choose
Can you now return to from where you came
The way it is, we're on land
What if there was no light
Lonely, that's not quite my problem
The talk of the town
And I won't pretend I understand
It's every players favourite crime, to make you feel
I hear your name
Since we drank to the sunset until it was gone
And count the time in quarter turns to ten
Safe to say from here, you're getting closer now 
You are second hand smoke
We've had the romance of the century 
Because there's some lives you live
Here on neutral ground
I'm reaching for the phone
Oh well, it seems like such fun
With the backup, makeshift life in waiting
You wanted someone else to say
Building up inside of me
No one here beside me
The best friend that eluded you lost in time
Let me know I'm just on the outside
"Bobby, don't look back"
My hand won't hold you down no more
Here's your warning
And dead does he love you
Have I still got you to cross my bridge in this storm
No matter what I say
Now I'm trying to wake you up
When I realize I was acting all wrong
I may just never see you again or might as well
It's rush hour
Get the flan in the face
Stranger came and pulled a gun, grabbed her by the arm
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
We're either riders, or fools behind the reins
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And my mom hates my guts
See nothing wrong, see nothing wrong
You're the only one for me
Return in the caves
Marries into what she needs
Well what would you say, if I said that you could"
But this may be my last song
Someone's deciding whether or not to steal
Played Gloria, talking about Hosanna
Other people know it by heart
That way there's no way, I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces
I am done with it
Another year ago today
Two words that could describe
Standing over your head
But New York cares
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
And I am true to my heart now
Why broken cisterns never could stay filled
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
What a piteous thing, a hideous thing
Oh, God, please
Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend
I never tried to feel this vibration
And no one knows who's in control
And so nothing left to say
But anger, her skin makes them sick in the night
He's going to change my name
So that the pure can shut their doors
And the genius next door was sleeping
A family in crisis that only grows older
There's a place where you are going
Someday I might I might find myself looking in your eyes
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Still
And I'm hanging on to the words you say
Stop charging, my darling, get closer, be quiet
That hangs in a basement
It's been a long day coming and long will it last
Everybody knows it 
And I was thinking 
So there was none 
At who I've become
Louis was my dearest friend
Never now we need the other centralize the force of rot
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything, but boy, I couldn't give it to you;
On this one
Don't you dare ask why
And I've, got all the symptoms
Und wenn es regnet, weiß ich, dass du manchmal weinst
To get closer to Heaven than ever feel whole again
As to want someone like me
All I need is
And New York is getting kind of cold
What's written inside of your head
To explain to you I would have walked
Twilight fades through blistered avalon
'Cause you know her tricks and you know her past, when she makes a face you just have to laugh
Why are we strangers when 
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head"
Love is just a piece of time
Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you
But these feelings won't go away 
But I'm so hard to handle, I'm selfish and I'm sad
So come on baby, let's go shut it down
Safely to the ground
Goodnight and thank you
How do we call this love
Who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees
Can you stop the train
When the rain came down and we took cover
Take it all away
And maybe finally split the rhyme
And a shadow is cast on devotion
Sing like you think no one's listening,
You see the cripple dance
As drunken men find flaws in science
The deeper the thoughts, there's no more pain
Dust devil swept you away
And what are you left with
Would I could afford to buy my love a fine gown
I put my hand in my father's glove
The worries are washed out to sea
I know you cry
Do I know what you are feeling now
This is the way that we love And I'm wastin' everyday
Your devils and your gods, all the living and the dead
I want you to fly not stop and start
It's okay  this'll help, inside
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
That's the time you miss her most of all
Talking all night "please stay up" but
Death is no dream,
I wanna' make you feel the same
I need a little loving tonight
A ghostlike sense of state
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there
Burst out and from its shattered shell
I can still see all your clothes thrown on the floor
Ambition cuts us down
I come home
Longing from a distance
In the blink of an eye
So leave me in the cold
Was right there in your smile
And there are melodies in the air
When you left that night
Pushing out before I sleep
I saw the future once
We're far from obvious this time  
I thought we'd be sexy together
Its empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
Maybe it's all right
If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
You got no chance at all
Take my photo off the wall
Though I don't know how I feel
Felt the chill upon my face
At every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
And Martha, Martha, I love you can't you see
But baby, I just need one good one to stay
And all I wish is gone away
This song is for the people
This could be heaven
You combed your hair inside that mirror,
I'm standing underneath the stars
Like gold, like gold, like gold
Yeah, yeah everything is wonderful now
And say I love you too
That river's flowing
That in time things must grow
It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming
und auf die Wege hinterm Waldesrand
Or the lies I'll tell you every time
This is a song about the everyday occurrences that make me feel like letting go
We both could see crystal clear
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments
And no one understands, my dear, no one really cares
I did him wrong
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But I thought you would be sure
'Cause these last three years
You don't know how lucky you are
I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
Break my heart
�Cause I can't get you back, can't get a second chance
As she walks out the door
'Cause though he's gone
That you loved me all this time
These are the tears
I gave my life away
Although she needs you more than she loves you
I keep holding onto you
When I see stars, I feel in your hand
The hidden law of a probable outcome 
A part of me is gone
I have called you preacher, I have called you son
Oh, the rain falls hard on a humdrum town
I just want to love you when the day is done
One for you and one for me and
And ohoh, I can feel her, she's dying
Got to walk out of here
We just don't care anymore
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
Now all we do is fight
Child, nothing's right, if you ain't here
I played my cards too late
River of time, river
Musky tear, suitcase
And I thought I wouldn't have to be
The last thing that she sees before they turn off all the lights
Chat at the bartender in the cold top steeples
I couldn't find a friend around
On the walls
The good times that made us laugh
Will some day turn back to batter like a joke
For the one who had a name
So grab your mother's keys, we leave tonight
Note to single M Why did you not show up
I'm never gonna let it slip away
And you, you always have a reason
I'd stop my dreaming
I won't tell you lies
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
They're playin' some kind of game
It's way too broke to fix
Karen, miss communication, Karen, Karen
My friends keep telling me hey life will go on
To pass time; let us go and rob the blind
You won't need a real job because I would love to pay for you
Belly's not even tingling, I just feel a bit pissed
The mayor's machines are there cleaning the pavement
But she up and died 
That her eagerly death had had
If your hand's a little cold
I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Run to the lobby where I saw you try
When you stand in front of my eyes
And I know my time is surely gonna come
You think your days are uneventful
There is a blacksmith and there is a shepherd and there is a butcherboy
But if you don't change your situation
Tryin' to get my mansions green Tryin' to get my mansions green
Who hurled themselves into the ocean
I will still hear you
Welcome to the soldier side
You love love love, then you die
Why you gotta be mean
Instead I've found no meaning
Your plan is flawed from the start
And you were somehow the rain this thing could allow
Stillborn the trust in you 
If you just give me a sign
You're drunk sick from whoring 
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
Different people I've found
Weeds blow tall on a broken train track
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
So if I leave my room
The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own
And don't embrace the past 
She's a tear that hangs inside my soul forever
There's nothing left to try
Looks like an early winter for us
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
It's dangerous, to be sleepin' alone
And even though you never knew it, well I knew
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say
When I found out this love's undone
Let the clouds roll
A drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
And watching you walk away
To paint in the caves
The books suggest we set our hearts
To end
That's abandoned and cold
Oh, all my old friends, they don't know me now
To wait until the morning train arrives
Someday my pain will mark you
Who couldn't get things right
Was it everything you hoped for
Armageddon, come Armageddon
But I swear you didn't care
These days
Everybody trying to put us down
It's such a selfish way to lose
I've got another  'nother  miles
The pressure of days, do what I say
I will settle in and dream
The city of death
Do you look for hope in other people's eyes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
When I broke my bone, he carried me up from the riverside
You've got to be so strong
And it was be wonderful,
So stay the night
Full of broken thoughts
But you still can find me if you ask nicely
Baby, let me love you
My hands before my fading eyes
 years old I remember when my father told me, "Son,
Always waiting 
Last night they said the fire had spread and we said our prayers
And the man you will marry The home you will share
Come along if you dare
I feel like I am watching everything from space
Daddy please, don't take the girl
Often I sit down and think of you for a while
Try to love again
And what did I do that you can't seem to want me
Casting your gaze way out to no man's land
They call holidays an option for a reason
Don't cut me down just yet, I'll make things right again
I always get lost when I leave the village
All the glitz messiahs just pass the time
Oh my friend, how did you come
I need fuel  to take flight
Oh, Lover, you should've come over
Throw me in the water
Though I know you call me selfish for assuming
That we hope to achieve
Oh, everybody sees right through
That you can just follow and push around
To mend that shelf
Dry your eye
Lessons learnt
Best of starts, the broken heart, the stone
Hard work forever pays
I feel you
Oh, river of time
The first things I noticed about you
Still with feet touching
No one's got much to say in this town
No one left for you
All along, not that strong without these open arms
It's the same old storyline 
I miss you, I guess that I should,
I just want to hold you when you're not enough
Cause you always learn to hold the things you want to say
Everything's cool, yeah
Spread your wings to the wind
Give up your heart left broken and let that mistake pass on
With the last breath of my
Every time you address me
You in the sea
And dream of sheep
All these pieces 
Tender you go
Sweetheart, got so much freedom
And I miss the way you made me feel
No you can't come in
And once again I turn to you
Find it in music
The soft and the black and the velvety
I know the past will catch you up as you run faster I know the last in line is always called a bastard
I thought how could I think of leavin'
Oh, well, I never meant to cause you no pain;
Cold wind blowing
I can be all you need
But we run back, scratching at the door
Would mean your life was over
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
I love you, anyway I love you I love you, anyway I love you
You're there through my wasted life
Her mother hides the pearls 
I done drawn a line between you and me
I am terrified of all things
I'm chasing all the words
Now the sky is pink
Never tell the truth
Tomorrow holds such better days
Doch der Abend wirft ein Tuch aufs Land
You come to bury me
I found you here, now please just stay for a while
I've been waiting for something,
Sees some people smoking off to the side
Oh, clouds of time
For I've found myself attached to this railroad track
I got a life to lead
I just want to make sure you are really okay and wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication too
In between molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide
Rain fall and voice sound
And I loved her
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
And I always was
And the castrated ones
Every lonely night that I sit and pray
Can't say I agree
Back to the time
And it's crowded and cold
No one knows why she did the things she's done
Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
When it's burning inside
When the needle didn't sting
And I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
You are the one You are the one You are the one You are the one
Blood suckers hide beneath my bed
I have a feeling you don't know what to do
Been living in an idea
The rain pushes
What are you hoping for
I guess you didn't know
Looking ahead
So this world
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Think I just remembered something
I smile as it burns
Trading places with an angel now
Oh but I have to say
Alright, now help me out boys
And if you die, I want to die with you
Until you are ready to confess
You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
Way outside your safety zone
And this bottle of beast is taking me home
Do you miss the blend
I wish these  hours would never end
I found myself face down in the ditch
My eyes were wet and red
There's no need to argue anymore
White queen how my heart did ache
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
Why do you show me those sad, sad eyes
'Cause they know your playboy mommy
I be dreaming a dream in a thought
I just want you to be mine,
She says she's right here, she seems so distant
You ate your words wrong this time
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Just as sure as none at all
Everything inside of my head
Well, the night makes moves
Sought by single M Nothing too heavy
Well, there was a time when you let me know
Walking up the hill tonight
You know it's time to say goodbye
Nobody lives
Would blow me away
Father set our house ablaze
Down the Forth, into the sea
Everything was beautiful
And love is not a victory march
I can't say no to you
If you turn the bad in me into good again
See me crumble and fall on my face
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you
Talk about your big mistakes Hey Shan, nice going
Stars at night turned deep to dust
So next time I see you, I'll be pleased to see you
They left me dizzy, oh, won't you please forgive me
All in all, it's been a pretty good year
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me, c'mon
mainly when it's cold 
You're the nicest thing I've seen
You make me cry
And alarm bells ring when you say your heart still sings
Over forbidden lines
Sail away with me
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere, with anyone
My lover's gone,
In the heart of December
Still I'll try, try again, try again
Leave all your love and your longing behind
Slender fingers
Up for air from the swimming pool
Into eternal space
You turned to me and said,
Will you help me to feel the glow
And that REM song was playing
Turns us into compromise
Here, silent all these years
Well I hope the ground is what you find
'Cause nothing compares
From the madness of the governments
Oh, Mary's ambitious, she wanna be a politician
And I will remember you
Just one sign that could show me that you gave a shit
But there's one thing we've got going
So if you lost a sister, someone's lost a mom
We never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way
Well now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
If you change your mind I'll come, come, come
My lady soon will stir this way
Man, it's a miracle that she's not living up in a tree
My brother's first child
Told him I was drowning
Watching the days go by
Close your eyes
And I don't want to feel this no more
I still love you
A history so deep it hurts to look
Give us life again 'cause we just wanna be whole
To trade the handshake for the fist
I wanna' bleed show the world all that I have inside
Oh, unbreak my, unbreak my heart, oh baby
I could never care enough
When I was young, younger than before
To always get me through the day
To settle for a place with some nice views
Long before I knew
There's no control, are you with me now
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it
And the winter moves about Illinois
I show the scars of every fear and doubt
I'm a mouth that doesn't smile
How can you love what it is you have got
Of what brought us here today
I know there was something that we could compare
Sunday is gloomy,
As you lay down on your side
I will not put on a smile
All the cards
Well, summer's gonna come,
And if you come and meet me tomorrow
Starry, starry night
There is nothing as lucky, as easy, or free
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
Ev'ry morning brings a new day
See now a star is born
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
But no one will give me a map
the truth is that i also 
Oh, I wish you knew the deal, gotta learn from far away
We will say goodbye to flesh and blood
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger
Even if I died
Shine a little light
It's all the same if everybody leaves her
That if you fall, stumble down, I'll pick you up off the ground
Kiss me now you'll catch your death
And you who were bewildered by a meaning;
I was looking for another you
'Cause I will come for you
I'll swallow poison until I grow immune
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier 
I was far away
And you were left feeling so alone
Remains a sordid twist of fate
Cause lord knows I could use a warm kiss
I can't survive on a halfhearted love that will never be whole
Shake it, shake it baby
I'll be big enough for both of us to say
The uneven way that you move
Baby, I just need one good one to stay
Sometimes I hang my head
Oh, oh, baby please don't go, oh yeah
You'll fall asleep
I met a girl, a snowball in hell
But more the crowds that walk all over me
I say I won't be long
The smell of rain in the air con
Either one of them things will do
Passed out on the floor 
I've seen you a couple of times
Thinking through the day
But I just see the memories
There is a black river
Saturday,  miles
But I'm still not right 
Your smile would make me sneeze
Will you do all these things
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
Your sister groans, 'oh, usurper to the holy throne'
What country shall I say is calling from across the world
Why did you leave me in silence
I'll be the first to say that now I'm okay
And I'll wait my turn
Lonely and forgotten
Oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine
Feels like I'm looking at life 
Why did you try at the choice
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Is what I was tryin' to do
The years go on and
Do you know how I feel
Sick of all these wasted years
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
Now I see you in a better place
Let me apologize while I'm still alive
Do you miss your little girl
Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
You'll never dream again
I guess this is growing
Recollection brings me back
Help me understand the years
To start
In our love
Or you'll end up a wreck
Yeah, it can always turn
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
You want to fuck some other women, now
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
"Oh whatever he has done I have done"
When I dream I dream of your kiss
You're the only one that knows
So bring me back my girl
Until I fall asleep
Those things I said
People keep pushing me though, no reception on the phone
Step out the front door like a ghost into the fog
And the road the old man paved
But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
That sorry seems to be the hardest word
And I feel you forget me
Gather up its harm in gauze with grateful arms
When somebody loved me
No, I'm not sorry if I do insult you 
And live with what I did to you 
I'm everywhere, I feel so high
One day I thought I'd see her with her daddy by her side
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away
'Cause your walk with a pelvis, white boy Elvis
I thought the older women would like me if I did
Roll away
Do you think I wanted to turn back around and teach a class
So let's face it, this was never what you wanted
Everything's gonna be alright
I got the bruises to prove it
I just don't care anymore
In case you would come walk in
You know what you gotta do
Maybe then I'll sleep well, maybe then I'll drown you out
I play the ones from yesterday
The book of love is long and boring,
I'm gonna drop along the way today
Waiting until dark
And it's quite alright
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes,
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
If you're so very good looking
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
'Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never is
No, I don't need them 
It's my life
Is it too late to remind you how we were
I'm being cruel to be kind
They come here alone and they leave in twos
Each and anyone
Where you kiss the ass that I've exposed to you
As hours start to fade, deep into the night
My way to you
So aid my end while I believe I'm winning
This is just a dream
And then home
Sheep are counting me
The phone has been disconnected
We all come to an end,
And whatever's going down
Came around, never broken
Trying to remember
Well I got bones beneath my skin, and mister,
Motor window wind
From then on it was cold Campbell's from the can
All you have to do is cry 
Of this town
How did we get this far apart
So she sees sex as her way of leavin' hell
No, no, no, you are not alone
To chase one and I think I've found mine
Make yourself a photograph and laugh at me please
I left you in the right
You were perfect and I guess I'm just a creep
In a minute, sometime soon, maybe next time, make it June
And I have no way of knowing
That I never should have taken in the first place
Gave me your plastic bird
Come on skinny love, what happened here
Hard as hell just to comprehend, ya
Can only be another sign
Swings empty,
Cette chanson était la tienne
Now the game's been fought
They say I'm better off now
It's all ending
All the things that I wanna do over
My face it's all wet
Think there impressing, but they ain't do shit
Nestled in your wings, my little one
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
Love these days is getting rough
You are a funny bear
And what you least wanted, holds you down like a stone
And she thought about this irony as she stared back at the moon
Is this my life I'm wondering
I love you more than I can say
And there in the square he lay alone
Pretty words that you whispered
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
A man needs a maid
Let's spend the night in Jimmy Choo's
And you who hoped that underneath
You right where you are, from right where I am
On random notes of parchment I'm scrawling my existence,
It was hard to tell just how I felt,
Sometimes so it reminds me
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden
They're tears of joy
But don't walk away, don't walk away
C'mon, baby
So it's not hard to fall
Pinning space to the world
There's one thing that's still the same
This is the part of me that thinks all humans are ants
I'm hanging on another day just to see what you will throw my way
Isn't the ending so much as the start
Ah, ah, ah, you fell into our arms
One more little one I love you
They're only words, they don't hurt
It's sweet, lie motionless just staring at the ceiling
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
A safer car, baby smiling in backseat
But you need something to fill up the days
You might say that it's over
Your heart broke when the party died
and on any given day I'd rather ride a limousine
What was meant to be 
It must make you sad to know that nobody cares at all
I'm a sky that nothing wants to fly in
Her feeling she hides, her dreams she can't find
To even look upon
And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
For I've lost the last love
Now you say you're leaving California
You are "just another girl" 
Than the friends you try to keep
You smell of memory felttipped electric child
But for them nothing changed
And on the surface of the waters
A final sleep
I drink good coffee every morning
Like a thief in the night
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
And down with it went our pain and fear
As the hills turn from green back
Because it's hard to think I'll never get another chance
For all of this you're feeling
I just want to kiss you in the morning sun
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Someone somewhere dropped me on my cranium
I still remember the sun
The Lament of the Monastary ends the song
The scarf off of your clothesline
Your waning smile
Sidewalks
So alone in love,
With clouds between their knees
Help me to carry the fire
Of darkness in the valley
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Maybe not with a look
It's on, and being foolish won't cover up 
There were people, standin' all around
And God I mean it, God I mean it, I hope that I mean it
There's a windup man walking round and round
Tomorrow is tears
And I don't need your reasons
Until you've loved a love you had to lose
I still get lost in your eyes
'Cause it was you that wrote it too
I've come to realize we all have our place
The worst kind of sad
Boy, your boots can leave a mess
Promise is never over, never questioned it needed reply
You find that all her words
This is me pretending
Or the person
How I used to be and everything I'm cold
Are words that you whisper in my mind
The TV's blaring, the radio is turned up loud
Like those who curse their luck in too many places 
To wash away our pain
I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you
I step up the pace
But I'll be home, I'll be home
I cried so many, many nights
Can you bear not to share with your child
What you do to me is like a page right out of Ernest Hemingway
In the light of the sun
And I keep spot that we can go to chill
I lay in tears in bed all night
What have I done to myself
This song is for the rats
Call it predictable, yesterday my dream was of you
Through the nighttime, through the dawn
Let's be alone together
Tell me that you turned down the man
But it doesn't need to be saved
Try to keep myself away from myself and me
Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time
I just wade the tides that turned 
Don't wanna try don't wanna try I bout just had enough it's been a rough road
To lie here, under you, is all 
Somebody get me out of here,
You can sin or spend the night all alone
What is love but the strangest of feelings
The only thing we share 
And the moon is laying low
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want Is all I want
Would you say that one of your dreams
All of our friends were gathered there with their pets
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
And you just don't love me no more
And spending it all
Walked me up a story, asking how you are
We were born, we were born We were born to die
A fool of everyone
There's a picture on my kitchen wall
Here's the army that you mowed to the ground
As my jaw dropped to the ground
What have I become My sweetest friend
In the service of the heart alone
Stingy thingy into little me, me, me
A flag white as snow
Everything had changed, around me, mhmm
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
Not anymore, I've gone away
To camouflage your scars
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
And that God never blessed her insides
And live our lives, stigmatized
The way is clear if you're ready now
You fade into a shaded room
it's tearing up inside of me
Because it's time to arrive
Such a strange predicament we find ourselves in
Hindley wakes and says
I really didn't see us singing through this
But everything else is the same
But now that it's come
Slightly bemused by his lack of direction
But your mother kept it all inside
But I carry you on 
Yes for now we'll go on living separate lives
Soft winds blow round his head and his phone rings just once
In loving memory of the one that was so true
Tonight
Come again another day 
So many days
And you're probably hanging out and making eyes
Everything you hated me for Honey there was so much more
When it's all here and it's all new
Who will love you
Saw something in the way
I don't want to think about anyone
They told a tale of bad goodbyes
I looked across and fell in love
I'm not the the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now
I wish could remember
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
I see my vision burn, I feel my memories fade with time
Gave more than I took back, oh well So back away
I wanna' bleed, show the world all that I have inside
I just want something I can never have
Repenting other lives unknown
Guess I thought I could never feel
Lover, there will be another one
Violate me, show me your religion
I saw you this morning
No flags will fly, the sun will rise
I hope my love
Nothing's gonna change the things that you said
Would you dare to let it go
I waited for a while
Wish there was something I, could say or do
Just to lie with my mistakes 
I share it all with you
But my friend got to me before you
It's hard to win me back
And damned them all to hell 
Comprende mis white lines
This is my way of saying goodbye
Breathe Eve, save that one
Our hands are in the branches
You're all alone behind your eyes
Took our chance, crashed and burned
So who needs girlfriends
We don't need to say goodbye
All sorts of junk in the unattached spare room
You wouldn't have begged me to hold you
Makes no sense at all
Is that what you're talking about, Mickey
When you turn away from me
Does it matter
But please, I beg, don't do this to me
There's some things you can't hide
Before you advertise, all the fame is implied
Can I die with you so we can never grow old
I keep floating down the river but the ocean never comes
Old memories
Don't leave me stranded, don't leave me alone
The aching kiss before I feed
I'll say it loud here by your grave
And she is kind, he is free, full of knowing
Don't want to stay here
Now and forever you are still the one
Hey man, tricks can't wait to hear my emotions
Is answered with one touch
And run far away 
As I put my foot down to the floor
Those kilometers and the red lights
All full of wine the world before her
The damage is done The prodigal son is too late too late
I can't breathe 
Your mouth that never tells lies
But today
May God's love be with you
I thought I had designed for me
That try to hold on
I'm so lonely 
And the lines on your face did tell
Not to let anyone go
'Cause this will be the last time that I let you
"Baby please don't don't do this"
I say she drove him to suicide
I step outside my mind's eyes for a minute
Because of people who were "nice"
'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
Who do you think you are
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
Is everything is not as it's sold
Until that moment comes
Up in my steamer trunk
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away
All of my life I've tried so hard
Here we are Here we are
It's as thick as our skulls yet it's thinner than air
The broken clock is a comfort, it helps me sleep tonight
'Cause it acts just like lovers do, the satellite
Every word I've said
With no place to go, no place to go
For a girl in need of a tourniquet
Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me
Sharing pillows and cold feet
And you were right, right from the start, it took everything you had, but you finally broke my
You are the only one
I'm gonna leave it to stargazers
I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth
And now you save love again
At ugly girls like me
Yesterday seems like a, life ago
Cornereyed I saw it lock in
When the light of your life sighs,
You're stuck in the same old nightmare
What am I gonna do when I run out of lawn to mow
But I shit in your bathroom
A fist to the voice
Just remember when
Oh, Caroline, you
I dream of another you
Sometimes I wanna call you but I feel like a pest
No one here to help to see me through
Wish we knew this from the start
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
Every picture you paint
It's called Breakup
Cause the only thing I can see is her elegance
I can get to my sleep, I can think that we just carried on
She said one day she'd walk away
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
Know I'm right and do it right, could I get to be like that
If I could start again
It's a sorry sight
I hope the worst isn't over
To fight this feeling that is growing in my mind
And me, just another dream theory lost inside your eyes
That I should go and this should end
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them
Read the part and return at , it's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive
For the plentiful times that, 
Fly over a city of canals
Her love was a joke from the day that we met
Because it seems that it's always changing
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
I'm not feelin' up to it now
Oh my baby baby I want you so it scares me to death
So, don't make me sad, don't make me cry
This feeling is not sadness, this feeling is not joy
Has anyone, looked lovely
We still have time
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
Hers is the face I see when a certain mood moves in
Burned alive in the heat of a grieving mind
I wake up to find you lying awake with your hands in your head
She's leaving home
Try to put myself on on the inside
While the roaches climb the walls 
Your face against the trees
But you were in the shower when I got there, and I'd have wanted to stay 
Now I'm trying to be assertive
I'm sorry, could you repeat what you just said
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
'Cause I'm a begging kind of man
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me
Well it's alright
 Someday, they'll all be 
And the bathroom's still a mess
I don't want to see my parents go
You might sleep, but
Makes the morning sun
Love takes time
I don't want you back
I'm in the grass on my knees, wipe the leaves away;
"Daddy, look what I made", dad's gotta go catch a plane
You still have us
Blood and tears
Yes, I think we got a problem
I still, I still love you 
I�m not carefree, no
Of the slow and funny scene
And make him feel this pretty burn
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
I want you back
Man, it's been a long day
Every second of my life I only live for you
And if you don't then lie
She's the one that makes my dreams
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
Do you see how much I need you right now
Kills you when you are young
With a smile on her face
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
We never get so close as when the sunward flight begins
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
Some of them got closer than others
Are you missing the love of your kin
There's nothing wrong that wasn't wrong before
I don't care for myself
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit"
And all my brothers and my sisters yeah
Walk the alleys in the dark
I have to cover my eyes
You touch my hand and start the car
Searching for something
In all I've done
'This night always falls again
Where are you now I can hear footsteps I'm dreaming
Years go by, will I choke on my tears
Passed out on the overpass, Sunday best and broken glass
How to fight loneliness
Total control
What they promise and their word isn't good
The white trash boys listen to their headphones
There isn't one nail without dirt under it 
And I have walked these streets so long
I feel unhappy, I feel so sad
It's full of flowers and heartshaped boxes,
'Cause this life is long
I'm gonna miss you girl,
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
It's a comedy of errors, you see It's about taking a fall
I will fight for one last breath
Your strength is in my hand
Sew this up with threads of reason and regret
Hell, there's plenty of light still left in your eyes
Walking down Brick Lane, feeling blue
With someone else
When he gets that call, he's too far gone
Why must life be so tough
Then something unusual, something strange 
Close up these eyes, try not to cry
It's a lonely book 
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
So please forgive what I have done
It's a hard thing faking a smile when I feel like I'm falling apart inside
And that's the end and that's the start of it
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
We hold out our pans with our hands to catch them
Making more friends would be easy
That has you choking on the truth
And my brother and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah
I wanna get this right
I wince a little, but it's not because I know the truth
No one deserves it
I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
But you don't really care for music, do ya
Nothing's quite how it seems 
And I'll walk away
Clinging to his picture for dear life
Flesh and blood and the first kiss
We might take it home
Say anything, say anything
And I found myself attached to this railroad track
That I started looking for a warning sign
We should mind, the war child
No one gets to come in
Saw your face
Sidelong and glancing still in tiny dancer land
That I can't shake those memories
Once divided and nothing left to subtract
That today is grey skies
She says you're not there and I should take care
A constant reminder of where I can find her
I should've watched those eyes,
They've been looking around
And I simply needed space, space for me to be
And I think of someone else instead
I saw hatred in his eyes
Seems so very sad for you
I opened my eyes
Then back in the car
And breathes it out, he says,
And when those tears have run out
I can't wait till I get home
Since the end of World War II
Close enough to start a war
When we were liars, lovers in combat
Late night you make me feel like I'm desperate, I'm not desperate
Never thought she'd look my way
I found what I need in you
I'd do anything for you, anything for
I came back to haunt you
So leave me at the roadside
A little boy inside
You couldn't love
It's so noisy at the fair
I was speaking soft, see the pain in your eyes
"Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy  no stop it"
I can tell, I can tell how much you hate this
I'm not your family
The things you've told him all along
I want you to trouble me
Does it hurt to hear me say
Leave your fear in the fray
Through the eyes of a fly on the wall
And living down
You had nine lives and one by one you chewed 'em up
You called me from the room in your hotel
Watch me now, and I'll be someone new
You gotta make a decision
To find a little girl by your side in the wood box where you're sleeping
Let's stay up late and smoke a jay
Now he's lighting up the wrong way, something for the pain
And the tumblers are drained and then flooded
I guess we'll have to move
'Cause you feel like home
Seeing lights, feeling pain, there's my cure on ice
All my friends now try to save me
Is the rise of an eastern sun
And I can't stop bumping into things
That I never really meant to stay
Me to feel I'm falling
And we both like to stretch the truth
A punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters
Broken inside me, it falls apart
And though he was ashamed that he had took a life
If you walk away, I'll walk away"
All the lonely people
A year ago tonight we lay
So I crawl back into your open arms
If spring can take the snow away
I am on the mend
I can only give you everything I've got
If your soul was deep just like mine is, then you would known not to give up
And they talk to me
I don't dream about anyone  except myself
Why some stay, others go
And if I hadn't set aside the fact that you were brokenhearted
When the day is done
It's more than just words, it's just tears and rain
When she thought up that I should be with you
Hey now, count a thousand, million people, that's astounding
Bury your face in my shoulder
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
More hearts bein' broken, more people being used
Find a way to lie
Somebody oughta take you in
To buy the truth and sell a lie
To my troubled mind
Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin
If we fight what's true, will we ever be
That is, dear, everyone but you
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
Said, "Time has bridled us both, but I remember you too"
Maybe we'll forget, I hope we don't forget
And it stings when it's nobody's fault
Oohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohooh, momma
nadie piensa en ti como lo hago yo 
The winter stripped the blossoms bare
I've been washing the sand
My worst nightmares became real
You're everywhere inside my room
Or what I'm supposed to say but
As we round the corner
Of your November downtown
And my heart opens up to you
I gotta get you back today
From breathing easy, and talking straight
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
And everything's so strange
You're free with a history
And spaceboy, they'll kill me
We die forever
Burning in his eyes
And a candle burning bright
I hold my breath
Was really just a song inside my head
You can always review on your own little screen
Don't tell me everything is wonderful now, no
Our hair is in the garden
Everyone I know goes away in the end
Removing all your skin
Maybe you'll leave the light on
All the everything you win
Came 'round the corner at a rate
But your verse got trapped inside my head
Cracked up years ahead are all I see
I thought that my first love would be my wife
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
So I'll watch your life in pictures
And you should've left the light on
Now I'm drunk as hell on a piano bench
And are soaked from the morning light
Hold on, hold on, my brother
And there's a time, ooh
They're all scared and stiff
Weepin' and drownin' my senses
I can't do this alone
Beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads
No more words
With all the memories that I got
If I find my own way
She pulls away, my arms are tightly clamped round her waist
And though I covered my eyes I knew
Or maybe you're in disguise
And it feels so real
And the storm keeps on twisting
So please wake up
Counting stars again x
You made me smile with my heart
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
I will see you again a long time from now
Suitcase for way too long
But I feel old and tired
Take everything
Their only desire is to die
And pain is just a simple compromise
And soon enough my strength will return
And we're alone, love
It's a shame that it had to be this way
The strangers whose faces I know
Final breath
He had another face
As they stared to the sand,
I wanted you tonight
I was impressionable, I was upsettable
As your name is carved in stone
As my life flashes before my eyes
I go to the places where we used to
Fly away
The edge of the world 
Dust and water, water and dust
See the muddy hoofprints where he carried you
Mum says me and you are the same from the start
I want you on my side
I'm only here to witness the remains of love exhumed
At the shallow end 
I pray that you'd come to my door
Sometimes
The wind blows so light
It could be a joke, it could be a statement
You bring up the soft side in everyone
I can't believe you let me down
Did it happen when we first kissed
All the words we said
Time's running backwards from me and you
That's the high and that's the heart of it
Then those around who care
Ever searching for the one
Boys get discovered as winter melts
I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do
Don't you talk to me
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
Sometimes I pretend
Old friends, old friends
Now and forever･･�
When I wake up, well I hope I'm gonna be
You just slipped through my fingers
To be alone
I never got your name, I assume you're thirtythree
And from the sidelines, I see you run
Yeah, we never talk about the past anymore
You had sent into the sky by now had crashed 
Spinnin' in the night sky
That I'm tired of calling you once a week
Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
He looks up at the sky
Summer's getting colder 
As if from a distance
I was your fortress, you had to burn
And every birthday card I threw away
To tell them that they've got you all wrong
Into the night with me
She knew someone
It's such fun
You have made yours worth mine
I'd spend a lifetime with you
Now it's like a fairytale without a happy ending Happy ending
To see the way that light attaches to a girl
Collapse the light into earth
Yes and the morning has me
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
Did you know what you were doing, did you know
'Cause I, I keep going right back
Since you're gone there is a lonely heart
Another war to fight
This moment is perfect
You'd be hers if only she would call
I saw her face on the back of the door
On the first train to Mexico
No you can't, you can't come in
Total control
The pictures that she sees make her cry
Some sun had gotta rise
Down, downstairs to the man, he's gonna make it all okay
I took a walk with my fame down memory lane
You won't see me cry
Pretty Mary K is off in somebody's room
Fall down beneath their own weight
Only hoping as time goes you can forget
So mother, I thank you thank you
Nothing to hide
Bringin' new tears 
I have a lot to think about
The words might come out better
Stephanie says that she wants to know
Hold memory close at hand
Tonight you're sleeping alone
When they told me that there was no saving you
You are, you are, you are my everything
'Cause soul mates never die
I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes
And it's so hard not to search
And I love the pain
Lisa  Lisa, sad Lisa  Lisa
What's the point in all this screaming
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I am not your friend
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
Sing it like it's going to be your last day
I open up my wallet and it's full of blood
Oh, but maybe I'm just too young
And the German dwarf dances the butcher's son
Of the arms you said you'd never leave
You wash them clothes
Midsweet talk newspaper word cutouts paper word cut outs
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
Away, away
Than a place we've been before
All the flowers that you planted mama, in the back yard
Rain clouds come to play again
Hopelessly drift in the eyes of the ghost again
And I only understand every other word
Better call on evolution, better way to make a revolution
Talk to the tears
Send photo to address, is it you or me
You got tears making tracks
'Cause I look through the camera eyepiece and cannot see
I start to forget
I can sing this song so blue
And hours of making love inside 
There in the road, straight ahead
Now you got me right where you want me
'Cause she will love you more than I could
Though my record may say it
And on to something new,
Can die
I'm nothing much I know it's true
What a child will believe
I will leave this man just to occupy one minute of your day
Now I'll never have a chance
Rest your head
In this place it seems like such a shame
Is just a habit Save Me from myself
They never fall, they can never run dry
My goal is to reach your hands any day now
The softening of sound
I didn't want to go to bed and I didn't want to stay up late
Please don't follow me tonight
She said while you were sleeping
They say your boyfriend lives in a bubble
And I lost my head
Good good bye, I'll be fine
And all the time they took talking in circles
I'll never lose this pain
So I took your hand
Sells coal and marigolds and he cries out
When my sister finds my body closed up like the blinds,
Our love is quicksand
And if I sleep,
We're the coolest kids and we take what we can get Wait forever
And I'm seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
Strung out and thin, callin' some friend, tryin'a cash some check
If she had wings she would fly away
Still harder getting up, getting dressed, livin' with this regret
Behind the rings on their fingers imprints the ink deep in the inner
But you're giving me a million reasons
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor
So what did you do those three days you were dead
Come again just to start afresh and
Goodbye, my friend 
Who she may run from
What would you recommend I do
No one else will know that part of me
'Cause she's too scared, and she, she can't pretend
All the things I should have said to you
And is that alright with you
Who has taken you far from my land
In the backstreets or the alleys of this town
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I die again 
Sea salt tears, swimming 'round as the rain comes down
Every thought that I repent
No money, no babysitters, she couldn't keep a job
And I put my face over the ground
hold me tight
I can, I die
Where the bones'll show through
And it eases me somehow to know that even this will change
You coup your love until we kiss
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made along the way
I am a growing force you kept in place
They never really seem to want to tell the truth
Wouldn't have to have one worldly possession
Who makes you feel safe in your sleep
And met Dr Dre and flew you and mama out to see me
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
my days without you are so dark, 
I am a bird
All the rainbows in the sky
Try to kill it all away but I remember everything
Nobody nothing's said
Lili, take another walk out of your fake world
So the wind that blows across your room
Seen the look of anger
Just miles and miles of endless road
Away from me 
But I could not tell what was said
Today's the Macy's Day Parade
Baby cut me all to pieces
Never needed you so bad
I don't need you telling me how
Situations get fucked up and turned around sooner or later
Making it up behind my back again
And I hear my mother call
For the sea like navy men 
But you never wanted them that way
The day that he first met her
I'd give up all the world to see,
I try not to think, about the pain I feel inside
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
Well everything is eclipsed
The lightning bolt made enough heat
But I'm on the outside, and I'm looking in
Ultraviolence Lay me down tonight
When you get lonely if no one's around
Spinning 'round my head
Only silence as it's ending
Drifting and floating and fading away
'Cause I'll still be standing here
I could spend a hundred years adoring you
But you can't say I'm not trying
I hope that all is well in heaven
Oh, but I'm scared to death
You could love me if I knew how to lie
Have kept their fires burning
It's only your shadow
Stay up all night with the stars
Sometimes there's no one left to tell me the truth
And know that this is right
I thank you and hang up the phone,
There is a road I'm always walking
In the car, do you remember
Why did it have to end
And we will share a drink 
It will just go back 
And he never shows his feelings
Left and right
It's so easy to hate
To make you feel you're with someone who deserves to be with you
I should've turned around,
Nothing left to face
We're left as shells, we lost the fight 
Won't have to fight for long
Ain't nothing I can do
Being like you are
You'll be alright
Anyway, you'll never know
Take back all the things I said to make you feel like that
Have you forgotten
The PA painfully starts boarding
You bring yourself down in pain
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
I've been havin' mine
And now you want to talk 
She stole the keys to my house and then she locked herself out
So why change now
But I'm not going to say them
Grow further from me with every, falling tear
And by all that I have done wrong
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
But one day goodbye will be farewell
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it
I don't need a hand, don't need anything
Has me looking in your eyes
Power to the people, we don't want it, we want pleasure
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
Don't close it 'fore its done
"If you love something, give it away"
Still smell the rain, distance aside
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die
Etched in the middle of the night
Who's all alone
If I just turn and run
You are the blood of me 
To break my fall
Before one of us has accidental babies
And I'm gonna try to hold it all in
And wishes on eyelashes fail
But the winter scent in her hair
Then I guess we're both to blame
Someone to whom I could relate
So I'm up at dawn, putting on my shoes
There is nothing I know except that this lifetime is one moment
In a special place that I call my life
I said some awful things and I take them back
Your enemy is sleeping
And though my edges maybe rough
A high sheriff on my tail, boys,
So they took me away and after some time
Even if it's just for a few days
I got my own way home, I got my own keys
Appliances have gone berserk
Everybody knows that I'm a mess, I'm crazy, yeah
Caught a lovely butterfly
We reached for the stars; everything is now
And not our last days of silence, screaming, blur
Horses running free
I was so confused as a little child
I know I was a percenter then
They say the cream will always
I don't know how long I can hold on
The rest of my life's been just a show
It's just a season thing
Dear darkness, dear
Something happens to you
So won't you help a brother out
I'm not coming back forgive me
When you've no one left to hurt
The world has changed or I've changed in a way
All my children can become me
The way we are tied in
And nothing at the same time
Was everything a man could want to do
Sleeping dog beside you
You don't even want to let them start
You look in your eyes
So what do you say, your coffin, or mine
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
As I walk away
It breaks your heart in two
Well it's hope, the endurance of faith
But now you're saying "hey, let's think this over"
But I was thinkin' 'bout you
I am my mother on the wall
Or a bent up cigarette
Now the cities we live in could be distant stars
I saw you falling on the floor
And fades into the night
We go blind when we've needed to see
As I walked out on the ledge
I fall apart
Long as afternoon shadows
When you gonna make up your mind
Some people think he's good looking
You're on my mind, love
You wanna see the other side
Of these lives which are completely meaningless,
You burn down the trees
Fake concern says "what's the matter, man"
In place of a broken me
Let me know the way
When you hide, hide inside that body 
And I must push my barrow all the day
And if you lost a dad then someone's lost a son
But something kept me standing by that hospital bed
Come take us high above our time
We would do anything to bring him back to you
And I breath the air
Driving myself to death
You're laid out on the floor and you're not sure
For my wings some time 
Even though she's only giving me pain
Just late night television
And scratching her wrists in the pouring rain
So you say what you want maybe I didn't get my way
Some words are just unspoken
The winter wind
Torn between the lover
Get out of my head
But when you hold me like you do
Where you can always find me
We are like a wishing well
I didn't feel right anymore
You're the voice that I like
Somebody tell me, how can a loser ever win
He said, I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
I throw some clothes on in the dark
Should be a good night in here, Ramo in the main room,
One more song about movin' along the highway
We got big black cars
Sell the rights to your blight time machine
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
Would you still be here, no
You know war it has no heart
Our old friend, fear, and you, and me
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
Combs her hair and sings her psalms
So please understand that I don't answer the phone;
And a couple of kids of course, they don't mean anything
The one to keep hatin'
And a rocket to depart in
Nice dream
You'll never step foot in my room again
And all those white lines that sped us up
A midnight blue, day and night
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
I know everything will be all right
I can't believe your thinking
Can't you hear their call
Hissing from the road
Give me a reason to stay alive
I'm gonna die of loneliness, I know
I'll kill who you hate, take off that dress, you won't freeze
"You're safe, child, you are safe"
She just smiles, she don't want the world
I'm gonna die of loneliness, for sure
From that same head you've twice removed, now
And though I can't be with you tonight you know my heart is by your side
Yeah I wish that we could see if we could be something
The reason that the sky is blue
'Cause my life's become as vapid as
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
When I spin away
Then it all just falls apart
'Cause if I died tonight
'Cause Ed is watching my every sound
Every step I take
But you're long gone, yeah you're long gone now
Use me Holly come on and use me
Tadzio don't you fight
My castle, kids and home
Take the time to take my breath
To be honest, I really don't care
I felt for sure last night
Your eyes are so blue
This vacation's useless, these white pills aren't kind
And all the girls in every girlie magazine can't make me feel any less alone
She had withered all away
And I feel something's changed
And the shells jumped through the smoke
You have her face and her eyes, but you are not her
Sunk inside our blankets,
Agitated at the fault line
You say you know what he did, but you idiot kid, you don't have a clue
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rockabye baby
You won't be there, you coulda warned me
But she's got no more time, now she wants mine
Hard night
You'll know we are equally damaged
Oh, she who dares to stand where I stood
He was bored and tired of my laments
I hear my voice, I hear my voice and it's been
You come to me with excuses
I am like the old tin man
Take me somewhere new
You're always going to be afraid
mordiendo mis uñas
I'm tired of fighting
I can hear it in your voice, I see it in your eyes
Or the sound he appears to make
You're losing the calling that you've been faking
The shadowlands 
And what can I tell you, my brother, my killer
'Cause oh, you'll be the end of me
It hurts and I can't remember sunlight
I was alright for a while
And rejoice, the bed you sleep in is burning
How did I get here with you, I'll never know
It's time that we rocked three daunting nouns
I would do anything for you, babe
Now that the cuffs are off
Leave me alone,
Hard to leave when it's picturesque
I'm in California dreaming about who
It's like the finish line where everything just ends
I cannot stop my rebel hands
The tune upon his lips has passed 
You know the clothes that you wear, and the colour in your hair,
For years gone by and I cried
So poor Edward was doomed
That you bought at the grocery store today,
Everything as cold as life, can no one save you
There is really no one left at all
I feel so lonely, there's no one here
Until all our cares have blown away  yeah
I'm no longer fine, I'm no longer running smooth
I was back in the old days long ago
Try to detect you while I'm sleeping
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
Houses move and houses speak
And all my uphill clawing, my dear
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
But I'll be okay Is that what you want me to say
And I'd been shifting gears all of my life
I thought we'd be growing together
O children
Gets in his car and drives away,
That's the way every day goes
Your withered heart and everything it's seen
Forgetting to give back
Although it's not easy, I know you believe me
In each line there
I used to work in a record store
I still see that look in your eyes
Give up on trying to save us
I don't want a broken heart
You once talked to me about love
I closed the ranks, and I doubled back
The year of , broke my bones and skull
I know that diamonds mean money for this art 
But I'm not alive until you call
Round here, we always stand up straight
Come around no more
Like indecision to call you
To find I've been turned over
Maybe love won't let you down
I'm coming home
We're leaving here tonight
The early morning
What it feels like beside you
And my brother and all my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah
In rooms unfamiliar but until now
'Cause I'm still breathing
The river down the way
Hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose
That place in my mind
Lost in a haunting thought
I don't know what to say
Evaluate the differences in life
I hate to love you
Ist es nun still und ohne Leben
I'll keep holding on to you
And the thing that makes me mad, 
We looked good for eachother
No distance can separate
You took my thoughts from me, now I want nothing more
You're not worth a thing
By your resonating light
Better sit back and go with the flow
And we hoped that we could be what we knew
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything, but I got nothing here without you, baby
I was left alone
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air Tonight"
Blister please with those wings in your spine
In the night
A warning sign, you came back to haunt me and I realized
Are you the now or never kind
Draw another picture
And Morgan says
And you coming back to me is against all odds
I've bought some things that I sort of regret, about now
But it's done
Hey, I won't change direction and I won't change my mind
We cannot even choose a side
And do I really have a song that I can ride on
At the wave of your hand
The leaving lover that I still favor
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Floating upon the surface for the birds
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
We faded faster than the speed of light
Not sure what space I'm in, oh well,
Don't say you won't get scared and leave
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up Man, how's your daughter
Try to make it all okay, baby yeah
I'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or why
To make the other one leave
And said what's that sorrow you bear and I could tell him he understood
I know you don't think you did me wrong
If the sea should swallow up my house
And who he's become
Making fools of all the neighbors
Someday we'll go round the world
She's never gonna see the light
For everything I just couldn't do
Excuses, you know it doesn't work
Padraic my prince, I have all but died
To dirt and to dust, it all fades away
I just can't remember who to send it to
All this wasted, it's all inside
But what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane
She cries to the heaven above
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
And never say goodbye"
Underneath my breath
When you're staring at the cracks
I say that I'm a phantom airplane
That what we had could make us feel alive again
For so bare is my heart
Let me die
And when we are done
I feel it in the air
Why won't our love keel over
A thousand crystal towers
I tried, to run away but your eyes
A face that dances and it haunts me
I'm falling asleep and I can't see straight
I could say it, but you won't believe me
With my hand in my pocket,
You'll be handsome and you'll be beautiful
Making my way, away
I don't want you to change;
I gave myself in that misty light
Till I come back again,
Or am I just going crazy, dear
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love
You're not the one to place the blame
Remember all the things you'd say
Now that I'm laughing even deeper inside
If you don't mind, why don't you mind
When the sun's too bright
Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear
Angels to die
I try to keep an open mind
If you ever find the thing that you lack
Waiting to start
Never ran away for the sake of scars
Because I loved the simple thought of you
I've heard that you'll try anything twice
Take me You promised, you promised that you're done
We were a gold mine, they gutted us
I'm far too obvious this time
A life of the night
Plummet pop, dew skin, fortitude for the sniffing black noses
The same old scenario, the same old rain 
Lost my own return in spite of
Everything means nothing to me
Junk boats and English boys
But then you open your eyes
God bless her little soul
No alarms and no surprises, please let me out of here
But all I do is just lay in bed
Who will cast the first stone
I have to cover my eyes
Don't know where to look without them
I heard my mother thinking me right back into my birth
I hope you're not intending
Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fall upon my knees
The walls and the ceiling move in time
Went into the world Melanie C Into the world, 
The TV's on but the only thing showing is a picture of you
'Cause the music is boring me to death
I'll move back down
And all these memories come rushing
Ada, don't talk about reasons why you don't want to talk
And I can't stand to see you be a bad man
I no longer hear the music when the lights go out
And caring what it brings this way
On this country drive
I just wanna talk
He said he was in love with me
It's all smoke, there's no more fire
I need your affection all the way 
You'll get through, you'll be home, you'll be home
Like feral waves to your mind
Still looking at the road we never drove on
Till I heard the doctor say, I had a son
How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends
You're the magic that holds the sky up from the ground
Looking out the window
Don't just wander back and forth and leave it
You straight in the eye
Don't you dare
I'm sorry
Of the place we heard that everything would be
There's nothing left for me
Till I learn to leave the past behind 
It's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live
Lonely people tumble downwards
When the road is full of nails
Making up for all this mess
These words will fade when you explain why you hate them
you're spending all your nights growing old in your bed
Silent all these, silent all these years
With a smile on your face
You can make it last forever
As a new one appears
I remember the times we spent together
Into soon the sky 
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
In the darkness of the storm
I am better where you are
I hope you find what you're looking for 
And you don't even care
The subtle grace of gravity, the heavy weight of stone
He was me
My baby cries and lays me down
There's a heart on the line, and it rests with your eyes
And I wanna believe you
We tried to wash our hands of all of this
And look outside, find the reasons why Find the reasons why
Remember, Dear, our son's first cry
She figured if she didn't move no one would notice her
And after that you didn't bother
He held her tight and kissed her lips in, front of the picture show
You go it alone
And the door shut shut, I was vacuum packed
These flowers will never fade'
I hope you know it was never to you
That it may seem unkind
And if you let me I might try to make you stay
Drew walks by me
It seemed to last for hours It seemed to last for days
And I thought hell if it's over
Of all the things I should've said
And like a ghost in the silence, I disappear
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed
It's all gonna be okay, yeah
Where they don't know who we are
Living your end
Don't walk the plank like I did
And dragged me down at the end of the day
So I must learn to abort these feelings
They've got so much to do
Something about me stood apart
Only what's left is right
I was teething on roses
Is he dark enough
Can you stop this pain
Things are never gonna change, ooh ooh
Sickness and sleep turning me cold
That's dead and gone
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
When you're too in love to let it go
I can't keep myself away from me,
Nothing there in my glass
Und es verdichtet sich die Stille über uns
Another night with her
Oublier ces heures
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die
But I'm still the same underneath
Round and round and round
And I don't want to be alone, my heart is yellow as an ear of corn
Plug up your wormholes and give them, to feeders and spirits be freer
Ten guys on whom I can depend
It was the only place I'd ever known
When I hear someone has taken my place
And I lay my head back down
A cross country miss
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
Your young aching smile
I don't, don't need you telling me how
It's old news
How we take each other's love
Swear I could hear the sea
Now the pigeons gather 'round my feeding hand
We never change, do we No, no We never learn, do we
So hold me now,
I will always feel free
I guess you need no one,
Feeling ten feet tall
That as the sun rises on Mary, it sets on him
I can't be there with you But I can dream
I hope you miss me
And I can't live with myself today
At sunrise the monkeys will fly
She slips off into a dream
Oh, how I wish, that was me
To do everything in truth
I have a feeling you don't have the words
We found the ground
I want to hear he pleases you more than I do
Of what it was you were trying to find
Never quite managed the words to explain to you
I think I need a sunrise
And one day passed away in his sleep
Light turns to
And rejoice despite the fact this world will kill you
Truth shall be told one day 
It'd be all right, it's all right
That I'd been crying over you
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Sing the anthem of the angels
Hello I'm the lie living for you so you can hide
You raise your sticks and cry and I fall
Hey can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way
On the edge of a dream that you have
I'm using lipstick again
The stench of a love for younger meat
And you'll realise that you love me
Love was always cruel
I may be disturbed
I'll hold up high a mirror
I could open up the sky
I'll stick it out, skin pierced with colly strings
the sky is tired of seeing 
Left letters for you all
You roll out of bed and down on your knees
It couldn't be right 'cause you're not right within
You crossed this line
Somewhere along the line, I must've gone off track with you
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms
Push me out to sea
Love is good all the time
All the time
Round here, hey man, I got lots of time
There's so much hate for the ones we love
I move in water, shore to shore
And one for the dreamers
Well mercy me, I'll be goddamned
Like a knight from some oldfashioned book
You were always brilliant in the morning
To love me like they do right now
And when brotherhood come first
On all those hooded sweatshirt walks
For the glory boys at your bedside will love you
We'll skip the goodbyes
And what's small turned to a friendship
Got damaged, I got damaged
I guess that's love
Even if I cried alone
Sometimes its hard
You'd better get down on the floor
I need you now
Do you feel like you belong
We got California drowning out the window side
Disarm you with a smile
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
Who tell their families that they're sorry
From the hotel where he calls 
Hey man, tell me something
I'm goin' to a town
And I can't handle this
She talks to me
Push a blade into my hands
Cause to trust is to depend
You barely even make a sound
That's all right,
Now I'm back on my own
For the miracle to come
You must not fear
I know things will get better
You kiss me with your kiss my life begins
Singing Everybody wake up Wake up
But that joke isn't funny anymore
But she could breathe deep into my neck
Fly to the side
Between warm sake
For the come what may
Way, it's not my fault
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
Who've been stamping their feet to a different beat
bits of a child, 
Searching for the right,
But time has changed nothing at all 
Turns you around
Lead different lives
The way that I would
Oh I need you
I'm gonna stay down & Ride For You baby
Bow your head and join with me"
When it was always about to hit me
You leave with everything
Your pure heart
You just don't care what you look like
Before a while it all made sense
The pieces don't fit here anymore
Now I am calling
To get my way I would run from her to him
She's got magazines filled with hair pies 'Scuse me, I apologize
Dear darkness, dear darkness 
Even if the sun crashes into us I won't let go, I won't let go
And he's taking care of me
I got my rings around me
Shedding no little tears
He's lying, you're crying
Well it's very hard for me to say these things in your presence
Your face it's all wet
Oh when I rush to the start
No one knew what they could do
I can tell that you're lonely but it seems now
Sticking to my pointy ribs
Some escape, some door to open
Friends who don't have a clue
And I feel so much older now, you're much older, too
Behind enemy lines
And though it makes no sense, I know there are no accidents
Oh I've searched for them across the country
We tried but there was nothing we could do
He's got the fire and he talks with fame
Spread your wings as you go
And I understand you must keep moving, friend, but I'm headed home
They took off his clothes
She says I'm too dumb to fuck
'Cause I believe there's a place
That's what liers always try to do, it wasn't me, 
By the way my words were fading
I never once in my wayward life was heading to run out
And as the nail sunk in the cloud
So save your breath I will not hear
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, noone does
Quiet in the corner, numb and falling through
Know that I won't try
And then nothing's left undone
Go firmly to the window Drink it in
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes
Tell me enough of thinkin' everything that you've done is good
I've got this light
I feel it coming out my throat
Does all the things
When your living in the darkness 
Like I heard her backwards saying
Because like dying young, idols got the best of me
Making my way away
So ambition cut you down 
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
Holding down my feelings
I wish you would've grabbed the gun
Once too often I've retreated into the depths of my despair
You fool
Oh yeah 
How many times can I talk this way
And the wind is gonna scatter it and cover everything with love
It's the loneliest number since the number one
Never mind the pain or the aggravation
For to gaze awhile 
It felt like a lifetime
I still feel like crying when I think of what you said to me 
That moment in time when we'll be set free
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
At night she spoke to him
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
They push and shove and won't bend to your will
I need to tell you
And we're trying to be faithful, but we're cheating, cheating, cheating
We don't see eye to eye, or hear ear to ear
And the money was just rolling in
Bittersweet, I want you
And said "Amanda, I'm in love", no you're not 
And his mother cried in bed
It's on that he needs to focus 
And my momma swore that she would never let herself forget
What a wicked thing to do
That guy was complaining as he looked at the ceiling
Sometimes it makes me wonder where would I be Where would I be
And if you wanna show, then just let me know
And she locked the car and slipped past
Frustrated fireworks inside your head are gonna stand and deliver talk instead
I'll try to keep my skeletons in
When I dream I dream of your lips
When you water down my name
And the word says
I will never sleep again I, I, I'll never even close my eyes
I'll probably be the last to know; no one says until it shows See how it is
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
All the playful misspellings and every bite I made that left a mark
I tried to murder the lonely,
'Cause you want to be alone
And there's nothing there for you to do
I know the feeling of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
But my heart won't buy it
Just a simple word
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I try again
And as I stared I counted
You You were a friend 
I don't feel sorry when you cry
But they'd only remind me of you
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
Chase his fears away
And they say she's in the Class A Team
To soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth
Come on I need it
Where the rainbows end
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
Then save it for me, baby
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Believe me there was truth in all those stories that I told
And I'm sad, not sorry 'bout the way that things went
Alone like I'm supposed to be
And probably you know all the dirty shows I've put on
Oh oh oh oh, riverside
I watch the dreary light
I rip my heart out
Just a name
'This night never falls again
You might sleep, you might sleep
That there may not be another one like this
And you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me 
All the torment and the pain
Someday maybe I'll get to where I'm going
A good woman will pick you apart
I know nobody else who can laugh along to any kind of joke
Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand
I sure need a good companion
I wanna travel the world but I, I just can't do it alone
When the angel came
Happy endings, now I know
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
Because we both know
Nothing to lose
And we're on so many drugs with the radio on and the curtains drawn
Well, we might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
How's life Tell me how's your family
Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Do you hear the jet plane yawning miles across the sky
Dreams, dreams
This is a big world, that was a small town
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife
To stand in your shadow is to be home
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Gimme something sweet
Spat out on new terrain
Promises mean everything
Doesn't she look good 
You still mean the world to me
Music turned into thin air
I would give at this moment
If again the seas are silent, in any still alive
Cradle in a cry, cradle in a cry
But I've done it enough 
The bittersweet taste of fate
To this love aloud
If they find me racing white horses
No one's about to shout
On the inside of love
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
You just refuse to bend so I keep bending till I break
Maybe cross the country 
Papa was a rodeo, Mama was a rock'n'roll band 
No girls, no sweet romance
I know it�s out of the question, honey
These train conversations are passing me by,
All stars could be brighter
Moody It's got me x 
I won't be sad
That has stained their souls' together now
I never sleep
But the crowd kept pushing forward
It's out of love, ooh ooh
The ghosts are crawling on our skin
But now I come home
And I would love to bring you down,
And as I look around me
She didn't say a word, she just walked away
Lying here, lie, lie, lie, lie,
Trying to believe that you're gone
Imagining you there thinking of your future
So I say turn up the music, take me home or take me anywhere
Let me sleep
Oh just as long as you call me
It's gonna be alright I wish I could save you
'Cause ev'ry time I cry I know
I love him so much, it just turns to hate
I can be the one
Better call with some persistence, that way you feel nothing at all
Joey has loved but never shown her tears
In the morning
It's just this thing the seasons do
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
And it hurts a whole lot
Now I long for yesterday
Wish I'd been a prom queen, fighting for the title
And the siren song that is your madness
And you better come come 
Everything is wonderful now
I couldn't love
She's been running through my dreams
I still try to find my place
You got me, I got you, yeah you got me and I got you
Cause honey friend fuck
The horses are coming
But I trtrtry to be good 
Afraid of the sun
Now I'm weaker than the palest blue
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
Let me hear the rain tap on your street
And I don't really care who follows me there
Now it gathers dust
Well, I only wanna make things right, baby,
And I'm trying to understand myself and pinpoint who I am
I stand here alone
Say something
And I love your women and all of your heroin
What is it you need
Take me with you towards the light
And goodbye for now
You won't be seeing rainbows anymore
Wait another minute here, time will kill us after all 
They circle in sunlight
At some point, every rose has to die
To any sound of engines
What did you think
'Cause I wish that I could stay
One more perfect rendezvous
I hope that I find you in heaven
That's when I definitely knew
Majestic and lonely, magnetic, raw;
At all the eyes on the ground
My heart, my heart
I am done, smoking gun 
It's the wrong kind of place to be cheating on you
Good good bye, lovely time
Well, I dance the two step look at you swing
If it meant I'd get the Jack part out
And I'm wastin' everyday
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
River of sorrow
The scraping subject ruled by fear told me whiskey works better than beer
Everybody who comes
They say I suffer from a lack of serotonin
It's summertime and I can understand if you still feel sad
This world ain't exactly what my heart expected
And dreams were all they gave for free
Coffeelaced, intoxicating on her lips
Show me love I've never known
The sun's gettin' cold, it's snowing
No, we don't dream anymore
Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed
The more I cry, the more I cry
I've looked everywhere, Mr Forbes
Step aside from all this anger
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Try to put it in the past
This fool you love somehow is here with you
Of distant dark places
My feet are gold My heart is white
As the sun sets on Mary, its rising on him 
When you're sad when you're lonely and it all turns out wrong
I have no one
To see your blue eyed problem
When you change your point of view to underfoot very good 
I still think we should meditate
I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost
By pushin' my hand away to my chest, from hers
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
We'll get some lighter heads for our heavy hearts 
I'm trying to be brave
They're not the only ones
Where I feel I will
I needed someone I could shake
And now the floodgates cannot hold
I could put my arms around every boy I see
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
I thought we'd be genius together
She had it on the bathroom floor, and didn't know so
And these memories, lose their meaning
Is anybody here I know
We're like fire and gasoline
'Cause we're just under the upperhand
I really, really need a raincoat,
What a mess now C'mon
Seeing you cry it makes me feel like saying sorry
You told me none of that was real
So just one more
Lottery or car crash
Once I was a lover
And hide my cuckold eyes
Sometimes it just feels better to give in
Lili, you know there's still a place for people like us
That you stay surrounding me
I guess I always will
Here underwater we're down Here underwater way down
See the lights all shining bright on Broadway
And I can't find a way now to find it out
Out of nothing at all
Every place I go, I'll think of you
But you should've left the light on
What I choose is my voice
But have you seen this girl
Tell me that you care
With every single letter, in every single word
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And slamming her eyes, locking the door
I shouldn't have laughed, 'cause I mean you no harm
Moonlight tonight
Minä kaipaan eskimoystävääni  I miss my eskimo friend
I thought Johnny would always be my best friend
My heart became a drunken runt
Stars of lovingness in her hair
I've been staying up and
Does she need you like I do
Live forever, for the moment Melanie C Live forever, for the moment
Into a thousand dreams
And should I fall from grace here with you
Signing off and winding down
I bit a flashing lure
Not just a boy and a girl
She What did we do that was wrong
Ooh, give me a fistful of love
I'd tell it to your face, but you lost your face along the way,
My mind is filled with radio cures
Suckin' on the ice makin' eyes all by myself
Cause these are, these are
We're backdriftin'
And stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
So I think I'll leave by the window
To come on all courageous
Baby I got a plan, run away as fast as you can
And I know you care
Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
Just sitting here, trying not to look back
With your talk of four leaf clovers
I'm missing just one thing, a brand new start
Stranded starfish have no place to hide
Nobody's lost
Cold, but I'm still here, blind, 'cause I'm so blind, say never 
Fucking well come and find me
I laughed with my friend when she got to the end
Dripping with blood and with time and with your advice
Love is love's reprieve
Cool heart and hands and aptitude
Had I known how to save a life
And your truck broke down out in San Antone
Who could never love anyone
For one
But now I just don't have the time"
One last time
You are the lonely one
From the passenger seat as
And I could find a way to make it
I only can watch the countryside
Gonna throw a blue bouquet
How can I give love when I just don't know how to give
It's better to push something when it's slipping
Lying in my plastic bed
Uh, uh, you don't care a bit
Cold wind
It's all in your mind 
Seems like it's been thrown away
No you're not fooling anyone
The town we lived in
I sucked the moon
And things that we could never do and,
I'll follow you into the dark
So right,
I don't need this, I can handle it
You're the yellow bird that I've been waiting for
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
Memories rushed through my brain
It's gonna kill me The rest of my life
Hope there's someone
In a moment of truth
The cold comfort of the inbetween
Trouble is her only friend
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
And I said, "Not a chance Not a chance"
From win and lose and still somehow
But none of them is going to last 
It was on the bed that I knew what she'd done
Together we cry, cry, yeah, yeah
And ask my girl to dance
In my sweetest dream
And when the day has all but ended
Eighteen blue, twentyone gray
But darling, I want the same thing that I wanted before
Try not to pretend
In your arms, I was half awake, half asleep
That you've come back here to rebuild
Oh keep me on your mind
Inside of me
And I look into your eyes
Every night, I'm paying hell for glory
Will I forget in time, ah, 
Blasting white noise in the convenience store parking lot
Oohhoo, ooohooo
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
So you can be sure that you're in control
I found another way to let you go away
I don't wanna take away his life
As I'm staring at Alpha Centauri
I thought we could wait for the fireworks
And the night, the night is yours alone
And how I picked you up and everything changed
Refuse to rest assured
All veins in highway laps
I know you miss me in your living room 
And the daffodils look lovely today
He is singing in her bat's mouth
It's done
And you, you were the lonely one
And dreams of a world where the two of 'em are together,
And you got me
I swallowed the sun in your form
You won't be coming back
Is way too much to handle
When life and love turns strange
I don't know what you are
Turning circles and time again
Or hate myself for letting it pass by
Where would we land
She was tracing her years with her fingers on her skin
If I could make the world as pure
And sharpen them with lies
That I would be loved, even when I numb myself
And soak into silence
I never sleep still
It burns a hole through everyone that feels it
but at least i'm breathing 
Hush, hush
Then just when we believe we could be great
Did you know how you would move me, did you know
War child, war child
But I have seen the day of your awakening boy and it's coming soon
Till it's gone
You see I'm trying to find my place
But going out of my mind
And you have closed your eyes
The sky is your blue kingdom
And I was green, greener than the hill
They look at you in disgusting ways
Don't want to spend
Not to search for, not to love
This empty place
And I remember the truth
Looks like Jesus and his friends involved
I left home at an early age
I don't wanna die
Daddy's in the corner 
I can not hide how low I feel
If I could just hold you,
She holds the blood, she carves the knives
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
So you tossed me out to the wind
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Setting off the car alarms as it passes by
What have I got to do
In the light of day
Holding my head high in the rising tide
All in the end
"Clever cover story" awards go to you
The night has fallen down the staircase
Held you in my arms one time
It is the world to mean
I'd rather you never heard my voice
To that lonely song
And look to the corner think about me
Oh, love, it's easy if you don't try to please me
Hopelessly fighting the devil futility
You got rid of me
Hear the nighthawk call
That no one knows the ways of
Broke up and I'm relieved somehow
In the shadows buried in me lies a child's toy
OhOhOh, I hope you can hear me
Possibly maybe, possibly maybe
How do you love on a night without feelings
It's just dead and gone
We were , maybe less, maybe a little more
When the AC hum inside your sleepy head,
I remember throwing out all of your things
Even, even after all these years
Still I waited for the day
No one gives a shit about the things they do
From last night tears
But life happened, house, kids, two cars, husband hits the jar
When things go wrong I sing along
Your father's body was judgment day
That today I belong right here with you
But don't break your back
Others say she's shy
Everyone to see 
She swears there's time to make it
Hey little train We are all jumping on
Like you knew my name
It was the only thing I felt I could do
You cross the border of my heart
She used to pray on her knees
That's way over now
I know you remember me
Every day, I'm
And you'll realize that you love me
And as these shadows fall on me now
I wish it was me
And I'd whisper that I love you
There's nothing in between
Me colder when it's over
Getting strong today, a giant step each day
Is that what you want me to say
No, I won't be seeing you for a long while
His father was a drinker
Got a taste of you, threw up all night
And I know that you love me
Gloomy Sunday
And it seems that I can't live a day without you
Standing on my own two feet
Of everything I wanted when you came along
Every day
And all that love you gave was strong enough to make me stay and now it will be alright
Staring down at the irony of life
No one around for miles
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door
To think that I was wrong;
But you taught me how to trust myself and so I say to you
First there was the one who challenged
Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really,
I wanna sing one for the cars
I want your warm, but it will only make
I hit the bar every night
Everything would be all right
Oh Father, if you never wanted to live that way
I know you love the song, but not the singer I know you've got me wrapped around your finger
Someone I could keep
You're the one I need
the same song 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It hurts to feel
Will always get me through the day
You have gone so far 
Find me space
Where has my heart gone
You always wanted to believe
I went and messed around with her heart
You're gonna find someone new
Clutching her handkerchief
You're so selfless, cold and composed
Wrapped with wire, tapped to the heart
Round here, we're never sent to bed early
No one knows what is coming
I got family
Then the air went thinner
And I fired away
And then one day I lost the job
Share a popcorn and when it's finished we could go to the pub at night
If it was all a mistake
You always were the one to show me how
You do not warrant long goodbyes
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
Sadness is my boyfriend
And stop pretending
And that's the way that you feel
Around you
What's the point in ever trying
And girl you're the one thing caught in between
Silent wars  rumble somewhere below
As the years pass by before my face
I'm on the outside of love
In the pain in the pain there is healing
You're startin' conversations
Black and light black 
Just carry this gun, you'll even get paid"
I know that the clubs are weapons of war 
Seen nothing wrong, seen nothing wrong
And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind
You are, you are, you are
We both enjoyed a good fight
Crazy as it sounds you won't
When the world's crashing down
Goodbye my friend, I won't ever love again
Look outside, I know that you'll recognize, it's summertime
I don't know if you meant it, but you did yourself in
I'm talking and talking
Your baby doesn't want you anymore
They moved forward, and my heart died
And a paper plate of course, you think of everything
All doors closed but he's always open,
No I opened my mouth and I tried and I tried
Maybe you could not believe it
If I could just hold you again
And that line is what we reached
'Cause my heart has found its home
And pray our pain subsides
Besides, don't release me until it's over
I made my baby say goodbye
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching
And lonely just to watch you go
That I thought that I should
The day will come, when you'll get away from it
In the press of every kiss
Everything else I lost it
Nothing shines quite as bright
With stolen wings and evil ways
Stay here, lie with me here, oh lofi, lonely sighs
I still feel the pain
Now I've got the needle
And in a little while, we'll only have to wave
And wild is the wind
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
You look in the mirror
In a brick yard, it's raining up in heaven
Just as sincere as a dog does,
And if ever you come near 
"Wake up, paul don't be scared
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
I'm not what's missing from your life now
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
Why don't they just admit they're scared, cause its already showing
In his eyes
In your life we take our cover try being someone you're not
Has anyone seen lightning
And I'm not sorry if I do detest you
But not this time around
This place is our prison, its cells are the bars
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
I'm finally numb, so please
And they smile at me
Lights flash before our eyes
After all the things we've been through
And this wall breaks on the phone it at all, if you call
Ooh Your stylish mess of silver hair
When all along the fault is up for grabs, and there you have it 
All you ever have to hope for too
I've made my mistakes 
Crashing down was my biggest mistake
'Cause when we need it most there's no rain at all
And nothing was left for you and me
I cry, "Oh"
You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
Everything but suicide
But everything reminds me of her this evening
If I die this instant
See I met him later on, think it was 
And when the winter comes, keep the fires lit
Try to detect you when I'm sleeping
It's the wrong time, she's pulling me through
Be a good soldier
Though it never felt right
And you're the only one who knows
I know the distance is a factor
That you float in the air
When the sun came up,
And things get bent into shape
You are the clever one aren't you
No, I've changed my mind again
There's no more crying and there's no more lies
I know how you are
I think I kinda like it but I might have had too much
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
And you can use my skin
You never were, and you never will be mine
I caught your eye with a camera's flash
Be dead on the ground 
When I loved you so
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
We'll be a perfect family
Our blood is cold
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
And I keep it like a burning
With his ultraviolence Lay me down tonight
Bastard son of a bastard son of a wild eyed child of the sun
Awoken by the morning bird
Lives within my heart
I'll take the pain
But you don't care
The time always comes to say goodbye
I pray to god you won't come back here anymore
And you say, "Allah hu akbar"
You tell me that you're sorry
Ocean, swallow me now
Did you bury the carnival with the lions and all Excuse me while I sharpen my nails
I try to read a bit, but the story is too thin
I focus on the pain
It wars with my tears,
Wave yesterday's action goodbye 
All the things we laugh about
Other side
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
The bad things in life were so few
There is no one left in the world
My heart is on my sleeve
I needed you, you didn't need me
I saw you outside that wall 
Fierce and light and young
I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to lose
Today I wrote a bad cheque
Into silence
Wouldn't mind it if you were by my side
The things that you tell yourself
Operator, number, please, it's been so many years
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
Minutes passed at speeds we can run at
But one thing is true
Seems that I'm always
I'm looking for a sign
And all I've got is your hand
I've searched the holy books
God knows I try to feel
Do you still love me
Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last
Even if saving you sends me to heaven
You talk in paragraphs
And life is so cruel without you here beside me
Inside my mother's clothing store
With my hands on your waist
And all along I knew it was wrong
The singer sheds a tear, fear of falling out
Lights burning
To that coffin you call your apartment
All the lonely people Ah, look at all the lonely people
And turn it into something
You're fragile and you're cold, but that's alright
Honey, I hope you can
You heart is like a diamond 
Below this we'll end here until the end of time
Next door TV's flashing blue frames on the wall
Black chariot for the redhead
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
This bouncing baby boy's now turning baby blue
To find the places we used to play
I mean, I went and found the modern world
But I can't hide my own despair
So you say the present's just a pleasant interruption to the past 
'Cause there we are again
I begged her to stay
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find
As I stared at my shoes in the ICU
She always looks good in red
There's a love that could fall down like rain
Oh I wish my arms were wider
But I miss the way life was
Laid our blessings on the ground,
Just outrun the demons could you
Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
Everything they whispered in our ear is coming true
Billy's leaving today don't know where he's going
When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
Chasin' the ghost of a good thing
No alarms and no surprises, please
No I don't look back 
Never time for you
Is it only timing that has made it such a dark hour
You I held so close, in my heart oh dear
We sent out the SOS call
You didn't know him at all
Turn the tires toward the street and stay sweet
I'm gonna stay right here
Tell me I'm a part of history Tell me I could have it all
Reminded me of when we were kids
For all the times you run this
Withdrawn a step away
Your chain of command
Playing class reunions without end
Dangling entrails from the gut of the sea
Why don't you tell someone
You see, the cage, it called I said, "Come on in"
And I don't think that I can fight
While the city sleeps 
Yes, I do believe I have found mine
All of our work
We were married under cherry trees
As the light pours in
Cocaine flame in my bloodstream
Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
But I could never seem to say
Oh, my darling; oh, my baby, yeah
Tell me when did the light die
Waking up, it's rarely worth it
Stapled together with the strangers and the friend
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
Who has dressed you in strange clothes of sand
There's no recognition in their eyes
And so the kiss became the cold
Shut the window love, keep the world outside
Well, I don't think that I ever loved you more
Go fix my head
Nothing for me every day
It's getting to the point where we have almost made amends
It's the better thing to do
Get down to the inside
Even though she only has one or two
And we argue the tiniest thing
"All your friends and your foes
Now all those feelings
The minor fall the major lift
Better call the captain, he's been caught stealing
Father he enjoyed collisions, others walked away
Here, take these before we run away
Shaking in my doorway like a sentinel, all alone
There is a woman in Somalia
They poked a million holes
I only wish you weren't my friend
I'd tell you that it's simple and it was only ever thus
As you are right now to me
He showed up to the parties
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
It always turns out to be a different way
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say
And we'll lie till the corncrake crows 
Everything where it belongs
I try to quit
The kiss of the snow
Things can be better, you could be happy, try
How did he not find the baggy, with his hand in my shoe
And when I awoke, I believed I'd taken a bride called Mary Stanford
From my fingers to your bitter face
I try to make a sound but no one hears me 
I still smell you, distance aside
Before you walk out my life Oh, yeah
And I'll pretend like I've got something to say but I've got nothing
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes
And you can tell the sun in his jealous sky
'Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space
And part of this terrible mess that I'm making
Top hats and tails for thrills, red lips and famous hands
But the truth is that I've never fallen so hard 
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
This story is for you
So who's gonna watch you die
With a little bit more of innocence
Well everybody's tired of being alone
And how eventually our hands will just turn to dust,
Where's my love
Running away from the streets we knew
Remember what she does when you're asleep
The sweet turning sour
We're counting backwards
Is just the way that you were tied in
My true love, my whole world
I'm so glad you made time to see me
Goodnight to every little hour that you sleep tight
That time heals everything
My sneakers in his hand
I didn't get to say goodbye
Yeah kiss my mouth, hell is here
Walkinbarefoot now
It put its face up to my face so I could see
These open doors, these open doors, these open doors, ah
Academic or street education
What do I do to make you love me
And he found someone who understands
Don't get me wrong I still desperately love you 
Upon the instruments of death, the sunlight brightly gleams
I've been searching in the pouring rain
And you think you have to want more than you need
And when she was lonely
nunca duermo antes de diez 
Don't lose your selfish ways for me
Sing us a song
But there is another down in a dungeon who never gave up the fight
By the tree in Ennis where we used to hang around
I've been here before, I know this shade of blue
And if you've lost your love for me
He may lay the queen of spades 
Alice died in the night
Und die Vögel singen nicht mehr 
I'm wasting
And be too stubborn to die
Abusing 'cause you're a friend
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
And now you're standing bare in my doorway
Early Thursday mornings, wipe away the flies
Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Headlong without a thought
You're gonna wonder who you are
The angel sweet
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch a woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
I hate my face
And seconds, they seem like a lifetime, a dream
People all grow up to die
Someday I'll follow you and see you on the other side
Watch as she lies silent for soon light will be gone
Sons are like birds, flying always over the mountain
It's even dark in the daytime
Holding on until the end 
Dangerous 'cause I want you so much
I looked over Jordan
Coming down this time
There are no words to describe it
Without you, what does my life amount to
Weep not for the memories
You could keep me up in bed 
So I came inside to be with you
Oh I got nothing
Lookin' for some hope
You don�t need me
Getting killed by a car 
Ooh my own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go
The first thing that I do before I get into your house
Are all my old friends gonna leave me and die
But I was waiting
Hoping that you are missing me too
Oh, and you're so beautiful, yeah
Gather round the home she rests
And you could say my name
A moment one solar flare would consume, so I nod
There's a seat here alongside me
When I can't wait to get outside
Than I ever was with her
Surrenders it all
I promise not to blow the address again
All the words I need to hear
The way they comb their hair
Right in this moment this order's tall
This is all I need
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you
The cleaners are coming, one by one
Brother, put your needles down 
I'm just a person on my own
I never thought good jobs were hard to find
We used to talk
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
Brings a change for you and me 
You spent everything you had
And I cannot believe
It may be over but it won't stop there
This is my heart, bleeding before you
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
But when that water breaks you know you're gonna cry, cry
They told me, "Son, it's time to tell the truth"
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
When darling I love you
Not much hair left on his head
No one's picking up the phone
She says that she'd love to come help but
I try to make the worst seem better
She looks impressive
Let me sit in the dark of the morning
But we don't have much room to live 
She's got her reasons, got my forgets
Oh, but I learned the hardest way
Like that firework over the freeway
Everybody hurts no, no, no, no, no
As I've ripped out my heart and said 
Homeless my sweet
As she simply walks away
Regretting some little foolish thing
Me and my broken heart
I live along a straight line
Wind in my hair, you were there
Wir waren verschwor'n
Hide out and then run when no one's looking
I need you, you want me
I've looked in the greenhouses, one, two and three
Sometimes in the morning I am petrified and can't move
And stayed out way too late
Seen in the mirror
Leads to one mistake
It's so hard to think it ends sometime
It is so strange the way things turn
Can I change my life for any price
Well, Jesus Christ, I'm alone again
As you stand, under the bar lights
Align my heart, my body, my mind
Dreams of a face that is pure perfection
Now every corner's filled with dust
'Cause if you want, I'll try to love again
'Cause I knew, I knew, 
Ring out the bells again, like we did when spring began
I had a mind to try to stop you
Love is coming home
Ya buscaré qué hacer conmigo 
Will you never let it show never let it show
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
I wonder if you'd miss me when I'm gone
The bitterness of one who's left alone
And keep trying to find your way out of that maze of memories
He wasn't welcome
Center of the storm
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear
Hoping you would care
My heart
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
Kick the door cause this is over
We had each other, that was all
But you keep sailing right on through
Walking with no shoes or socks
The change machine lied
Only it happens all the time
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
But I must find my way
Somethin' warm, flowin' through my eyes
I loved the way we used to smile
'Cause it's his turn but his brother won't let him try
They can make me turn my back on my friends
Blank page was all the rage
To cover up the pain
Because when I look in her eyes
Of history
And don't forget to breathe
The tugboats on the river
This weight it must be satisfied,
And it's too late to start
And somehow you left me neglected 
And I watched my friends go off to war
Guess I've seen you three times
"I think it's dark and it looks like rain", you said
It's a feeling that you cannot miss
Before you sign away the deed
We left before the dust had time to settle
To dry her eyes, broken inside
I dreamt I traveled and found you there
Everybody here is watching you
Playing movies in my head, that make a porno feel like home
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Some still believe he was freed from her
I can call, wish you well and try to change this
Throw me in a landfill
Oh when you're looking at the Sun
Hear the crowd call
But I'm drunk instead with a full ashtray
'Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
What am I gonna do if you never come home
Everything, as cold as silence
She broke away
So we wait for morning
Will end the story of a soldier in the dark
We think the same things at the same time
If I had a dime for every hand thrown up in the air
And I don't think you see the places inside me that I find you
This isn't all my fault
She thought of maybe asking a girlfriend
To a January night
Confession arms awake
I lived, I loved  I was here
Ain't nobody looking now
Eating snowflakes with plastic forks
You're telling me that we live too far to love each other
When you look at me
Sat on a floor in a grey, grey mood
I need to be alone I'm not coming down
Et que la chanson de Prévert
Through the dark
I finally found the words
And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things
You never seem to be home
Maybe you understand that, city bird
One more time  I promise after that, I'll let you go I promise that let you go
Mother don't worry, I've got some money I saved for the weekend
Wine left to rot and a voice that can't sing 
From the young man in the twentysecond row
He will admit to everything
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
Are always first to drop
It all comes down
I will roam lost but never alone, hide with me, hide with me
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance;
So I will share this room with you
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I couldn't promise you anything
Spoken words like moonlight
There's an eclipse in your eye
A lesson learned to me and you
Everything we had
I'll be under ground one day 
Once there was a great storm
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
You're dancin' circles around me
She's always done much better with boys anyway
Hey, yeah, yeah
But I don't have to make this mistake
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
That somebody loved me
I have called you children, I have called you son
But spare some for spare parts
Always under or above
I've been up half the night, so get off it or leave
I never was there, was there when it counts
And I feel quite okay
Moving pictures
Now do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand
And whispers in an all night bar
I'll make everyone pay
We've tried the goodbyes
I'll bide my time
�Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough 
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
God is wearing black
In you is everything that I'm missing
And when the broken hearted people living in this world agree,
Aww baby
Then I'm sorry 
Reminds me how you laid us down
And there's still a hole where the phone was thrown
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you
But with your mind
If indeed, I cared at all
These days I seem to think a lot
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for, 'cause you are
What will it take to live as if I would not another day
On doing nothing,
Think I got myself in trouble
I need to walk away from ya
The lady at the counter said There ain't no flights
You'll fake it if you have to and you'll show up for work with a smile
The world is just a little town
They fall among the voices and the wine
And they say back then our universe
And still I push my barrow all the day
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Oh, waves of time
Outside it's summer, indoors it's cool
Just to see you mess around
Though it's been so many years
Get some sleep
And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall
From this second story window I can hear the church bells
Wind in my hair, I was there
A little less than a human being
Why tell me about anything
I don't expect anything
But now you're lit up by the city
Maybe its time I saw the world
Collect the love that I've been given
For it has halfruined me to be hanging around
I saw two birds lost at sea 
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
In a bad way, did you love me Do you spite me
I won't let go till it bleeds
She looks like Mary, Queen of Scots
Your picture is far too big to look at kid
And I'm painted black
Frozen in fear every time we appear
Discard my friends to change the scenery
Sad eyes, baby
We'll cry about this
Frank's in there I don't care
It's so uplifting, fuck yeah 
I'm trying to make you proud
At least I thought so
All the things you put upon the mantle
Cause everything were been through
Honestly over you
I'd wake up beside you, you'd hold me in your arms
Happiness hit her like a train on a track
And soon the cells give way
Well the day begins, you don't want to live, 'cause you can't believe in the one you're with
Inside I'm screaming,
From beginning to middle to end
You're a wasted face
Something you're afraid to show 
When you're little and the world is so big so big
Cracks appear and passion slips away
But they're on their way
Your body gives but then holds back
Someone to have, someone to hold
Oh my love, oh my love 
I got a feeling that I want to live, live and live
I guess it was just a dream
The street
You dreamt of sex with tigers
You don't want to mess with this honey
Between, half the time I'm so dead
I said I'm under the gun, round here
Our love, in a ball of yarn
And all I wanna do is ride bikes with you and stay up late and maybe spoon
Thought I knew it all
Investments and dealers
That the good things would never last
And she says, "Baby, I've gotta get going"
It's me, your lover
The more you look forlorn, the more to you I warm
'Cause I can't sleep alone at night
Better call the ships, they been caught sailing
But the water keeps on falling from the sky
A beautiful girl
Its filled with older folks pleading "baby listen"
Won't feel you anymore 
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
I'm a fool in the fetter
If we get to see tomorrow
Like the back of his hand,
I'm not sure, and never was if this will
Who doesn't lie
Walk on shells tonight
Upon my liar's chair
Standing here in the dark
I buried nails and strings and hair
'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark
You look rather tired, are you pretending to love
This is our music from the bachelor's den;
Still it seems if you can't trust
I found one for you, kiss your cheek, say bye, and walk away
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Hey, yeah
All the times, when I felt insecure, for you
He's in pain and misery
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
I saw you asleep beside a wall 
Before the fight, before I let you walk
So I lifted my gun
Feeling together, believing whatever my love has said to me
This day will come
You always seem to know where to find me and I'm still here behind you
I would keep myself, I would find a way
I woke up early this morning around am
For the tide has turned
Make me whole
My fingers sting 
Like the world has lost its mind
Of your story"
With no way to feed it
The brightest kid in school
The light was shining from the radio
I went out driving, trying to clear my head
Just don't try and understand
Now don't be sad
There's no one left to hear you scream
I don't even know where to start
They quiver and they shift to the floor
we trip on excess steps
I'm gonna take you home
You just look a lot like me
Does he hold you when you cry
I cry out
Oh my Barbara, she looks so much just like my mom
And went right back to bed
And run away from all of my fears
I fell apart but got back up again
Sorrow found me when I was young
How about what I have to say
How we gonna move together Just come closer
Ooh, Ooh, oh, whoa, oh, oh yeah
This is where the road crashed into the ocean
Don't want to kiss you
You ever tried to say
We writhed under a red light
Miles away from seeing you
You accept and go back to try it again
Mother remember being so stern with that girl who was with me
You hate the way your life turned out to be
And it feels
You're the sounds I've never heard before
Pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream
And I've been shivering all night long
From give and take and still somehow
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well
As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight
And face pushed deep, reflections meet
Don't leave my keys in the door
Leaving it for such a long, long time
Oh what a wonderful place
But like always, I let them go
Who will fight
It might not appeal to fools like you
Please let me take you out of the darkness and into the light
Don't know if our fate's already sealed
Than when you turned away, when you slammed the door
Stones and sled
I can't be there with you But, but, but, but I can dream
I had to take your word on that
Well, I love the way we communicate
Love is love's critique
With all the luck you've had, why are your songs so sad
Their hearts say 'move along'
He's been in my dreams
I see things that nobody else sees
Was the day
The night into the day
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'll show every one around you 
I can give you everything
You wanted rock 'n' roll, complete control
All the things we should've done
And you looked as sincere as a dog
Consider yourself lucky if you think of it as home
Of my heart that is crushed
But what I said is done
We can never go home
The hopped up boys are lookin' for their trouble
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
To a flake of your life
Bad moon whine again
I hardly recognized the girl you are today
Everytime you looked at me
It's just a fond farewell brave
With what I've done 
They both walked through that door without me
In bed I was half dead
And sleep the rest of the time
Through still and storm
I'm not the new kid, on the block
Two wrongs make it all all right tonight
I just had a bad night
Drink up, baby, look at the stars
Mr Hudson
Live again, baby
There's a fire inside of you
I'm not crazy or anything
If you have to go, don't say goodbye
He had to leave though I begged him to stay
A little, but I'm hoping it might kick start
Just tryin'a find my way, some way, oh I, oh I, oh I
And I thought we could wait for the snow
But in time you see things clear and stark
Please don't give my hopes up, no, no
Or for the sadness
Right here when the storm blows over 
And I believe in crystal light 
Nothing left here for me
She knows there's people watching
In a better time you could be my friend
Bear paws and rascal power
They can tie me up, call me a clown
I am here for you, if you'd only care
And as you flashed your backstage pass
I've seen it all, I have seen the trees
So I'll wait for you, love
There's a life to be found in this world
Don't even dare to say you hi, still swallowing the goodbye
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
Once again I'll be the foolish one
I'll keep reliving
Around the throat of the one I love
Two lovers locked out of love
You'll try and try and one day you'll fly
It's later, never sooner
Is this how you wanna go down, right before my eyes
That's inside me now
I don't know words but I will hear them
When will it start to sway
'Til you thought it through,
Cut off my wings and come lock me up
And I knew for sure I was loved
And get him to swap our places
Gloomy is Sunday
Than to have never lain beside at all
Together we cry, we cry, we cry
You've done nothing wrong
He's nude as the news, nude as the news
Jailer who sells personal hells
Keepin' warm
And you got to be so strong
Totalll control,
Like my father
You won't ask and I won't say
With the focus I gave to my birthday candles
So let me go, just let me fly away
You are the only exception
So you trying to do what they did
Always warm on my back
That's when I knew I had to move
I need your light in my life
I want to hear the children sing
This used to be the place I ran to
Well wake, baby, wake
You could drop the keys off in the morning
And I know it was me who called it over but
Than sweet, sweet lies, oh now
Making ooh's
But, I am no gentleman, I can be a prick
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Your blood boiling
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast
And saw that it was headlights
Hold your mouth to mine
Though you're still her man it seems a long time gone
Why'd you take me out of my fucking house and kill my parents with me
I just wanted to stay
His bedroom walls began to glow
Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
But it's just a temporary high, 'cause when I close my eyes
I barely have motivation 
Oh, it's funny to think it through
Oh I love you Amy
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall
You gotta tell me its true
This could be heaven
And the spine collapsed and the eyes rolled back
And I hope you die
Sing us a song, sing us a song
Doll mouth
But when I start to try to tell you
It's one step away
I turn on my phone, now that I've grown up
To all the fights I've conquered and beyond
Knew we'd put up with anything
So we bend the bracket
They are lost to us"
Coming down on our homes"
Come, come, come nuclear bomb
Only in dreams, only in dreams
And take me off far away from you
Maybe not with words
If I could only work this life out my way
Did you think that the night would posses us,
Under what spell the guiding light
Do you try
And I don't need you or anybody else
And falling down on your knees asking for sympathy
All alone, I can't mend
A happy song
Puts on a smile and breathes it in
I guess I know by now
Alone in this house again tonight
Somewhere's hole to divides any way you want
I guess I need you, baby 
We'll wrap the world around it
How to be like somebody else
But fools they rush in 
In my nothing 
No one's listening anyway
A glass once half full 
Yeah, it's more one thing now
My little hawk, why do you cry
Until our veins run dry
Our time is borrowed, girl
And daddy, how are you today 
From place to place, and bed to bed
The airwaves stretch and they groan
You're callin' me back, when the money is gone
And at the end of all your lines
Like I feel you
She's laughing, she's turning
Got a schedule to stick to, got a world to keep sweet
We're out of time and I can't breathe
Reading the stares at your passion that bears me now
Maybe you would have been something I'd be good at
That's why you're on your own tonight
The pavements, they are a mess
They won't see no lies
Man ¡Hola Manu, soy Guancho ¿Manu ¿Manu Bueno, pues, mira, si no contestas te mando un fax, ¿eh ¡Hasta luego
In my arms 
It's looking like a limb torn off
Wildflowers, dear
Those who speak know nothing 
You took a ring and pawned our love away
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
Everyday is like Sunday,
Can it melt away all our mistakes
And you couldn't care less
I know your fears and you know mine
Exciting and new, shameful and true
To think of me at this point in time
Oh I'm running from it
Hold of your time
You kissed the boy and make him feel this way
And here I am softer than a shower
It's round about, it's somewhere here
Sitting straight, feeling faint, an exhausted smile
Let your backbone slide
Let me try and pull out my pride
With a desolated view
But the only thing that
And you're making that face that I like
How's that thought for you
Give me the truth
Am I your only one 'Cause you're still my only one
And won't you kiss me
We could make babies and accidental songs
She glows and grows with arms outstretched
Its color gone
You could've been here right by my side
And it's ok, she don't want the world
It's got lots to do with magnets and the pull of the moon
'Cause I, don't want to make things any worse
He is kind, she is free, and wants to show him
We believe
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
What was it you wanted Could it be I'm haunted
'Cause things are gonna change so fast
That I can hold onto
You're breaking my heart
"Mom, please wake up, dad's with a slut
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Sleep now and Jesus will come, dear
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother
It sounds pretentious but it's true
But you didn't find anything to read
All you needed was time
I've still got me to be your sandy shore
But I guess that's love I can't pretend
He came a long way just to explain
Always having my heart set on you
It seems one thing has been true all along
Together we cry, yeah, yeah
There's a storm only in loving me 
And did you rush to your phone to call
Is banished to the past
For every street of any scene
And add to the list of all the places we hate
As the days turned to weeks
A warning sign, I missed the good part then I realized
I wanna go back to the old ways
And try to feed your hunger
To love again
If you took all the little feelings in your heart
I'm just scared to lose you
I've gotta find a reason
Selfhelp, selfpain
I find everything pursuing
Feel there's truth that's beyond me
Drew looks at me
Fun Fun is the one thing that money can't buy
Lost in the arms of destiny
I've got my heart
To make you mine, stay with me tonight
I couldn't wait till I got home
Though some may hold the rose, some hold the rope
I will never let you fall let you fall
To find a place I've never been
I find myself searching
And I never thought this life was possible
Out of time
I'm tired of asking
And all around the air did say
And overanalyze your words 
I wish there was an overthecounter test
I promise one day I'll come back to you
It don't matter at all
Please don't walk away
And all the cracks will crawl right through me
You are always gonna be the one
I remember you quite well
At anything that moves
Just slipped through my fingers
A Promise is a promise
My name is Leslie Anne Levine
This morning we drove out of town
I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Is anybody waiting at home for you,
For you this never ends
To those of us who know the pain
Stained 'soul mates' forever now
Eyes are red and tears are shed
Like a walk in the park, like a hole in your head
Because there's nothing else that I do well 
Then maybe I would tell who I was
There's no regard for life
I remember little things, you hardly ever do
Your sorrow's your goldmine 
And it's hard to say how I feel today
I just wanna hold her;
They're in my skin and my bones
She sees a million stars like holes in the sky
Let's put away those claws
I have drunk you wine
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself 
And rewrite every line
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
They want me gone
But Julie knows a party at some actor's westside loft
Your little lies of desire
And live my life, and have friends around
She always said that you were the one
When everyone else was having good luck
The birds
Walking tentative alone up the driveway
The dust has only just begun to fall
I couldn't feel my feet or hands
All the white horses
'Cause in  hours x
It's been in the past for awhile
All he needed was a gentle heart
Then she moved to LA with her firefly stare,
Trouble oh, trouble set me free
It's God shining through to me I guess
"Attention shipping information in sea areas within
Already died and went away
If you never hit the road, so
In a galaxy of stars with nothing in the middle
But I've got nowhere to go
But the thing is I love you now
Oh, he surely must be happy with everything he's got
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Where all my layers can become reeds
Girls, forgive me one more time
And you will never see the one you love again
Sing a long goodnight,
Well you're all scared and stiff
Deny everything
Reach out into the darkness 
I can feel her breath as she's sleeping next to me
The beauty that surrounds them
So I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on
Young men standing on the top of their own graves
Why did you think I did not on this rely
"We'll catch him unawares but 
This sordid affair is ending in tears
Where in the world
They're just paper cuts
No one knows where the ladder goes
Then we'll spend our days catching up on life
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
Mary's got the same size hands
It'd fly and leaped like a black spider between your legs
And somewhere in between I can feel you
You sway
Bring you home
Dreams over a lie's the same
And flowers they bloom
While I sat at home
That I still, I still love you 
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
And our souls they blend
And you're really all alone
And you hope she'll sing
And my brother has fit in the snow
For lookin' at you straight in the eyes
All died when you went away
Bis die Sonne scheint; Bis sie wieder scheint
Rain, rain, go away
On a day like today
And the fight for you is all I've ever known ever known
She was hoping for a better world for this little girl
"And it's all running out like it's the end of the world", you said
Three wasted years, wasting time
In your eyes anymore
But when you tell them my name and
But you're always on time, so
And I was drinking you goodbye
I'll dress like you need
Yes, all you have to do is cry 
Here we are,
We didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow
You wouldn't have done
We are exactly as before
In these last days
Through your window
We're not going anywhere Sun is bright and standing still, it's alright
You will see your beauty every morning that you rise
That are looking for purpose, they're still looking for life
Do my hair quickly
With my head in my hands
They were friends of mine
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
How did we ever go this far
Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness
Look, all I know is that you're the nicest thing I've ever seen
Hair is grey, and the fires are burning
In my cruel love gold poisoned
Then why are you on your own tonight
And blood rushes to their bed
I got a plan to get us out of here
Yes I guess we need the drama
You get a phone call from the queen with a hundred heads
How can I go forward when I don't know which way to turn
And you break apart the things I had
And keeping lines blurry
Tallulah, it's easier to live alone than fear the time it's over
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Once again I do I turn to you
We were born, we were born to die
That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family
And call it true, call it true love
You're just a sucker for the ones who use you 
What we did suddenly
You don't know how lips hurt
Your car crash in slow motion
I hopelessly, helplessly, wonder why,
I'm sorry for the way I let go
Risked her love
But I was made the way I am
The dog days are over
Well, and a jealous man Am I coming
I want to believe in more than you and me
Your lipstick is smeared and sad
There's something that's invisible
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Now I've lost my disguise, it was all white lies
At night while everyone was sleeping,
My fears unveiled for my fair female
That the rain washed away
I pick a book up and then I turn the sheets down and then I
The bus is runnin', it's time to leave
In the name of being honest
Through this wicked world
And I realise that there's something wrong
All the answers, honey
And the lightships 
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you;
Alone at the end of the rave
The gardenhead knows my name
Please just save me from this darkness
And never saw his father anymore
Everytime I interrupt someone like you used to,
And nights when you made me your own
Now I guess I should've listened
And we'll smile once again
Isn't it a pity, oh, isn't it a shame
Other people say she's dumb
Of violence of love and of sorrow
There's a girl just down the aisle
I've looked in the chest where I thought it should be
From the spell of some old holy song
You can all sleep sound tonight
Don't be scared to speak
Now I know, I lost you a long time ago
The kind you had left behind you
By blood and by me, you walk like a thief
How I loved you
And back to my neck
Bury me upside down
You say that they've all left you behind
'Cause I would not lie
Like I was poison ivy
You'll take your time
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for
That you don't want me there in your life
With someone else on top
Come on pigtails, girls and all those sailors
But that's just bullshit
Ever since we were kids, but now
I can't believe
Watching the sun go down
If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
Walk inside, gets noticed
Of falling down laughing
I don't think we would kiss
But I can't see myself that way
Just like I always wanted, but I'm so sorry
You take what you need to make you whole
It'll be those who gave their island to survive
He gathered up his loved ones and he brought them all around
It's your right to shun dependence
To leave you alone
Oh, does she love you
You'll say you understand; you'll never understand
The past has let me be
All the play fighting, all the flirtatious disses
She takes her time
Do not hate her
Up to your hill
Downtown, Downtown
Why did I turn away, away
That they should try to hold on
And accept "someday, somehow"
I never needed anyone to help me
But I think of him still
Like something that can never be replaced
I knew that I'd get like this again
It will all be over, and here we are
I wanna call them back out for applause
Of my last night with you
I tried to server ties and I, ended up with wounds to bind
So why do I still burn for you
Time will take them away
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one
When praises cease and seasons change
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
If you think you're gonna faint, go out in the hallway
Hurt myself again today
She just walked away
And I won't listen to your shame
We'd ever die for these sins
'Cause each time I feel it slipping away
I know everything is all right
Even sat me down and warned me just how they'd fall
Are you so scared to look within
This shit it's making me tired
Take my hand
No one sees me here, It doesn't even matter
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
When all is said and done
The news that truly shocks
You'll say you understand but you don't understand
I wish I didn't know now what
But children lived in Levittown
This is the fear
Yes and no are just distinguished by
Ah, fool
It's such a lonely experience
Behind my back
Hear you me my friends
You weren't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say;
It's all new
Keeps you safe for the moment
At times of war
And now the clouds, well they've covered everything, oh
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I saw an angel
Written around the dried out flowers
I have found the perfect end
And all the stupid lies I hide behind
In a life that you hate
Everything's all right
And every night I think I certaintly won't ever sleep sober or alone
I'm tired of hiding behind these lying eyes
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
Plant your feet back on the ground
Your cold white brother alive in your blood
I know I promised
She walked right into my mirror
I don't even know my strange old face
Joey will come when once more it looks like snow
You who love to love and believed we can never give enough
The killer in me is the killer in you, my love
But a lot of people think he's fine
'Cause you said it'd be forever, and that was your vow
But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way
About the times I won't have to say
How can I have feelings when my feelings have always been denied
But gravity always wins
It's short, it's simple, it's crystal clear
How you could easily take my man
You've already gone, why am I clinging
I saw our sad messiah
And I know that the lift can be painfully slow
One you love
Know that love don't live here anymore
So I will just sing my songs and I'll pass a hat,
How I could've been yours and you be mine
Final call,
And you know, everything changes but
Watch my mascara dripping down
To call at 
When my heart's on the floor
And everything feels wrong
Better come come come come come to me
Out across the city
And I feel so ashamed
And ev'ry night that day is through
A long life wind
I wear this crown of thorns upon my liars chair
Not appreciated's just his first name
I'm gonna find you and never run again
She says she's tired of life
Whose shadow paces the floor
You're not alone in anything
With wishes of a sandman and a night light
The phone slips from a loose grip
I know it's over still I cling
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
All the waves of blame arrange as broken scenery,
I'll see you in another life,
Round here, we're carving out our names
There was a time you let me know
But they say be true, don't stain your bed
When I say shut your eyes, eyes
Got to head back east and want to leave tonight
No one else will have me, only you
But still, when the moon is out, with his push cart
One absence of truth 
My mama felt, she never liked you neither did my friends
Daddy watch me sleeping
So halfblind we wrote these songs 
Unkiss me, untouch me, untear this heart, oh no no no
My heart screams out
Time will make sure I'll get over you ooh
And left me all alone
In celebrating nothing
No fairytale
You forgot me long ago
I'm still remembering the day
You cannot run can't escape from the things that you said
Current girlfriend, exgirlfriend
I thought you could read my mind
Here are all my songs
The hours are pretty bad
I tell the kids that it's all okay
Burning through the rainbow
And still I wanna put this out
You'd stay the hell out of my way
I was here
He too understood and felt her pain,
Look in to her eyes to make her listen again
I keep a memory of your face
The glass house that you lived in 
Her green plastic watering can
Don't leave me dying, without a lover to hold
So if someone could help me now
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
Anything you ever want me to be
Falling away from you, no chance to get back home
Now all we do is shout, oh yeah
Look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid
Let's go for a drive and see the town tonight
But I don't mind, at least I've tried
Cut that little child
Hope comes from inside
In fact that's where music comes from
I got fried a little
At the end of town
Ooh, the people I've met
You'll be the road, rolling below
Then the baby came before I found
And the river bed shall not be yoru home"
Go to sleep and dream again
Better find the one that lights the way for you
On the back of his head
I'll be crying
And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared
Yeah, but don't it make you feel rage
Endless summer, acoustic guitars
And no matter how you try
Searching for some trouble
I could go back,
No tears in my eyes
I pray for the night
I picture you fast asleep
Break your bones
Leave me out with the waste, this is not what I do
He was guiding me, Love, his own way
That they forgot to bomb
Only thing I need to do is walk away
And now you're sitting on that train
She collapses down upon the ocean floor
Half off the price they're asking
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
Son, you'd better wait to fall
A future for us
I thought I saw you breathing
When I'm not around you
Am I the reason why you tossed and turned last night
All the memories are getting colder
I've always known my heart's been held by you
All that I say, you always say more
They throw me a bone just to pick me dry
These wasted Blues
I still taste its kiss
To stay away from me 
So it never has to show
Goddamn, I am such a jerk, I can't do anything
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Just can't take the thought
Mind, the war child
Mary's got the same size hands Oh
When you feel embarrassed
The curtains drawn, the winter sun makes patterns on your face
"There's plenty of things to wear when you come to me
I hope my mom and I hope my dad
But I can't sleep
I remember December
Giving you all my heart
Of us in here, baby
We share the sadness
I'm an ocean nothing floats on
It's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Oh, love, well I'll wait for you
My love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be
The world is just illusion trying to change you
It was your life
Someplace where no one calls it wrong
This song leaks out onto the pavement
Better call the fisherman, 'cause they're coming on land
And it was memorable
But the ones who didn't make it
And a photograph of my traveling friend
And goodness did heaven know
There is none to harm
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
I'll carry you home
Weekenders on our own
And that's all right aww baby
There's one minute of your day
I never thought for one second I'd have nothing left but shame
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
When he feels like he should be having his fun
This parasite inside me I forced it out
And you try not to put on any sexy clothes or graces
I'm feeling crossed, I take it inside
Like my father's come to pass, twenty years has gone so fast
Light up, light up
Do you believe you're missing out
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
With anyone who might
'Cause I need you back by my side
There's nothing I can do now
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
Whenever I'm alone with you
They could have texted me when they were here, but I'm fucked and I don't care
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find 
I've got no where to run 
We're entering a brave new world
He smiles politely back at you
Paddle on, just around the bend and
And time is on your side
That defines the meaning of their lives
By the way your hands were shaking
You slipped away nanana
It's been cold, cold Campbell's from the can
Now you're here, now you're away
Scratching at the door
Some wouldn't even bother and then you came around
Measured in miles
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
It's just been raining on my face
Your eyes set on the ether
I have tried in my way to be free
But it never got into you
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause
If this town's your sinking ship
The past is still the past
Can we simply starve this sin
I still remember
Back with the streets I know
Love can last forever
I may not have the softest touch
With one hand high
But the little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
What if I could sing just one song and it might save somebody's life
Frozen from the failing mess you made your own
And now you're asking me to listen
Alright, relax
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
When I rang you at home, they said you'd left, yesterday
And always fool me
Watching the waves dragging out of our reach
So I pull my collar up and face the cold
I'm gonna buy a gun
So hurry up and run to the one that you love
Do you find it hard to sit with me tonight
Are you at one, or do you lie
Listening to her voicemail
Like I'm made of paper, oh woah
You played yourself to death in me
There's things I remember, things I forget,
Nothin' else to do but close my mind
So I wait for you to call and I try to act natural
You'll never hear the message I give 
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
My head is full of flames
For no matter how much I really do want to stay
Hold onto love
What if I was someone different in your only history
And I'd wager all, the hazards of love, the hazards of love
Like I need you
Yes we gave it a try
Makes a boy out of me
I need a good luck charm to give me good luck
Oh well now what's the point in doing all of that
Farewell my black balloon
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
A little girl lost in the woods
Where I can shelter in peace
My revolution thoughts
You give me three cigarettes 
Said, "Pity please the ones who serve,
I keep making these todo lists but nothing gets crossed out
Please don't go away
'Cause things are gonna change so fast
And no matter what I do, I can't make you feel better oh oh
The night's hard to get through
Never meant to cause you no pain;
Cold was the night, and hard was the ground
So they jokingly nicknamed it the porridge,
Twoheaded boy, she is all you could need
Wonder if she's gone to stay
And end up together
All I wanted to say
Ocala is calling
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
So come on, love, draw your swords
We'll fall just like stars being hung by only
I've never felt this way before
Slowly walk away
And when you stand in front of my eyes
And maybe I just set aside the fact that you were brokenhearted
This one's nearly gone
You are calm and reposed
Where I laid and told you but you swear you loved me more
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
And time as it stands won't be held in my hands
We always knew that it'd come to this
Oh my God, the shuffling and the floor
I'm not a fool
And we will never feel again
Quote we never talk unquote
Woke up and climbed from the suicide machine
Well where are you now
Some say love is a burning thing
Twentyseven people, even more
When I was a kid, I thought
In the cold light of day
I'm waitin' in the dark
But no matter what you'll never see me cry
This face in front of me
 years old, slow walking alone
I took a piece of you the day I left the womb 
Oh take me back to the start
And we danced, and we drank
Baby goodbye
There's an angel in the snow
You say I'm crazy
I'll forever know
I'll stand up with you forever
Car is parked, bags are packed, but what kind of heart doesn't look back
I'm shining like fireworks
I feel me
This is not my life
And it may not make much sense
You never hear me talk about one day getting out
When you're dreaming with a broken heart 
When there's nowhere left to fall
And for the first time in my life
It's time to turn off
Like I thought she would
I would fall down, down on my knees,
All alone in the dark
Don't you know she's got a baby
Are welcome
She always dreamt of a fairytale life
Walking a fine line between wrong and right
And true love lives
You snuff the blaze, turn to vapor then you float away
I'm trying to figure out
So you fed me shit to digest
Is remedied, oh, my blue heaven,
And you said that I was liar and I'm lost somewhere on the inside, forever alone
'This sun never sets again
I just know that she warms my heart
For this heart's a little bit colder
Yeah make yourself a photograph and laugh at me please
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
I see just who you are
And once there was a desk
I shot the pilot
I can't prepare for death any more than I already have
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'
First tell me which roads you will take
Reach for a hand to hold
But I want you to know that I need you right now
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it oh
I carry you on 
I was cold as I mouthed the words, and crawled across the mirror
And looks down at my breaking face
So I'm always pacing around or walking away
Smile down on us, sun
Oogie waits for just another day
But the truth is I'm only guessin'
That's how you fight it
How can you know it when you don't even try
And you may go but I know you won't leave
You got me scattered in pieces
Tracer lighting up the sky
So far away, away
One love, NERD
Who you foolin
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
I can't sleep no more, baby
When I see you in my dreams at night
To melt the street beneath your feet
And you see someone that you physically despise
Never stuck around long enough for a one night stand 
Why does it have to go from good to gone
With the way I fear
How my heart was blind
And I had a feeling that I belonged
Beneath the brilliant showroom light
'Cause nobody's going to save us
Our sky fell down tonight
Is that all you need
But you can have all that's left, yeah yeah yeah
Living the good life, I left for dead
Never got the chance to go that far Never got the chance
I want back my virginity
In my heart I know, I can let go
And it's going to carry on
My dying prayer, sealed in a scream
He says help me out, hell is coming
Down by your side
Only fools rush in
And the words still ring, once here, now gone;
Want you here tonight, want you here
That almost made you cry
I hope you can hear me
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
I am flying on a star, star, star
'Cause I don't want to leave home
And there's a memory of a window
Lookin' at the stars
Once a time they nearly might have been
Oh, lie to me
And I found another one
Don't leave me in all this pain
And take the pieces and build them up to the sky
Lonely and frightened
'Cause it's too hard to belong to someone who is gone
When she says she has no time for you now
Everybody needs a soul
Just keeping the peace between the sheets
Losing sight of life, day by day
And the road travels on
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I try again 
'Cause our days were rough
Presence of people not for me
Oh, you're almost home
And if we all believe in heaven
I wanna feel with the seasons
Anybody waiting at home for you,
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
I hope you're well
To prove you still feel 
We lost our way back home
Then I'll be your pride
A handshake of carbon monoxide
'Cause we have spoken everything
I long for peace before I die
It's no sacrifice at all
But the water keeps on falling from my eyes
When I walk around all of the streets
A house
If our hearts get torn
Come to me once more, my love
You want a top hat on your head
I know you think that I'm someone you can trust
La lullaby, distract me with your eyes
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
I'm not a man of too many faces 
'Cause maybe something's wrong with me
I'll be in despair
When you stole the car and drove towards Mexico
But nobody ever hears him
When you're with me, oh, won't you please forgive me
But I was just thinking, merely thinking
Little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
Now, when you look at me, you're condemned to see
Look through your fear, you're still blind to my way
And how broken my heart is
Now all that I can really say is baby, oh
You'll be gone x
You must risk something that matters
Give me all of your dreams
I say that I'm a bantam lightweight
I fell in love with the actress
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Holding back the fool again
Child, you know how much I need it
Chained together for life
Yeah, we couldn't destroy a single one
Before I'm dead and gone
I said sometimes I hear my voice and it's been
Oh, the world is round and so I'll go around
To be everything I'm supposed to be
Maybe just for a moment things would seem all right
We are tested and pained
I wanna get you back again
I didn't give to you on purpose
The photograph on the dashboard taken years ago
In several more years no one will care
And mildew on my glass
And I can picture it after all these days
I'll do what I can to show her the way
I love you the last time
I have to come to terms
I got my knuckles bruised
Eyes like a car crash
He doesn't think is funny 
But you tear and tear your hair from roots,
You were the only face I'd ever known
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
Who am I to need you now
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone
Baby, I love you today but I don't believe, I don't believe
A different name
I don't want to risk our paths crossin' someday
A kiss goodnight
Graze it with their wind arrows
All twisted metal stretching upwards
Together we cry
Taste the milk of your mother earth's love 
But I'm working all weekend
As long as I keep my distance 
And you're lying in the rain
I'm holdin' on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
It isn�t any trouble
They're the prayer that I say every day
Become someone better
It has not healed with time
The rd floor
When I go to bed
Because the man wasn't good he was great
Do you wanna run away together
Stop sending letters
So you stole my world now I'm just a phony
No one's got it aaall
Talks about one day we having a place of our own
For angels to fly
My future is not set,
"Sorry" like the angel heaven let me think was you
And use his credit card again 
So I'm taking these pills for to fill up my soul
It was just like a song
Don't look back, keep your head held high
Like can't you see the grass is greener where it rains 
Leave me to die, you won't remember my voice
Come lay me low and love me
So many things remind me of you
Want you by my side
A fifty year old, reminiscing what I had
This whole life is a hallucination
Her love is all that I can see
I'm burning slowly I'm growing weak
And I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
And all the broken glass swept off the avenue
But I will have to say
I search in snow, in vain
Shouldn't change you,
Will you come for me
Last night I heard my own heart beating
The words are tightening around my throat and, and
Crying rain
A chance for calm, a hope for freedom
The one
And all of your thoughts on God
And what you make the truth
Are the wonders of this world
If there's one more chance for us here tonight
Around 
Say you follow your heart
But I can't, I can't give you a reason
But I am not afraid of anything 
Drink the colors of the night time
It's a place of sorrow but we call it a home
Or paralyze in light
Slips her dress like a flag to the floor
The sun warms my face
And maybe I'm just stupid
We might as well be living in a different world
My only one
Oh, the room was silent 
Hear my feet, they are made of stone
But it's alright, why don't you tell me again
It will all go black 
Now our hands are tied
Ending what had begun 
When I hear your voice, it's drowning in the whispers
I built a barricade to block you on the road
She sends her regards
The fever pushing the day by
So you invade my sleep and confuse my dreams
Looking for some kind of clue
Where my grandmother drank
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
Down your face they pour 
I've got the feeling we're gonna die we're gonna die
Back when I had those fights with my old man
Take the gun, and count to three
Don't you wonder why we never talk about the future
This constant yearning 
In hand a single rose
So make your way on down to the sea
In a town full of rubber plans
Watch them fade away
One man's close pursuit is another man's
There's proof in the sky
He sailed the sea for a hundred years
'Cause no one's tried to give you
Kissin' me, your lips painted black
Still and all it would be hours
I'll remember it
You're gonna make us scream someday
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Just made her more interesting
And so is the girl you used to call
He said Dolores I live in fear
To speed away
'Cause the one I loved today, I hardly know
Let me tear myself apart I need to breathe
No one laughs at God in a war
You're my baby baby baby baby baby
And ice cream castles in the air
She's in your bones
And the rumours of his parties and the orgies on his yacht
But when I pass your house, I won't stop no matter how bad I want to
Of my world, yeah
Stop me from crying
Where I'd find your face
From you, my love
Well this is something else, who would comprehend
Don't you know she's got a babe
Her mama called me a thief
Stop thinking about the easy way out
That the flame we had is burning out
Whatever makes you happy
I felt lost and found with every step I took
Do you wish it was me
I'll steer myself through choppy waves
But the less time that I spend with you
With my ghostly tears
And everybody wants to be special here
With the credit report for duty call
Newspaper blow across the court
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Everyday is like Sunday
Someone's got a stamp that I can borrow
Some great big disease
It's a beautiful thing when it starts to rain
However long you stay, is all that I am
Why she felt that way, she felt it, every day
To battle is the only way we feel alive
It took so long just to feel alright
I'll still adore you, you'll never need me
His father sent him to his death
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
In the way I had planned
Handsome groom, give her room
He says, bad day, looking for the great escape
All he needed was a beating heart
What is deeper than the grave
at the first showing
Where whitey bastard made a bomb
But nothing I can say will change anything
Round here, we all look the same
Last time I didn't know
I'm resting my mind
She hasn't much to hold onto
That my love for you is blind
Prepare a list for what you need
The grave is the bed
But I know that I love you through the hole in the sky
You were not honest
Just stay in when it's lookin' this way
I have no fear anymore
Tuscarawas flows into
I can't breathe but I feel
Gloomy Sunday
It was so easy and the words so sweet
Then a phone call made me realize
I live in a southern town
The sun is bright, the sky is black
Would you cry with me 
For the kiss, kiss
So you're backtracking
And I will love you till I die
Think of a birthday
Never fall in love with potential
Nananana, yeah, oh
With a knife in her hand
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
So when the birds fly south 
You've scared them all to death
Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space
So don't cry Delilah 
Tell me you love me
I don't know how I feel when I'm around you
Tonight will be your very last night
We're a rubbernecker's dream
You didn't know that I was watching
Someday when you're lonely 
Sorrow's my body on the waves
Unless a light bulb really loved him very much
When your smile is so wide and your heels are so high
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
Could it be that everything goes 'round by chance chance
But there I was picking pieces up
All I want in life's a little bit of love to take the pain away
We beat him with guns
We couldn't wait to get outside
Your body's cold
With no one here just by your side
I'd be anyone to be at your side
Wish that I'd go to bed
'Til her eyes became sore
No hope, no love, no glory
Resting on the shoulders
With tears from me
From the eyes of a child
I feel so nervous 
Get too frightening
I guess I'll go home now
And it feels like somebody is
Cell phone number here, call if you have the time
This one's called 'Stella was a diver and she is always down'
And late in a star's life
Saw the ocean all around
I could fall, or I could fly
Pink pill feels good
And you know it was money well spent
Distorted eyes when everything is clearly dying
Dropping little reels of tape, to remind me that I'm alone
Because
This is the way you left me Oh, I feel as if I'm wastin'
But somehow, I found my baby that night
You keep coming back to tell me you're the one who could've been
All alone
We're all the losers now
In mine when I'm asleep
Can you see the light
I need my girl
It wants what it wants baby
And I'll always need her more than she could ever need me
These tears just can't erase, I don't need them anymore
Since you took your love away
And slit the necks of soldiers while they sleep
I know the world is black and white
Takes one step forward, looks back and then walks away
I'm talking to you before
I had to have this talk with you
Holy star
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Don't you wish that life could be as simple
When I'm lonely
To shoot the breeze, love again
I saw your face in a crowded place
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
The routine daydream starts to sock it off
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
I had a dream
Jack it up Judy, set your heart alight
But no one's in your head
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
The boy done wrong again
Here in my hand 
You make me feel like I am young again
And love's a raven when it flies
He beat her cold
Such a chill
Good times for a change
You're the feeling of hurting
I really wish I got to say goodbye
Forgive me, I'm trying to find
But now it's just a monument
I'd not be stuck here in this hole
When it rains it pours down
The reception's gotten fuzzy
If you don't then lie
The fingers unfold 
You're more than a superstar
I see your face, it's haunting me 
The last three years were just pretend
Do I feel lonely too
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
You're the one who's always bruised and broken
Possibly maybe,
Don't come back to me, don't come back at all
Nothing could bring me further from my old friend time
And he told me that I'd done alright
Hold me darlin', for a little while
So now I'm sleeping next to mousetraps
Museums mark their bodies down
Sundown paints the shadows through
Maybe it's change
Appear, my dear, and cry for me
But you you still tell me how you didn't know what to do even now,
Morning comes in Paradise, morning comes in light
Talking shit about a pretty sunset
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
A man has to have a little bit of variety
Caught in the confines of the simple life
Don't wanna stop, cause I want you back
To hold eternally
Come around Ruby, I could never sleep alone
On those endless games
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
When the night is cold
But I still sing glory from a highrise
Oh, come to me once more, my love
But I know that we tried everything we could try
See the stains of winter's grass
Flatter and colder
I still feel your love
You make this all go away
They say it's not becoming
Tides will bring me back to you
You sure aren't gonna say
Put your insides all on ice 
"I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
You walk up to her
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
As if I'd rather be alone with me instead
Your wild guess, everything will be explained
And even if I need you here
We are here for you
A knight in crystal armour
Seems like you never really knew me
You said you'd be mine
And that I'd climb through your window
And I'll watch your face
For awhile you were here
And how can it matter Ohohohoh Ohohohoh
My life had barely started since you jumped all my heart
I've seen it all, I've seen the dark
And the ground below grew colder
It has left its seeds like a tomb inside me
Dead in the stare of a thousand miles
There's something missing in my heart You are missing in my heart
Seems I have stolen a horse and I step to the gallows
Your smile is so wide and your heels are so high
And now I wish I'd stayed 
You're throwing it all away at the end of the day
I never wanted anything so bad
But then you said, the emotions are dead
But I can't imagine a life without
But when I look into your eyes, it pieces up my heart
On the roof above the streets
After all the lies that I made you believe
And he listened obediently
Dance halls are empty
To come around and cover everything
I had such a night
The whole thing's tumbling down
Somehow we lost our heads for the last time
Me with you, face to face
To see your son on Saturdays, what way is that to live your life
We were fools to think that nothing would go wrong
To face the fear but
And cried, "My children, my children
The emptiness starts to drown
So let's let these tiny acts of charity be common ground on which to build
Blunted and exhausted like anyone
Hiphop, gotta love it, fuck it
Take a breath, I pull myself together
I got my own kindsa groovy
And fuck you, fuck you, love you
To make sense of the signs
All the light that you possess is skewed by lakes and seas
Until everyone knows that your smile is just a ghost
And he kissed me till the morning light
I will bring a mirror, so silver, so exact
'Cause it's not hard to fall
I remember you said
Even when it's day
And watch as it dies from bleeding
But it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
These foolish games are tearing me apart
'Cause I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
Getting your hair from under your bed 
But nothing cures the hurt you bring on by yourself,
Into the darkness passing over the faces in the river
To watch me while I bleed
"Live and love"
I'm watching through my own light
And even though you're not all alone
Take a look, you might see me on the ground
I can't think of what they're for, oh, they ruin me every time
Were not enough, it used to feel like dreaming
I love it when you sing to me
'Cause I'm picking up the message, Lord
Put on your gloves and your black pumps
All he wanted was a toy
If I'm goin' fuck bitches then they better be tight
Or did I believe this dream
And bury it in parking lots
If you just stay with me we could make it through
Sometimes it just feels better to give in
I'd never want someone so crass 
Well, they trade in their places
Trains and sewing machines oh, you won't catch me around here
And your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
On his frozen face
I check my palms, the cracks in the sidewalk
Love or not I've always got
Who's gonna walk you side by side
There's a dream that I see, I pray it can be
City lights lay out before us
There's a muddy field where a garden was
Go where you are little pond
I, don't know how I feel when I'm around you
The wall breaks on the phone if at all, if you call 
Until the end of time
We'll die inside this salted earth together
�だ�しlove song
Oh, don't carve me out Don't let your silly dreams,
You were there by my side
Probably watching porn of you from the fall 
You dance all wack
She says she has no time for you now
I'll make sure I'll look
Out of doors, and into stores with bigger names
Shards of words of a shattered voice
I'm not pretending
And never could I tell it was him
The same blood runs in every hand
I guess she doesn't have a choice
And it took a long time till I came clean with myself
You made one last stop at the store
And then I heard what you say, man, that was ugly
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
I'm so used to my life with you around
Visions from a dying brain
And nothin' holds relevance
Those nights would never end
You talk too much
Just one more line to keep me sleeping loudly and cold
The ocean is blue
But I just can't sleep on this tonight
On my heart, I'll bear the shame
You've not heard a single word I have said
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off
Your lips, your eyelashes, your skin 
How's it going to be, when there is no one there to talk to
Looks like a thousand swirling eyes 
Now it's time
And though I may not look like much
From things it's not meant to see
Yeah, 'cause we are broken
It's so beautiful it makes you want to cry
To gold
From another time
Spin me around till I fell asleep
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
But you won't stop crying
Yeah, that's what you think, and you hope she'll sing
There was a riot coming
And deep down inside, you know it's killing me
I just want to love you just because I do
There must always 
This is the part of me that's trying to be funny
It's love's illusions I recall
I'd sing to you just one more time
Burn my knees and, burn my knees and
So still I wait
I do this thing where I think I'm real sick
You'll say don't fear your dreams; it's easier than it seems 
I stand outside this woman's work
Beyond that man, he brings a world of pain 
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I need another world
Digging for Kryptonite on this oneway street
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you
Burning holes straight through my heart
No one ever listens, this wallpaper glistens
By the beautiful and good in this city
Let's bow our heads
I miss sleep
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
For love that cannot live yet never dies
When you're little and the world's so big
You showed me love
I stayed the same
And the piano's this melancholy soundtrack to her smile
Be an end 
When you leave don't say
Now that you gone
Our wonderful memories
But in time you'll get settled, and we will write
And sometimes I wonder
Oh sorta let her when I need it
And nobody's gonna tell me now
Just keep going to the bathroom, always say you'll be right back
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky
You'll want to be mine
City bird, haven't you heard
About the future
That can mend These broken bones
And I'm so happy now that you're gone
I can picture your face well from the bar in my hotel
And you're, you're so long gone from the city
Stand here beside me baby, watch the orange glow
Who's gonna talk to you
Save everything
All the girls that you run dry
Yeah, yeah
And dream about things
Although my clothes are all wet, tell me
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
She was  years old and she'd never seen the ocean
Ride the wind that brought you back away
Laughing into the fire, is it always like this
Than to show my skin
Everything's ending here
If I smile and don't believe
And the dancing centaur queen flies past
When I threw that drink in that guy's face
This time I'm coming down
A silence I can't ignore,
And I've been trying to make
Es war ein Stück vom Himmel
Of this life, well hang on
Slipping into mine
I never thought we'd be here
Those are just a long lost memory of mine
I knew my loss before I even learned to speak
To our love a valentine of blood
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
Now it's time to sing along
It felt just like the old days
Take your life, give it a shake
It's only your shadow, never yourself
I woke up and one of us was crying
I want to give him pain
'Cause I can't believe what I found
Without my love and my best friend
And I'm sure the view from heaven
Love of my life
There were times you really made me smile and
With neither heart or spine
You can go, you can stay
No amulets, not a charm to bring you back to my arms
But I didn't
Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit
We gotta live our lives
Shameless as an ocean and
But I've made the change,
And the clouds are goin' by me
I wanna' show you all the pain
So for tonight I'll stay here with you
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
I have travelled the world
Will someone care to classify
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Quickest girl in the frying pan
As the hunger pains grow inside
What if you could hear this song
And when I left your place
I take my last match with desperate passions and a few up facts
With your heart and your clothes when I find
Universe surrounds
Got a crazy sensation, go or stay now I gotta choose
'Twas my greatest thrill
I can't pretend
I've been cycling in circles 'round your empty streets
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
I wouldn't worry, you have all your life
I never thought he'd be an old man
that always repeats, 
The roses came but they took you away
You'd be scratching your head through the best advice you knew
So please understand
Nothing yet has really sunk in
And the worst part is there's no one else to blame
So I go all the way, like I really really know
Together we cry, oh, oh
I made you mine
It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
My father's love was always strong
I'm so glad you remembered
Yeah, your eyes closed, your head hurts
And I think you need it too
You know what I need
Please don't fall apart
Until the Soviets turned their ships around
You've been looking for someone you can trust
What once was a Emerald City is now a crystal town
All my windows still are broken
A gag is placed between her lips
I fall asleep to the sound
Will you stop working for the dead and return
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
Good good bye, tinsel shine
You're eating my heart away
I think you lost what you loved
Don't have a soul on my side
I am good, I am grounded
My life had barely started since you jumped all on my heart
My mother
'Cause it's all shot to hell down here
Ooh The sun don't shine
Let's pretend, happy end
I know the day will come
That's all and for us, that's as good as it got
Straight into my mind
I've been crying on the inside over you
And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
Slip slidin' away
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right
But the proof's in the way it hurts
Crash land, no illusions
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Me and my broken heart, yeah
She calls around finds me crying,
I've been thinking of the things that I missed
When striving leads you far from home
And nobody's watching you now
And now I miss everything about you
And look for your children
And knowing nothing at all
There I was in uniform
'Cause it's so far past me now
Still you wait for Joey to come
I got the message long before you said you knew
Reminds my heart what love can yield
And now look for you from within
I cannot tell if you mean what you say
You might say you don't miss me, you don't need me
I'm sure it didn't ruin her
I really miss your hair in my face
Yeah, I was her man
Then the sky turned black,
Of your name
And just as love's silhouette appears 
Long nights allow 
By the way your hands were shaking 
To be acknowledge by some touch from his gnarled hands
Run away from me baby, run away
They're like searching for you
Sweetheart, may not be easy
It was just to piss you off
And it's no sacrifice
And hear your voice of treason
He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown
But hey, what daddy always tell you
But that's life, so social
Someone choose
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
There is no night time, it's only a passing phase
It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget
There's no use in trying, when the pieces don't fit anymore
But the water keeps on falling from my tries
And they will know how I love them 
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody needs to know
Not a fool
When sorry seems to be the hardest word
There's still a little bit of your ghost, your witness
Cold, cold heart
This life's too good to last 
A pink and silver day
I'm blue and cold
You could stay within these walls and bleed
I'm gonna run to the river
I get a flash and I smile
But it sounds like bubble gum
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope
I know deep inside
Spinning round inside my head
My back turned towards the sun
But something told me that it wouldn't last
But could you send back the only man she loved
Share with me
Goodbye
I don't need any help to be breakable, believe me
And when he calls, he calls for me, and not for you
For I'm left with nothing but this bloodless river bank
However far away, I will always love you
And the third is almost fallen 
Hopefully, the hate subsides, and the love can begin
Won't come your way, yeah
They're playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us
I could stay here
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by
You will be back someday
Can you stop the pain
You must be tired of taking care of me
Today's the day I realized that I could be loved
Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder
Your voice is all I hear somehow
You can't say I haven't tried
In the end
Nothing's more
Remember today
Around your knees that crackle into the dark
Thinking about everything we've been through
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me
It was my voice that moved the first rock
He hopes that we can still be friends
Love you so it hurts my soul
She said, money is like us in time
But when you tell them soldiers my name
But my heart it still sings
Your grand dad left home for the circus
tremors that warn us
You said, "Let's save it for another day"
Your arm's got a death in it
I've been waiting for you to come in
Sell me a car that goes
Das Leben ist nicht fair
Even though I'm far away
No one laughs at God on the day they realize
With you by my side
There's enough for everyone
The chains to my life are strong, but soon they'll be gone
You're so quiet and you never make a sound
I'm tangled up inside
Just be glad that you did and stay there
Hey now, don't forget that change will save you
Don't mind if you can take it
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
Got his hat tipped bottle back in between his teeth
Notice me, take my hand 
And you'd take care of me
And will you never say that you love me, just to put it in my face
Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars
To leave and turn to dust
Was a coal black egg until the god inside
I don't want to be old and sleep alone
This splintered mast I'm holding on won't save me long
There's not one moment I'd erase
You just took the train
My sadness shows
So dry your eyes
All the time we had
I want to be the place you call home
But all I got are these roses to give,
Well, it's just like being alone
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
And the way I felt inside
To meet him eye to eye and face to face
Mother, mother, mother
By sharing these things,
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
Sensitivity builds a prison
For you know this isn't the first time
And we'd lay there in the darkness
I really need a raincoat
No one in this fair new world can talk us through this situation
Since you're gone the world is not the same
Please don't walk away,
If I may weep
When God takes you back he'll say, "Hallelujah
Would it make you feel better
She buys a new dress for the party
When they're talking to you
I'll hold on to your heart
But he's a fool
You might say that you don't care, oh
He hears that outside, a small boy just started to cry
You just gotta let it go
Not today, today, today, today, today
Well you held me like a lover
Does he lie below snagged in the fingers of a seaweed tress
The sun would stream on the sheets
I'd like to bring a little light
The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
My favorite dog is buried in the yard
And curse my mother's name
To the town where I was born
The more that I fake it and pretend I don't care
But now I tell myself I've mended under these patches of blue sky
Deep in pain, she is so far
I keep pretending not to care
Because there's been a great deal of discussion, yes,
Will there be peace
'Til finally there is nothing left
But just remember that when I touch you 
All beginnings and endings, 
I want deep space
'Cause I've got noone but you
If you see mother, tell her I can sing
 pounds, wearing black and white stripes
Flowers in the love of my arms
Nothing to embrace
Now I'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around
Another time undone
Don't let this desperate moonlight leave me
These matters be
Why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why
I guess it's funnier from where your standing
Even if you were a million miles away
What's going on behind the eyes
The last selection in the ballgame
It won't matter, what's the point of this
This love is a mystery
While your house is swaying
Running all the red lights
But I won't hold my breath
Graduation day
What a coincidence, your Papa was a rodeo too
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
Hearing no bell from a steeple tall, people all in dismay
A bourbon brown that can burn my eyes
Don't go and lose your face
Desperately close to a coffin of hope
Will you take me away
I'm always dreaming and it's never for real
You will always be a loser now"
I'm all alone
One of these mornings
Change in the air
I am the snow, I am the snow, I am the snow
My head is lead, I don't ever want to go to bed
Place the blame into my arms
When she's breaking his heart she still fucks like a tease
To remove the stain of my love
Goodbye to you
Flies dip tongues into tear ducts
She said, "Some days I feel like shit"
Those singing morphine alarms out of tune
If you loved me
And there's no one road
I walk in a trance
I love you even more
When the TV has gone out
Don't punish yourself; leave it well alone
The ice was getting thinner 
But she just drops her pearlblack eyes
And the darkest thoughts, yeah, I guess they're my own
His name was Donovan
Love me, wherever you are
When she is dancing her little home dance on me
My toes are warm
Put me to shame now
And men can do terrible things
Our love can save us now
Yesterday
And when the hour is upon us
While the hours pass so slow
As your best friend
Her eyes were bright, tonight he finds her
He's acting dumb, that's what you've come to expect
And no one's going to tear me down
I know I'm not your only, but at least I'm one;
The day our house collapsed
And I'm just having thoughts I said
When I say,
Everyday, to make myself feel bad
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
Just to find a home that's for the restless
So take me to the airport 
The miles
So now I'm leaving you alone
Since we kissed through the darkness until it was dawn
No one will love you the way I do
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
To say a single word
By blood and by me, and I'll fall when you leave
Tell everybody
Home was anywhere with diesel gas, love was a trucker's hand 
These aren't tears of sadness
Are we ever going to start making sense
So come on kid, look at what you did
If I tell you you're mine
But it's gone
My face is as white as the snow that haunts me
Oh why can't I be what you need
But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie
And I didn't mind; it's not my kind
In a dream you appear
And don't fool yourself 
Filled with pain
I hope you're waiting for me 
'Cause I'm pretty when I cry
Goodbye, my almost lover
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
So she took her love
And now it kills me just to hear you say the simple things
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so you will listen when I say baby
To lead him through the dark
All this time I was wasting
But from dusk till dawn
And maybe you'll be all right
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms
And it's not the good kind
And I'll bet you are just fine
Powder blue, oh
And find some kind of grace
My feet are always heavy as I inch toward the door
Weatherman
Probably still is for those of them left
I've been so lost since you've gone
This time it's all of me
Then you have got to set them free
Can't you see that this is life and life is killing me
He'll be back sometime
And I got nothing to look forward to
I'm at home in the clouds
you're not going to come back 
And if you fall
Ice cold winds swept my heart away
After you're gone
This time next year, we'll be no more, oh yeah
So I asked him how he became this man,
To watch the things you gave your life to broken
The less you need to heal
The chance to
I was used for amusement
And I believe in therapy 
the hours don't have a beginning, or end 
And when I write them out they don't make sense
Hindley wakes and Hindley says
My family tree's losing all its leaves
Ooh Laura, you're more than a superstar
Sometimes the last thing you want comes in first
You found your little game to play
Until later doesn't always come
How am I supposed to send this shit out
I was closer to you back then
If you take me there you'll get relief
I lived, I lived I loved I loved
I say goodbye
Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Sometimes I wonder where you are
'Cause I need you
Never imagined we'd end like this
When it doesn't mean anything
From those old lips to a town where its dry
And I remember when you started callin' me your Mrs
You don't need to preach
And it's your first cigarette
Two hands digging in each others wounds
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend
I got  bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough
Punkrock tshirt, black cap and tattoo
And sleep the rest of the day
I want you to sigh and fall apart
They press their lips against you
I could have died right there
You are ready to use
You know I've sailed away
And someday you will ache like I ache
Somehow everything I own smells of you
Davy says that I look taller
About forgetting yourself for a while
May I say I loved you more
If only I could be in that bed again
Who controls the keys
So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to reassemble it
Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart, Just a little bit, baby, baby,
A new world just around the corner
And in between the moon and you, angels get a better view
So come back to me my darling
Waste some time with you
A streak of light above the trees
Stay at home or walk in alone
There with my crooked teeth and companions sleeping, yeah
But don't go tearing your life apart
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave ya, we'd only just begun
I was there to dry her tears
Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
High, high, neglectful lover
Your eyes feel so low
BabyI can't help you out, while she's still around
And I sighed and bleeded like a windfall
Knowing every moment is closer to your flight
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
We're stuck inside this salted earth together
I know I shouldn't look but I can't turn away
Better find the one that fits
Keep my eyes down below
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
Driving home the sky accelerates,
Those are words I'll never say I'll never say
Maybe we'll make something
And three days later was clear to all
And claim all that has spoiled in your heart
But could not make you stay
Crawling back home again
A thousand faces we'll choose to ignore
But never is a promise and you can't afford to lie
In my life, I love you more
You're on the other side
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, let's have a toast for the assholes
And that's why I want you to sing it anyway
Baby let's stop and sleep for a spell
seems like yesterday 
Of my life
But compared to your eyes
Dreams of mountains sunk
This, I need
When the truth is I miss you
Still I cling
It's a call
I try to believe you
When there's nothing much to defend
A firecracker flash of light then on
The ground never seemed so far away 
And he knows all the ways of the wind
As the bruises turn to yellow
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
'Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough
Don't me leave me dying, without a lover to hold
Makes her body older than it really is
I'm living over city
But I am good, I am grounded
Oh it's so sad
Your chance to even up the score
Well this is torturous electricity
Does he still look just like you
The new day's begun
I still wish you'd fought me till your dying day
Higher than I've ever been babe
Don't for a minute change the place you're in
The stumbles and falls brought me here
No you still don't like to leave before the end of the show
I'm sorry if I smothered you
With the strobe of the sun and the life I've led
I'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime
I had tender feelings that you made hard
Timid without a hand
To keeping you away
You'd put your hand up and interrupt the conversation with a, but
"Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head"
You're the one whose shower's always golden
It was magical,
It hurts to remember
I always have
I must have held your hand so tight, you didn't have the will to fight
Aufnehmen Wen
Make a halo with your hands
But pretty soon the day came for change
While we dance in the moonlight
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
Feels so hard to say
In endless circles
Don't start me tryin' now, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
But I'm going to stop pretending
I'll say the things that you said
'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room
I scrape my hands until they bleed
Calm my fears and soothe me
Losing the star without a sky
But once that's done, man, there's nothing to do
Less your lover
Now tell me, what have I done
There are no friends to cheer him up and
In one single moment, your whole life can turn 'round
And no one likes to be alone
I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Ah, it was sweet
You turn into a song
The lights on the riverbank, they just much reach
You keep on building the lie
Could you imagine when they turned their backs
Did you hear the news about Edward
Cupped hands whispering into ears
That you were crying
And I will pretend
Never to see your face again;
No matter how hard I try
Don't worry about it, don't worry about anything
Enjoy the ride, the medicine show
What did I find
And now I'm older, see it face to face
While you've been pushing me around
We're falling forward
On this shallow land
Makes me want to say
A black eyed dog he knew my name
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness
The waves will pull us under
There's nothing I wouldn't do to hear your voice again
I don't need to be, yeah I don't need to be
When the swingset hit his head
Don't you know she's got a babe I know
And that was called love for the workers in song
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
Points to my beloved
In strange ideas, in stranger times
Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay
Hit the ground and run
Just come inside
My neck feels stiff until I wake up
I'm getting to the end
Why you gotta be mean
That one day I will be, where I was
Nobody girl
Fucking glow in the dark
Come back and haunt me
And round, and round, and round, and round, and round, and round
I want you here tonight, I want you here
And I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
I don't think you know what I feel
You're not listening anyway
And float in space and drift in time
Forgot how to cry
Baby you gotta believe in the things that make you & me win together
Shannon just flew down Four days back in town
Lacking me inside
Try to hold on try
Everything to me 
Ich werde in die Tannen gehen
Killers reinvent and believe
And hope someone will save me this time
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Your place is in the sky, how can I show you
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
And a dream that I was chasing and a battle with booze
And they smiled at me
May your children play beneath
He waits to hear her say "forgive"
You didn't know how to react to being seen
I've no idea what's right sometimes
I only want to see you smile
Secure the grounds
But I cry instead
Saying goodbye this time the same old story
Oh despair, 
You got vacation days then you might escape
There goes another one that kept me breathing
Our love, our love, in a ball of yarn
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn
And you like to party and have fun
Goodnight, may your dreams be so happy and your head light
From this moment
When it's all said and done
With laughter still ringin' in my ears
Easy as two times two
And everything is turning blue now
Found a way to understand the things I'm learning 
But you do this every time 
This is the way that we love
Side by side in orbit around the fairest sun
Why does my heart why does my, my, my feel so bad feel so bad
How did it ever come so far
Or wheeling through an endless fog
I didn't know, didn't know, didn't know
'Cause no one will hear it
Even though she doesn't want me around
We'd never turn out to be real
So help yourself to this bitter pill
Will not cry in public, less chance of illness
I may be blind
Or justify your lies
Fireburned and blew out flowers
You should take more time
Then I had better end it quick or I could lose my nerve
Now each moment is the same
The way they show they care
It's the easiest line you could break
So just kill me now and let the good times roll
Nervous, I'm knocking on your door
I'll write you a letter tomorrow
And though you say you've found another who will surely speed you on your way
You don't deserve to be lonely
Most people were overjoyed
I think I want to change my oxygen
That hurt too bad to when we both begin to cry
And right now there's a war between the vanities
Put all your fears back in the shade
That's what I'd say
My mother lies alone on her back at night
In a space that's too small
Where no one notices the contrast of white on white
Midnight moon shines through it all
Days when I still felt alive
All alone, all together, all together in the dark
And you can't bear the thought
Why does my heart feel so bad
The whole damn thing makes no sense
We'll never get so close as when the sunward flight begins
The minor fall and the major lift
It's left this house empty now, not sure if I belong
So much stuff you got to understand
Love ridden, I've looked at you
As I disappear tonight
So here we are, the witching hour 
Coffee black and egg white
And then the silver turns to gray
With their cap in hand
Around you still
Oh but I know love as a fading thing
And the silence of our words
Some of them living, some of them dead
When You feel like my dreams are so far
mis dias sin ti son tan absurdos
I like your twisted point of view, Mike 
Sad to think it was just a fantasy
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
When two suns are shining
When she walks down the street
I'll be your clown behind the glass
All the glory when you ran outside
I don't even try
Nude as the news, nude as the news
Out of the evergreen that you helped your father cut away
The world is wide, the time goes by
I'm here to stay
She comes around you and me
With my tears, you'd make a sea a desert
So don't leave me here with only mirrors watching me
I finally got my orders
All these things that I've done
Nobody knows but me
What if you could wish me away
The memories shaken apart
Denied everything
Fall asleep with stranger's wives
Take me to that summer past
Not feelin' up to it now
There is so much space between us
I was doing time alive
Someone that looks like
We'll wish this never ends
I need your arms to welcome me
So many voices inside of her head
Oh help me please is there someone who can make me
You had kids to feed 
Rejoice although this world will devastate you
This is our last goodbye
As this tiny voice in
Won't let this build up inside of me
I was her cruelhearted man
To hide deep inside their sunken faces and their wild rolling eyes
Takes him away to war
We shared together, they'll stay with me forever
What they call love is a risk
And there's kids playing guns in the street
I know it was destined to go wrong
Need to wave 'em over here Swear Simone's kissing Dan
Said your Jackie's gone
This breath collapsed again
And so it's begun 
But turned around softly
Well I saw it in your movements
Either way I can't breathe
And the lead in the life 'cause I never play fair
Telling me he'd be home,
All throughout the morning, though I'm begging
And too old to just break free and run
I'll always look out for you
Oh, sleeping children better run like the wind
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts no, no, no
To ask for these things we'd lost
Look at what I lost today
And you slither away like the snake that you are
An angel will die, covered in white
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine
Goddamn, I hope I can pass high school means nothing
'Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me
So why's my baby lying on the side of the motorway
We know what we've lost when it's gone
"And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world", you said
You, on the other hand make yourself known
Then looking upwards
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet mother love
And I'm tired of being all alone,
And I know you have a heavy heart, I can feel it when we kiss
And an open invitation to the blues
Good morning, son
Being what you are
Or you could just let go and be lifted to the sky
And these dreams keep you awake
Love to aim at besides
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Options change
And who would he become, all the things he'd have done
There's no one here to blame
Is that what you thought love was for
You're gonna walk so far
That you just don't believe that I'm sincere
Don't you flan in the face
My vision's getting clearer
Photos show no tears in her eyes
The ugliness of being a fool
Oh, someday baby, someday
And now I try hard to make it
My thoughts bounce off Sam's guitar
I wonder if you feel the same way too
I see an elevator, a moment I am above
I guess it's luck, but it's the same
Now she seems to be sand under his shoes;
I don't regret a thing
And you'll never see your home again
Repeat to end
We broke up a month ago and I grew up; I didn't know I'd be around the morning after
And in the early morning light
My heart was blinded, love went astray
I have no reason why it should've been so plain
I want summersad songs behind me
You forced me to become strong
Seems that my pockets were filled up with gold
But it's all just a show
And always was this
And hold onto you,
He said "really, I just wanna dance"
She don't recognise your voice no more
Tried to figure out memorize their words for hope
And I'll make you okay and drive them away
What leaves you crying, and what makes you whole
'Cause baby, ooh
But leave that blanket around you 
While the children of makeshift hills
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Little soldier, little insect
With all of this I feel now
Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
But my happiness disappeared
And it hurts to say
We could go into town and spend some money
Leaving everything behind 
My life is brilliant
When hope begins to fade
For a bag of gold to you
The kingdom of men
"You're safe, child, you are safe"
But to know that the trust you had in me is gone
I look over my shoulder
Daddy's love makes me whole
Let me put on a show for you, daddy,
I have seen your face
Where kindness is a card game
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
I can't replace
How long did we all
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
We walk the streets to feel the ground
Anything
And I sing and sing of awful things,
The promise you gave
Made our choice, a trial by fire
On the street
Shot up hot from under the sea
His voice is dry and hollow
So much to love, so much to learn
Got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past
But don't strain yourself for me
Whatever that means so
And the will to show
And you'd speak of your loved ones as I clumsily strummed my guitar
Blue as seas, running to them
Because now the room is spinning
Never meant the words we meant
Lost in a simple game cat and mouse are we the same people as before this came to light
I say the road only grows long
Listen, little child, there will come a day
Cheap sex and sad films
To make me dream of you
Someone's always comin' around here trailing some new kill
To call and be nice
Yeah, we never talk about the future
Mmm whatcha say
Just as the sky turned black
Whatever on earth possessed you
Will be the last thing you'll ever need
Oh baby, how can I begin again
Maybe someday I will see you again
I guess the honeymoon is over
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
Not a family or honest plea remains to say 
'Cause when you feel like you're done
Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
'Cause I know the dreams that you keep
And that's why I need you here
But hopefully it will be fine
I guess I should have heard of that from you
How can it be you're asking me to feel things you never show
Tyres that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat, a good memory
I was listening to the radio and wondering what you're dreaming
'Cause I talk to you like children
Your eyes are crazy
This storm that's broken me
If I leave you it doesn't mean I love you any less
Now I don't know when but a day is gonna come 
Please be kind
Stop sign told me stay at home
I'll know that nothing
Maybe tomorrow
And it's just my luck to end up getting stuck 
Did I fall or was I pushed
I'll be strong, but whatever you do
How time grips you, sliming, in its spell
And I'm trying hard to work it out
It's not about not about angels, angels
In some sacred place
Smother me under the eyes
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
Don't write me no more letters, my mailbox is full of bombs
With your triumphs and your charms
Give it all away, just to have somewhere to go to 
They cut through bone
I could never show it
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts
All my resistance will never be distance enough
So I never went back
I feel just like
Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Into the flow of encrypted movement
Playground school bell rings again
And I know, and I see, you'll be breaking hearts again
Mark your place in time with another question why
Don't help me sleep
Of when you looked at someone else
Trying to occupy space
To remind me once again
Twisters rolled but no one walked in
Come upstairs and I'll show you where all my
I was
Let me photograph you in this light
Sound like the wind in my ears
You're still mine
I got too possessive but souls ain't for stealing
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Want to get myself back in again,
I've been searching deep down in my soul
If you're on your own in this life
And for the first time I've opened up my eyes
The mark that still remains
To let you know that you're not alone
If you love me got to know for sure
Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Don't think I ever believed that
But in my heart it was so real
I just want to love you when the goings tough
Where you are
So please put your sweet hand in mine I've been told only fools rush in
It's like I told you honey
But I'm sure gonna give you a try
No one ever said it would be so hard
'Scuse me, I apologize She's got vacuum cleaner eyes that suck you in
By the ghost of you
'Cause I won't be coming back
Can't pretend that I'm all right
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
I don't expect anything
Somewhere you're not coming back
I'll do anything for you
Worth it right now
But through it all I still feel lost without you
From the slavecatchers' songs
This woman's world
God my fingers burn,
In the early morning rain
Save everyone, inside you
And can you keep sleeping metaphysical girl
Sleeping with ghosts
Tell me when you hear me falling
You are walking on a thin line
My baby lives in shades of cool
Before I met her I was sad
Lays her dying hand
Named her baby Hope when she was just fourteen
I'm wondering for days and hours
We are on a sullen misty moor
When there's nothing that's worth seeing
I learned all I need from you
Watching the cars as they go by
God visits all lost souls
All around me are familiar faces
That when she pulls me by the hair
O, I need this 
But you will stay
When you walk without ease on these
Many many men
I'm running out of clock
And it kinda made me smile
There'll be a place for you
I sought after, after reasons to stay
Broken hearts want broken necks
So I can feel infinity
Losing sleep, we learned to be
Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away
Like somebody wants you, someone that's more for real
And formed the bruises that you said you didn't want to fade
In a voice that's hollow
So I'm holdin' on, I'm still holdin', 
The sea's evaporating
Just hanging with the girls
When you were my girl
Love is drunk and love is blind
And you thought you could change the world 
Skip a life completely, stuff it in a cup
It's time to get down Everybody wake up, it's time to get down
I just want someone to walk in front
So receive me, brother, with your faithless kiss
And he'll make war, oh, war, on who you were before
Will you take a journey tonight, follow me past the walls of death
Something he was not looking for
But that's not the shape of my heart 
So be kind to your mother
Couldn't read the number in the dark
We found your man
Turning out your lights 
Such a lonely day, and it's mine
I thought it was strange when your, car was found
Hell knows where your heart would be today
I said something wrong
Lost are voices heard along
With dirty hands and trousers torn
And I'm wastin' everyday, hey, hey, hey
Your envelope and fall to little pieces every time
I feel unsteady
Well I thought it was already as heavy
It hurts and I can't remember
You still don't think I'm going to see this through
Head in pain
But I can still feel you here
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Just some kind of life with the edges taken off
He will do one of two things
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Dark little heaven at the top of the stairs
And I confess that I'm only holding on by a thin thin thread
Summoned from the sky
We no longer have one
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leaving
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts
Let's just paint you a pretty face
'Cause I've started falling apart
She's leaving home after living alone Bye bye
Felt like this for awhile
It can be done
With every sour second rate kiss
You're calling too late, too late to be gracious
I'll lay you down in clover bed
Take your eyes off me so I can leave
Oh, to feel for even a second without it
I'll be around 
Clumsy, crawling out of my skin
I guess my mother never loved my dad
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
There might be some good ones
In a land there's a town
You still live in me
She's afraid when the sun returns
But tightly hold up silently
Stephanie says Stephanie says but doesn't hang up the phone Hang up the phone
This world forever, baby
But those drugs you got won't make you feel better
Sure as it was over
I'm down here by the bay, my arm around the moon
Well, I no longer hear the music
How can I have feeling when I don't know if it's a feeling
He may play the jack of diamonds 
Then she leaves, with someone you don't know
Put your name on the line
Me and Lucy never wanna end
Everyone now
Boy and the ghost,
Rows of houses all bearing down on me
Twotime you
Good things coming
But you listen to them never like "uhuh whatever"
And all the sky is grey
Never knew pain like this
He still gets sad
Though this is not her lord in case
It takes a while to grow anything
No sleep tonight
And I was hanging on the words some poem said in '
It's already half past
Said 'Stop'  but we went on wholehearted
Songs about love
But honestly it's fine
Away
Was it a woman's face
I will freeze till you leave
Dream what you like, but you dare not sleep
When the storms are raging round you
I don't wanna be without my baby
Your tiny hands
I go where I please
Someday they'll find your small town world
Storm in the morning light
Drink up, dreamers, you're running dry
I still remember the world
Now she in it, can't change it, she keeps her mind on her wages
Or all together just taken apart
She once believed in every story he had to tell
Don't you go, my baby begs me so
But turned them away, she's a whip and a slave
Maybe someday
Like when I fell under the weight of a schoolboy crush
I would do it all the time
You're just somebody that I used to know
Hold my heart till brighter days
And it's sad, but true Out of cash and IOU's
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight 
And the seas open up to me
In your head
To give them time to let them breathe
In search of inspiration
The words gets trapped
One day you'll be a man
I am here right beside you
But Instead, I keep on having these dreams
We took him away
The world feels like it's caved in, proper sorry frown
And it sounds just like this
And put me on a train 
When all of your wishes are granted
That's right, dying
And the sky breaks at dawn, shedding light upon this town, they'll all come 'round
And all my friends have gone to find
He asked us what our favorite work of art was
Tell you I need you
I know why you cry out
Lay down your arms and I will lay down mine
That I would be good if I lost my hair and my youth
Watch fluent sea men rig their rudders so they'll
In the shadows grey crusaders with tails
Maybe I was too fat
My scream got lost in a paper cup
And legs of stone
Please help me friend from coming down
She would pretty paint my face
I know I'd do it all different if I had the chance,
No matter what you do
There are too many of us
You knew just what to expect
Night time triggers the land mines
Tell me it's not all in my head
Smacks you in the head
Oh, my baby
The fact that you are married
Your warm whispers
I try to be I never needed anyone to help me
Because you don't want to know,
A good one
I can't keep pretending that I don't even know you
We'll name each after its way
Dear Lord it took so many of my people,
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
You spend half of your life trying to fall behind
To the way you move
More then anything you wanted to be right
And out of my mind
I told you, man
Oh love, please send for me,
I've got the feeling, can't satisfy you
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon
Leadfill the hole in me
All this talk of getting old
And they are fine and they are good
Your wings won't spread up against the sky
Something's gotta change
I don't want mudslinging games
It's a treacherous road
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean
Or happy just to get it done
Just another one of them
All the words that we have to say
But for tonight I'll stay here with you
And isn't it great to find that you're really worth nothing
Now I wish I woulda talked to him
I said this has got to stop
And I hope you like your pictures facing down
And took all those little feelings all apart
I don't care if you can take it
He says he's happy, he looked pretty good but I think,
Oh, little stranger, bring my baby back home
In your arms Don't haunt me
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
When you tell me everything is wonderful now
This one laughing quietly
In syringe or in shower stall
Her caresses caressed by fingers
And I don't know where to look
I should've called you out,
Now I'm wondering if things will ever change, yeah
All they said of a world without you
Better than the truth
It's hideous right before your eyes
I hold my own, but you with your hunger
It thrives in the dark
Got to get to you, got to see this through
But don't hate her when she gets up to leave
I've looked at life that way
When we were running in the rains
Before you turn and walk away
Wipe away your tear stains
I was never enough
Nothing can be changed
I found somebody 
She takes a plastic pill, she plays the weatherman
The maid needs a maid
Though my love wants to relieve her
If I can just hold on tonight
Baby I got a plan, run away fast as you can
Together we cry, together we cry
Left it all for love
Nothing is clear
You had your arm around what'shername
Doesn't help to know you're so far away
Just as black and whispering as the rain
You can't remember, you try to feel the beattttttt
The dog days are over
And love so distant and obscure
Stole underground
There ain't nothing right, there ain't nothing wrong
I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it
Been around the world, in many situations
'Cause I been feeling sentimental for days gone by
They're in the wrong place, tryin' to make it right
I'm having trouble inside my skin
And even when you lock the doors
And I'll draw until I get one right
Babysat all four of my kids
I say you're name
And I'm strung out again
We're proud of who you are
Just pull the plug, yeah, I've had enough
So we took the room
Why don't you just get into my car 
Now you're starcrossed
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Watch our souls fade away
Let me see your insides
'Cause I have faith in you that you're gonna make it through another night
Or happily in the the dark
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
I'm dying, I'm dying, please
i never sleep before  
This disease
Maybe you're right
Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
And on cold leather seats
In my own special selfish way
For all the times she showed me wrong
'Cause the world got in her way
And that you miss me sometimes
Well I said anywhere, anywhere, anywhere I lay my head, boys
And they tell her not to say a thing
How will I rest my head
She used to come and visit me
You'll never live this life that I live 
And I didn't know, I didn't know it at the time
Tiredness fuels empty thoughts
Ever searching for the one Melanie C Ever searching for the one
And my bruisecolored eyes peeled
We'd fall asleep by the big blue sea
And the soles of your shoes
The walk has all been cleared by now
There's still a little bit of your song in my ear
And you call me up again
And we cheat and we lie
Oh and still the beating never ends
She said a good day ain't got no rain
And yet in all, she thinks that he'll be with her forever
Shove it down anything to make it fit 
But these kids they lost their graces
But like a drunken night it's the best bits that are coloured in
But I wouldn't have you how you are
Rage, yeah woo
The touch of your skin, giving life from within like a love song never heard
The first time in my life and now it's so great
'Cause you are the only one
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
But I was wrong
Been three whole days since I've had sleep
Sometimes I walk around town looking at faces
Words from your younger years
Everytime I let it go, baby it's you
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
I'm awake in the infinite cold
On the overpass tonight, I bet we laugh
She broke away, broke away
But it's not right
Don't tell me tell me 'cause it hurts
Here they come
Regard me, dear
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
And up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
"Independent Independent"
If I squeeze my grape and I drink my wine, yeah
We'll dig a great big hole
Gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight
People you love will turn their backs on you 
Well, it's just an invitation to the blues
Reminds me of you
And I don't ever wanna se you sad
We walk in the same direction
There's things I'll take to my grave
"Three long years and your favourite man
So lovely
And don't wait for the sky to clear
I could feel my eyes turning into dust
And that's all I wanna do right now
But underneath it, she's a broken girl
I know I'm not always all that strong
And the lightning sang
You shone louder, longer
And ur tryin' to come back home
Please believe me when I say
Than a mirror
That's turned to turpentine
The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
I can't imagine all the people that you know 
Forgot yourself,
Long ago, wrapped in sheets warm and wet
I'm not bitter anyway
And a little rain never hurt no one
I was alone for the last time
I used to look myself in the mirror at the end of every day
And you always will
My city's still breathing, but barely, it's true
Are all down at Bobby's house
Young girl, one day you will be old
Always failing to remember why we came, came, came
That we end this here
You give me miles and miles of mountains
Only have these eyes for you
Just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
You swore you wouldn't lose then lost your brain
Gather your skeletons far inside
There's nothing here for me 
You'll be living
Everything that I've been missin'
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown
The same old madness everyday
I can't believe what I had to say
They come and go as if they're someone else's days
Something has left my life
We'll reach up and hold their tails 
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
So I'll be holding my note and stomping and strumming
And I need you in my life
Well I thought that we could sit around and, talk for hours
Just come over let's pour a drink babe
I just came to talk for a while,
Ans the soil lies awake
Oh come around
Some day
Haunt her life, the memories
So open your eyes and see
'Cause you're not the one, you're not the one
From trying not to speak
And she may cry like a baby
What comes is better
In shame
I don't know you, but I still want to
Ohohohoh What is love and what is hate
I can feel myself fading away
The holding up on bended knees
Missing what's gone
I am just a man who knows how it feels
Well, I remember how she left me on a stormy night
Simple girl, my simple girl
And lies
I'm still learning to love
Move away
Remember it was me who dragged you up to the sweaty floor
Wouldn't take no phone calls at all
Like lavender the smell of your hair, 
I write songs
It's always been "Wait and see"; a happy day, and then you pay, and feel like shit the morning after
And kill the phones
There's times that I was broke
A game that's made for twothat's you and me
Who sees you as something more than sexual
We died just before him
I roll the window down
To have Busby Berkeley dreams
And the soul underneath
Ooh my smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know
The confessions of a broken heart
All along, not so strong without these open arms
This feeling's running out the door
All I know is, I don't want to lose control
So won't you be fair
With your eyes shut you cry in your bed
And sets me down in your warm arms
Through your eyes I can see the disguise
How can I carry on
born in hearts
I can see your face in our secret place
"If we walk away, they'll walk away"
Your friends flew south many months ago
I never, never, never needed anyone
I don't want to play that part
Wild blood in my veins
No not mine,
Won't you help a brother out
And it's been here and disappeared
Oh, distance has no way of making love understandable
In your bedroom
Take everything away
So when my mom and John came in I would be cold
When I do something like you you'll be on my mind or through,
And you painted pictures of
If words are dead
So I'll be someone who won't be forgotten
It runs in my mind all the hard times how it turns
Tell me I should stick around for you; tell me I could have it all
But it's time to face the truth
One kiss and I'm ready to die
I don't want to make no waves
Comes from a place that's far away
You're travelling with my heart  I hope this is a temporary feeling,
You see real life's much different
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
The pleasure that my sadness brings,
There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
And I feel your fist
And that damage was done
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
still i keep looking in the faces of the old people, 
We'll not undo what has been done
so short of air, 
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
Dead roses
Why did she crawl down in the old deep ravine
And I searched behind your eyes for you
I think the finish line's a good place we could start
They say if it doesn't kill you it'll make you stronger
There is no peace that I've found so far
No more nights, no more pain
The heart wants what it wants baby
For that fearful leap into the dark
And when I'm standing still
But I ain't never comin' back
Hear the nighthawk cry
Hand in hand with someone else and they hope that they're mistaken
To see the damage I've done
Anything as beautiful as You
Oh, I hope one day you do
She prays one day she'll find someone to need her
She has won Now it's no fun 
I'd like to believe it was all about love for a child
It's been so long since I found a space
I'm with you, I'm with you, yeah yeah
I've been waiting night and day
There must be an angel
I never thought that I could be so bold
I've got nothin'
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
Everybody goes
And I feel the whip
And fly him out to Spain
Every time I walk out the door
When my days are through
Your phone has been disconnected
so bitter, so tough, 
I shoulda never let you hold me baby
When I kissed you on the mouth
In the dark
Well I know I make you cry
Are you looking down upon me, are you proud of who I am
When the world ends who's gonna hear it
I think I'll go out an embarrass myself by getting drunk and falling down in
Above this same awakening world
By the look of the clock
Things start splitting at the seams and now
When the wind was fresh
Would you believe that no one, no one ever told us about the sorrow
In a little while I'll be gone
Lord, I could never show you 
So how does this make you feel
I see your blue eyes
I've got your picture on the wall
A free world of clear division
Feel the power you cut the truth into you
My dreams are all the company I keep
I never said I would stay to the end
It's rocking the boat; we gotta get control of this
Up north's getting cold soon
What matters most Everything
So do what you're gotta do
Slide your hand
Take a look, you may see me on the ground
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
But the thought of you
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
We catch the last bus home
And then the day becomes the night
Still with hearts beating
I'm wasting my time
On everything from how I act to what I say
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I don't feel alright in spite of these comforting sounds you make
Satisfaction guaranteed
You're up with the sunrise
Under whose gaze did fall such evil blunder
So one man has and another has not
But time is on your side
And the singer won't get in our way
If I had it any sooner you know
Every glamorous sunrise
And held the darkness over day
Off through the earth
They bury you when you go and die
I can't face your breaking heart
Now that the dreams have given all they had to lend
All those mistakes and be wise
And we saved 'em for a rainy day
All my senses come to life
Pretends she can't see me here
How could this love ever turning, never turn it's eye on me
Should of known, when I hit the ground running
So why would you be welcome here
And we got stories how we slept with all the movie stars
And I hope you will forget
Running out the melpomene, nicotine
It's the disease that we crave
Where can I go that your pictures won't haunt me
Questions I have answered, you are still asking yourself again
Hold me up hold my hand
I really believe that this time it's forever
Over your sad, empty town
Of my True Romance magazines
Promise me the sun will rise again
Have heart, my dear
All the noise died away
You should count your change before you're even out the door
I thought you'd catch me if I fall
To ugly duckling girls like me
When the sun came up
I am doll parts
It's just the end of the world
Or felt a part of this human race
Just wishing so bad that it held some kind of truth
Even though God knows you have mine
I refuse to believe you could
Off the map where the wild things grow
Something up your sleeve
Loneliness "
You changed my life and all my goals
So don't call me baby
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
Born into society, a banker's only child
When everybody else is soundly sleeping
Or showing up for work early
Moon and sun
I have something to say
I lost my head
The sun, the sea and I
Is that I never heard the sound
And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
When I finally get it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan
Man is the baby
I never said goodbye
This is my new age
The glow was strong when I was a boy
Far away where nobody knows
Yeah, all those stars drip down like butter
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
As what you hold
There's people making lonely
And so tomorrow there will be another number
At four o'clock he got off and you called up 
They were getting older, sons and daughters
Give me back my point of view
None of these long legs are mine
But it's hard to turn the opposite way tonight
When I was yours and you were blind
I love the shape your faces make
My love in this daze
Then return with a broken heart
The city breaks
So I watched the world tear us apart
Well, you can come inside, unlock the door
And God, I hope it's not too late
Just know I love the time that we both had
But I ain't done much healing
Right there, right next to you
I wish that you knew when I said two sugars, actually I meant three
For in death I'm caressing you
And the fire that was starting to spark
You didn't mean to be cruel
If you don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it
A fouryear offense to the devoted type I may have got an invitation but I wasn't invited
Into soon the sky
And it did 
You'll return
But dad if you were lonely you had no where to turn
Amongst your toys in a room where I can take no more 
Show me the meaning of being lonely
If you never go away
No you better stay away from this
You see, it was my fault Of course it was mine 
'Cause I'm sending all the signs
We just can't do anything about it
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
I'll be flicking stones at your window
Boy I was shaped for the fury
Looking across the faces I've know
Losing, it comes in a cold wave 
The web we weave is thick and sordid
'Til it was too late, too late
Maybe some time sooner or later
I'm gonna love you  percent
You've dreamed of thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
Only they can see where this is gonna end
Seems like they've made it to the other side
I've been catching all your ghosts for every season
I'm just moving uncomfortably slow, yeah, slow
Tell me we both matter, don't we
Wrap me up in a dream with you
'Cause it's time that will tell this tale,
Before your father hears us
No, no, no, no Melanie C You know it's time to say goodbye
You're always crazy like that
All of this and her dark hair, oh no
I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce
I forgot the part
And still I don't understand
Loving him was never enough
Don't patronize me sorrow
And I know in the cold light
Bring back the joy to my life
So give us a chance
It's not so much a storm
To catch my fall
Just to be the man who walked  miles
Put your hand on my heart that was cold
Who'll take care of me
It's in my honey, it's in my milk
Lord we married young and stayed where we came from
Geezers' stares bounced off
I could wrap you in your favourite clothes
And when the house was left in shambles
Hear the rain fall
Everything will be just fine
And now youjustfallen
I loved him so but I let him go
Oh my love don't fade away
Now I work for my dad
It's always the same
"It's just the way I smile", you said
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
When you walk around, know you are future youth
It's under, under, under my feet
Someday if ever you love me you'd say its okay
I feel so faded, so far gone
Man I'm 'bout to get crazy, why can't she just, run away Look at ya
Still upon the shelf 
To find somebody
Ain't the roof or the doors
But we could never see tomorrow
That's not what I believe, and it doesn't matter anyway
These dreams of you keep on growing stronger
No reason to be ashamed
Fall on your knees, 'cause this time I won't be so kind
Here we are
Can I save my life at any price
I would say it was your best line ever
He had a tryout with the Sixers
I thought you were my boyfriend Thought you were my boyfriend
Well, think about the lonely people
Adolescence didn't make sense
Of breaking up the silence
I didn't know what love was on that day
And in this horror show
I love your kind patience
Why you gotta be mean now
Blame it on apartheid
You choose your side, I'll choose my side
Little firefly in her jar
I'll be waving, I'll be waving goodbye
He's got it down now
There are beads that wrap
That season left the world and then returned
I will end where I began
You and all your pieces,
We all need the person
Now all those feelings,
So many tears I was searching
But see how deep the bullet lies
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
I wanna sleep in my bed
All around me is fast moving 
Cops were running around the scene
And I hope I never get sober
And you were fool enough to love it when he said
I can't love you in the dark
The book of love is long and boring
Every time I pin down what I think I want, it slips away
You were the first to say that we were not okay
On the stairs, she grabs my arm
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now  Oh, shit I forgot
And said to me son
The papers print his pictures almost everywhere he goes
And he wish he'd had a mirror; looked a little clearer
This isn't rain, you rapist werewolves
Don't look back you're safe now
It's just too heavy for Superman to lift
She says, love's not a hostile condition
I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
And she's walking out
It'd be easier that way
Now he's on his cell phone in a Coupe Deville
I sink deep,  thousand feet 
So then I move my hand up from down by my side
Still falling
Are like music to me
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
How I wish that it was forever you would hold us
Then where's the blood
With what I've done
When she'd say
These days I barely get by
And then the truth
And I won't stand it if were broken apart
Oh, he'll, he'll never return it When you come back, we'll have to make new love
One thing leads to another
I will not turn again
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
No sacrifice at all
He'll never return it When you come back, we'll have to make new love
Please let me know that my one bad day will end
My insides all turned to ash
In the flies and rats
I take the truck on into town
Get confused and you fade away
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
And you're gonna let our things simply crash and fall down
I dare not say as the wind must blow
Eating at the heart
Silver birch against a Swedish sky
I am your failed husband contender,
But nobody wants to know him
And your knives and clothing too
I only wanted to have fun
"No one is allowed to be so proud
This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
Relying on my best memories,
Beyond your wildest dreams
She hangs her head and cries in my shirt
But every single time I do
Running down corridors, through automatic doors
So come on and hurt me
Went to school and I was very nervous
It's just, your love is like a drug
If I walk away from you
A hundred times the doctors say
Where pleasure moments hung before
Is it dark enough 
Dressed in white This candle radiates throughout the night
Not turn away
And dead men talk to all the pretty nurses
What am I gonna do when I run out of shirts to fold
The last place we left off
Try to make you like the way they feel
Make a place for you to land
Unbreak my heart, my heart
I thought with a month of apart
I told you, weren't lyin', I know you aren't relying
Last chance, make it through the divide
Shared my body and my mind with you
Little bird
Your skull inside a ball 
Even if only for one weekend
I didn't sell my soul, I didn't sell my soul 
Friends that last
The rainy roads of our old town
You can say what you mean
Weeks are slow, days drag on
Seem to rain on
But the brightest of the planets is Mars
Don't let me get away
you're just jealous 'cause I'm young and in love
I just wanna go back to being the same I just wanna go back to bein' bein', baby, yeah
Down the stairs, I was there
But mama, he'll never touch us again
I panic and pace when I can't see the right thing to do
Is it weird to be back in the south
You still look like a movie
How can I rely on my heart if I break it with my own two hands
About a place to hide
And there's no other girl like you, no one
Hold your breath
Ain�t the same since I'm living without you
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
And I tried to hold him
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Held her there, kicking and mewling, upended, unspooling, unsung and blue
Smiling dark eyes
Though I know no one can see her
Oh god, please don't tell me this has been in vain vain
I'm still reeling from the loss
But I've never known a winter so cold
Nobody's listening 
Please, please come and save me
Stars shined on my back as I slept and knew you
Who doesn't long for someone to hold
'Cause my chemicals, yeah, left me a beautiful disaster
Like a house made from spider webs and the clouds rolling in
And in that woman
One message beating through
I wish I had a reason, my flaws are open season
And one horrible thing I saw 
I'm my only friend, am I
Until you're out of breath
Their eyes can't hope to see
Start, stop and start Stupid acting smart
For this love game's expensive
We were lovers and now we're not even friends
This story is old
I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
And sail us to the moon
You don't care a bit
So the next time he hurt you again
Now we're tired, battered fighters
On a decline
It's never done
Poor girl, lonely 
You talk to me
Far from his room, the familiar perfume
Or do you sit within your picture
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting
Can make a good man bad
When I was young
The world revolves around us,
She was all right but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
Cannot pretend to change the fact
And I was bad news for you just because
I live in America with a pair of Payless shoes
Windows down and my hair in the breeze
Oh, this world may lack style, I know
While I go to sleep and I dream all night
All I had to say is goodbye
You know that I've gotta say time's slipping away
Everyone and everything
I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who's still around the morning after
Crawl back into bed to dream of a time
I'm embarrassed but I'm much more sorry
But for now it's just another lonely day
Most of the time
Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line
Sing me Happy Birthday
There's room inside for two
It's greener pastures I'm thinking about
Well yeah I saw inside the mirror and your smoking gun,
Listening for patterns in the sound
Every step that you take
My sister called at  AM
A dusty cartridge from the VCs is on the way to see old friends,
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Oh the elements I do not fear
She's twelve years old, guess she's havin' a baby
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
Just as long as we got the same thing in our veins, you and I, we are both the same
Can you feel its second hand wrapped around your neck 
I take the blue ones every time 
As if a good thing ever could make up for all the pain
Her loving nursed him back to life
Even if I died alone
It's about to fall apart
At night I will protect you in your dreams
The softly spoken words you gave me
Fingers crossed, my time is coming now
And now it's  years later 
Anything to pass the time
A different tree now lines the streets
And you said it would be funny
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
"Isn't something missing
A certain something certain
And I can still smell summer on your skin,
In the moment of the meantime
Well I thought it was already as heavy as can be
And quickly replaced
But I'm not lost, I'm not gone
I've noticed things
It's out of love
See these lines
The subway is a porno
I've been under the ground
By the forest of our spring stay
The untold pain
But I'm willing to give it another try
Cornered, wasted, blessed, and used me
I remember when we used to want to hang out
Oohdon't wanna try don't wanna try try try
Waiting to be asked to come inside
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
I still dream dream dream
The saddest song, that she ever heard 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Is all hope lost
Tight side by side
With one or two I get used to the room
Long winded promises of future company
This plan of mine is oh so very lame 
And your only hope is that forgetting might make a door appear
Auf der Schussfahrt zu wenden
But she began to drift away
And her ghost leaned down to kiss me with a message from the sun
Don't sacrifice your plan
I forgot the start
But in the long tresses of your hair
I don't need the passion too
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
And fades away
Tomorrow comes Sorrow becomes his soul mate
You can have my heart My heart, my heart
Please let me bring back these gifts of mine to the woman
Carry me away
I will somehow
I'm going to say it once again 'til I instill it
But whatever you got right now will probably suit me fine
My man and me
Felt things were going wrong
I will not say I'm all right for you
Come on, come on
Empty party afternoons won't come back
You look a lot like you'd
I say burn all of your bridges
And after all, it won't take long to fall in love
Day after day, alone on a hill
So many hearts in great demand;
And a strange dust lands on your hands,
'Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight, good evening
And passed away
No tears to damn you
'Cause here they come
And traveling blows when you're out of road
Take me home, tuck me in
We flew together, love thought they'll fly forever
And I will say peace to the people I meet
Words will never sound again
But what my father did 
Through the day
Through the headlights of a car
Offer signs that it's over
Now my words are filling at the top
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
You're far too short to carry weight
But it was vile and it was cheap
'Cause we are broken
And I felt my head exploding
And now with postdemise at hand
For the moment, we're alone
'Cause overnight that lake had turned as thick as butter
We both know it's a waste of time
How do your pistol and your Bible and your sleeping pills go
Hold me in your freezing arms before we have to go
And I feel sorry for you
When you get your way
Would hold me slender limbs would hold me
Singing all their songs
And when the crowd becomes your burden
and to be frankly nobody 
In the middle of the summer
Ever saintly in a way 
Do it all the time now
But then I awoke dear and found you not there
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
These old bones are worn
I'm watching you breathing
I did I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
"You're safe, child, you are safe" Am I coming through
The way it's going
This world was never meant for
This is fact not fiction for the first time in years
I feel like giving up Like giving up
And I've heard all the stories 'bout the black cabs and the way they drive
Pull me over just to say "I'm a fan"
Far away from me 
I took the supermarket flowers from the window sill
I've only been your lover and friend
I'm a sun that doesn't burn hot
But I don't need them
I thought we'd have children together
And no matter what they knew
Come back
But I'm going to stop pretending 
Seems you never realise a good thing till it's gone
We're gonna live our lives, Gonna live our lives
I open my mouth and I try and I try, but no words came out
It wouldn't have worked out anyway
And some things they stay the same
It always leads me here
It's such a loss for the good guys afraid of this life
Your lips they stay perfectly still
Und das Atmen fällt mir ach so schwer
Your face is light and cocaine white
We won't pass this way again
There isn't anything that you can do
Follow me through a city of frost covered angels
Maybe I'm still searchin' but I don't know what it means
The way you lose these wasted blues
Hello helicopter, are you listening
It's my birthday and I cannot find no cause for celebration
Can't go with my heart
This you surely knew
For a moment, I didn't need you
This romance is bleeding"
And who are the trusted
And there's no more pain
Down in the valley where the church bells cry,
We are the walking dead, we hold this ghost in our arms
I was thinking that maybe we can discuss
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Just a few last hours we gotta make this count
And the stars, they seemed, to paint the most elaborate scene to date
And you thought you could change his mind 
Forever the name on my lips
What I want from you, is empty your head
Yeah, you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me
Her love is a rose pale and dying
Sang our newborn love to sleep
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Heart beating close to mine
Cause you can see with your own eyes
Spring forward, fall back down
So leave me alone, you ought to be proud that I'm getting good marks
Don't worry Mary, 'cause I'm taking care of Danny,
Hey girl
You meant more to me than anyone I ever loved at all
A tear drop falls on every page
And now we're barely breathing
The sun sets on the war
She left me with a note saying
I'm tired of the sunset
Brush down my sparkling sides
Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
By the fallen stars 
And we'll lie 'til the corncrake crows
You are the maid for me
You know me, you know my way
I wanna see you put your hands hand together
You haven't changed
Gave him the time of day
And I feel the way that every child should
Just a thought
We'll stick it out, skin pierced for something
All my life
Standing in the dark outside the house
She can take me apart
I'd really love to tell you 
Oh, James, you broke me, I thought I knew you well
Jeddy  is what we first called him
The one and only true love
If there's no one beside you
It's all your fault, momma
Ooh don't take it all to heart
And when the morning came, I was ashamed
Now I've got you right where I want you
There is no one as lucky
To stop the blinding mirrors
Have I still got you to keep me warm
Of giving up control
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
'Cause I'm a fool for you
You used to light me up
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
Breathing the cold and sterile air
I always end up feeling cheated
He said "turn sixtyeight"
'Cause love songs and poems have all lead, they've all led me to this
Every street light a reminder
In silence
So I take a drink, another cigarette
But reality sets and you're stuck in this plastic life
You keep pushing me away
Wipe my nose, get my new boots on
Don't call me, don't call me, don't call me
The only one I loved and not forgive
I knew it would end this way
Does it mean nothing
She said "I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore"
You gave me a reason for standing still
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
This innocence is brilliant it makes you want to cry
We're just living people
These wasted blues
De ces amants là
And you came home without Lili Marlene
Rain, it wets muddy roads
The sadness
And they're letting me go home
Oh whoa yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
So hard to believe
I feel for you
About today
Throwing bits of stale bread
He's in pain and misery x
I tried to get my head around that one So right
I used to run down the stairs
Blame the devil for the things you do
And the endlessness that you fear
So she may laugh in the autumn of your years
Ain't it funny how you feel
If your heart was simple just like mine is, then you would know just how it feels
All of these moments I'll never replace
Can I say it on the phone, if I thought you were alone,
One day I guess I'll be
Without face, without crown
Do you still forget the breeze
This highway's dark and empty
I've sailed away
Barely breathing
Than flesh and bone
And still the hardest part for you
Of the glowing dark
I'll display my disaffection you grind me up, yeah, you spit me out
A memory that could hold me back 
Always worried about someone else
Bones Boy talks and flickers grey
When it's really been so long that it starts showing
That these feelings won't go away
You're gone and I can tell
They crawled out of the woodwork
Asleep in the deep of
Tell me, who are you this time
I'm running fast, as fast as I can, to get you back, just to get you back again
You know that I'm always right
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
This flesh and bone
I'm down to just one thing
And the moon is shining bright
We're all inside our own heads now
Don't go away
One look and I'm crying
It's  AM on a Tuesday,
Johnny came home with another wife
No happy endings
Your opinion was the law of the land
Going nowhere take it from your eyes
Someone who isn't you
He said Is this the return to Oz
It falls apart
Guess I'd better wash my mouth out with soap
I just need to know that I can breathe 
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
My friends all approve, say "she's gonna be good for you"
Between the trees and cicadas singing round the pond
You make a sound that feels like pain
When I mention how I love you
We're all the losers
I won't let you walk away
His life was stole Stole, oh
I could never see tomorrow
How long it was to get around to her side of town
Here we are again with handguns for hearts
So I hope and pray you won't throw this love away
You make me feel like I am clean again
I fell apart, I fell apart
With every passing day
So are you safe now we're through
Then in my dream
But where to begin throwing caution to the wind
I walked home smiling, I finally had a story to tell
The way you left me for dead
And sometimes I get jealous of all her little pets
You raised his children
Why love gets up and goes
Without a sound
Since the war was won
Ask the ministry
These tired eyes just want to remain closed
I guess you don't know what you got till it's gone
We're glad for what we've got,
When we are alone
Things that made me love you so much then
A woman said, "I know my son is dead
I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
No and thank you, please madame
The more you're slip slidin' away
Will always lead you home, home
Even when their numbers call you out
All you bitches put your hands in the air
A burst of rain, brief and loud
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice
I feel like I want to live again
I cared for and most of all I loved
I guess you are at an advantage
My amulets, my charms, I set all my false alarms
It'll be summer in Dallas
You've got me down on my knees and I proclaim
That everyone is staring at you
It felt so good to hear her voice
But I was sadly mistaken
And now all our dreams are cashed in
No one's laughing at God when they're starving or freezing or so very poor
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
A shimmer in the midnight
Till they swallowed the police
I feel too cold
When you lay your head down,
I cover my eyes, still all I see is you
I'm not comfortable with how the story ends
But there's no one home
Running round this house
I hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I'm alone with you
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
Where the human tried 
Of appointments and promises made
And rescue me from me and all that I believe
I've got my maple syrup, everything but you
But you can give me all the love that I crave
But you're falling anyway
Way oh, way oh, way oh
If the wild bird could speak
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
Oh I just wanna die without you
You were the one I loved
Your smile is like a breath of spring
While you were sleeping
And ooh
Parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water
The things my heart wouldn't dare
Turn it off forever
The future's unclear
When you said your last goodbye
I'm thinking I can give you a call
Under the earth 
Now it's turning blue, and you say
Don't know why I ever go away
That these nights when we were drinking 
I drove past true love once, in a dream
I really don't know life, at all
And once again you my friend are no where to be found
I thought you'd want the same for me
In the sea again 
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
But late one night you threw them down
And these foolish games are tearing me, you're tearing me
For the, for the, for the dancing girl
Shaking its fists in the air
But my selective memory won't let me
Rich man in a poor man's clothes
She never learned to let things be
And I may find in time that you were always right
I was the one
I've gone away
Like my love
The wind was slowly melting
And tomorrow, you won't believe it
I feel unready for my love
I'll spend a day
Take a look, you might see me coming through
You've still got some loyal disciples
To be at home
There's no perfect endings
I'm sorry for what I did
I know it's still the same
And part of this terrible mess that you're making
It's sad
You were always the waiting
Like it's forever
Phony people come to pray
See you walkin' by with another guy
And I just know that she warms my heart
All of you, all right
You never do, babe
Will you comfort me in my time of need
But the time has come to leave
You made me sleep and uneven, and I didn't believe them
But the night came down and swept us away
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
Wind, rain and hail
Nobody's fault but my own
Until I'm out of breath
Left me standing all alone
Phone ringin' off the shelf
Everything that was right
I got some things, I need to say
For a heart that can't be broken, oh
Things that I still lack
Well, I love you so much Never again
Yeah, yeah, yeah ah
I wasn't good at being a thief
Nothing takes your place
And I see stars and I reel again
Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
Byebye
What if you spoke those words today
For a set of new wings and anything gold
And your friends they sing along and they love you
And he, checking time, did punch me
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust 
To love you, again and again
For a brand new start;
Something about insurance policies
I wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being across the sea
Don't wanna die alone without you here
And I became nothing when I found you were dead
People say I'm a onehit wonder
Believing no lies, telling each other we'll be fine forever
He was a very good friend
It goes to my head so carefully
Puffs away, and winter comes
In a dark room on the bed, he kissed them all
With a note that said 'I'll love her 'til I die'
Take my body
You don't wanna stay in
And you can't breathe without coughing at daytime
This is a foreground
My body's running but I don't see why it bothers
Frightened by my feelings
Who feel so very lonely
We've been told you stay up late
Though we stayed by its side 
And this is how I feel
Say what up to life immortality
If I woulda been the one to maybe go this far
But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues
Just to ask you how you feel
That can bring you right down to tragedy more oh me
And everybody's gone at last
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
I heard a whisper on my shoulder
I don't belong to anyone, my heart is heavy as an oil drum
But I won't be home again
When the woman was only a girl
About everything you could imagine
Nothing to do but keep sleeping longer
Cold smoke seeping out of colder throats
Far from all the things that we are
You never sent me no letters
To be functioning properly 
I bet your fortressed face
It was rare, I was there
Just sometimes I wonder
The love will never get lost
That I can't see from beyond that line
And I can see you push your hair behind your ears
I may seem unafraid
And find my little girl 
It's too much, too bright, too powerful
I heard you driving in my car
Just running in circles in my mind
That's proper rank, that tastes like hairspray
Everybody's got them
When you lose something you cannot replace
The mother of your children every really play
This time, we'll fade out tonight
So come back to your life on the lam
And line them up in single file
And it's so hard to say goodbye
And I don't want your good luck charms
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
You will look for me
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
Yes, My eyes are wet with clarity
Until the day it was taken away
Search within yourself for feelings
And the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out
Ever searching for the one Melanie C For the one
Well, you could have your choice of men
No more trying, oh oh yeah
Just the same way you showed me you showed
You know the kind
Why you turned out the way you did
And the hardest part is letting go
If you see me out on the town
So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
I can see but once I was blind
I tried to ask you to your face but no words came out
The spookiness of night surrounds us in trees
Find the few living things rotting fast
Of hope for the days when I feel like I've lost everything
Oh, but anywhere, anywhere I'm gonna lay my head
About a million reasons
The light from the Lord that shines inside
I was drunk in a phone booth
You promised, you promised that you're done
First the lights, then the collar goes up, and the wind begins to blow
Who will love Aladdin Sane
Calling out winter
Sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of the shoes
I tell my love to wreck it all
Holdin' your scarred heart in hand, it's all the same
They're asking is it good or bad
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
Forever you'll be right here with me
Motherfucker turned white as a ghost
No blinding light
I see it in the way you stare
And I'd fix all that I've done
You got to see the person I have become
Every image to your face and heel
In the middle of the night
When the floes under our feet
I guess maybe that's what's worse
Uncry these tears
Could I speak any plainer I need you here 
Can you find me space
And I just wanna stay in bed
Textbook hippie man
And it's your song
Holding on the telephone
I'm always gonna live to be your man
Tell my mother I am sorry
They don't just care
I didn't understand
Sing to me hope as she's
Wholesome
I feel you in the wind
But we don't care do we
He was someone I could learn from
Isn't something missing
I need you to pencil in the rest
Unless your looking to check out Shot, shot, shot
I've started falling apart
By blood and by me, and I fall when you leave
It's the time we had apart to sort things out
Brush the snow from your hair
I hope we come up with a failsafe plot
Everywhere you go red roses follow
We live our lives on different sides
Don't try to change my mind
Good friend
All my old friends, they don't know me now
Two hands longing for each others warmth
All before the drama begun
And I hope this makes you happy now
I've got shinsplints and a stitch from we
Her hair was pressed against her face
And I get upset that something was lost
Take me to the heavens now
The feelings come and go
Oh I, I want to go back to
And you heard my heart stop beating
You turned white like a saint
We found her with her face down in the pillow
When you say you didn't love me anymore
The future was our skin and now we don't dream anymore
And I'll take you for who you are, if you take me for everything
Do you think about your sons
I will sacrifice
I got to live with the choices I've made,
And leave my love
How all the changes came about my way
The setting sun destroys the light
Like a constant reminder
And even shared the tears
Honestly I tried to avoid it Honestly
The rest of my life
Just like sunny days that
I know what you're saying
And spare the good people it takes
Seasons came, seasons went
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
The perfect taste that leaves your mouth
They come your way
I know who's to blame, but I swore I wouldn't say
And when you jump up the earth wants you back
I don't know your thoughts these days
Oh, you catch me if I'm falling
Take me with you 'cause I'm lonely
Don't believe their lies
Of course you say you can't complain
I may not seem like very much
I just remembered that time at the market
And I let the wind make love to me
Signal if you can't say, "no more"
But I'd be love and sweetness
Where love is more than just your name
Love is hopeful
Things aren't what they seem
But when she calls me, I do not walk, I run
But that don't change the fact
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause
I need your help
Now I see it every day
I'm eeing lights, feeling pain, there's my cure on ice
Which I obviously don't, or she wouldn't be gone
Those summer nights seem long ago
Never to come out
In the halls I'd rather hear silence
Ripped apart by the crows not the vultures
Just know I'm right here hopin'
I loved you
And shove it way down inside
There's nothing left to beg for
Drowning out the sound of the rain as it knocks on the windowsill
We are ugly but we have the music"
I try and tell myself it'll all be alright
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
What you need
Oh my baby baby I love you more than I can tell
And I cannot hold a candle for every pretty gun
And yet you don't believe her
We were here all together yesterday
No, I don't want to meet your friend
Let me drain
There's a road ahead
One that settles down stays around
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby, too
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
Oh, we never talk about the past anymore
We'll try to go back and make them last
Ooh, I remember we could talk about anything
You'll try to hit me just hurt me
And someone to believe you
At the end of the day
I'll find my way through night and day
It's no fun to be the man
'Cause my words get in my way
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
Love, it taught me to lie
With my feet on the dash
'Cause she's angry like a salesman 
I don't wanna feel the pain
On our bodies we share the same scar
The skies are dark, they're dark but they're clear 
Ain't much to rake anyway in the fall
I learned the truth at seventeen
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your selfcontrol
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
The test results tell you nothing at all
Faith has been broken and tears must be cried
I get the final say
Every kiss that you could ever mean
Don't you think we stay for too long
But the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
Wouldn't say goodbye
Wide open spaces far away
She broke his heart; he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
And tears will dry
I promised I
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
But I guess I got no valentine
She's in the air In the air
She was hard and as cracked as the Liberty Bell
I had a lover
Goodnight, sleep light, stranger
My home on the old Milk Lake
I was doing the best that I could
I will miss your heart so tender
That instant of light that wipes the slate clean
Ain't no angel gonna greet me
I climbed the tree to see the world
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Isn't it a pity, isn't it a shame
They said they'd be here they said, they said in the corner,
You and I have something different
I want nothing more to doubt
Better make your mind up quick
Looking out the door I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
Oh, everybody's dying just to get the disease
I'm tired of singing all the sad songs in my head,
That's one thing
But when the color goes out of my eyes it's usually the change
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
I just cannot believe could do that to a child
Every time I try to fly, I fall 
The wind's indecision, the sorrowful rain
You're just waiting for her to come apart
A shallow grave, a monument to the ruined age
Love it, oh sometimes at least I fall
And you're far away
Oh, I will make my way through one more day in Hell
Is that any way to say hello"
Waiting for sedation to disconnect my head
People say I interrupt people with the same look
Tell me everything you saw
But I do not cry
Because I'm the girl who eats the scrub
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven
Back to the same place I sat with you drink for drink
Like a simple waste of time
And happiness and peace of mind 
I really feel
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
Remembering everything
Life's too short and I feel small
When you see my face, I hope that you don't laugh
She was lying on the floor and counting stretch
At this wheel I'd drive the earth for her
And I just wanna die without you
I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
But though you're still with me
It's been such a long time coming, but I feel good
I can't believe how close I came
I can't find the joy within in my soul
Excuse me but can I be you for a while
Send the poisoned rain down the drain to put bad thoughts in my head
But then again maybe we are just pretending
For that delicate look upon your face
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us
Like sisters, blanket, blanket girls, 
I loved you in the moonlight
Until there is no one
The room's suddenly spinning
Everything, everything, here is gone
Baby, set my soul on fire
I sit and watch as tears go by
And sing you a song
In these winter nights if I'm wandering all alone
And there's nothing that I wanna do for you
It's life's illusions I recall
But I'm still
Put it on your son
I can honestly say 
Was a parliament of owls
Farewell my friends
'Cause if you do it and you're still unhappy
At Christmas time with your family here
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
These are, these are
Artificially sweet
Worn like a mask of selfhate
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Beyond the moment that ends our bondage
And I saw God cry in the reflection of my enemies 
So good when it ends, they'll never be friends
Ready to become
Can't put out my stomach burning
When I see your smile
Nothing is pure anymore but solitude
Und der Wald er steht so schwarz und leer
Just a little girl, big imagination
Searching to feel warmth forever more
Now run along my little nightmare, your job is done here
I wrote you a letter, I tried to make it clear
He sits all alone
Like snow, like snow
Oh that reminds me of when we were free
You'll lose your hair, your teeth 
Distance makes the heart grow weak
All that I wanted was to sing the saddest songs
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
To someone I
Hell when you're around
You're spring to me, all things to me
And rejoice although this world will penetrate you
I roll over in bed looking for someone to touch
Flirting with the flicks; you say it's just for kicks
I'm asking for
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
I chase you just to hear you say
Off the port I see the lighthouse
Would you find it in your heart
Isn't someone missing me
And all I needed was a call
While the limousines wait in the street
You look so tiredunhappy
Have you put them aside
Many, the lives we lived in each day
We've got our hearts on safe
And memories like spies
You hit your head and then forgot your name
Though it comes as no surprise
Through the morning, through the night
Can I stay and say nothing at all, at all
Told me how to please a man
Honey I ain't nothing new
Quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth
All the white horses have gone ahead
Forfeit any fight
I'm still not feeling anything, this has got to be a dud
You on the run
How am I gonna stay here without you
Up with it came our pain and fear
And that cold wind will blow
One more night gone, only twenty more days
Where no one needs a reason
You say you do, but you don't deceive me
Tried and failed as we walked by the riverside
And I claimed I didn't care for you
But after one too many I know that I'm never
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
You can't turn back the clock
But I couldn't do another year
We need a connection but you seem to push me far away from you
So you just stepped out of the front of my house
"Hey I'm doing all right"
I would teach my feet to fly
Well, I heard there was a secret chord
Their heads heavy
Don't throw your hand
I need a sunburn,
Can you see me when I'm running
Slowing down I look around and I am so amazed
Until those rainy days that make them stay;
Next door
Shine like stars, shine like stars
You wouldn't like it baby
I'm two heartbeats ahead in Hell
I'm not cryyyyyyyyying
Like the winds outside
All the pictures are all in my mind
All my troubles seemed so far away
We always pull through
As it was
Every time
But it's alright
No one will play it
Must have been too late, I believe you were not lying
How does it make you feel
So goodnight my dear
Jackie ooh
I nestle into pain
But it's your heart, not mine, that's scarred
If ever these questions were yours, what would you say
The one who can't afford to face her image is restored to grace
So unkiss me, unkiss me, yeah
Puts on her makeup, puts on the new dress
My kids were being quiet
Don't swallow this time
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
When I was
That is our life 
If things start splitting at the seams
Go take your economy car and your suitcase
To the four corners of the world
And show it where to aim
And if I bring a little music I could fit right in
In those basements made of music
Of a sleepless circus promenade 
But I need to
That I would be grand if I was not all knowing
'Cause she's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
You know it cuts me to the bone
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Teignmouth 
If you're sleeping are you dreaming
I'm gonna lay back down, I'm gonna lay back down again
And too afraid, you're too afraid to fall for anything
Losing the reasons why
Sometimes I'm not sure what I'm gonna do but I ain't here for more
The sea of love
A tear comes to his eye
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
And why'd you sing hallelujah
For the cute ones
And the world she is tough
They choke me to the bone
Oh, stay with me, Arienette
No, no, no brokenhearted girl
I couldn't be the one who'd stand by your side
On the wall behind St Peter's
I can't look away
I'm falling down
Don't turn away
But the damage is done
Without a single word
If you think you belong enough nice dream
Through everyone that feels it 
I'm working on erasing you
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
They can comfort you, some even try
I run off where the drifts get deeper
The columns are all men begging to crush me No shapes sail on the dark deep lakes
Hung in shame
But we sacrifice like lambs
And when she came back
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive
It's got a hold & really making me wonder
It's all in her mind
Anyplace is better
All the times way me
I've spent ten years trying to sing it all away
And the air in between is overflowing
Swing low, sweet chariot
She left all her things, well, her books and her letters from him;
Who makes me feel much taller than you are
But that wind that blows across your room
You remind me
Well I have been happy the past couple days
Two guards for one uncharged
And all I've got is time until the end of time
No I, just wanna taste your love
A space in town
Angels lie to keep control
The lie will unfurl
But sometimes I feel your not deserving of me
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him
The winter slammed us like a fist
I'm a bird girl 
All animals lead us to light
I know everybody
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
Sometimes you make me feel like I am living at the edge of the world
Wish I were with you, but I couldn't stay
Some forever, not for better
I'm sitting at this table called love
And winter unreal
See the storm broken
So fucking scared, I'm not scared
My bad habits would be gone in a matter of days 
The love My friend
There's still a little bit of your words I long to hear
Too many books
Somehow I'd feel intact and reassured
I'll always look to a brighter day
See the world spinning round
Left with a trace of all that was 
And I wanna fight
Going, girl
I couldn't walk, and I tried to run
You was broke down crying a mess
I know you're sorry
It's the wrong kind of place to be thinking of you
Adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission,
Stares down at the ground
It should have been me instead of him in the dark
Just to stay in the corner of your heart
Every famine virtual Retrovertigo
In the town where I lived
You got a devil up your sleeve
To this love aloud try, try
Now it's years since your body went flat, and even memories of that
'Cause you're so beautiful, yeah
When times get rough
Shadows all around you as you surface from the dark
Caress every ache
You're already the voice inside my head
You've got yours, I've got mine
Today you saw, you saw me, you explained 
Stan How's it feel to be the man
We walked along a crowded street
Better be right
Saw me just come up with anger
I wait in  time
Something inside me dies
I'll find somebody like you
Can you stay strong
Let me ride the crest of chance into the sun
I know you think I'm holding you down
I need your arms to hold me now
But he won't call anymore
It was real, It was right
The cloth low on the mast 
The book of love has music in it,
And I hope you're waiting for me
And will when it gets compromised
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
The people all call her Alaska
Hey, dad, look at me
Let me seek the answers that I need to know
Good times, good times, good times
All my days
Everything will be wonderful someday
I should have forgotten you long ago
Hello, goodbye, you know you made us cry
'Cause I don't wanna know how it looks to feel like this
All the holes we had to breathe
How I wish I would save my soul
Drop dead in place, you can forget it
Nice to hold when I'm tired
Before this same awakening world
The thing is I'm not worth the sorrow
On the waves of a sinking feeling 
Couldn't see past the end of my beer
Well it can always turn
I really hope you do
And the people you're with
Wintertime is a razor blade the devil made
She'll always have a place in my mirror,
'Cause this is torturous electricity
And you remember when you were young
To hear the time in his mind
It was all about love
It's all of the good that won't come out of us
Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
Don't look away
No one comes near
And take you home into the night
But never in my sweet short life 
All the white horses are still in bed"
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears
And I can be one too
Be running up that hill
You need a ride Delilah 
Thought I knew which one to wear
What it was
Every way I go I'm bound to lose
Baby wakes up with the sun
I'm feeling like I'm famous
All the cracks they lead right to me
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, ohh
'Member how I asked you why are you so mean
I'm just having thoughts of Marianne
Und jetzt wird es still um uns
And if you promise to stay conscious, I will try and do the same
If it's all in my head, there's nothing to fear,
So when this is over, don't blow your composure baby
And then I die
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Change your mind and you'll have to forgive
Keep on looking through the window again
Will night bring light or gloom
And how can you mend this broken man, yeah
An old soul song comes on the alarm clock radio
Don't you know she's got a don't you know
I need a change
For the time we had
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine
Away from them
I believe that my life's gonna see
I wish I wasn't such a narcissist
When I sneak to your bed
She's all on the floor while I drink whiskey
Smile to keep the sky from falling down, down, down, down
No I, never had to give up of holding on to you
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
Making something out of nothin'
Till then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
Talkin' to the one he loves and always will
Oh God, I'm gonna die alone
Till death do us part
"There's plenty of time to make you mine tonight"
I don't know why you're so far away 
Like I'm made of paper
The giving up is the hardest part
Walking, holding hands
And if I need anything at all
And never been down the factor too much of
So just close your eyes Close your eyes
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Marching through the night
Surrounded, surrounded
A place
Pretty Mary K walks along the dock
So I'll file away all my dreams
There's no need for denial
I don't believe you when you say that
You can tell everybody
I hear the beat of my heart getting louder
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever
And you have been so ugly your entire life
Every time you get a drink
I laughed so loud inside myself, it all began to hurt
After all the things we've been through I know it's never gonna come again
London, did you have to take my child away
I am feeling so ambitious, you and me, flesh to flesh
I don't know why you think you got a hold on me
I found you, something told me to stay
A band of them were in your apartment
And you needed proof 
Getting high and mumbling German fables
One is the loneliest number
The man needs a maid
Just love
When she gets that call, Hope's too far gone
I cannot recall
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
That could think of the dreamer that thought
Help me carry the fire
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane
Take a deep breath and a good look around
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
He'll take you out any open door
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
I can't keep up with your turning tables
To this heart alive try, try
It was all an illusion
In my platforms I hit the floor
Felt like nothing good could come
And I'll keep up with our old friends
We fear how we feel inside
Look me in the eyes
I was stood in the stair 
Quiet as gondoliers
You can't miss what you ain't had, well I can, I'm sad and
I look for you or someone who can still remind me of
Shotgun, aimed at my heart, you got one
Feeling scared today
She'd be white gold
Gonna make you break out of your shell
Sometimes I wish I could save you
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love
All my time until I die I've been told only fools rush in
'Cause it's all in her mind
Wornout places, wornout faces
When my sister picks a fight
What'sa matter with you
The ups and the sundowns
Mmm what did you say
All those lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights
And tell it like you still believe 
Any street
All the things that I never thought
I gave you everything to die with a smile
It's such an icy feeling
The ocean pressures its frame
I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head
Our minds are empty, like we're too young
And hold them up to the light
Did I treat you like I did
I hope you're not angry if I disagree
He said, I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
Baby, you took my soul
Or the land between here and the mountains
Jukebox fuckup hanging round the drugstore
Can you do all these things
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment
Losing my mind from this hollow in my heart
No one really cares where I go
I don't need to be I don't need to be
And there's no Hell that he can show me
You never said a word to me about what passed between us
"There's plenty of time to make you mine"
Till I'm blue in the face with a choking regret
I just want to give you everything I've got
While she sings she make them feel things
I'll be forever grateful to
And we knew what time we had
Is the same sky 
For  hours
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
I won't heal given time
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
You're a thousand miles away
But I'm your girlfriend, now I'm your girlfriend
When I dream I dream of your fists
Concerned but powerless
I'll fake it through the day with some help from Johnny Walker Red
Yeah love I hope you know
U keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
And don't tell me you need me
It'll grow back like a starfish"
I ain't about to to die like this
It's horrifyin' right before your eyes
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all
Screamed your name
And he's mean talking beanstalking icey man
I'll hurry past your chest of drawers
Hide and Seek Mm, mm, you don't care a bit 
"Loves golden arrow
Nightmare
And I say thank you Mom
It ain't in their hearts they're bad
So I couldn't come meet you in Brooklyn last night
When living ain't easy
Something inside of me dies
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world
But I always come around
You have turned me into this
Love the way they smiled at me
No, 'cause I can dish it out Never again
Where the rays of the sun were so warm and tender,
She covers her eyes and hides
And do I try to change him
To everything you are 
My sweet prince My sweet prince
I was bitten on the entrance
And all the things that I wish I had not said
I'll be right beside you forevermore
It will all end in tears
Just down the street from your hotel, baby,
Strobe lights and blown speakers
He never even felt his shoe fill with blood
I have all of life's treasures
If it's the last, if it's the last dance
All those rather dreary rain clouds still bother me
When you didn't like my mother
Shell, forgotten with its memories
That she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
And having so much to say
But I can't get my head around it
What you've done
Every look that you threw told me so
That you were looking for
And the words we say aren't meant for anyone
But that's okay, there's nothing left to say, but
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
And you feel like such a knowitall when you only want just a tiny girl
For someone like me
I will paint myself out
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
Are you afraid of being alone
You measured no one that I've ever known
And I wonder where these dreams go
You were looking for the great escape
I'm going through changes
I can change, and I can grow, or we could adjust
Sing me anything
Oh, Caroline, why
The feeling of feeling
Beneath your tender touch
I'm just having thoughts of
Nobody has gained or accomplished anything
Do you smell like a girl when you smile
It came to me tonight, so everyone will have a choice
For the last time
Deep at night I'm awakened from my dreams
Yet I always try to hide
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
Why you got to be mean now
Parading in a wake of sad relations
And I'll turn the night into the skylight of day
When it comes down
A working class hero is something to be
I lay down on the cold ground, and I
And I love you, I swear that's true
Then you walk, under the streetlights
I feel the hurt so physical
Baby, I know you hate me so
When the words take days you can rewrite and erase anything
You were always crazy like that
If you feel just like I feel push people
Just say it to me now
And if it makes you sad to give up dreams you've always had
All of my pain when I think back to when
And I know, you can see right through me, so let me go
And just to keep me up, God I'm so tired of sleeping
And it kills him inside
City bird, haven't you heard
But either way I can't breathe
He said you changed but he wouldn't say how
Since you're gone I'm not the man I used to be
Life carries on, and on, and on
That you need to speak your mind
Either way
Set out with no map and turn off your torch
Or is it mine
All we got left's right here, mm mm yeah
Though you're not mine
Yeah, this is a song about the way things are
Face to face, I've something to say
I am barely here
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around
And see it all dissolve around you
Two halves are equal
A weekend break that slept in late
Yearning for more than a blue day 
Didn't care as long as he was able,
Where is the girl I used to know
It was just like a movie
I close my eyes to see
This is year one 
The scars inside have made you beautiful
Oh cause you got inside my head
Got no reason yet to die
Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Ah, look at all the lonely people
His soul flew right up in the sky and I cried myself to sleep
There's plenty more fish in the sea
And who you thought I was
Warmer than warm, yeah
I may be mad
I must be one
And taking in the homeless sometimes
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
Love is love's return
Open your door  don't hide in the dark
Living in the shadows of your song
And all the gods come down here just to sing for me
'Cause you just don't love me no more
But I got nothing to say
Unable to find my way
Everything that I do
Won't take nothing but a memory
I can't begin to start again why can't I just be perfect
I keep thinking in a moment that
So I left it beside the road
Don't know how you won my heart
Something is muffled, another chuckle
And from the sidelines you see me run
Got a wounded soldier stance
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
It's to dying in another's arms and why I had to try it 
And I'll take with me the memories
Even though you know it don't always go that way
All hungryeyed and weatherstained
From a dimension torn free
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say
I hope you find out what you want
Nobody ever learns
A NeverNeverland
And things that we could never do
Brightness fills empty space
Why's my wallet in the yard
I've never been a fan of long goodbyes
There's only pain
Highways flew by
Oh, nothing means a thing to me
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
"There's nothing we cannot ever fix," I said
Nothing more than a pile of bones
"I don't need you anymore, you're nothing"
I'm gonna miss the trees
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
In a future
To the grave if I must
To bear the shame of this whole world
I didn't see the time
'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
I don't wanna be here alone
The stars, a roof above our heads
It's just another night
For all you've done and still do
Oh America, my friend
But you may be offended, and you may be afraid
It's ok, she don't want the world
I feel so broken up So broken up
All dressed in white, going to the church that night
You make me real Lately I just can't seem to believe
Tracks will fade in the snow 
No one's laughing at God in a war
And those were days of roses, poetry and prose
And so long, goodbye
I don't love you I'm just passing the time
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
And on the day you said it's true
You know the truth
Drinking, saying that to them it doesn't matter
I promise to be good
It's raining in Baltimore, baby,
Something's different
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours,
The lone neon lights and the warmth of the ocean
You wrap your thoughts in works of art
Cause someone's coming home
Me and the dragon can chase all the pain away
What have I got to do to be heard
I know it's always been there
So I turned to run
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
They took you away from me
Put signs on the handles 
Live forever, for the moment Melanie CLive forever
Vanity fairgrounds and rebel angels
And came into my bed
You can always find something to do
Though I've a faint belief in everything
This world is just illusion, always trying to change you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
Let me be to go home
Don't say that it's not fair
How can I fall asleep at night
Let's talk it out
Yesterday's deliveries, tickets for the bachelors
Can we go it alone say say say
The sun don't shine but it never did
And I feel your warm hand
And I'm not coming back around again
The sun will never disappear
The ground is getting closer and the sky is falling down
And I've forgotten what you've said
Come and kiss this pain away
I was lying in my bed last night staring
To get them off the hook would take miracle workers
I just want to touch your soul
When I came into my land
Singing out loud when the sun came up
Cause sometimes I don't know what to do 
But it doesn't sound the same
Give me more than one caress
There's a sense of longing in me
But, tonight you're sleeping alone
About things I couldn't say to you
The people never change
Returned with that drama and stress
I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
I'd play a song that would never ever end
We didn't handle with care
The he falls to the floor
Sorry if that's sweet but it's tomorrow's hope
Go or go ahead and just try me
I call up my friend, the good angel
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
Thought that maybe we'd fall in love over the phone
Slipped my mind that I could use my brain
Tonight, I can't hold a pen
A gift to tear apart
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them someday
I missed my stop and went round again
Oh Lord, what have I done to myself
I want to walk into your grave
Big wheel climbed to the top
All alone, but here comes goodbye
Now that it's easy, ever easy all around
Told me that my hair was red
They keep erasing all the streets, we grew up in
U kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again
Too late to turn back now, I'm running out of sound
I always figured there'd be time enough
For my man to come
I seem to lose the power of speech
If my father took his life
And inside of me, lingers on
And it's not what I was seeking
I know you're never coming back
I never feel I'm quite enough
There's wealth in the bank but there's nothing to show inside
For they're designed to be together oh
May no man's reigns ever chain you
When fools are mistaken for men
I'll make the most of all the sadness
Now that I'm falling to the sunlights and a song
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
And even though I may seem to feel a touch of love
But some things they stay the same
With your eyes shut, you cry in your bed
And you look and you look
You give a little not a lot
You couldn't meet a man
Life was a party to be thrown
Her hearts a bloodstained egg
So I can feel you in my arms
So why did you flee
Looks like it always did
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
I'll leave them over to your eyes,
Cast down by an angel 
I'm goin' to a town that has already been burnt down
But you couldn't care less
I guess I should have heard of them from you
It's not treason, it's no lie
And realized I loved you in the fall
Into the new morning milk blanket
I still don't know why we were holding on,
I miss the grinded concrete where we sat past  or 
And they will sell them for nothing
I know you didn't want to leave
I was sure you saw me, but it wasn't meant to be
The method acting that pays my bills keeps the fat man feeding in Beverly Hills
There's a woman
You said "Young man I do believe you're dying"
Do these dreams have any meaning
I should be crying but I just can't let it show
This story's old this is the end
Take a glorious bite out of the whole world
Where it begins or ends, what it means to be dead
Of all the times before
Far far away a train
Hello, world, hope you're listening
They're all good but not the permanent one
When was the night that showed us the sign,
Over rivers, farms, and state lines
I heard about the cool breeze and the cool nights
I wish I was
That little kiss you stole; it held my heart and soul
If I don't return to you
I won't always love what I'll never have
And said the trapeze act was wonderful
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder,
I know I've been a liar and I know I've been a fool
And looking at you, all I see is
Why is everything so hazy
Return over valleys
I was held in chains but now I'm free
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around
My hate
And I look, and I see, you could be breaking souls again
You were fashionably sensitive but too cool to care
Don't you wish that we could forget that kiss
Take 'em to the bartering lines
And spend every moment I had with you
And you're quiet, you never make a sound
I can't believe you're gone and
But he tells no more lies
And I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
And I'm trying to figure out
You're calling too late
And I'll be your downfall
No, they never got us anywhere 
And sirens on the way
Binding promises were made
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
Don't stop the buck when it comes
It's the chance I've got to take
I gave you everything, what did you give my soul
I'd feel rather alone and ill at ease
And you still can't let go
You die when you're young
You don't believe me 
But you'll see lonely sunsets after all
And when it comes, you'll feel the weight of it
Trying to be your friend
Put on my PJs and hop into bed
And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
Ain't no other cats got love for me
She climbed into a van with a vagabond
Honey kisses clouds of fluff
No one saw
Is this the return to Oz
And through the portal, they can make amends;
Tied down by handicaps instead
Next to the dance hall
A glass of water longing for the ocean
Which agrees with this watch of mine
Before the right one
And I bought it for you 'cause it's your birthday, too'
Love is hell, hell is love
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
This time I'm speeding, with no direction
But if you run away I won't be all right
I'm trying not to think about you
If I was asked I'd tell
And I'll hold on to it
But it's crossed my mind
Lord knows it would be the first time
And these flowers will always fade'
And one by one the years of our lives 
We could be daytime drunks if we wanted
Captain of my feelings
All my sorrow, all my rage
No one left to weep for us
Did you see the closing window
You're a thousand minds, within a flash
The Atlantic was born today
Asking to get in
Wish I could press rewind
Every day, every hour
Will fill your head
It's not half right
They say if you ain't grindin' until you die 
She can feel my heart, fell asleep to its beat
You like your girls insane
Simple promises you said you'd never break
They travel fast and alone
For when I'm alone
And ignite your bones
While I hope that she won't come home
I've still got me to cross your bridge in this storm
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you twentyfourseven
Not just for today
The home we reside in
There might be some good ones
I've been searching 
In every heart, there is a room
I don't feel it anymore
I will fight until we're the special two once again
There is something wrong with me
A broken heart and twisted minds
Oh rejoice, his hands perform hexes
I don't know what else I can say
Like a bird on the wire
Oh, to realize something is ending within us
Holding back the fool pretends
But it looked like you ain't laughed in while
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
Hold On, what did you say that for
I guess I still care
But these handprints on the front steps are mine
Into the hills and looking down
So pristine the pain
Almost all the time
And I've been secretly falling apart
Here I go, scream my lungs out, try to get to you
So please, please, please
The way I loved the way you moved
I always knew I never wanted this
But there are things that line my path
But all your friends are there
We've been cutting it close with the backwards & forwards
As it promises me joy
Will you put my hands away
Free with a history
I know that everything you wanted was yours
I can't take it if you see me cry
You love 'em 'til they can't recall
Well, I guess I should have heard of that from you
In the corner of your eye
Sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep
Think of all the places we could be
'Cause I miss your hands I miss your face
They fly to the end
For one more plane ride out
And these nights
But you were too busy looking into your affairs
Who's from the future
When I lie here with you I'm sure that I'm real
Cold, cold water surrounds me now
Those crazy messed up things that you do
Then I'll leave your town and I'll never look back,
The world is just illusion, trying to change you
'Cause if you don't, then it won't be in peace that you rest
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
But I don't care if I fuck up, I'm going on a date with a rich white lady
But please remember me, my misery
You're a bedtime story 
It's so cold in Alaska Stephanie says
Leave it on the table till somebody else with moneys got a use
And the sun will come on through
She spreads her love
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
I can't breathe with these words in my mouth
Your tears are only alibis 
Maybe somewhere else will not be half as cold as me
On rd, he never found the magic words to change this fact
Half hoping for a showdown
This is the song for Baby Birch
It might be everything I've waited for,
Singing ain't this life so sweet
You keep your wishes I'll keep my feelings
This is a place where I don't feel alone
And I won't be back till next year 
Oh, my baby, don't cry
They never care at all
I see your face, you're haunting me 
no encuentro forma alguna de olvidarte 
No fear of my heart, absence of faith
We're all gonna die"
And just to lay inside you, and just to know this feeling
If you're choking up, take this paper cup
Angel sweet
Let me rest in pieces
I could stand with you with your snow boots on
Next to his name
Do you remember staring up at the stars
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
Tell me you won't give up 'cause I'll be waiting
Und die Vögel singen nicht mehr
You came back soft without a sound
People are dying, I close my blinds
That time at the mall
The signal interrupts
So why do I feel so sad
The state of what you've got
And if you will, keep me from waking to believe this
You will always listen as I pray
'Cause those fire birds are
And you hold me
Why, why do I come here
We have the cold to keep
Sat down in jail with this friend of mine
She is gone, now she's gone
I can see the tears in your eyes, baby
And isn't it sad that you still have to ask if I care
The quiet one
Cold water, cleaning my wounds
Give my gun away when it's loaded
There's nothing like the pain
Biting words like a wolf howling
I was watching a movie with a friend
While it is light
Remember her hair as it shone in the sun
I wish I could tell you a lie
The underground drip
Just three miles from the rest stop
In my heart, you have remained
Hey Ain't life wonderful
Bringing the past with the postcards you sent for me
But it all boils down to what you did there
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Swimming the same deep water as you is hard
And read me the story of "O" 
Sometimes I wonder how I will stay strong
Breathing smoke through his microphone
I thought with a month of apart
I was taken for all the things
Hold you here until the pain has all gone
That I made a difference, and this world will see
I know you're coming for the people like me
Your body's warm but you are not
Your middle name is always
They carved it up into the world we know
On your birthday when mum passed the forks and spoons,
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
I don't know how long we've got left
So we pray for night
Millionaires say
Stop breathing for me you said
Now all I'm feeling
That feels like home, yeah,
I'm really quite a mess, yes
Say a word or two to brighten my day
Ambushed on the road, stole your gold
While you are underneath
Shouldn't let you torture me so sweetly
You'll find a way to live your life
So bright on cinder gray and spray paint
You're sleeping again, alone 
But I'm trying to take some comfort in written words
I don't know what you feel like
Back down to earth, back down to earth
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
Both admitting we'd never felt better, never felt so warm
I hope you're up there with God saying "That's my kid"
Take a chance on a 'recommend', ya
Peace and love,
Now I truly love you wholly
The sweet delays love again
Show you all the pain
They were never meant to hold her so tight
And I will stumble and fall
Rocking chair
The weight of it
To love her
If I have to switch the lights off, I wanna switch them off with you
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell
Noone loves you
That's why I try to keep at bay
So you can struggle in the water
And I love nothing
And now the flames are burning me in my bed but I just don't care
But fear surrounds me like a fence
Well I'm here to tell you babe,
I have nothing left to hear
Somberly, somberly linger lie long early
And rejoice, your hair it smells like burning hair
There's a vintage thirst returning, but I'm sheltered by my channel surfing
Don't you know you've got your Daddy's eyes
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
That you'll be someone, who won't be forgotten
Oh where the heart beats slower and slower
But I need
I say
Elvis never could carry a tune
If you're looking for love
Just cross the border and into the city
'Cause that's all they knew how to play, hey
This time
There isn't room for two of us
The light and the dark, the big and the small
You just have to walk away
Ooh ooh oohoohooh
I fought him off with my love
Please don't fade and please don't cry, 'cause it's all white lies
To look in your eyes,
Lilah you're my only home
It seems you're playing a game
Alone
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And time is speeding by
The things I needed to
And how lips tasting of tears
Give it all away, to have someone to come home to 
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
It's not what you thought
If I had to I would put myself right beside you
You're gone
When I hear your voice, driving me insane
I wanna' scream let the blood flow that keeps me alive
It was Don DeLillo, whiskey neat
With thunder crashing in my head
So Jesus Christ, this goddamn rain
What do you think I would do, baby
When my mouth is this dry
I love you
Oh John you'll never be a man
And the tears come streaming down your face
I strain my eyes and try
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
We've missed out on everything
And on her jacket there's a picture in white of Che Guevara
Soon your hopes will rise and then
She walks in the sun to me
Once it held dreams
Well, I miss my mother and I miss being her son
Turning the clock back,
Shot an arrow in your head
Then you find you jumped the gun
Why are you so far away from me
The permanent installment of the daily dose
Isn't it something
No one cares
Oh you needn't be
My heart is yours
It's only fair to do what's best for you and you alone
Mind, the war child
Wie es mir geht, die Frage stellst du jedes Mal
And dance with my mother and me and then
I used to bring you sunshine
But still you lived inside of me
I should've stop to think, I should've made the time
We'd set the fire to the third bar
Till my hand shook
I I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
To hum through the hours of dying
And I must of said the the right things
There's a woman crying out tonight
Watching him dash away
They'll bring us through it every time,
Shine your teeth to meaningless
We are
In my life, like a song
And watered by the deeds of those who know and who are known
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I am the fire burning desperately but you're controlling me
Life carries on and on, and on, and on
Let the code of silence repeat  times
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I never was the fantasy
Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue
To hold on to these moments as they pass
Down a manhole in that bad way
I guess you don't need me
Me and Lucy walking hand in hand,
And now I speak to you, are you in there
I saw the sun disappear
Nothing unusual, nothing's changed 
Blackened sky, I beg you, weep
Could be your biggest mistake
The same sky we lay under
I wish I could sleep
She's running out
They remember the people they loved
And I don't wish to taste of your insides
Now take a look at me now
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
I'll wrap up my bones
Have been silenced forevermore
I never was one for lying
Another moment
When you loved me
And now, I guess
Until its silence burns you
"I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
To the sea
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And all the real people
This is nothing new
I will be rising from the ground
God, I love you
So now we're living living separate lives
Let me know, let it show
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold
Now nothing
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And through the walls, they made their mudpies;
Johnny's daddy was taking him fishin'
They're trying to ignore us
The snow kissed the curb
Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist
I took a deep breath
You let my hand go, and you fake a smile for me
Say you've lead the way to a mirage
Every day together always
You're like my fire
I wrapped you inside my coat
And please remember me seldom
Uns verzweifelt geliebt
Read the paper
I'm like a soldier coming home for the first time
As one we are everything 
Together we cry, oh, we cry, we cry, oh, we cry, we cry
And there's a thunder in our hearts, baby
This weight will now be satisfied,
I've turned into someone else
Without you is all my life amounts to
Simple girl, simple girl
I'll win you back for me if you give me a chance
Last time I saw you, you were on stage
It's not right, not okay
Oohoohoohooh, believe me, momma
People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night
Six will love you so much
And hands in the sky
And she listens like her head's on fire
Why's lipstick on the mirror
High, neglectful lover
To live the life that I have made in song
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
She'd fallen down to, now the streets are wet
I loved you first, I loved you first
My heart is frozen still
Tonight it used to be so cool
The very last thing before I go
So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
She put her veil down trying to hide the tears 
Where the jokes are cold
I wanna live life, never be cruel
To get a drink in this place
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah ah
The language of love
I don't know who you are, but I
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
My grandaddy was a player, pretty boy in a pair of gators
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
And I could've gone to that place
All the strange things
Keep my heart breaking in the dark
It's the last goodbye I swear
Why put a new address on the same old loneliness
I never conquered, rarely came
Yeah, and Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
Maybe maybe they'll stay true
No one can
Well we can change our partners 
Just talking shit about how we're all so upset about the disappearing ground
I haven't forgot
And that's the way that you feel honey know
I'll Take you away from that empty apartment
We're not the same, dear
You can sing me anything
This has got to lie down, down
And the daffodils look lovely today 
More damage than a soul should see
Go ahead and destroy this
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
To my loved ones today
That there is comfort in a world
But now she's your shade of gold
To the shadows of regrets
Did you add up all the cards left to play to zero
Are you my friend when I need one
No I wouldn't have kissed your face
I'll run free too
It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce
I say that shit just clownin' dogg; c'mon, how fucked up is you
All that's done's forgiven
And though there are times when I hate you
And fat blue serpent swells
And talking in rhymes
I'm with a man I know
I like your questioning eyebrows 
I'm supposed to love you back
Even angels would be homesick in this forsaken town
We're on the other side
For you, whoever you are
Dying far with everything
I know nothing at all
The things I feel and
All I want is the comfort and care
'Cuz nothing else matters, oh
I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
For the national plan, I don't care
Not yours, not mine
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
All the chickens come on home to roost
I never thought I would forget this hate
But I know I'll see your face again
Could I be any clearer 
We know to seek success is utter nonsense,
You can't mend me, don't even try
And I just want to see you back at my front door
For the first time that we could drive
In the distance, moving closer with every hour
I just want to fold you up into my arms
As soon as the storm is over
On the back of a motor bike 
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life
And all around us everywhere
I have seen death
And dreaming, pick up from
Can I come see you tonight
Whenever paul thinks of snow,
Like my love into her grave
Do you see the world
Can't you see that this is death
What a wicked game to play
A song that no one sings
Because this veil is has been lifted
And I won't hear you cry when I'm gone
Oh rejoice, the world we know is turning
Love is like a dream, when it's just me and you
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
And the ribbon was tied
You said you weren't afraid to die
Oily marks appear on walls
So now you're scared of love
I remember the bells, the flowers
I can't mend
When in fact we're slip slidin' away
That no one in the world could dare destroy
By closing up the garage door and turning on the car
These flowers will always die
Think of the past,
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
 minutes, to alter our lives
Do you fall upon your knees
I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real
So you send So you send
I got happiness that I can maintain
Says here in the water you must be gone by now
I know there is a way,
You won't need a real job
But I can't find your clamshells
Through all their lies
I'm a junkyard full of false starts
Wondering if I really tried everything I could
Would this song live on forever
These are a few of my favorite things
And when I'm brave enough and find a clever way to kick him out
I found a place so safe, not a single tear
That she could feel and
In the city or the suburbs of this town
I just watched her make, the same mistakes again
Out on the road
Wasn't there something I should have tried
How dare you say it's nothing to me
I will kiss you
Is anybody waiting at home
This Martian ends her mission
To leave this earth, come on
The perfect heart's length away
Think I wanna die if you don't stay
I will feel so glad to go
Hello, teacher, tell me, what's my lesson
Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die
It still feels like yesterday
I've been around this world
I guess I forgive you
You'll be the end of me
I can see it in your eyes
I'm gonna be the man who's coming home to you
Like 'We'll meet again' and 'Fuck the man'
Out of the air
The rain falls
Hey What's that you say 
It's so hard to go into the city
I didn't know that it was over
I'm gone, gone
Your mama's got a new man, your daddy always fails
I fell in love with you
She says, shhh, I know, it's only in my head
They can run me out of town
And man, did I lose you
My Clementine
But its far away, it's in the distance
No, I don't want to be the only one you know
Without a reason, what is this fire
I'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
You're still alive Delilah 
I'm telling you I'm trying to hear this out
Asleep from all your pain
I need music
And no reason or rhyme
But still your love was true
How could I let things
I feel unsteady,
Out of your way 
About myself, I'm sorry
Please don't worry lover, it's really bursting at the seams
Goodbye, goodbye
Bring it baby
She was all right, yeah the sea was so tight
I'll always love you
I'll never get over you walkin' away
From the edge of the deep green sea
But I won't let this build up inside of me
My blood is pumping through my veins
Cause my heart caught fire
Turned off the light on my way out the door
One more year, down here
Somebody hurt you too
I can see the signs,
The way you've done it
Out of the lightning
Got to be some more change in my life
Party in the sky
Mother remember the night that the dog had her pups in the pantry
Cut your hands
Always a lonely widow
Sweet deceit comes callin'
Along the way I lost my faith
I got a dream to heed
And all of the drugs she took, every one, every one
We don't open from outside
Was beautiful but nothing really was there
And know that I meant something in somebody's life
So now I'm taking back my words
On an allnight drive to another world
That in time things must change
Nothing compares
i will already look for what makes me 
And late at night
Her world has changed
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
And we'll never miss a party collar weekend
But if you only knew me
I break in two and if a piece of you dies
Will I shake this off, pretend it's all okay
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
To the point It never was the time to let me in
Though I carried karats for everyone to see 
Never thought you'd make me perspire Never thought I'd do you the same
Three wasted years, standing still
A single thing that I could always understand
Well, maybe I am, maybe I am
It's all the good that won't come out of them
Pictures frozen in time
When the first star you see may not be a star 
I felt closer to you than you ever would have known
And I'm on my way to believing
When everything was falling apart
Don't send me to the path of nevermore
Katie, don't cry
I get that same old feeling
Everything will be alright
I did this for you too, you still got me around your finger
I guess it's time to put the top down
Fading everything to black and blue
Together we cry, cry
Look sadder and sadder still
I don't know how to be something you miss
Before you lose it on the man
The thought of all the stupid things I'd said
And you tryin' to come back home
I somehow see what's beautiful
And we've found the music
Something I can believe in
From knowing the truth
May your love never end, and if you need a friend
There's so many ways our lives have changed
Sad song, sad song
I don't wanna see the day when it's dying
And they seem to lose control with you
So before I end my day, remember
And send that old devil back to hell
Fall apart right here in Northside bars
Your friend who won't betray
The only one left
Are you strong enough to tow the line,
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
You're the one who's always choking trojan
Just the car that we ride in
I need you like a baby when I hold you,
Well, the trees grow
Come on fallen star
To pull you up on to dry land
And you should have seen the look on your face
Don't throw it all away
To hear you knocking at my door
Saw the boardwalk start to fall
Every chance that I take
Someone suddenly my fear
You're nobody girl
I yelled my commands
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Why didn't she tell me, and where do I go tonight
I'm guessing this is growing up
But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
I�m stayinabove the flatline
Only in dreams, we see what it means
Nor lay my face to the soil, nor my teeth to the sand
"Daddy, our baby's gone"
Who'll set my heart free
Each beat reminds me of you
Live forever, for the moment
He was down for his brother
Your soft skin is weeping
Someone had to go this far
If you're still free, start runnin' away
Blood flowers in the kitchen
With no room for a pardon
I did, I did I've done
I forget to forget, nothing is important
Spend Sundays asleep I'm just another dreamer
Rejoice despite the fact this world will hurt you
Looking out across my family members
Carefree along the shore
Three cheers for my parents,
I just wanna look in your eyes
We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, "No"
That little piece of heaven looking back at me;
Charlie's broken 
It may sound absurd
U and I had many conversations on the telephone
I've worked for so long
And how I miss someone to hold
Yeah, and this time
A simple man, a sycophant
I can't believe what I saw on the TV screen
Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesterday's fallen freckles away
How come you're not ashamed of what you are
Of a girl with a broken heart
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
Who fall behind
I'm sorry about the other night
Daddy ride us on your back again
Like a baby stillborn
I can't say a word
This time I'll be your man
That took you farther than you thought
I'm like a mother barely keeping it together
Got no one to call your own
'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Don't try to wake me in the morning
Hold in your breath,
This tired mind just wants to be led home
And rub my eyes
All the summers singing, drinking, laughin'
Ooh it's hard on the man
This is the end
Feel it fadin' away
Inside
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
So tonight 
The long and winding road
Are played in loops 'til it's madness in my head
This clock is opening another door
Well, I'll go to college and I'll learn some big words
The sun is coming up and it's going down
Because I'm gone again
Will shrink you till you're underground
My happiness depends on you
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong
Reach out our hands, hold on to hers
We stumble into our lives
Something real, make it timeless,
Wash the blood off your hands
I had true love
You've got yourself to tease and displease
She said she'd call but that was three weeks ago
Gave a thought to what they all could mean
And black fumes of skin so gently bled
Leave it all the fights and all 
I've got some imperfections
Mr Jones
No sense of time
My fake plastic love
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
'Cause you're fast asleep next to me
I want to, I need to be
Too close for comfort, bed and breakfast in a spoon
It was so simple in the moonlight, now it's so complicated
Spring flowers sproutin'
But we're still sleeping like we're lovers
We thought that everything
The things that you wanted, I bought them for you
And would you take away my hopes and dreams
She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested
When there's nowhere left to fall, nowhere to hide
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I can't sleep next to a stranger when I'm coming down
The salt you breathe
People would stop to hold 
I wanna talk and laugh like we used to
We swing and we sway
I don't feel alright because you make promises that you break
Nice dream, nice dream
Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
And on your machine I slur a plea for you to come home
Pictures of the life she's longing
I never knew perfection till I heard you speak 
When I won't have to leave alone
This world is crying for so much more
And misty memories of days gone by
On election day
Here I go, so dishonestly
No one cares if you live or die
The snow's been fallin' for months
To this heart a little bit longer
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
She comes to me like an angel out of time
You'll be someone they will look up to
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
And feel it wash away
Come off course while you sleep
I hope your wish came true, mine betrayed me
Would you tell me I was wrong, would you help me understand
And I don't know how we woke up one day and somehow thought we knew
Promises of payments were upon your shoulders constantly,
Bullying him round round
And a blinking midnight clock
It's Christmas time and the needles on the tree, a skinny Santa is bringing something to me
The map of the world is on you
Don't run, don't hide
I was so scared to face my fears
I have loved you for many years
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
I'm singing a sad tune
They wish for different worlds
She's homely and she's cranky, and her hair's in a net
Repeats  times
I wish that I had never said the things that I'd told her today
You keep me up in bed 
That could dream about a thought
Your death by information
I can't take it like the other girls
I was young,
And now he's turning off
The kids were waking up hung over,
But you'll fight and you'll make it through
It's the end of a broken heart
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
Coming back over again
And everything that we could be
They love me like I was a brother
Pull me out from inside
Did they throw it away
A fight that never ends
But I'll try my best to reach you
But you haven't seen my man
This is the hardest story that I've ever told
And the air in between is spewing comets
I'll point you home
Never to see your face again
Oh take it all away
Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one
So please hold on, so please hold on please hold on
I could make you smile if you stayed a while
Enraged by things unsaid 
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Do you even wonder if we're alright
Good and evil matched perfect, it's a great romance
Aside the lions and the ladies
About reasons why you don't wanna talk
I'm working on drawing a straight line
Well it's alright, why don't you tell me my friend
There's nothing left to prove
She didn't even see me
So close no matter how far
You're a loser, a rebel, a cause without
You'll follow me back with the sun in your eyes
Own my sears
It's the same way you showed me
And now it's just another lonely day
I'm just human
Red light, blinking in the twilight
I got your bible and your gun
Steel toe caps, takes all your credit cards
I thought that I found myself under something new
You haven't seen my man
Follow the cops back home
I could drag you from the ocean,
And please don't fall in love with someone new
And I want you in my life
Is one that smells so pure
I could never make him love me
No, this can't be, please don't leave me alone in the dark
You see my ghost and you'll never forget it
And the story's all over you
You needn't be, oh you needn't be
There is too many ways that you could kill someone
I love the tone that's in your laugh
A family is waiting,
Another day of life without you
Mister fisherman, to a less peculiar ground
You are my center
I let my heart decide the way
But something we will always want
So when your new eyes meet mine
From all of the tears you have shed all of the tears you have shed
Cannot be repaired
And you'll laugh and embrace all your friends
Learning to care for the ones you hold dear but it's too it's too bad
And I would walk  more
To relive time in his mind
All the truth that I needed
You said you hate my suffering and you understood,
And you left with your head filled with flames and you watched as your brains
In the morning, at the top of the stairs
'Cause we've been this low and we've been around this bend
Somewhere with you, yeah
And I can't love you any more than I do
Some things look better, baby
I see my mother in my face, but only when I travel
Now the lightships 
I felt loneliness and shame
Can't you see the grass is greener where it rains 
And there's not a word that I comprehend
That is what I knew
No my blood don't flow anymore
These flowers will never die
She waits all night to feel his kiss
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Hopes and fears
I called
Loving you was really hard
Unloading lead inside me, I was subscribing one by one,
To me you're precious, may you always
Without someone to hear her cry
Since the day that I left her
But now it's time to get out of the desert and into the sun
With you I saw fun and expansion
And while we're sleeping all the streets get rearranged
Like I follow my dreams
I am one
To deserve your love and sympathy
But the simple word "love" itself
I thought that I heard someone say now
I've got the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why the tears
There's a very big man
But the local kids would still go swimming,
Was covered in snow
I was not honest
'Cause the trousers seem to love your floor
I know it's dark outside
And you can't sleep
I'm gonna miss the birds
I won't deny the pain
Something absolutely wrong
But where did we go wrong Oh
And so I'm reaching out for the one
Whistle away 
You see mom, I'm a good little boy Good little boy
'Cause we keep them going constantly Stands forever
Besides some comment on the weather
It's only fair to do the same to me when you're not home
There's too many people
Oh, the sky was a woman's arms
In the wind I crunch, I want to die
Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
Caught a bolt of lightning
'Cause then I'd know I was down because
Maybe I should buy a new car,
Loneliness was tough
Do you know I cry
I remember, I remember, I remember
Step one, step one
It will kill you in the sunshine
�な�を�っ�る�だ�う yeah yeah yeah
Like wildflowers
For loneliness like this
Did they get you trade your heroes for ghosts
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You shed light into this empty space
And no there's no one to rely on
I've worn the faces off
And below the angel dog
Don't waste your whole life trying
And so I've learned the meaning of the sun
my days without you are like a sky, 
The fate of all mankind I see is in the hands of fools
Do such normal things with you 
Let me break the things I love I need to cry
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I'm in the crush and I hate it
I'm not a stone, I'm just a man
And sit here cold, we will be long gone by then
There are moments when,
Our sinking friendships
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
Basically, I wish that you loved me
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh
I am surrendering
You don't have to call anymore
They've long since waved their last goodbyes
I'm working on my faults and cracks
Like so many girls, Jenny Wren could sing
Held their face for eternity
If you could paint it
Just know that I am by your side
On that midnight street
The ghosts of graffiti they couldn't quite erase 
I searched for you there
The heart wants
The curves around your face
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
And I held your hand through all of these years
I want to be a good woman
There ain't nothing we can do to protect you
Everything's gotta change
The window's open now and the winter settles in
While I was waiting
In his own way, he'll love me till the end
Mother don't worry, I killed the last snake that lived in the creek bed
It all becomes clearer now
In each dead bed and empty home
The gallows and the graves of
Flowers grow through my window and I love you again
It is my fault you see
We were lovers in every way
When I don't, ooh
Take some time and warm it with your hands
When you did the things you said were up to me
Mine to give away
It's a violent night, there are boxers in the street
It's true I always wanted love to be
In beds in little rooms in buildings in the middle,
I need your affection all the way
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity
I'll turn on my SAD light
I was unrecognizable to myself
And make sure you're alright
I hope my fists
Where we captured all the fireflies
I believed your every word and I guess you did too
Your every wish will be done
This used to be our playground used to be
While those around you crawled
I still remember the look on your face
But we don't have much room 
A little death makes life more meaningful
These flowers will never die'
All these walls are caving in
You shut the door on everything too busy getting high
With every waking breath
And I walked along
You are fighting us all
I need it, I need this
I don't want nobody else
Is leaving Sacrificed most of our lives
My problem is I don't have much to say
And my father and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah
And he felt himself floating up to falling snow
Could you ever believe beyond love
A wind can always turn
You've done no wrong
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
And only as bright as you wanted me to be
And the distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
Lies, lies, lies
Until his dad gets here and stands by my side
That's toxic clear down to the bedrock
I need this 
And waving your hand
It never goes away
Well, I feel so broke up, I want to go home
Enough to see your light
Stone, stone, stone in love with you
I miss it all, from the love to the lightning
It's only your shadow, nobody else
I hope that heaven is your resting place
Your destiny may keep you warm
Oh, it's such a perfect day
Did you hear me laughing in your head, when I saw you stuck in a rut again
Painted portraits of minions and slaves, crotch mavens and onenight plays
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now
And all those nights
It's so hard to go in the city
Bag it, man
Black sky and black sea
Yes, so CripplePig was happy
And I am here right beside you
Who cares, this is a tune coming in, that one noise is like
Hi, Justin, this is your mother
Every dream inside my soul
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Or with silver spoons and coloured light
With open eyes so we could see
And we can never repair
Your mother's dead
To make sure that she is safe and sound
I'm a star, you're a star
Twentyone was not a good number
When you walk away
Was there a man up in the corner with the spiders made of light
Picking up the ticket shows there's money to be made
Still tryin' to persuade me that
Possibly maybe
A voice inside my coffeecup
I am drowning, there is no sign of land
That the angels have slipped through our landslide
Slow is the memory
Feel the moonlight on your skin
No light no air to live in
It all sounds well and fine
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
A hundred times is fine
And be forever with my poison arms around you
And this life and work
You'll knock on my door
And I'm light as the sun,
So I blame this town, this job, these friends, the truth is it's myself
Get up, won't you stop my pain
You were always good for a rhyme
So is it goodbye
Oh I'm scared of the middle place
As we all tried so hard to remember
From home again
So please stop explaining
Ooh their breath is warm
So far from home
Please, please forgive me
And as I start to leave
My heart was blinded by you
Begged him to stay by the light of this ship
I will make it through the night
You must be proud of the boys that you have raised 
Must enjoy the sun, must enjoy the sea
Six hundred sixtysix hundred sixty days
Oh tell me, did you really think
Hurting parts of your garden
She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
I'm staring at the mess I made,
Ha ha ha show me what you got
And thinking of long distance rates instead of kissing you
Scratching at the surface now
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
The lights went out,
So heavy on my heart, heart
I take out the trash, I sweep the floor
Are you wasting away in your skin
I never once in my sweet short life meant anybody harm
He explained how the end will come
One more night, that was a good one
Well, I know how much you care
Seen into the eyes of the weak
I'll take you back
Sleeping soundly the back of the car felt more like a home than I would have ever thought
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
The snow and tickertape blurs all my senses numb
I don't need an education,
You've never seen the lonely me at all
It passes by my window
But the timing never seemed right
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
A time I thought I knew
In this love
I will be your angel
I wonder will it be the same tonight
Then you move when it's your turn
To fill a hole, to shake the sky in two
If I had just one more day
This won't break your heart, but I just think it could
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
So I will take it back
In my sleep
She was an angel
And trying to find anything you can feel that you can believe in
It was all just a lie
We're far from comfortable this time 
In everlasting peace
When you say love is a simple chemical reaction
Too much, too bright, too powerful
And the pipe dream is yours now
If the curve of you was curved on me
I wish I died
We pulled too many false alarms
While the lovers and the lonely, start to whisper all about me
Mother, where are you today 
I could document this as our first, as our last row
She was lying on the floor
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
There were times I'd wonder
How this will end
A throwaway from an open grave
You know you'll never be lonely, no you'll always be loved
I'll drown my beliefs
Darling I hope that my dream
I'm gonna make this work
If the chip off your shoulder should fall to your chest
There ain't no blanket, that can hide this cold
What are you gonna do
Oh baby ever understand
The last thing they remember
I'm on fire, baby
There's something I've learned 
Watching the fox pick off my goldfish from their sorry golden state
Come and take these tears away
I'm changing like the seasons
The trees are giving up To sight
I've wasted away
Everlasting like the sun
I heard her say it once
Don't you think I was too young
I remember someone old once said to me
She says, "Hey, baby, I just might take the chance"
But you love someone else
And maybe try another time
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence
Well, there's only one girl that I will ever love
We'll make rainbows at night
One just escapes, one's left inside the well
That strangle the heart 
But really girl it ain't no rush
And I can't fight
I'm holding on your rope
But I'm always wanting you
Let me tell you something; this is the 's Alright
You dropped the paper in my water
Please don't think that this was easy 
Everybody knows that I'm the best, I'm crazy
Hey now, comb your hair and off to work
Sends your words past your lips
This song has been brought to you by a falling bomb
And now we're left here in the pain,
So now in Rock Ridge pharmacy I will be waiting for my man
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
The dog days are done
All my life I've wasted for this
This life is not yet over
Oh rejoice, you burned your whole beard off
Joe turns the TV on with all the lights out
Oh baby come on, let me get to know you
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
So cold
I walk back in the night alone, got caught up in my song
As they come
But you, you were almost gone
Even in your sleep
'Cause life long cracks
Sadly, or in the depths of winter
Reaching out, reach for me, emptyhanded
All you can do now is watch the shells
And I went to my room
You can stop the world, try to change my mind
Now when I think of touching your hair
I try'd to save us so many times but still you couldn't see
These look well speckly, bit of green and blue,
And I've been calling
Father set our house to flame
My mother's glamour lives on and on
The hammer may strike 
Am I correct to defend the fist that holds this pen
It was my turn to decide
And I can't make it go away 
Waking up I see that everything is okay
All you have to do is cry
You're sadly, crumbling
I don't know what I don't know, it's harder everyday
The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
I wanna fly, never come down
And people come by and they look at your face
With you I knew god's face was handsome
Will the patterns show, we'll know what to do
Can't stop loving, can't stop what is on its way
No, not "baby" anymore  if I need you
I'm gonna miss the sound
Made me live in memory
I said I hate myself and I want to die
To a place where you belong
I'm gonna tear off all the petals from the rose that's in your mouth
I'll find someone to help you
Picked through the rubble and pulled out their hair
What it meant to give everything up
Ice is starting to form 
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
Best friends can become strangers
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
Wonder this time where she's gone
Of tears and idle threats misplaced then
Feeling right here in this uniform
And history books forgot about us
A sin you swallow for the rest of your life
Up in the air
Now I'm waiting for a hand
As I opened up the door, she said
She's all I dream
I guess we'll never meet now, it wasn't meant to be
So this is me swallowing my pride
Somebody good 
Maybe it can't stop tomorrow from stealing all my time
In fact this is twice in a row
And you feel hopeless and homeless
The damage is done The prodigal son is too late
When you've seen it a million times
But in just three words he brings you down
Falling out my babe
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
It's a day that I'm glad I survived
In the shallow gutter that lines the boulevards
Your sympathies I'm ready to return
So please hit me
Silently closing her bedroom door
And every time I try to fly, I fall 
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
Oh, yeah I will, yeah I will
Let me stretch upon your carpet
Won't you help a brother out, out, out, out, out
At somebody new
I know what you'll say
And it will fade all away
Found a way to understand the time you're burning 
Please don't die
And I'm too young to care 
Then I'll put the towels all away
My lips are pale plum
Just keeping the peace, just keeping the peace
When it's you I'm dreaming of
And Konstantine is walking down the stairs 
You had me crawling for you, honey
Take anybody that you want as, long as she don't go
Like we did on the beach last summer
Just one more round before we're through
Someone mawed and put my cock in
If you walk away, I'll walk away
I feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door
Cause you lied, lied
If you don't want to be with me just say and I will go
You'll never touch these things that I hold
There's nothing left of me
When I was lost I even found myself
I won't feel anymore
Is this the bed I chose to make
And I am still inside you
A long farewell of the hunger strike
New words for old desires
For everything that I've done
Here's one to you
'Cause you can blame me for everything
I think I'll save suicide for another day
I have been thinking, what, with my final brain cell
Don't you know this is war
She used to kiss his weeping eyes 
Can change everything in your life
In my home on my way
That you'll run and never tire
Through the sleet and the rain
It was just before the moon hung
I know you're gone, you said you're gone, 
This dancing lights across a crowd remind us of another town
I start to miss you
But for the grace of love
See if we could be something
Our love is like our music 
Didn't want no more voices in her head
I keep waving at the taxis, they keep turning their lights off
But, you're chasin' the ghost of a good thing
Separate lives
And strangers break their promises
'Cause nobody loves you
Were you made ashamed Why'd you lock them in a drawer
But I'd sacrifice my body
'Cause you're not coming home tonight
The worst things in life come free to us
And I know I wasn't right,
All my sorrow and pain
Just to stay in the corner of you heart
I'm not crying
It might start now, or maybe I'm just dreamin' out loud, but until then
I'm not sure why it always goes downhill
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
Return to me
Sometimes you just can be a man
Call me on your way back home, dear
Lucky old sun is in my sky
To breathe for me, breathe for me'
And I will get lost into your eyes
Yeah, yeah, ah
For sorrow, the only lover I've ever known
Oohoohoohooh
They still can't erase you
The thoughts you once gave me,
And I think I am just as torn inside
No one's laughing at God when they're saying their goodbyes
Down in the way you've held together
I'm miles away 
A strange way to tell you
Hear water ebbing with her breath
I'm like a child looking off on the horizon
Tomorrow it may change
You've done enough
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Of the night sky to infinity
Was saving money for you in a jar
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
Or dig myself a little hole
Just make it go away now
Plastic wings and plastic smiles
And just dance and just drink,
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
You're everywhere inside of me
There was a moment
And I don't mind
So you walk that way, I'll walk this way
I miss the way we sleep
Make the days okay
Time, time has a way, you know, to make it clear
Like the ground's not mine to walk upon
I didn't really know what to call you, you didn't know me at all
Hardened It never was the time for us
Can you hear my call
Each time you decide to pass on by
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Let me feel the space between us grow deeper and much darker everyday
Well death may come invisible
Caught in his hair
So if you're calling me out,
If you were swinging from the highway overpass
While you dance to 'Purple Rain'
I unwrapped your present underneath your feet
I remember we could talk about anything
The need to destroy things creeps up on me every time
It wasn't meant to be
I breathe deep and cry out,
But that's one thing I never mean to do
I fall for her
Black and on the ground
I'm searchin' for a face
Gravestone
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
It's worth my time,
No one else will have me like you do
Woke up and before they went back to sleep
And in the day
Say you'll be with me, when the heartache ends
You really hate
And maybe twice the bear that I thought I was
Everyone says you just gotta let it go
Where flowers grew and the sun shone still
The harvest of my dreams 
It's gonna kill me for the rest of my life
Your death creates success
It was over my head
In the morning when you finally go
Shine like stars, shine like stars, shine like stars
I pretend to cry
If Heaven calls, I'm coming too
Look lovely
So many times I've played around
Same night you bought a ring and you proposed
Was always waiting for the crush
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Afraid to find out that you're alone 
We hope would mean the most to me
I need somebody and always
My toes can talk
I love you madly
To the sun and the dust
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now, 
Left all my kinder parts rusting and peeling
Now what have I become
I never needed you to be there everyday
The lack of space for the lighthearted
That haunted this still life 
Where do they all come from
Its just a bad dream
Can fight for two
For the life of me, I cannot believe
Oh that drink went down smoothly, just like the one before the last you had
You stare politely right on through
Ya me he olvidado de ti
Please don't hold me down
Faith dear, enough to get you by
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
You knock on her door
You didn't know
That�s the piece you keep when you say goodbye
To the beat of a drum, yeah
And the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay
Please, please, don't tell my mates
I can hear you asleep
Everything is new
I got to see the land
She usually comes right in, now I can tell
And if we died right now
You're gonna like it but not a lot
Traveled all alone through boring meadows
I try again and again
Here's two for being unaware
Snoozing in cobwebs and the cement
And I know you'll never return to this place
I wanna run away from love
Built a shack with an old friend
Maybe it's trite but I can always, always, always be wrong
But you never were, and you never will be mine
I need you to stay
You might sleep but you will never dream
And there's distance and there's silence, your words have never left me
Go to my room and I close my eyes
Walk with me and maybe
I'm fallin
And the reasons why
And find some beautiful place to get lost
Is a rule, read the guidelines
I'm holdin' on
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me yeah, yeah
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final, and nobody gets a reprieve
And all that ever mattered
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies
How you'll still be there, when the heartache ends
I'll be staying down where no one else gonna give me grief
You're a friend
So I, I just got to tell you
I was trying to make you angry
And I'll be anything to keep her here tonight
Make a raft of our bodies
Lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
My mouth is dry with words I cannot verbalize
But dear Lord she' s dying to dance with my father again
I could feel myself growing colder
Dear Lord you've took so many of my people, 
I put my head on the table I was so distraught with you,
So I twist and turn
And I haven't got a lot of time
Passed the guitar and said I battered my car right now, won't you please give me your tune
And who wants to give up that part of them
Of "tears of a clown"
I might need to be near you
Later that night, when I was asleep
Find your way into my heart
To walk back through the mud
He drops to his knees, says please my love, please
I just toss and turn right there beside ya
Where I'm tossing and tortured till dawn
It's not like years ago
Keep me safe inside your arms like towers, tower over me
It's hard to make that change
We are blessed and sustained
Look both ways when you leave the building
Hit me like a fever when you left me baby
Smile all the time
It's just a name
All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
By the time you realized I was dying
I'd do anything for you, anything for you
And you love the lies they say
Alright
That I bought last night 
With the windows all cracked
Just dragonflies
You are lost and found
For me to say or her to second guess
Many of your dreams will be destroyed
Wir haben die Wahrheit
These arms would not be taught to need another's
Blackbird fly, Blackbird fly
Be a world child, form a circle
When you're alone in your room
Swirl and sway without me
The times I've had with you 
Without you I'm nothing
Yeah when my world is falling apart
You offer only one reply
And pretend that he could wish himself health on a four leaf clover
You'll say I'll need appeasing when I start to cry
I'm waiting on the other side x
And then I'm not so scared somehow,
I've been looking back to find
Your needle and your damage done
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Cause to trust is to depend
I've got nothing left to live for
I don't have much to say to you
It's across the sky
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Heaven is on earth
She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures
And when will I meet my end
Papa went to other lands
But if you're tired of looking at my face, I guess I already am
'Cause I'd love love love to dance with my father again
What would it take for things to be quiet Find your way
Innocence in your arms
I wouldn't mind perhaps
aun sigo buscando en las caras de ancianos
And my wife has some dogs in our yard
When I first got here
He was always such a nice Boy
Now I wander around, feeling down and cold
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here
Why don't you come home to me
So sweetheart, tell me what's up, I won't stop
But it's the way I feel right now
It's hard to say that I was wrong
The next time you say that you love me
I got damaged, I lost myself in you
All these tears that I cried
I can't lie
And you can't change me
For the summer
Nothing
Only seven hours away
I can't get it through my head
Oh I'm still breathing
Bird girls can fly
Soft, dark, and dreamless
Wake up in the rain
Your lips give you away
Bearing down on these two shadow animals
That was until the day before the day
'Cause it takes something more this time
Eyes always stare
Maybe, we are, we are
Salt my wounds, and I'll keep saying thank you
Outside the cars speed by
Let go of my hand
It's better not to holla back
Because of the things she did in the streets
But please try to be patient
And you swore you say me laughing
Seasick yet still docked
I'll be misunderstood
He never stopped to think that he was getting older
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
And say everything's fine
You give me a little bit
So pay me money, take a shot
Bury it by the river, easy
The things I kept inside
Time will fly, upon my baby's back
I'm too tired to fight your rhyme
To believe in
I will see you in the next life
Come on and dance with me
Candied on the inside
I'm light as a feather
Your back's not straight like before
The winter as your scene
Maybe I need fantasy
I want the world to go away
Oh, truly disappointed
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I believe that I need to be free
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
Can you please
You have to help to patch things up
I can't sleep
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
What you needed was to be rid of me
Favours for favours, fond but not in love
Sais e minerais, evaporar
Edward, see those alluring lights
And they took all their things
I fell asleep last Saturday
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
Yesterday was cold
If these walls could talk they would have so much to say
The things that they did  ah  they didn't have to ask us
Chafing mine eyes
What a wicked thing to say
You can't fix me, I'm torn apart
Is all we have to breathe
But this carriageway can't take me there
To find the surface, when you're underground
There's a shadow in my place
Everybody else's dreams are Freudian clues
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime,
It ain't nothin' but a house
The biggest lie
I'm giving up the ghost of love
And we all went to heaven in a little rowboat
Suddenly the night has grown colder
Like every day, of course
Now you move with the tide and I've heard you've found peace of mind
Cause everyone I know just keeps calling me
In case you change your mind
My love
Pour real life down on me
Not to tell you that I still hate you
Don't come across for me
This thing that I'm saying
I'm not one to hide my face behind the pain
I keep my window open
It's time we left town
But tell me something, can they see mine
Just too bad they lie, just too bad they lie
So close to dying that I finally can start living
A secret kiss
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
It wasn't meant to mean no harm
There's a girl that I know of that don't ask for much
'Cause I can't do it face to face
Because you're dead in my mind
'Cause every breath that you will take when you are sitting next to me,
I catch the rainfall
To sink into the dark, dark earth
No love, there is no love
I'll never be able to give you something
A walk across the water with pretty Mary K
Papa was a rodeo 
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are
And the building collapsed, so we'll shop one, we'll shop one for something
To the one thing that I need to walk away from
I'm fallin down
Don't give up the fight to stay alive
Falling slowly, eyes that know me
Try to pretend to laugh
You meant everything 
I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet
It was just the other night
She says, it's only in my head
And sitting in the long grass in summer
Doing my hair with an hour to spare
Every moment we had to make the other one feel bad
 am it's dark
If you have a father or if you haven't one
And inside my head, holdin' on
Everybody is the same in this long nowin game
Hey, I'll take this day by day by day
He said, "Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do"
And I'll be gone
And lie here on our bed of leaves
Whirl around me, make me wonder
And saying whatever they say
Don't despair, 
That's the truth
Will she remember my old voice while I fight the tears
The words have been drained from this pencil
You remain selfless, cold and composed
Kiss my hand and wave
The cleaners have done their job on you
But a house, a house where
A wish or a command
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
I never should of waited so long to say
Ev'ry night I lay on a pillow
Looking out my bedroom window
'This dream always ends,' I said
But tonight we'll set you free
I'm done with this, I'm counting to ten
Is just hold me please, hold me squeeze, hold me, hold me
Do you have to make me feel like
Oh, little stranger, bring my baby back to me
I let you go but you're still the only one
Sad news from today's call
Dream that I'm dying to find the truth
"I know this can't be wrong" I say
You have changed so much, that I don't know,
Go home and shot your health
Scraping for pearls on the roadside
And these are the years that we have spent
It's hard to notice gleaming from the sky
And I don't want to scare her
I spent last winter in New York
This town has got the youth of me
So kiss me hard
Yeah yeah
And I gotta hear the same sermon
Where are you dad
I'm not satisfied with where I'm at in life
If art is still inside I feel it
So take your suitcase, 'cause I don't mind
And I didn't know, all those years ago
You told me not to cry when you were gone
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Without love
So many words for the broken heart
Hello from the outside
I guess you needed more time to heal
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
I've heard it takes some time to get it right
I can change your mind turn it all around
At Mann's Chinese Theatre show
I hurt myself to let the darkness out
Beautiful people everywhere
Love, out the same way in
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing
Now I can't let go of this dream
Now way back when
Mr bones from town said he saw you the other day
I'm still remembering the time
The car to drive right through the shops
And maybe all those secret times
Burning for the true day 
I think I'm gettin' lost for a while
But our love can stretch farther than the eye can see
How there's really no difference in who he was once
This queen of heart's dancing on her throne
"You're safe, child, you are safe" Am I coming
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
Here I am expecting just a little bit
It's unsung and I say
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Did I disappoint you or let you down
All of your failures are training grounds
Maybe the whole thing's wrong
And it's finally quiet in my head
I used to believe love conquers all
I'm ravage like a dog and meat
And no one ever thinks about you
But one was shut all the time
On your face
It's hard to see in a crimson love
Why am I so damaged, girl
By my only things are clear
Is not of my own design
I live in a city sorrow built
I'll take it by your side
I'm a fallen old tree
Don't need prophets or preachers
So fall into my eyes and fall into my lies 
Then they're speeding away
Because opportunities moved us away 
Forever, always, look to me
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye I think I love you
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Don't try so hard
Well I can't explain why it's not enough, 'cause I gave it all to you
With all these left over feelings of you
When they're under your skin
Have faith that when you call on me
And settle, two kids and a swimming pool
For there's many more tears on the sunrise
And the other side of a loop is a loop
All the glory when He took our place
And now you tryin' to tell me that ur sorry
There's always something getting through
Mirror, mirror, where's the crystal palace
That brought my heart to a stop
The man who could make you sure he was the one
And the fog comes up
Cannonball off the porch side
I think I'll start it over
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
Stay well away from trouble that you caused
I just didn't get busted
Like I used to watch you sleep
That you are my night sky
All my plans fell through my hands;
I don't mind where you come from, as long as you come to me
It's letting people in
Inventing lovers on the phone
What the hell am I doin' right
The wrong incline 
One by one they come and go
That would show you
You won't talk me into it next time,
And so my child and I came to this place
Most of what I remember makes me sure
And so it's crying on my shingles
All gone and it goes on and on,
Apparently nothing
When I dial the telephone
Or are we ashes and wine
Tell me if you want me to lie
Why did you deceive me
I don't have to pay for this shit
If we hadn't been there in the first place
Did I get too close in the pouring rain
Woke up and for the first time the animals were gone
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
I'll make everything all right
The only way to live was drown the hate
Your heart is unobtainable
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
The concrete looks too thin to break my fall
She kept all of her pain locked away
So many men no one needs
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Will I know when it's finally done
The snow is really piling up outside
And I'm pushed into the deep end
Baby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at all
Baby, help me mend my, this ol' broken heart
I was crazy thinking you were mine
After time, after time
And making love was just for fun
Or we'll skateboard your ass push people
I laugh a lot so my friends won't know
Drew talks to me
Go or go ahead
Like we've known each other forever
And I'm closer than I've ever been before
And the dregs of my bed
Gonna rise to the occasion yeah
But I, must carry on
I'm not sure all these people understand
The hell out of this town
Your mind aches
That I've been dying for something real
She's not trying to go against all them
I really need to know
You could be the one I'll always love
Don't you dare look back
"It's the atrocities of your story
I'll move back down
Walk around this town like we own the streets
With your head upon my chest
Why I turned out the way I did
Another son who never had
As you come off all concerned
Oh god help his fate
Maybe I was too pale
And I realise there's something wrong
Staring at my picture book
It's been such a long time
And a light that won't shine in the darkness 
I guess I should
I've been walking in the same way as I did
To read the signs more carefully
You can see my broken heart
This thing is slowly taking me apart
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
You took your coat off, stood in the rain
Sing me a love song
We could go back to New York
There's music on a station
I'm missing your bed
Lightning on the river and you're shivering
I think it's time we move on now
And the light's always red in the rearview
Well, You measured no one that I've ever known
And I know I'm dead on the surface
I only wanna make things right yeah, yeah,
The light of the moon 
Her eyes like windows trickelin' rain
My mouth is dry
And fall into my arms
I was a camera until I went blind
But it's time I gotta say goodbye
Tell me to stay, oh why
She lives by the wall and waits by the door
It was almost too bright to see 
For to fill up your soul
In Detroit with the Nashville tears
Tryin'a find my way some way, oh I, oh I, oh I
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
I'll just sit and stare at my deep blue walls,
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
Turn my head, turn my head
We might as well be strangers in another town
And It's to much for me today
I just want to feel free
Look in her eyes
I don't have much in my life
You say that "things change, my dear"
Never seen the light
It was the hope of all we might have been
It's four AM and I can't sleep
And with a sound like white magic caught in a black car's blazing trail
Paid for by the allies, so invest
You thought we'd be fine
Awkward silence is on the other end
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
You never really can fix a heart
They stole his phone, he never got home
My mom, she cared for him
The game looks easy, that's why it sells
I think I need a new town
Your face don't look like before
You made her think, maybe, I wasn't so dumb
Leaves us plastered to a bed of hairs
If I was walking through a sad art gallery
We're better off this way
Oogie knew there's never ever time
When you left last night 
Your crazy thoughts and dreams
I can breathe fresh air
Have no fear
Is there some better place I could be heading towards
"Bo bo, you need prayer"
My weakness caused you pain 
Probably mindless dreaming
And everywhere I turn
To leave it, believe it
This tide never turns,' you said
I thought I was just the guy
And someone's little girl is taken from the world tonight
So don't come back for me, don't come back at all
I was your fortress
I live in a trailer home with a snowmobile, my car
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If you're all done like you said you'd be
The reason you don't live
Ready for today
And at sweet night, you are my own
No paranoia, careful to all animals
I'll wait by the backstage door
Never thought I'd get any higher Never thought you'd fuck with my brain
Will frequently check credit at moral bank hole in wall
May it hold you through the winter of a long night
And drive around a faster car
And left her with an invitation to the blues
Tell me a story
Nothing's changing anyway
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And my life is starting over again
And I fell apart
Found your writing on my wall
I hate me for breathing without you
I am not your friend, I'm not your lover
I won't need any help to be lonely when you leave me
Tomorrow is a different day
The only rattling cages are her own
He's never coming back
Ich mag die Ruhe hier zwischen all den Bäumen
I tried to call you from the party
And if you're sleeping I'm with you
I get along but the trips always feel so long
Well, I only wanna make things right
I just want to dance in your tangles
'Cause I know you care
You remember it all
Try to have fun in the meantime
Before too long you'll be a memory
It�s last call, last song, last dance
Will you say to me a little rain's gonna come
From my window 
"I feel you pulling back
And from the first, to the last time, the signs
You know I love ya
It's only gonna end in tears, baby yeah
Give me all Whatever you want
And my voice gets thin
Love to be with a brother of mine, how he'd love to find
You'll be a real good listener, you'll be honest, you'll be brave
Instead of run in place,
So I'll check the weather wherever you are
But nights like this
Jumped in the river, what did I see
Sweet Sunday morning, all by myself
postponed, at the first showing
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
I'm not gonna break down and call you up when my heart cries out for you
Will you sleep tonight, will you think of me
A snowflake falls in may
Put me in the hole, a thousand times again
While he stands tall and walking proud
And I picture this corpse on the M hearse
I'm growing old and I wanna go home, I'm growing old and I don't wanna know
But you're not feelin' it at all
I wonder how you decorate your room
And I swear to God by Christmas time
It's who we are
To make it all right
It's always had that ghost who always almost
There's a feelin'
Ultraviolence In my linen and curls
Whatever you say, it's alright
You philosophies on art, Baroque moved you, you loved Mozart 
Little bit of love
Gonna make you like the way they talk
And now all your love is wasted
For months on end I've had my doubts
When they're holding you
When things go wrong
Trying to make you smile
Talk to the man with the reasons why,
Our hands will not be taught to hold another's,
I'm sorry I can't be perfect
Now let me die
A lie I didn't have to tell
I'm gonna dream about the time when I'm with you
He lives in California, too
We've come a long way from where we began
You grew up and you sparkled, but why don't you care
That's the one, Oy
For so many years
Overhead
But I'm always alone
But you still have all of me
And homey there he just front and pretend
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
And sometimes I forgive,
Through the cleansing fire
I won't kill myself trying to stay in your life
Always keep me close
Listening to the song we used to sing
Well, in the dark we're just air
Inside my heart
Hey you, things aren't what they seem
Contrast and compare
I can't help but start
Everything
She find pictures in my email
I'm gonna miss you girl
But right now but right now 
'Cause it was on a hidden bit that nobody else could see
It was wild
As each descending peak on the LCD
You could be happy, I hope you are
This is a battle and it's your final last call
But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms
You turned your light off
Take a holiday in Spain
Still small, small voice of calm
You are my only one
I'm longing for love and the logical
Who has said that my sayings were wrong
You wonder if she might be single, she's alone and likes to mingle
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
To the point where I can take no more 
A young boy's died
Those days are gone
Oh, I believe in yesterday
So we can stay like this forever new stitches
Came to this world by caesarian section
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
Something vague that we're not seeing
I know that it is freezing, but I think we have to walk
I stood in front of her face
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know,
And you'll be just a man
So I could be your friend again
Went over the sea,
Each grain carefully wrapped up
The ribbon was crimson
From inside his mouth, I lick the scars
I'm standing here outside your door
Wish I'd died instead of lived
And expose all the lies
Oh, how I need a hand in mine to feel
I only read one page and then put it away
The streets are silent like my lifeless telephone 
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way
And I creep in, everything's loud
Everything I wanted to be
Then you could see the view
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right
All my rights are everyone's enemy
It's ahead of me
To see everything looks the same
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night 
Every night I feel you burning
And please tell me you'll stay
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
Gonna sing it to everyone
Lazy sun, your eyes catch the light
I never did find my way back
You've been looking for someone to believe in
But I am dead and gone and lying in a church ground
But I'm still waiting in line
Loose the taste for kissing
As the curtain comes down I feel that this is just goodbye for now
We could possibly do was right
My head's a carousel of pictures
Now I'm a policeman directing traffic
Last night I felt
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh
What did I do to deserve
At any given moment,
Out in the streets just tempting fate
This house, it holds nothing but the memories
No more can I say
"Love is watching someone die"
And the traffic stops for miles
Begging you Don't I love you
Your softly spoken words
Just your skin against the window
And if you call
They're picking on you still
We would do anything to end what you're going through
I feel you changing shape"
All we can do is keep breathing now
Now you've seen his face
In the darkness I will meet my creators
My friendships
No happy ending
Snare another pill and
But down in your arms, in your arms
You kill me, you've got some nerve but can't face your mistakes hey hey, hey hey
Just makes me wanna cry
And when the stars fall
There was no tomorrow, we'd packed away our sorrows
Faded from the winter
She's at the edge of the bed, she gets in
Because you instantly felt warm
Don't give a damn if you still can't see,
My father's house shines hard and bright it stands like a beacon calling me in the night
'Cause the time I've got's running out
I am covered in skin
What are we gonna do Stand up
Wake up lying in a patch of four leaf clover 
I got nobody on my side
A child of sacrifice, a child of war
So we'll just carry on like always
It all goes wrong, she sets things tragic
Are you dying to believe
It's just lately I've been feeling
Grow up at night
I wish that I had gone up with you too
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper
I'm as open as the door in her house that leads to her room
It's so weird to be back here
But I'm safe inside me here, oh well,
Underneath a winters' moon,
Forever trusting who we are
And when the money comes in for the work I do
And what is past is done and gone
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 
So you better run
There's no heat in this house
Other people think he's not
And Ill let your smile just off and carry me
I am too scared to come out
Then the facts turned me pale
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
I know it's asking for your benediction I know I know
And now I miss everything about you Still you're gone
I've been drawing the line and watching it fall
I know a man, he came from my home town
Something new 
Was it all a waste of time 
But I just want my mind to stay the same
When you walk away is when we really play
Can't do right tonight
And I will give up this fight
More will show up after the bars close
You kill me, you always know the perfect thing to say hey hey, hey hey
Everyday is silent and grey
But I, I live in hope 
It's funny when you find the words to say
Is an elaborate dream
In the steps I'm about to take
I watched you deal in a dying day
Mama, now I'm coming home
Her hands filled up full
Tell me do you really think you go to hell for having loved
How come we've reached this fork in the road
There are objects of affection
And if I'm gonna talk
I wanna feel
Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
I was your amber
Believe in you
That I need to be with you 
She was a very good friend
They seemed so important at the time,
Love the way you're waiting
Because you were not there
The young man stands on the edge of his porch
That I still love you so
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing
It's a mixed up man and I guess that's me
That never left the ground
I go to the window and put down the shade
Call it true, call it true love
I could be the one
If there is anyone who is in the sun
In this forgotten space race under my control 
But by then their heads are gone
Even in death, our love goes on
Ground down, I know that you'll feel fine
Oh grandmother 
It never was the time for us
You could feel me seething
My baby lives in shades of blue
It was the day that he turned on his kids
There's a line drawn, like the lines on her own hand
Just countless mistakes
I can watch the countryside and I can fall asleep
Thinking about poodles and puddles and mistakes
'Cause you are unfixable
That you would never come around
Like a drug in the water
Viva forever, I'll be waiting Melanie C Viva forever
'Cause I think it's time for me to pass
Day one, day one
Conceived on an island in the sun
Still he's not satisfied
All the time we spent
Jed could run or walk, sing or talk and
Sometimes a man gets carried away,
Hoping you're someone I used to know
Need you there when I cry
Glad I'm not a girl in this place, they'll be here till dawn
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
To make it easy, you lie
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
I hate myself and I want to die
Love is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill
And the smiling children tell you that you smell
Never quite knew how to make them believable
If the right thing is revealed
I'm a foolish, fragile spine
And you love to party and have fun
Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed
You're there through my wasted days,
What's the point when my dreams are infected 
And thinking on what you did
Lying on the floor
I've got to live with them rest of my life
I will return here one day
Headlights burning bright ahead of you
You come circling through the light
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
The SFO, the time and price
To go over everything
Man, but don't it make you feel rage
Anger steaming up your glasses, you've been holding parties all your life
I'm bearing a cross, she's turned into my curse
The images stuck in your head
Nothing's going on 'round here
To stare at my starving brain
And never look through me
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
Don't ever go away, ooh, oh, yeah
And I can't stay this mad for long
So come home"
You took the first words that they spoke
Oh 'cause nothing is lost, it's just frozen in frost
And I think I'll want to be alone,
See the children run as the sun goes down
It made me learn to hate you
And I don't need your permission
And underneath it all, the giant was afraid
These children are so hard to raise good
Fridays at 
And we have survived try, try
And baby cries he cries his eyes out
As the plane was touching down
The pain of this slow burn
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
I hope you're finally gone
Just around the corner from you
On a day so gray it's black inside
Everybody but Heaven knows how I was wrong
Tired of getting stoned
And besides this shit is making me tired
"Daddy, where's mommy I can't find mommy, where is she"
Me fighting him, fighting life, fighting dawn,
I remember moments of happiness
So tell me when my silence's over
Into Judy's room 
I'll take one chance without compromise
I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me
I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel 
So you leave me feeling dirty
I'm medicated, how are you
The many ways I've tried
It's not over till it starts again
You wanted good schools and friends with pools
She cried on my shoulder begging please
So come over now and talk me down
I never knew, I never knew
Oh my friend, what time is this
There's so many dreams I've yet to find
With these waves crashing over my head
Never meant to say anything
And I know sometimes you wanna die
There's a place and time for everything I know
Let me steal this moment from you now
For years gone by, and I cried
I feel like the shadows I don't even bother for anymore than that
That people they just ain't no good
Seen your kind so many times
All secrets and lies
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
I'll die in the clouds above and you that I defend I do not love
Her heart is achin' 'cause she wants him home
Bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
Round and round and round and round and round
But never taking off the weights that,
Doll arms
Don't try to fight the storm; you'll tumble overboard
You're there through my wasted years
Hear the garbage truck back down in boulevard
It's time that you won
Give me one good reason not to do it because we love you
Halfway on a slow move
I could stay here all day but that's not how you feel
I'm nothing like what I'd like to be
Up to your place
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
To our love let all the jilted lovers cry
You're not blaming me for anything 
Me, I don't say much
To keep her sorry tongue from any speaking
We lived in Coney Island
And bear my soul
Throws the planets out of line
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
You just can't show me, but God I'm praying
The sun was always in her eyes
How can we go forward into something we're not sure of
In fact, they follow me
Walked away again
Ooh And now it's time for you to go
I heard all you said don't say anything
I feel the beating of your heart
Burn your fire for no witness, it's the only way it's done
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
I just dance on the harpsichord string
And I hold a record for being patient
Kept you sleeping and even, and I didn't believe them
Low, it's not my call
I am feeling very warm right now
I was born to tell you I love you
Bedroom wounds  lovers like brigadiers
What you thought this song meant 
What's so easy in the evening, by the morning's such a drag
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
You are missing in my heart
Please remember me happily
I can use my tears to
I just get a bit scared,
And just dance, and just drink,
Time will never change it, no, no, no
Broken bodies at my feet
Would I could afford to buy my love a fine robe
To the day that marks that you're not here;
Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
With the Alexander boy
No one feels the pain I have inside
Let you down 'cause we were the special two, and will be again
She will measure and break like a habit
Fuck money, live up and get free y'all
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
As the dawn began to break, I had to surrender
And there are days when I'm losing my faith
And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free
I make believe that I have a new life
And I won't be far from where you are if ever you should call
It took everything you had, but you finally broke my
Never been alone as such
Did you know that I was sleeping
The sands of time were falling
And I am racing out on the desert plains all night
She looks like the real thing
I'll sellotape them up
You're on your own my little nightmare, you cannot stay here
You love me for who I am
Highway warm sing silent poetry
It's too close to home
Everything's plastic, nothing's real push people
At a ceiling full of stars
The days were endless
Saying sorry, we've fallen apart
Try to kill it all away
Today I saw my father standing in the graveyard
Stand in the mirror, you look the same
You'll be free, child, once you have died
But you won't miss nothing
And when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed
I got baby to pound me
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
Who they are again
'Cause you wanna say good night
Some degrading song of praise 
I could be another fool or an exception to the rule You tell me the morning after
House were nobody lives
Just how sweet it could be
And a runon piece of mountain trembles, shivers, runs down the freeway
Don't let me get carried away
Build a nest for us to sleep in here, you know it's real
Some people said
Feel as low as you feel right now
And I hope when you think of me years down the line
I fell asleep on a late night train
I don't care if it hurts
Come and take a walk on the wild side
I'll carry you in my arms
I'm sick of this life 
I've broken all my promises to you
I try to stay busy
I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I hitched a ride with my soul by the side of the road
She could see the world and its foolish ways
Sits down by the fire
See the changes, people's faces blurred out
I've always been in love with
Red light special at the mausoleum
And he's back again
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
This is my life support, shutting down, for the final time
This is because I can spell confusion with a K 
And our echo starts to fade
Never ending kind of run around
That I would be good, even if I was clingy
You've got to understand it's a hard life
Half underwater
Even if you cannot hear my voice
But I can't bear to listen to ya cry
I cherish you, my dear country
It's no cause for concern
In the corner of your eye
How's it going to be, when you find out there was nothing
The sea would electrocute us all
The road it winds, it twists, it turns, oh my stomach burns
I was embarrassed by its honesty
That I would be good, even if I did nothing
Shared my body and my life with you
Flowers and the love in my arms
Have I still got you to be my open door
As the neighbors said she moved away
So many mistakes
I can't live if living is without you
She says that long ago
I can't believe you didn't call
She takes you in with her crying eyes
Visions born in the dreams
I got scared by just how hard I fell
Unfamiliar brand falls from an empty shelf,
The way we used to scream and shout
And please remember me as in the dream
To handle every day
I had a really bad dream
Press my face to the ground
Could have loved you all my life
Ur tellin' me you really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
New York cares
And it's not a cry you can hear at night
I'm gonna be the man who's workin' hard for you
Besides, we can't believe without bleeding
You haven't spoken or looked at her in all that time
If I'm lookin' for somethin' it's probably a fight
Now highways turn to tidal waves
Could we learn to live right
Start to weep, then say goodbye
Drifting, drowning in a purple sea of doubt
To look through panes of shaded glass
I live with are numberless
Make room for the prey
Bought a mantra to concentrate
So stop chasing the past 
Something inside that was always denied Bye bye
He doesn't stir so easily these days
Sleight of hand
In this seaside town,
Started making his way past two in the morning
So many nights I cried myself to sleep
I haven't made half the mistakes that you've listed so far
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
Can't you see my walls are crumbling
And I hold you and I kiss you
That tells of how the seedlings feel
Nothing I know changes me at all
When I'm faced with the knowledge
That nothing's going to change, not for me and you
Burning in the corner is the only one
Watching history unfold
The fact that I'll die
Nothing is taking me down, down, down
All my limbs can become trees
They're not home to find us out
Ain't a love that's perfect 
Payne county line
I try to keep the house nice an' neat
I'll take a great big whiskey to ya anyway
Breaking the waves
No I would not change a thing
I'll see you on the other side
And through the life force and there goes her friend;
And so I ask you, please
Their sun is our sun
Nothing like I did before
Our bodies moved and hardened
And the waiting is the hardest thing to take
Baby boy I'm staying here
I've slept alone before you
And baby you're just movin' on
Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
The wheels of life they turn without me
Another walk, another dance with him,
Give it all away, just to have somewhere to go to
Inside your precious heart
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Stones taught me to fly
These drunken hours  graces deflowered 
I don't care no I wouldn't dare, to fix the twist in you
That anyone here will be thinking in modern ways
Up close the sound remains the same
Who I was before
You don't know if I care, you tryin' to find the proof
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
In the classroom, you were teachin'
All the cards begin to stack up,
You can take it away
With the magic of our eyes
And I've seen something you probably never got a chance to see
I went out back and I got my gun
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
This lonely little love dog
So swallow the knife
And so where does my heart
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring
What you crying about
And the night grows pale
In ths river 
I don't know where they are
In my Busby Berkeley dreams
We were born and raised in a summer haze
You're not sorry, no, no, no, no
Never meant to cause you no pain baby, yeah
Joey will come to while away your hours
Like the other girls, Jenny Wren took wing
I think about the little things that make life great
Couldn't see that I was blind
Through troubled times
And sell some gifts that I got
Do you brush your teeth before you kiss
Lighting up the stage trying to get a deal
Whisper secrets to the wind
It's the wrong time for somebody new
And I will never forgotten
With tears in your eyes,
Lost on journeys we walked on
Still don't know what love means
These are
Ahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah everything changed me
This dream you've ridden on turns your world to explosions
I'm coming home to my sweet mother love
And I walked the sea forevermore
On the Northern side is a Fife of mine
So why'd you have to lie
One sweet day
Your voice is small and fading
Hold on, hold on no, no, no, no, no
While I wait all night, for you in California
I'll make it without you tonight
Forget this life
Drape your arms around me and softly say
, people, all jumping out their seat
Around, broken in two
Probably end up a drifter and lonely
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
Or living inside of my skin
Around you now
Do come and find me
Well we'll all come back
Darkness, darkness everywhere, do you feel alone
I watch you grow away from me in photographs
To the devil's water
And found that there were none
And every step I take, I stay in the same place
Please, please tell me what they looked like
The needle and the thread Won't stitch, won't stitch us
You feel the need to find some answers
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar
Mourning our way home
I have decided to leave you forever
Stones to throw at my Creator
I can't tell you anything you don't already know
I am not for you one
You think I was scared yeah 
Your talking is just noise and won't lay me down 
When you get what you want but not what you need
So many things I would have done
In one of your lies
Always seem to get the wrong date
That I will understand someday
In all the things you see
'Cause the names you drop
As I'm leaving, she wakes up and says
Or brake with the ones you've followed
Don't call, don't call
"Isn't something missing"
Kept crying out
Always felt I was outside, looking in on you
Breathe you out, breathe you in
Shake what your mama gave you
Is the man that you fear
The times when we would play about
I knew the odds were I'd never win
And all the time you were tellin' me lies
As if we are pure in the reign of our contentment
They're stinging my eyes, no tears
Love is kind
She packed her bags and turned right away
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Well now I guess I should've listened
I wanna live life, always be true
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
But I thought that this meant something more than broken hearts and new addictions
I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I would be happy with just one minute in your arms
I'm like a junkie tying off for the last time
To give my love and repay debts
Show me the meaning of being lonely Being lonely
I love you more than I have
When they call out your name
There's nothing I won't do
I will light a match this morning so I won't be alone
I'll be right beside you, dear
That'll make me hater your name forever
The only failed experiments
Do you know that when you look at me, it is a salvation
Her eyes are basking in the sun
Cut this picture into you and me
And the vibe is feeling strong
You're not just a memory
I'm putting back together my heart,
I guess I'm guilty spreading thin with my love
I have walked these streets so long
Ev'ry day I lean on a lamp post
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
As a man I ain't never been much for sunny days
Was a junky, went in debt into his arms, it's sad
That's curdling the blood they found on you
You didn't have the time
'Cause this hurts deeper than I thought it did
Why you can't raise your voice to say
And I'll carry you home
Oh, unrequited love
You're falling, you're screaming
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And taking time to save himself
Sometimes I feel so insecure
Noone told us about the laws of the land
Now that we're apart
People from a time when he was everything he's supposed to be
As long as I need to
I've got to tell you so
Frightened of the dark
But its time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays
Like a father to impress
I'm backsliding
I'm waiting for blood to flow to my fingers
And I will walk on water
So before I end my day Remember
Lonely, lonely that is me
Że ty łatwo tak zgodziłaś na to się i
Lie here on the floor
Someone to share your regrets
Every time the sun comes up I'm in trouble
I only want to be a relief
Back when I was a child
Don't want to go on and speak now of what's gone by
They ain't gonna change
And we tend the garden all day long
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
Ain't life great
Honestly I know where you're goin'
The love The waves you made will always be
To never let that right be denied
Turn your back on a payyouback, last call
Nothing prepared me for your smile
And even though you're gone
Where are you now
Last time
And Amie come sit on my wall 
Dreams cover much time
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
I never said I was perfect
I try to just smile
Those were the days
Remember how it was
I've a bunch of purple flowers
If there's a soulmate for everyone
Love is good and love is mine
Spin this flammable paper on the film's that my life
Your baby won't be near you anymore
And it all became the world we know
I see signs now all the time
That is the kind of girl I am 
But that's life, it's so "soso"
Too many times
And now there's no way back
You're sorry, you swear it, you're done
To live a love, you gotta be part of
Don't be a fool, make it easier
He says, "When you gonna make up your mind
Ghosts with just voices
Oh, But I was wrong
Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody,
In my big dreams 
And now I'm wasting
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
You will look for me and I'll be gone
It'll make your life a lie
You know the words so sing along for me baby
I remember the time you sat and told me
Yeah, still
Never look her in the eyes
A black sheep boy dissolves
Then the stalks begin to sway
On the day that you were born
Light will fill our eyes like cats
I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
Just because you got yourself in some shit
I'd give my heart as an offering
You know I plan to retire some day
They will stay here forever
When will this winter end
Be careful not to let the bedbugs sleep tight, nestled in the covers
Look in my eyes
I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road
So come home
The wicked are vultures
She asked the pisspoor "Why you lookin' for that
Celebration guns
I've lost the best friend that I ever had
But I'm still around
Can make everything alright
I sing it while
The skyline is swinging
Two will love you so much
And come up with poetic lines
Who'd never close both his eyes
I couldn't change, though I wanted to
The man with the foolish grin
And their kid's not back from that party yet
In my steamer trunk
Lost inside his bedroom
Or shot up on the block and your mom
Wanna tell you that you'll be all right
If you're going out with someone new
But please, don't take the girl
I could do with some fresh air
Is it cruel or kind not to speak my mind
And I don't think they'll ever go away;
All of the days have passed us by
Watching the lights go down
Unlock the door
Just one more and I'll walk away
As we moved together in the dark
All I ever say now is goodbye
Even if I think that you are right
Then I start to doubt myself
In the light from the dashboard
You stay out drinking late at the bar
And I'm hoping that you'll say
Fell face down didn't help my brain out
Who am I to say this situation isn't great 
I will follow you and see you on the other side
mis dias sin ti son solo un eco
The god of love preparing to depart
Someone like you, someone like me
And this awkward kiss that screams of other people's lips
I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin
Nothing and nobody's gonna do me any harm
O can you hear the song of thunder
I'll be a friend and a fuckup
That nothing is as scary as election day
I'm going away for a while
Weep not for paths left alone
As I'm feeling my way through the dark
But when you tell them my name
She hadn't been a virgin and he hadn't been a god
I remember it well, there was wet in your hair
To the sea 
I think about the places I'd go
Do you cry, do you pray, do you wish them away
If you ever feel loved or needed
I needed to leave this trade and just heave it away
It comes to me in fragments, even those still split in two
Even if I make a sound
I'd always hoped for better
And I don't want to cry my whole life through
And take me to my home
Out of this place
Of course it's long gone down, you're still hanging around
How can I feel something if I just don't know how to feel
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
I'm gonna see a priest, a Rabbi and a Protestant clergyman,
I dreamed just last night
You wouldn't be here right here, you wouldn't be here for me, no, no, no, no
This year's love had better last
And I knew that my last lines were gone
I'm inside your mouth now
Rather waste my time with you 
'Cause what about, what about angels
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not
There's only tears
Here come the tears
Sometimes ignorance
Adia, I do believe I failed you
I know that you'd stay
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
You'll close your eyes and see me
Everything turned out so wrong
And wait for the lights to go out
You and all your pieces made me come,
And spaceboy, I've missed you
Something as good 
I get to go home in one week, but I'm leaving home in three weeks
So don't be fooled
I'm sorry that you have to see
The absence of God will bring you comfort, baby
And we're out here in space
But at the time it didn't mean a thing
I started looking and the bubble burst
So a love is lost, a love is won
Its starting to hit me
Swallows fall in a wave and tap on his window with their beaks
And will you wake up by my side
See, the sea wants to take me
A long walk home on Friday night
I don't wanna be here alone, ooh
I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore
Years down the line
This time she won't understand
Where in the world have you gone now
And as we say our long goodbyes
'Cause I can't hold on to anything this good enough
Tried to get by on bread and water
So I could see you see me sincerely yelling back
Staring back from the mirror's a face that you don't recognize 
'Cause I can't face the evening straight
We could go back to Woodstock
That rises from the shoes on my feet
Being tonight
Something I can believe in now
Right here like a storm left over 
The weather warmer he is colder
Fifteen years gone now, I still cling to the petticoat
Try to find a light on somewhere
She looks down at the ground
I want to take you home
Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonely
And though I said my hands were tied
Your hair is on fire
I never thought that they'd mean everything to me
Thought that maybe I'd really love bein' alone
Who are we
Someone found and gave away
Now, Brenda's gotta make her own way
The things that you needed to have
As we sleep among the dead
By some wave and end up on your own
Nothing stays the same
You know, some things in life may change
Take the very, breath you gave me, take the heart from my chest
Following me in my desperate endeavor
I want you to watch cartoons with me  HeMan, Voltron and Hong Kong Phooey
These miles have torn us worlds apart
But now you can't even recall
But I'm scared I'll get scared, and I swear I'll try to never give up
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
Just bend the pieces till they fit
Ice in my eyes, and eyes like ice don't move
I think you'd better find your place
It weighs too much this time
Seeing you cry it makes feel like saying sorry
Some things take so long
There's always an end to it
The quiet corners off this town, and I
When I find myself in times of trouble, mother Mary comes to me,
To prove you still feel  
No hope, no harm
Do they all look like mine
But then they were only kids
Cracked up years behind me
And it's your final last call 
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
And you are constantly surrounded by the swirling stream
Still loving what's gone
I've got this life 
John said he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
Graving dreams
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
Everybody knows his name
When I think of all my sorrow
All about our lives
Run 'way from your grave
He bore the mark of pride
I guess I'll find out in seventeen days
So we can do just one more thing
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired 
I feel like a shadow, I feel like a shadow
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
I'll leave my window open,
I'm not the road that you think when you lookin' for a short cut
Mama tried to wash their faces
And the light of God
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
And that's when goodbye should be farewell
Caught me listening to water dripping
But I can't place her
Waiting on a brand new day
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
Breeze still carries the sound 
And I see no chance of release
Come with me my love
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
Here is my unopened letter to a world
Time's not your friend
Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting
When the world gets in your way
Get a little bit of bourbon in ya
I'm a new baby weeping
I will breathe in a moment 
But I could never love again
The life may leave my lungs
Was the best time
Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
When I stand here taking every breath with you, oohooh
They're hip to it, man, they're in the groove
With the things you could do
Close to mine
Now there's no time to start anew
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
On a rusty side
It's so weird to be back here
Returns no more, 
I wait my turn
After the storm
No more breath inside
It's so hard to say goodbye
But honestly, won't someone stop this train
No no, I think it's more like a ghost
So I'll Lay here with you till the final goodbye
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
my days without you are only an echo, 
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
All your secret wishes could right now be coming true
There on your face 
To breathe this air
There's got to be something that would be worthwhile for me to give to you
Still agreed to disagree
I have seen water, it's water, that's all
It's turning around, it's up to me
Amongst the vending machines and yearold magazines
My life's a circus, circus round in circles, I'm selling out tonight
Assumed you'd always be there always be there
With sadness so real that it populates
Hello helicopter, have you heard the news
I'll just use your simple name
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
Dare to believe
I'm only a man looking for a dream
Sing a sad song in a lonely place
It's only fools they make these rules
We picked our way down to the beach
Sorry Sorry, but I can't just go turn off how I feel feel
Never cared for what they do, no
Let me put on a show
I'm jaded now, whatever that means
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
Her mother does her best to console her
What I'm tryin' to say here is not worth, it's not worth your time
While you try to find the lines to speak your mind
Nothing compares to you
In a way you could say, I was always a cynic
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
Don't you think we should have learned somehow
Unkiss me, untouch me, untear this heart
I'll be right there 
It's impossible to expand, when you never get a second chance
Maybe you'll rest sometime
I know I'm a man, I know I'm a man
We will keep it alight together
On my soul
Possibly maybe probably love
I am still right here
I used to live at home, now I stay at the house
Now that I turn
Is there sunlight on your bed
While the world waits for an explosion
When you come around and telling me I changed
I can't remember how to
She had a mind to make
Just to feel like you're okay
To say goodbye
Love me love me love me love
Hand over heart, I'm praying
And now he's guiltstricken, sobbin' with his head on the floor
All the trembling sweetness
Can't breathe too well
Still a little bit delirious
Rather waste some time with you time with you
Just to say goodbye, say goodbye 
I was like a gun
Oh, I'm alone
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
And darker and darker it goes
I'm in too deep and the wheels keep spinnin' 'round
Tell me, is it really worth remembering
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
Shredding him to bits
Looking to score a good time
Get me a room at the Squire, the filling station's hiring
From the back of your big brown eyes
With you dozen a day
Yeah, every time the sun comes up I'm in trouble
Your actions speak much louder than words
Don't throw your hand, oh no
C'mon, angel
These are the contents of my head
Freak my selfish out, my mind is happy
The strength inside me burning
And we can mourn its passing and then bury it in snow
All the words you write
So come on, tell me, is this the end
I've been here, silent all these years
But you don't need my pictures on your wall,
I got a job that pays all our bills
These days I don't have much to say to you
Then I let the darkness cover me
Oh, my babe, at least we tried, oh
Reaching out for your hand
And the calm weight of all things summer
Against the wall
Bringing it back all so clear
Baby up ahead,
And right as rain, I'm not the same but I feel the same, I feel nothing
Never feeling love like that
si alguna aparece
Won't let this build up inside of me
If I had a bill for all the philosophies I shared
And our bodies are tired, our shadows will dance
My selfworth measured in text back tempo
While moving across my land
Forever I'll fight
I never tried to feel
And I know you are gonna be just fine
To call in sick and late at work
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
It's  on Monday afternoon
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
But still they lead me back
I sometimes wish I'd stayed inside
Wishing I could hold you tight
I said I'd never leave you'll never change
Precious friend of mine
If only time could just turn back
Never have I loved since then
Should I feel fright
Angels will call on me and take me to my home 
You made it out alive, oh what a relief
But we can't read between the line
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
The boys you left are men you didn't raise
Even though I'm the sacrifice,
My love Where would I be without you, Glo
Your words just disappear
You already know the story, the chords are just the same
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
In love with her or so it seems, he's dancing with my beauty queen
Funny how I'm nervous still, I've always been the easy kill
Too deaf, dumb and blind to see the damage I've done
The city and leaves you homeless again
Is it time to let it fly
Oh rejoice, his eyes are big X's
In the smokefilled world
And trees without leaves and notes that don't ring 
They come and leave you behind someone else's face
We go home
I swear I didn't mean
And spit your pity in my soul
So I'll notice some grave thing
And I didn't get to say goodbye
And things sorta start reminding me
How fast time passed by
But at the same time, I don't
Send photo to address, is it you and me
To have and forever hold 
About my world and when you came,
To understand where it begins or ends or what it means to be dead
Maybe something's wrong with me
Surrender
Everybody knows where that is
'Cause you're all I'll ever need
Speak through these walls
I got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity
Three thousand five hundred miles away,
Where lonely angels sing you to your sleep
I say thank you
She looks right at you and bolts
Bright and early for their daily races
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
And in the morning I'll be with you
They say that time, will make all this go away
Will be of service to keeping you away
That I don't feel you or recall, I'll put your bones out in the yard
All the mamas and the papas
Never say a word
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Personal things
I'll try and try, until I die, to make you understand
Pulling my world down
Leave me alone a little while
Sometimes there's no one left to tell you the truth
I thought we'd leave this for ourselves a hundred times before
Fell off the hay bales I'm over the rainbows
I gotta stop pretending who we are
I turn to you and I let you know
Still it's so much clearer
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
All I have in life
I really don�t know what I have to fear
Some liar I loved to control"
Will you say to them when I'm gone
I even learned how to use the washin' machine
And there's nothing there for you to prove
The water's clear
A boy and dog with a clubbed foot
I was dressed in wine
I don't need them
Seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
Now I've gone and lost the best baby that I ever had
Home now, end of the night
So many nights, legs tangled tight
I think I'll save suicide for another year
And the friends I won't now make
To lift the sun into the sky
I loved and adored 
Don't go away,
All winter
You are my sweetest downfall
I can't be there, that's all you had to say to me was
How long I'll stay 
I got a taste of paradise
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
My favorite food and my birthday
Kristy, are you doing okay
And I'm falling over
'Build your castle, stop throwing stones
Though it all looks different now
Lately I've been feeling like a falling bomb
My hand doesn't shake
Seen through 'em all, seen through most everything
I'm just tired of counting bodies
Where is the road I follow
The strangest twist upon your lips
In case it is the last time
Fighting for the lives of her children
And maybe you never need more than that
And a tear from your eye brings me home 
So stay home
I go to school and I run and play
Ain't no use in you trying
Like it was meant to be
Fifteen years gone now, I still wail from these catacombs
I'm one of many, one is blue
And fly away to somewhere new
Has her leash and a face
Now I notice the streetlamp's hum 
And the fight for you is all I've ever known
I let go, there's just no one, no one like you
The sweetness
I never thought I would just
It's forevermore that I wait
So many lifeless, empty hands,
I know you're lonely
I believe in medication 
I want to be still
But some are altogether mighty
Hit 'em off with that dark brown,
You making me lose pay, a social worker's here everyday
A dying man in a living room
And I rise to turn it off 'cause all I'm seeing is her face, age eight
The only thing I want to believe
And as I climb into an empty bed
I promise you
And then I fell down yelling, "Make it go away"
Daughter to father, daughter to father
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you
They were cryin' to the camera
I am the one who haunts your we are the resin
On a big town avenue
He and I had something beautiful
And trust just don't come easy
There are worse ways for a guy to spend his time
I needed you more, we wanted us less
I'm in heaven, I'm a god
And you told me you were scared
Our heads full of thoughts
I've looked in the attic, the cellar and hall
What have I got to do to make you love me
But the world may not have many years
Holding you, holding you, holding you
My love GLORIA is love ooh
I got an attitude of need,
Travelin' around sure gets me down and lonely
I'm sorry to go
I guess you're as real as me
I was glad I could give you a smile
Brace myself to hear the lies
Greed's all gone now, there's no question
Not tonight my love
I remember it well, I was stood in your line
This place is gassed by fear
Only love can save us now
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
I need a raincoat,
Where was I
I pick up, put down the phone, like your favorite Heatmiser song goes
This is the part of me that means nothing
From the sheer weight of my shame
Arm wrestle your mother simply over
If only I could try
Melt in me one more time
Try and try and try
You never needed any help
Antiseptic and tired, I can't remember your face
She was calling around to find half an hour
We could rest and remain here, easily
The city's been dead 
I was wondering if after all these years
In the ballroom of my mind
Never thought not having you here now
If that's dead, then the head
Just remembering, just remembering how we were
And it's one more day up in the canyons
I'm falling in love again
A place that we can share
Never thought I'd have to retire Never thought I'd have to abstain
You take the fall in sacrifice
Had to wake up face reality
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
No one survives, no one survives
But you still kept your hand over my mouth
Or do I make you mine,
Maybe in time
I know you cut me loose from contradiction I know I'm all wrapped up in sweet attrition
A beach resort under a year of rain,
In every way
All I need to make it real is one more reason
I really do love you
Tomorrow reminds me just where
To pull me up, take the pain
'Cause you got no one to listen, you got no one to call
Yeah, throw me tomorrow oh, oh
That I was Thursday's Child
Teach a man to fish, you feed him now for life
Now I'm breaking down your door
The colour of blood, I'd say
You trouble me
This is why I am lying when I say
And left an empty shell of me
And it was always horribly convenient and happening too fast
It's only the air you took and the breath you left
Everybody knows
But what would you change if you could
To say my last goodbye
I just told the biggest lie
And when I pass the bottle back to Pete
But once we're gone, who's gonna care
So where are the strong
My clothes won't let me close the door
Just try not to worry, you'll see us someday
Oh to the head
If I say look away
"Kiss me goodbye
And all that followed fell like mercury to hell
And it's too late To scream, how long is the night
Already somebody's baby
Sometimes, I can almost feel the power
It's a simple suggestion, can you give me some time
And you loved sunset strip when it sparkled
Contempt loves the silence
No words could explain, no actions determine
Like falling angels, the world disappeared
So you slept in a stocking cap and wool scarf
Drive all night to hold you tight 
So I'm done whispering, done whispering
Well, all I ever did was look up to you
Sweet words that I want to give you
From absorbing everything
So you got in a kind of trouble that nobody knows
I can just look up
'Cause my angel, she don't receive my calls
I think you need
I just wish that you still were mine
Over little things the way I do
I'll be all that you need in life
Me a messenger man
Her legs around me, in the morning I cried
To the person that you were, and I will do the same
The scars run deep inside this tattooed body
With me at your side
Ada, I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall
Our whole lives laid out right in front of us,
I can feel their blue hands touching me
The garbage men were emptying the dumpsters,
I was the light from the lamp on the floor
I'm a word that no one ever wants to say
I saw a rabbit as slick as a knife and as pale as a candlestick
Someone else you know always is
Red, blue, green
Seal my heart and break my pride
And blind him with your kindness
I beg for just one more tomorrow
And we sing this morning that wonderful and grand old message
In the arms of an angel
She said nothing
But it's just a roller coaster anyway, yeah
I needed a break when your book about dreams was taken,
That you're gone away
You say that you're stuck in a pale blue dream
I've been havin' mine
Next time I'll be braver
Tell her that we love her
Beyond the door, there's peace I'm sure
All ambition 
I know this room I have walked this floor
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
Tell me what's wrong with my brain
You wanna hear she loves you
Her skin is white,
I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
She lives in my blood and skin
You were here, that somebody's me
The way the light hits your eyes
When it was dark, I called and you came
I am no gentleman, I can be a prick
It was all so different then
And the hand of the watchman
I've done something so terrible
Everything I've learned
I just hang around and eat from a can
In the death cell a single note rings on and on and on
You see, I know a few of your favorite things
And a little trouble makes it worth the going
And I could live, I could die
When I was sure you'd follow through
And though you've break my heart
But a brokendown jalopy of a man I left behind
All the pretty faces and sorry words
Please don't go crazy if I tell you the truth
There's a little child
Oohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohooh
Oh, why you got to be mean now
The mirror when I'm on my own
Dangling before my eyes
I thought we'd be flying together
Still not over you
I feel like a fool
Don't leave home again
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me
Crawling underneath my skin
I swear that I can go on forever again
The boy I'm dreaming of
And they're all missing out, yeah they're all missing out
If you'll just consider thiseven if it don't make sense
And I listen I'm heading out tonight
Safe and warm
I saw that day
Showing you all the cards
'Cause we both know what it's like to be alone 
I got so, got so
Just another chance so that I can show
Well thank you, it was a real blast
You can take away all these words
All those special times I spent with you, my love
What has happened to love	
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing
They're mopping up the butcher's floor
And I swerve out of control
I've got a flask inside my pocket, we can share it on the train
Waiting for the call
I hope that you can hear me
That everything
I never needed words, I never needed hurt,
Gone through days
Is it fast enough so we can fly away
Seasons stormy weather
All those sorrys, there's a million reasons why
And you don't hear a single floor board creak
If I should believe
I see the shadows of your face
Your fingernails go dragging down the wall
Of guilt and shame all over me 
No longer needed here so where do we go
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Good morning, son
Shoes keep sticking to the ground
As we burn down, as we are found
Maybe there is something that you know that I don't
And put tears on my face
Now it's your time to look after us
I see the moon
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
The universe will have it's way, too powerful to master
I said sometimes I hear my voice
Like my father's come to pass, seven years has gone so fast
I am nothing without their love 
Now you've gone away, further than yesterday
They don't look the same to me 
If you feel like letting go Hold on
You may be flat but you're breathing 
You don't need me back
You, I thought you knew me
Can't close myyou close your eyes
'Cause my day was rough
I need you now it makes me want to cry
As the heavens just increase
And you are only just beginning
After you've caused so much pain
That they can no longer feel love or sex appeal
Can't stay in one place
It's a wonderful time to be here
In a phrase to cut these lips,
Happy people don't give into 
That just can not be controlled
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it
Remember when you lost your shit
If our hearts are never broken and there's no joy in the mending
There's no living in my life anymore
I have seen peace
The days I spent so cold, so hungry,
If that's what you need
Those were the reasons and that was New York
Childhood living is easy to do
Somebody caused me strife
If only I knew what I know today
In strange ideas, we live apart
And catch a plane to Barcelona 'cause this city's a drag
Baby, what about the ending
But he won't call
They were crying when their sons left
You said that you would die for me
But when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
Think back and talk to me
Remind me, how can you stop the rain from falling down
Is filled with holes
Between worlds, so the people ask her
I refuse to let you die
I've been looking for someone to believe in
And then the devil took your memory
What did I do wrong
I go back to December all the time
There is a wound that's always bleeding 
No rowing could outrun
Pull my head level with hers so she might engage in
You're so selfless, cold
RIP Baby, we love you from all
Some people say she's stuckup
But I know what I have done
Just starting to crawl
And please don't drive me blind 
And the problems lie within
Too young to hold on
It didn't get there by itself
It's hard to know that you still care
Undo this hurt that you caused when you walked out the door
Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same
You caress me smoothly
Oh my, where is my mind
How this backward chapter reads
But I hate your guts I want you so much
This anniversary may never be the same
Then she looks up at the building
And I'm too old to dream 
Who sang me into life every day 
Now you're gone
Did you touch them Did you hold them
What you wait for never shows
Can you hear the horses
Well I have nothing
Crashing towards the driver's seat
While you are down on one knee
Lighten up when we can't breathe
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days
In the body of a violin
But we can remember
Take your space and take your reasons
Spending all your time
And the first thing that you want
I saw through your lies
I walk on
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply Never again
Sweet baby, don't cry 
And I won't make it any other way
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
Some day when my crying's done
We can never go home, son
And they can't help me make amends
And in a minute I hear my name and I wake
But baby, I just need one good one
Yeah, he taught me how to hold my tongue
I'll speak my mind, whenever I feel slighted
I'm not the shoulder for a bag, don't wanna carry your heavy load
Someday you will ache like I ache
Didn't let anyone get in 
Without you here there is less to say
I did what I had to
Excuses don't work
In a violent place we can call our country
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
How it's gonna turn out
For your information, there's an inflammation in my tear gland
All the times we spilled our coffees
The ones who couldn't take it
The only thing that never really changed
Good bye my soul, unquote
And when all you want is friends
All night long, all night long
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk
But you've no need to fear it
Just sit still, does it hurt Does it hurt
Paperback scrawl your hidden poems
Go on, lose the gamble That's the history of the trade
All eyes turn hollow
This night's a tragedy, I keep thinking I saw her
Music when the lights come on
Than I was before
Lazy ooh lazy
I felt you calling to me in the gloom
Floating on the body, floating in the Dalles
Ash, and urn, and silence
I want it back 
God please, don't take the girl
I know from the outside
Let me under your skin
Metal heart, you're not hiding
So I drive home alone
They watch their city change
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest, yeahee;
Don't give a damn for your reasons why
And the truth has a habit
Whenever I breathe out, you're breathing it in
When all these nightmares become real
And I'm sorry
Every restless night
So take me to the heavens now
There's no laws or rules to unchain your life
It's a good thing tears never show in the pouring rain
Calling me a fool, saying that I've effed up everything
We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard
I felt people move around me
Fade away and end up nothing at all
To try to hold on
Yeah, I bet you you will You rap about it, yeah, word, kkeep it real
And our bodies crumbling
But out there in the future
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart;
I want blood, guts, and chocolate cake
But everybody says this place is beautiful
And cherish them in parts of me, that savor every kiss
Awake, but cannot open my eyes
She hides in no place
I thought I heard Louis' voice
But if I fall for it again, I would be a fool
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not'a got 'em
It's been stuck there since it came a few nights ago
Take a chance watch it fall, grab too much and lose it all
Did someone's heart break
Before the world fell at our feet
My visions and my dreams, I cross all my fingers
Once I was a soldier
Oohooh, darling, oh love, come on
And the night never ends
Under a sky that knows no stars
I was a liar, I gave into the fire;
It's all just a dream, man, it's all just a dream
And I'd die for the truth
Sunrise and set are the same to me
Or how I am worn to the bone
That we'd already lost each other, we both knew that the end was near
Their tears are filling up their glasses
Gentle moon
When you'd hide your songs would die
Heart pain
Johnny, don't point that gun at me
We'll get some jewelry for your momma
In the blue part of the evening
I'm much too old to break free and run
While everyone is sleeping
Lift my hands, my eyes are still
No I can't stand the pain 
Made an angel in the snow
Creo que alguna vez fui infiel, 
I can't believe what I do late at night
It was exactly there
I loved her then and I guess I love her still
Sounding only at night as you sleep
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
I tried to stay away, just in case
In my tangled state of mind
I can hardly hear you say
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Give your life
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after  am
Leave me dreaming on the bed
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
I gotta think about what I wanna say
Possibly maybe, possibly maybe, possibly maybe
Inside this weary head I just want us to love instead
For my land locked blues
How I love you
I'm feeling so lonely
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
I won't always live in my regrets
I would have told her then, she was the only thing
In a failed attempt on blue
They stoned it with rocks till it collapsed in the reeds
Say something sweet
So you can try and live in darkness but you will never shake the light
My head is twisted severe, body's rushing everywhere,
And I'll put 'em in a letter
The sun is out and up and down again
I saw my reflection in my father's final tears
Still I rattled your bones
Frank Ocean and Mr Hudson
I won't cover my head in the dark
If we don't move together, just come closer
Well, Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die
The test results tell you nothing at all,
"I didn't want to tell you this,
Your cardinal eyes
Apron strings around my neck
Oh my heart, don't break the promise
Do you remember the way
Ohooh
One more time  I promise after that, I'll let you go
I hope it's already too late
Never was much of a romantic
She would change everything for happy ever after
Later on the bed
Still tryin'a find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I
To get back what was taken away
These are my snow covered dreams
Take a good look at me now 
Well today is grey skies,
The neon lights make me calm
Did I say that I want to
Mother made In the shadows will to become their pride
And it's hard at the end of the day
Vom goldenen Balkon
Tell him how I feel
Don't give you what you need
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
I wanna start this over again 
I hate it
I was trying to make it home through the forest before the darkness falls
Find it in your heart
Taking out the trash to the man
Oh, when she calls, I do not walk, I run
When my life went pear
That I'm the one you'll hold forever
See, honey, I am not some broken thing
And I miss you since you went out for that walk
With the pictures of your mother
She was all right, 'cause the sea was so tight
You never felt this way
A lock of hair you said would prove
Acting like nothing's wrong, yeah
And there never was
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
This unholy notion of the mythic power of love
A song that became the world we know
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
But some things a girl can never forget
It's disrespectful how you've handled this
And the train ain't even left the station
Something is glowing
Just smile all the time
I'll keep out of your way
Wish I were capable of lying sometimes
She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide
When you lose something you can't replace
And I, I got you down
Be mine
And if all I ever did was let, let you down
So search for an excuse
Your heart is not open, so I must go
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
Like I did before
One more night, I dreamed it was a good one
I won't let the shadows take their toll
And you appear just like a dream
When I need a thrill
I stand there for a minute, starin' straight into the ground
I run as fast as I can run
When she loved me
I need your love to hold me up
I've been dying inside you see
She would change everything, for happy ever after
I've got your letter, you've got my song
Blackeyed angels swam with me
Like an inferno we shone rays
Told me when I was young
If you don't have it you're on the other side
She doesn't know how bad she messed me up
In things that are ephemeral
I have seen fear
You make me real But now it's just a matter of grace
Our clocks are ticking now so before our time is gone
It's made of dreams that didn't come true
Backhand, role reversal
So I lay my head back down
And I watched from my window
'Cause we lost it all, nothing lasts forever
And we should spend some time apart for both our sakes
I've wished on the lidded blue flames
Stay by my side
Could you stay, my love
And find a place we both could hide 
You broke the rules but I should have known you do it all the time
my days without you are an excess, 
No stone unturned
In the one life that we've got
But I don't really mind, I've got much more than that
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
Does he sing to all your music
Rejoice, rejoice
I like to believe it was all about love for a child
I'm the hero of the story, don't need to be saved
Pray for me child
Your mother was born in December,
Gonna walk, walk, walk four more blocks plus the one in my brain
I often wonder what it feels like to be you
The pieces are only as good as the whole
I can't take my mind
I thought I could live in your arms
Daddy, please don't cry
How I hope I'll suit you someday
I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
She was so young with such innocent eyes
This is a song about the scary things you see from the corner of your eye
If I treated you bad, you'd bruise my face
Don't be afraid to cry at what you see
Am I still in your head
You spin around me like a dream 
Where is the dream for which I paid dearly
She's thrown back hostaged
Now I'm alone again, where do I begin
No light will touch your face again
On you I depend
For you to find you love me, and tell me so
I love you I love you I love you I love you
She's fallen from grace, she's all over the place Yeah yeah
But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Straight to the back of my skull
Poison oak some boyhood bravery
Is having We didn't know it was wrong
My sister called me just the other day
And feel the world turn round
But I talk in the mirror to the stranger that appears,
It's not the end 
I've spent ten years singing gravity away
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way
How did it break
That the inevitable end was near
Once said, always said, I will hold the past over your head
We woke up one morning and fell a little further down
Then the nurse comes round
We dry soil, heartmill
Shshshshshshame
He smashed it with a telephone
Burn my knees and
I don't know where else I can go, mother
To tell you I'm sorry
When a telephone was a tin can on a string
Better things to do without
Someone is showing
He's more than a man
'Cause you were always there for me
Babe, boy I'm gonna drink you in
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling X
But may be the only way
I won't try to change your mind
The moon is rising, a revolution
Your name like ice into my heart
And I can still hear her last goodbyes
Maybe on the rainbow
I used to pretend
Well I'm far too old to care about that now
I bite my nails for days and hours
The seasons are positive, negative, positive, negative
Clocks will carry on
Wish I was too dead to care
I don't wanna change, I wanna stay right where I lay
I know you've got your part
You crying, tragic waste of skin
Without love it ain't nothin'
In the corner
That it may seem unfair
Even if I come back, even if I die
Well sir, it's the first time I've felt like something is mine
Tongues on the sockets of electric dreams 
"Don't stop this train
I got dressed, and to that house I did ride from out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light
And all the people who've seen it all before
To the next plan soul remain
And you will be changed and everything
The sun has fallen down
And now it's happening in mine
That I loved you more
And you think I need some discipline well I've had my share 
Isn't everything wonderful
There's nothing simple
And when I come home, yeah I know I'm gonna be
Drop me a line and tell me how the hell you are
Round and round and round and round and
Was losing all my friends
We want this like everyone else
Would turn to flesh with teeth of pearl
The seasons bring change,
Will he make you feel like you're invincible
Hands on my mouth
Held acquaintance with the waves
So this is where you are, and this is where I've been
You come wasted
Throwing it all away
Oh, why is everything so confusing
They tie me to their wooden chair
And I close the door
Someone else's atrocious stories
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
The rivers carve out your hollows
At night when the stars light up my room
But I remembered
On a redeye flight to another world
What are you talking about, variety Hostages
It was a quarter past four
I want to know the things you did that we do too
The memories of your devotion
Dry house, wet clothes
Her father would come to her in the night
Static to the sound of you and I
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got
And the everyday geezers' stares throw me off balance
Better call all the guys on the deck; they've been caught with no feeling
'Cause really, it's what I need
Gonna send 'em on their way
How long have I been in this storm
I was gone
It's just us my love 
Will you still love me when I shine
When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
Wait on the porch till you come back home
But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight
But if by chance you're here alone
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know
Leave my wings behind me
And I'm taking all of your memories off the shelf
Lonely, lonely that is you
Why's the message pending where the fuck are ya
I haven't hung out with anyone, if I did I'd have nothing to say
Once upon a summer's day they went walking to the woods
Loved and adored from day one
They say that the captain
Did I drive you away
Trees are giving up
Ask her to dance
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Which many others struggled to believe
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Saying I'm sorry
But it's calm under the waves, in the blue of my oblivion
You can throw away all these letters
Cause something goes on once again
Don't worry, you won't die alone 
To wash over Georgia and kill the hurt
The words we spoke on freezing South street,
Dear God the only thing I ask of you
And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days
On repeat Caravan and we danced around the room
I hope it's worth all the wait
Angels might call by 
There is a better world
Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn
So there's nothing of yours to hold or to talk to
Thought that you would stay forever with me
Your eyes are green, your hair is gold
Though I'd die to know you love me,
Lying beside you as cold as a statue your hands are still warm
And before we knew it was too late
The stupid bastard's gonna have his way with you 
I hope it bleeds all day long
A brand new morning shines
It's too late to apologize, yeah,
Rest assured your love is pure
It's the getting to the point that is the hardest part
And though an autumn time lullaby
All my dreams, it suddenly seems, it suddenly seems
You make me think of someone wonderful
The little wet tears on your baby's shoulder
Not where the black coach
And if you say something that you might even mean
When busy streets amess with 
And thinkin' 'bout you in the night
She's the one that makes me fall
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
Me and my heart
And please remember me at Halloween
I'm just a tired man, no words to say
Now the man of the hour is taking his final bow
As you're walking away
And she stared at the world
You're there through my wasted years,
I can't feel your heartbeat
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Smile, smile
You're home"
I guess she spent her last quarter randomly
He put a cloth on their lips
You're the only one I wish I could forget
Piss pools in your seat
'Cause when the sun goes down
Somebody threw that brick
But if I ever needed you
You were like home to me
Lemme be your downfall, baby"
People digging through rubble for things they can resell
The boy from Seoul was hanging on good
When your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue
Oh you silly stupid pastime of mine
I'm so tired of singing all the sad songs in my head
Their old friends and I've seen through 'em all
I've made the change,
Oh I think I've forgotten her now
The tears have stained all the pages
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
Play dead dear, it's your only hope of pulling through
Been dreaming of this, so long
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
As the day you were taken away
Girls when they fall
But those are just a long lost memory of mine
No need to worry
Same old boy, same sweet girl, ten years down the road
But of all these friends and lovers
Senior year here in Mahwah
Just another step until I reach the door
How I feel
Underneath a winters' sky,
In a dark room we fight, make up for our love
Standing there in the graveyard while the moon sprays it's fireworks in your hair
She put her fingers in the imprints
I'll remember to love
Love is good and love is blind
My love My friend
You said you saw it coming, but you didn't see nothing
I'm not the table you can come and lay your cup down on now
Then you'd be right too
But I guess we're always leaving even when we look the same
In the sky
I wish my smile was your favourite kind of smile
Even though she sleeps upon your satin;
I can't forget that you once were mine
I can't even breathe
But we sure make it feel like we're together
And I know all the steps, 
All I hear is the sound
And then told me not to fire it
They steal the gravity, yeah
The storm is coming but I don't mind
Watching you run
You just didn't care
And you made an island of me
I've found I always move too slowly
Far and away where they took you down
I love it when you read to me
With closed eyes
What if you could look right through the cracks
He lives for love, for women, too
Inside I hope you know I'm dying 
There ain't nobody, who can show you how
They stain their mouths with blood
In search of destination
And we're moving slow, our hearts beat so fast
One day she stiffened, took the other side
But I just let love go to waste
I need your strength
I've locked up tightly I must say I've had my doubts
Don't you love the girls, ladies
With you 'cause you're leavin'
Just a perfect day
The windows rattling in the gales
Better off as the fool
Smoke is rising from the houses
I don't ever tell you how I really feel,
Better call the head nurse, wrap us up, to throw us in the dark
Come on I need it, oh
And these flowers will always die'
He talks about you in his sleep
The tour was over, we'd survived
And every time you smiled
My head is a jungle, jungle
And the snow had turned to rain
Well I, just see the sky
The night goes on 
Adding up hours till her demise, she counts herself to sleep
Knocking on that door that says,
I could barely see her face
Erupt again; ignore the pill, and I won't let it show
I just think it's time for me to go away
And, yes, you just run to him
Yeah, things could be so much worse
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"
They're gonna break your heart, yeah
The waking up is the hardest part
I'm halfway home now
Was I too young to see this with my eyes
Baby I'm a house on fire
Make you tired, tell you lies, make you fall
That's the way that you feel
That borders your back yard
Larry tap let you in through the back 
And you may case the grounds
Only reason I come around is for the
And drink the cold away
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
All I wanted was a kickabout in the park
I'm gonna stop wasting time
I do remember the swing in your step
That won't dry for many years
You can hold on but I wouldn't waste your time
I guess the love we once had
Pray now, baby
I always wait to hear you
Or did someone do someone wrong
I see you walking hand in hand with longhaired drummer of the band
Of the day
Stay with me, baby stay
I get a coffee and the paper, have my own conversations
I would do at this moment
I need a plane ride,
On the hood of your car
And I will bear my soul in time
'Cause you have friends
Black heart, crawling its way
Her life was stole Stole, stole
Tears form behind my eyes
Oh we knew it was over
I never trust my feelings
All we are is too fast for love
All you need is love is a lie cause
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven
Black heart, sweeping over the land
I hope you're as happy as you're pretending
I love no one
You couldn't ever love me more
But I promise mama's gon' be alright
You don't know you're guilty anyway
I'm weightless I'm bare
Why can't we talk it over
And shot me 'cause I died
I just need
Heal her soul
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby
And I can do nothing without his permission, that wasn't part of the plan
They laid his body down in a church yard
I've lived my life without regret
Then what are we doing here
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad ha ha
You will always be a loser
Can we help you find the peace and the star
Run with the wild horses
'Cause all of the stars are fading away
But somewhere out there across the moonlit sands
Everything led back to you
How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow
So come on, come on
Honey can you hear me in between
Just a few last hours, we gotta make this count
I will remember you
Well I move all directions, to the corners and the outskirts
He'd kill ten thousand people
So if you're out there barely hangin' on
And now I break to the floor when the old piano comes crashing
No one laughing at God in a hospital
That I would be great if I was no longer queen
They were only scratching their heads
As blue as your eyes
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed
I just have to let you know how I feel
Down by the people if they let you breathe
So won't you be kind to me
And from two suns spinning
Your hair was long when we first met
Screens my words but I will hear them
No, we couldn't care less
It was February  Valentines Day
Too dumb to fight, too dumb to save
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Get out of my bed
Everything we had, everything we had
And I won't tell the lie"
In the garden Snake was a charmin' 
To be played by your dark, twisted games
Without a care
Old friends I never visit, I remember what they're like
Well I walk in the air between the rain
That our memories depend
Searching for light in the darkness of insanity
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
When all the things she said
When I hear our song
And all I gave you was "Goodbye"
It's easier said than done
I could fly you away with me
Began the night believing
Or lie to yourself
Force the darkness unto me
Thems the breaks for we designer fakes
I didn't know what I was doing
Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair
Sunshine, been keeping me up for days
And she was listening to the sound of heavens shaking
You will be numb and blue
Watching all the world in war torn
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on
And I waited a long, long time
I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them,
Tear the skin off your nose and you've got nothing to be grateful for 
I put my heart in your hands
I will sleep another day 
I don't get many things right the first time
I'd tune into some friendly voices
You turn to rocks and omen
Got no place to call your home
That mean enough to me You're right
In your heart there's a spark that just screams for a lover to bring
I tell you that I'll always want you near
I'm wasting my young years
In the morning in the window
Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow, goodye for now
Nothing gets so bad
Take a piece of the sunshine with me
The water's cold so cold
Almost nothing
That's the whole and that's the part of it
The colder water
The needle tears a hole
A dream for the blind
Oh rejoice, his arms are burning witches
Do it all over again, it's always the same
A little blubber in my igloo, yeah
Just have to move the bats out of your head
To tear the world in two
Are somehow out of our control
You're headed for disaster
If living is without you
But something about it felt like home somehow
My hands have got
We should go into town and spend some money
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
You never got there even though you say you will
And that's the reason
And I know a woman, became a wife
Of my aching heart
Be the one, be the one
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a rollercoaster ride
I guess that's love I can't pretend
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
You were supposed to return
The times have changed and I will now move over slowly
And when you smile
Are taking hold
Can't feel nothing
What did you whisper in my ear
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And still I feel I said too much
Kick the door
'Cause I know you're somewhere out there right now
And this house just ain't no home
Wish I could recklessly love
You can take away everything leave me lying on the floor
I won't sit outside your house
They do right now
You keep going over every word that we've said
I wrote this for a baby
Clouding the truth, both of us knew
Like the feeling of what he needs
I hope you don't understand
In a dream, I saw you walkin'
It's been so lonely without you here
before our parents send for us
Drift away instead
But five or six bring you out to the car
You can tell anybody
Just to lead my way
I can't be as sorry as you think I should
Let me fly away with you
Jackie left on a cold, dark night
I may be viciously unkind
At the face you don't recognize
The palm trees swaying in the wind
There's nothing left
Oh I hate myself, and I feel crazy
But I don't believe you, baby
And sorry that you're the one she got
And pause it at our favorite parts
It's easier to be apart
All because I've fallen for
When I called you, you little one
I just had to come back one last time
He fought them all the way though
At dead of night, when strangers roam
The phantom is inside
With a trumpet or a train,
Crop circles in the carpet
My intentions, were full of pride
Give a little, a little fistful of love
To think I might not see those eyes
Because of me 
Like a last breath you would breathe
Of when we had just started things
And now we're stuck on rewind
But darling bless your soul
I feel like the breeze will pick me up and carry me away 
This is the last song I will ever sing
Well I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
How can a loser ever win
This can't be the end
In the moment
Won't you do this for me, dearest darkness
I can't believe I still want you
Is it too late To heal, how long is the night
Then you wonder why they haven't called
In an moment more before we break
I wear black on the outside
But there's no way you can feel it from so far away, yeah
And never read a single word
Bitter is the kiss that says goodbye
Leave me in the rain
Another floor, another ceiling
I'll breathe again
You show up like a hurricane
And believe who you are
And each line is sent I have found a new pages
Now the road is out before me
Lookin' back every at the day
I wanna hold hands with you
I don't have to pay for this shit
Ever dies
Long nights without you have taught me to be strong
I walked away and grew old
I've reached the end of the road
Decided to end it all
They were kids that I once knew
And when I see you, I really see you upside down
Can't change my mind
But nobody wins
How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends
I can love you desperately, though your love ain't guaranteed
This pain is just too real
There was a time I thought I'd die
Remember once upon a time
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Someday my pain
Inside today
How does he feel
At night I trip without you, and hope I don't wake up
Maybe it's time to stop swimming
Talking it out the last hour
I can't sleep here
Nothing real love can't undo
Drowns the startup chime inside your heart,
I was just calling to see how you were doing, you sounded really uptight last night, it made me a little nervous, and well it made me nervous that it sounded like you were nervous, too
I'm lacking in imagination he said hello
And you won't guess what he's done" 
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
In this hole that we have fixed 
As I drift away far away from you,
Do you feel
By the way my hands were shaking
Running from the voices filling up my brain
I keep going right back
You always said I should hedge my bets
I'm thinking hard about all the things I've been dreaming
still i keep waiting that you'll return to me, 
And we pray that they turn to seeds, to roots and then grass
Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And such was life in Leningrad
And I brought home fresh meat for you
In her sleep she dreams of winter
You don't know who you are, but you know who you wanna be
And I wanna see 'em go down in the river where they go
With so much hate,
You can take everything I have
Pretty Mary K took him back to town
Talking dirty for a hobby that's alright
To write about all of these faded things
And you've lost your way
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
We don't have time for that
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
No one was saved
Don't be scared it's over now, I swear
I can do whatever pleases me
How I needed you
Take his hand in mine
They want to feel the bulges in their pants start to rise
Prostitute found slain, and Brenda's her name
What makes a house grand
Did you close your eyes as you walked away
Run away from me baby, run away Look at ya
It's the one that you'll remember
Can't pretend
Where the grass is greener and the sky is always blue
But I forget which door I came through
Angels have no thought of
Our love would never die
Catskilled mansions, buried dreams
I see in blue
No one can lift the damn thing
Lost my job and lost my room
Everybody looking at you, here, take hold of my hand
Trees keep fallin' at my feet
I tell myself too many times
Now all you gotta do's remind me that we met
All your life
So, who am I to say this situation isn't great 
You forget where the heart is
But I didn't feed you to the cops
Casting shadows on my screen
But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Do you still care
'Cause it's all right, all right to see a ghost
A moment of bliss that we hold
Shaking hands with other men
Don't need no roads
About me and all my dreams lost at sea
But she don't want to go outside tonight
I don't wanna be without you babe
And there's plenty of things to do on his dime
But I am working, oh, so hard
I promise you I will bring you home
Well I did my best
And take it from someone who's been where you're at
Well, I did my time in the jail of your arms
He prays for love, he prays for peace, and maybe someone new
Think back to this time last year
Take heart, sweetheart, or I will take it from you
Take away leaf falls short
It's not that I love someone else
I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven
Or let this heart be still
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
The time will never come to say goodbye
So I can see my baby when I leave, this world
As I am soaring I'm one with the wind
To let me dream of you
But you had me and I loved it
Put them back together, do it all for love
Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
Il faut oublier
For my troubles are few
Passionate bright young things
What if I got it wrong
The sky turns black
Before you put my body in the cold ground
And you could tell that I was nervous so you held my hand
Some may say a dream
As far as I know you're still alive
But I don't believe, I don't believe
I show you all the beauty you possess
I regret my past
My heart is open to you
Since the stars predicted something new would reconnect our worlds
Who will you love What's love when you've hurt
Was making Russian children glad
You ran away you're all the same
But life without death is just impossible
I wanna kick these blues away
That this life would be good
No one around
A bit for you, a bit for everyone
I'd like for the whole world to hear
You gave in, you gave out, outlived your dream of youth
It's just to close to the heart
Lover, you should've come over
I've been aching, aching for you, my love
Cool your aching head
The day breaks and everything is new
And I don't get no change,
But a mother's love for her son
And everyone call it
Sometimes I wonder why that meek guy got all the fame,
To see the earth through painted eyes
We can turn this ditch into a well
He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
Take the plan, spin it sideways
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through, again
But I don't see and I don't feel
Stretched across my shame
And the day will come, when you'll get away from it
Maybe I misunderstood
Her eyes are underneath the ground
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child
I got years to wait around for you
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out
To get you out my mind
The hazards of love, the hazards of love
These manic gulls scream it's okay
Where the darkness does fall so fast, it feels like some kind of mistake
There's one thing I wanna know
Don't back down, concentrate on seeing
And children lived in Leningrad
It's so hard to say that I'm sorry
A black eyed dog
Down in your car, out by the pier
I'm gonna make you a star
All the livelong day
Lately, I've been tryin' to fight whatever's pulling us under
So baby, how can I forget your love
That fell at the bottom of the road
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Sometimes is all I feel up to now
I give you my hand 
And I've one more night
Into the fire
And I pray in you're the one I build my home with
The rivers from your eyes
Are you happy out there in this great wide world
Don't it look that way
And you dropped the note and we changed key
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail
You see I never thought enough of myself
To the lighthouse my friend
And you don't need to bother
It looks as though you're letting go
In this vicious world
Come back to the
Fifteen years gone now, still a wastrel mésallied
There's nothing you can say
Thunder and lightning won't change what I'm feelin'
My old heart, it's been thirteen hours
And the moon's laying low in the sky
I can't compare to nothing
So grab me while we still have the time
Nothing left to do
The sorrowful Midwest
Once my ignorance was bliss
Among the fields of gold
This is the sound of someone losing the plot
But that's all I need
I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day
There's nothing left inside of here
When they open up she's lookin' down at her feet
Can't even rest when the sun's down
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
And he often remembered how it used to be
Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
It all sort of looks familiar
Have I still got you to be my sandy shore
I never had the gift of holding on to you
Stay up for the fight
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
And the sky was a woman's arms
When I was three, and free to explore
Danny is lonely, 'cause Mary's in India now;
There is no reason 
Lord, show me the way
The whining ghost
I didn't know
To read the signs carefully
In hot cream, in sweet moans
That long black cloud is comin' down
Your eyes look low
I'd do anything to be at your side
Everyone I'll never meet
Pick up her dirty clothes
I will try to understand
Only bones
You could be my unintended
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
But clouds got in my way
The wind, moon, the earth, the sky
Didn't care though anyway
In this day and age, a man has to have choices
And our beauty surely gone
Over worlds, fly but won't tire
We don't know the meaning of
As she falls around me
I thought we'd be happy together
Along with everything that was lost and won
You gave us someplace to go
But the moment's magic swept us away
'Cause I know I've got to say
You best prepare a speech
And know the stars are
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
Oh my heart is frozen still
Sweaty hands and my foot in the appropriate place
Remain your funny valentine 
But we're done if we're undone 
She tastes like the real thing
But in junior high she moved away from here
On a faulty camera in our minds
And all the memories of the pubs, and the clubs, and the drugs, and the tubs
I remember the sound
I leave a kiss on your answering machine
Truly disappointed
Say there's a last kiss
The night's gone
You slipped away
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
I need a miracle someone to help me help myself
What the fuck is your name
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
My eyes are rolling back, I'm rubbing my thighs with my hand
Well you saw for yourself, the way it played out
For all that you've done and still do still do
But my love, don't fade away
Be my shrink for the hour
Hang your head in shame and cry your life away
When I got home, heard the phone,
I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
You will look for me you will look for me
Never tell the one you want
Take me to the finish line
Hush, hush, darlin'
And dreaming of just having a man
But it's alright, why don't you tell my friend
If you want to know what makes me sad
Say goodbye to yesterday
Drunk on immorality
Didn't mean, didn't mean to leave you stranded
And this solitary moment makes me want to come back home
Now he's turning off
To see how we're ending
My life's a circus, circus round in circles, selling out tonight
Before the lights turn on, yeah and you're left alone
And I will always remember you
You broke my mother's heart
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all, feel free y'all, it's unique y'all
Nothing to begin with
We'll start talking again
Whirl around me, dance eternal
His body's too young to look like his
The edge of the bed
I reach to hold you, but I don't feel you there, do you
I want to be the girl with the most cake
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me
But finally, it's mine
But damn Sam I love a woman that's blue
Ooh, what a waste of all that
And I claim I'm not excited with my life anymore
You know there's a better way for you and me to be
Well, it's  o'clock on Monday morning
I said somebody's got to take care of him
Can you promise me if this was right
Now I don't know what to be without you around
You are pulled from the wreckage
Yeah, you got me
Didn't need me to give him hell
There'll be someone else to hold you
"Why why why are you letting me go" she says
I ask and you smile
She's still calling around to find half an hour
Will be destined to remember
I could still fall in love with you
Won't disturb the peace on distant stars
From all of the tears you have shed
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
Sit down and talk a while"
It was the moment she took on his name
Face upon your happy home
But please remember me fondly
I can drive on that road forever
I've got a dying urge to feel the way you do
I need help and you're way across the sea
All but one and don't you even try
Till I find my Jackie ooh,
Gleam and resonate just like the gates
There's room at the top, they are telling you still
I don't mind catching up
I pretend to try
And the strays are pining for their unrequited mothers
Everywhere I look you're all I see
Before long, they waste away
From this dark cold hotel room
Lili, easy as a kiss we'll find an answer
Wait for the crying
Take another face, you will be kissed again
And I live my life, and have friends around
One hand on the trigger of a telephone
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
But this time I as I and not as we
The ghost of your smile was seen on a body in the park
Suddenly I'm so incomplete, yeah
Fresh fuel for the sodium flares
Back and forth, it's like the weather
And they'll do anything
But so dysfunctional, it couldn't last
And the truth that's in the message
I'm ready for my sun to
And when I'm lonely, well I know I'm gonna be
Samson came to my bed
Saying goodbyes the hardest part
My friend, she told me such a story
That you're no fun
And I know it ain't fair, but we just don't care
We'd share a popcorn and we can go to the pub at night
I know people change and these things happen
Our love is strong 
I heard your wrists got bruised
Desert wind
No hope or love or glory
I wait for the postman to bring me a letter
And there you are on your knees
When it ends
Waves of steel hurled metal at the sky
Before you destroyed my life
You saw a highway down in New Orleans
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Are you feeling, feeling okay baby
And caring what I do with them
I've been wadering 'round
Some of it is just transcendental,
Don't it just make you want to cry
Let forever
And you got less, and it hurt
I had it all, but I let it slip away
I want to break your heart
And in your heart
And everything that you do makes me want to die
In oceans of this tragic part of town
So pleased with a daydream that now living is no good
All around this place every night and
Well, we've all made out predictions but the truth still isn't out
I'm in the city you hated
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
Louis ran forward from the line
And cover me from the sun
And by that honor had your own restored 
A heart that's harder than stone
I hear the crowd count down till the bomb gets dropped
And how can you mend a broken heart
We're strangers in an empty space
And then who the hell was I
Your crazy kitten smile
Fill these spaces up with days
Something more like a feeling
It'll drain the power that's in you
After all these years wrestling gators 
My love for you was strong enough you should've known
Won't you look down upon me Jesus
You know the one I bought you in phoenix
For I am the parasite of this town
Mama's little baby better get herself in
In the end I will find some peace inside
This time next year, we'll be no more, yeah
Wild and free, I can feel the sun
Under my skin sodium pentathol
Ground had arose and passed its knees
And I'm on my way back down again
You know the words so sing along for me baby
And maybe rely on me
Fallen angels flown away
'Cause she was touching her face
There is no room for promotions out here
You had changed your mind
Were gonna live our lives
Go on and try to tear me down
Yeah, you slither away like the snake that you are
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
And warred with yourself
The earth is warm next to my ear
Finding a way to let go
A heart floats in the bay
I will see you in my dream
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
A burned out world you know
I thought you were my boyfriend
You seemed ashamed, ashamed that I was
And no flags wave me home
Now that the hour hand has landed at the end
Voodoo smile, Siamese twins
So many times,
Been working at the convenience store
Are you feeling lost and lonely
And you don't miss a thing
You don't have to love me for me
I took a drive in my car
So you thought that getting sober
With what I wanna say but
Can't think, can't sleep
I told you everything, you know my feelings
After a silent, peaceful night
My body turns and yearns for a sleep
I'm not weeping because you won't be here to hold my hand
We, too, feel alone
My body turns and yearns for a sleep that won't ever come
I thought it less like a lake
And she shatters like broken glass
I didn't go to work for a month, I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
It's a day that I can't stand
I've been living out of this here
Would rather die than have to touch you"
'Twas Halloween and the ghosts were out
But without you around I feel nothing but cold
Mary's got the same size hands Same size hands
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
Do you lie
The day news came my best friend died
Till yesterday is here
The Northern Lights are just a band for hire,
Break my fall in vain
I've been waiting all this time,
My world was turned to blue so thin
So one last touch and then you'll go
Like a bird without a song
And take my hand to feel the pull, the quicksand
When life was just a game
All I want in life's a little bit of love to take
Still wanna go
For the days when we smiled
But you just smiled like a bank teller
The sound of loneliness makes me happier
Now when the wind blows you cover your tooth
Rocking Chair 
Later in the dark
There's clothes all over my floor
I made it die
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
You have been the one for me
I don't see lightning like last fall
As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost
Should have been a rock star
Just do what you're gotta do
I'm lookin' for a place
This time I want it all
But if you take a ride with them you may not come back alive
And then I get, a scary thought
I see stars and go weak
Or maybe were the same
Hard done by you
I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
To chase your demons away
Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face
Uhhuh yeah
There is nothing to save
Was always tangled up in knots
And would he be stronger than his father
"Kiss me goodbye"
That you'll come in with the rain
'Cause I was filled with poison
Darkness falling, leaves nowhere to move
Some things always stay the same 
On my face
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Could you please, just once, just hear me
You'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so high 
Nights alone by your side
And now my head's hurting, you say I always get my own way
And the waves came and stole him and took him to war
Still trying to get to you
We couldn't win in the end 
Can't bear the stare of your teary eyes
Don't hold yourself like that
I'll ignore when you call
Curling up inside my private tortures
From a distance I can entertain
And I've still got me to keep you warm
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
I say
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
I'm gonna love you 'til this ends
To the way that things are going
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Now the music divides us into tribes
For somebody else to understand
I see one pair that I recognize
It must have hurt your pride
The best parts of lonely
Your heaven's invention, steeleyed vampires of love
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
And I'm here to stay
The joke we always knew
Gonna make you like the way they lie
I loved you and I should have said it
Even when the sun comes up I'm in trouble
Baby, we can talk all night
There was no tomorrows, and we'd packed away our sorrows
I miss my mother; I miss it when
Butterfly, early summer
Heart and soul, I will
For making circles and telling lies
I always needed time on my own
Words fall through me
These are the best that I
I hear them scream, I hear them fight
I've been twisting and turning
I've looked at love that way
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
Then you would recall the deadly houses you grew up in
I am a bird girl now 
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Thinking oh that, baby, I was wrong
Thought you'd be looking for the next in line to love
And walk away,
Can take anything I like
Is it destruction that you require to feel
Is that alright with you
Electric fences and guns
The city looks so nice from here
Well you know there's a snowstorm
Come and spend the night
The bed is unmade like everything is
Don't drag my love around volcanoes melt me down
Saw an evil emperor wearing my clothes
All the way down to the lake,
I hope you find what you're looking for
Memories made in the coldest winter, winter
Can't believe it's over
A rush of blood to the head
All of the silence after the tears
Human in all our ways and all of pain
Somebody's go to stay
We buried our love 
But oh Medusa kiss me and crucify
But they won't show
Every time the sun comes up I see double
Take me out of this world
Without my wings, I feel so small 
As I play the part of a saint on my knees
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
Just for a while
Here we are face to face with the memories that can't be erased;
Everything I want is free
Shine a light on my life
Long haul, sentence carried out
I hope that I have a place in your heart too
And no one has the key
So sad it ends as it began
I was born to love
Laugh about in front of family
What could I say
This song's your letter
So the years went by
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
You cried but no one came
Now what will it take to feel right
Sure my belly's tingling a bit, somethings happening I'm sure
You're the breath that blows these cool winds 'round
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
In a bed of all our clothes
Don't you know she's got a I know I know
But I know how you feel, I know how you feel, when no one cares
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it
I was feeling sad
Eyes wet toward
I, don't know how I feel when I'm around you
A bag over his face
And another day God will give her some
And she took it for a holiday
Incompatible, it don't matter though
I'll Reach up and hold their tails 
But you're still spitting fire
To pass the time in my room alone
The days go by and nothing brings me joy
With warm summer eyes that flickered like fireflies,
They've been looking for you
You stood alone in the halo's haze
and your tearin up your photos cause you wanna forget it's over
Where were my senses
Breathe, keep breathing
Thank you for this bitter knowledge
You leave my life, I'm better off dead
Is that why they call me a sullen girl  sullen girl
Eve is the apple of my eye 
She'd wanna kiss you all the time
So we got nothing to lose
Light that might give up the way
It's the first day
The way you bit off my head
In the blackest of rooms
And the flames burned away
You never talk, we never smile, I scream "You're nothing"
He's come so far to find no truth
He is shaking and dancing in her bat mouth
Because I whistle to a different tune
It's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing
If she knows you're paper
For the love of the crowd and three cheers from everyone
Who will save the war child baby
Life carries on and on, and on
It's like a car crash happening on my street
The future may be all I really need
Picking apples for the kings and queens of things I've never seen
But when I'm around you still I lose control
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
"How I dearly wish I was not here"
So pour another glass of wine
Besides
Like the surface of the moon
And everyone else, all of the others
Everything you intended to say
I ain't about to die like this
And then there was light, was sound, was matter
If I died tomorrow would this song live on forever
As you fall out of your clothes
See no use perfecting lives with strangers
Hearts are broken every day
I don't know who your boyfriend is
But if you want, I'll try to love again
But man I feel silly in that dim light
I've seen that road before
It's not how it was supposed to be
I know they're rested and ready
I used to live alone before I knew you
Tried letting go but you're still the only one
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
Look out young son
And love dies in your eyes,
I'm at the mercy of the ghost
I don't mind repeating
As soon as you're born, they make you feel small
I'm lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
From then on it was turpentine and patches
Whoa, oh, yeah,
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
These days are so much colder
I'll see you on the other side 
They're all full of shit
Tiring of trying 
I know that I love you but let me just say
I almost forgot it was twilight
I'm gonna make it right
Ask me should we try again
But she's out with her answerphone
Under your skin
And how can it matter Ohohohoh
So colourfullyseethroughhead before
Somewhere along in the bitterness
When will it start to
I'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son, you ain't lookin' at free
But I need a last breath
And crashed along the way
Only one of you
I need you like water in my lungs
With a hairbrush and an air brush
I slip concealed back to the keep
This is the countdown; they say our time is running out
One, two, three days that I've been sleeping on my side
The worst of it now, I can't remember your face
Sometimes late at night while running from the rain
I still see your reflection inside of my eyes
To lay you down in clover bed
Just try not to worry, you'll see them someday
To cousin, kindred, kith or kin or she'll end up dead
Why are you so mad Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
All of your lives unled, reading in bed
I was just thinking  I was just thinking
I think everything counts a little more than we think
My jealous eyes, saw all of it
Help me 'cause I'm feeling shaky
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
When it's the food on your lips with which it's in love
Just a little bit,
My mind is filled with silvery stuff
I must stay here, in an endless eventide
He said he had to see my face
never take a bath on sundays 
Bye bye bye to all of the noise
I wanna live where the sun comes out
You say "Anyway's the only way", be careful not to gamble
But I know the feelings still alive, still alive
If I gots to play I'ma play till I win
Lose the love they sought to gain
That God sent this angel to watch over me
Of God's good ocean gone wrong
They'll put that smile back on my face ya
Holding it up behind my head again
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
So denied, so I lied
That I love you
She's all I need
With my eyes on the back door
And from this moment on
No brokenhearted girl
What the scene has got too sentimental
He probably left her for a socialite and he didn't love her 'cept at night
'Cause no matter what I say
I got down on myself
I'll be here where I've always been
It just gets hard to believe
How can I give love when I don't know what it is I'm giving
Open my window, sing me a song
No love, no glory
You'll never change what's been and gone
They don't shine quite as bright as back in Frisco
And when she was happy so was I
Take a breath, take it deep
I am locked in my head 
But of what you've just become
Ha ha ha ha It died out long ago
She tied you to a kitchen chair
To keep myself and heart employed
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
And when he's not home
My dearest friend
Push it out to sea
So tell me when you hear my heart stop
Next door there's an old man who lived to his s
But if you'd searched the whole wide world
The end is near again
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
And I can feel your light, stay with me tonight
She'll say yes, because these words were never easier
Now you are gone eternally
my days without, 
One hundred foot faces
And all I could think about was Monday
I couldn't gauge your fears
I used to know who I was
There isn't anything left to try
I said before too long you'll be a memory
nothing bleeds the same
Obwohl man merkt, dass du ihm doch sehr fehlst
Hold every memory as you go
Sometimes I get to feeling
Step into the line 
But I know that I still need you here
Poison me against the moon
And I wanna hear what you have to say about me
I'm sleepwalking
I really don�t know why I�m staying here
Hear the crowd of ghosts
So here we are again, the same old argument
They said it'd bring some closure to say your name;
Wipe the spots off of the mirror
Pushed us far away
I want blood, guts, and angel cake
Yesterday is here
Whatever may come
If your horses could talk, I wonder if they would complain
Back then every day was different
It's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
But God can be funny
Never got the whole in love thing
Little wet tears on your baby's shoulder
I hope Mother Nature has not overheard
I'mma give you the world
My back is turned on you
In my life, the compromise
To the one thing that I need, oh
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
Even if no one believes us
Running away from the world outside
We're divided by the ocean
I would dig a thousand holes to lay next to you
Everything happens today
She covers one eye 'cause she can see into your mind
Please don't close your eyes
Ev'ry night I want to play out
Don't become a ghost without no colour
I've got your pictures on my walls
Oh, my love, at least we had it
If you're honest and you say that you did
He has no one
I ain't got nothing left to give
So we're alone again 
But I got my man
I go back to the places we've been
In the rear view mirror
I was born in '
And I had thought it'd be harder to do but I caught her, and skinned her quick
And I will always remember you now
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there Daddy's with you in your prayers
If Heaven's really coming back
I'm not like all of the other girls
And may no man's weight
Ooh, where love is lost, your ghost is found
So when you ask, "Is something wrong"
Her eyes were bright, tonight would be the night
"I can't wait forever" is all that you said
I know you have a little life in you yet
Feel no shame
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
I'm crying icicles instead of tears
I drink a little more than recommended
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
Worse than a fear, it's the knife
Goodbye my friends
Like something pure and holy
Sure we all make mistakes
Bury me, marry me to the sky
And still they lead me back
But don't forget to entertain 'cause this is your first defense, this is your first defense
This used to be our childhood dream
The water soaks into rocks
Nothing could be bring me closer
Hold your grandmother's bible
On the streets of Philadelphia
Goodnight, always to all that's pure that's in your heart
I've waited for the callin'
Do not choose a coward's explanation
To try to figure out what it is I've done wrong every time when
Only call all his wild works your own
I let fall flowers of blood
These wheels keep turning but they're running out of steam
By a lady in black
They say if you love somebody
Eve, you're wrong, love
You cannot hide the way you feel inside I realize
No, you're not my fucking lover
Strange how life makes sense in time now
This is the moment that you know
I killed a man of mine
It all becomes simple how
And I'm sorry, there's nothing more that I can do
But my arms want to carry
There's nothing I can say
And nobody seems to like him
Hates the sound that goodbyes make
You lie awake and think about the girl
Oh how I wish things would of happened so differently
Turning into dust
Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday
That before I knew how much I had to lose
I need you, don't say no
You can tell them all how, how hard we tried to work it out
I'm sorry, I know that's
And try and try and try
Why are you staring into outer space crying
On a course of distance
I thought that I was over you
And still I have the pain I have to carry
And I know right where I fit in
Now I'm listening I'm heading out tonight
What I've done,
I just ain't the same without you in my life
He knows that they're the fool
All I want is to give my life only to you
What a shame, what a shame
But girl, what if there is no eternal life
But one thing's still true
Unmistakably lost and without a care
Smiled in my room
Looking after number one
There is room beneath your bed just for me
Dry your eyes
Love is drunk all the time
Hunting by the rivers through the streets
Just walk on
Between the lies and compliments
Living a hell
Don't remember them being here before
I know that I'll be sadder
Something to believe in
Below the sea
And then it was clear  I can't deny, I really miss him
I know it wasn't always wrong
Ain't it funny how we pretend we're still a child
And why do we lie here and whisper goodbyes
Like she loved me
So far away
And if you fell to your death today
And you don't wanna be here in the future 
Just a little bit of your heart just a little bit, just a little bit of your heart,
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
While you're chasin' ghosts
I'm broken down and hungry for your love
I saw your life once
Resonates a note
Now can't you see something's missing
We're all of us stars, we're fading away
Allie woke up AM
And everybody hurts sometimes
Tears stream down your face
There's no one left to talk to, honey
One day I'm gonna lose the war
Lost moments blown away
Danny is not eating, he's drinking and sleeping in;
I'll wait my turn
I'm ready for my sun to set
It feels empty and alone
That you'll call later on
Bring something to feed the birds
To fear the beating of your drum
Sixteen just held such better days
And if I stand here silent, I almost start to feel you fading in
You're a big boy now, so let's not talk about growth
Life goes on as it never ends
I'm sorry for wasting your time 
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
Just sit back and listen
To be my sunshine after the rain
But I saw you last night
He said I'll rent a car and I'll drive home
Son, you've got a way to fall
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you
I was scared to fix what I had broke
Bye bye
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to
Only love is all maroon
Give a little fist, give a little fist, fistful of love
I feel like letting go
I miss it all from the love to the lightning
Please don't blame me for trying,
Why does my soul why does my, my, my feel so bad feel so bad
I don't have a past, I just have a chance 
Has been silenced now
Beautiful round face, so ashamed
I�m ahead of the curve
To love you until your eyes run dry
There's something inside this weary head that wants us to love just instead
Looking in the sky I could see your face
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
The truth was unbearable
And you ruin who you love
Kill anyone for you
I'm bright as the Oregon breeze
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
Won't you come down Come away with me
Seasons are changing
I saw him last night at the party, he's definitely thin
Where the sun shine slows
I would love to pay for you
Wipe all of your tears and look you in the eyes
They say start as you mean to go on
You wanted more than I was worth 
For my love is like the wind
I wear myself out in the morning,
Nobody lives
Return the videos they're late
This brokenness inside me might start healing
To see how warm it is inside
I'm gonna miss the snow
Now I need a place to hide away
Let the weather have its way with you
Is to be home
They hurt so that they ended our relationship
My sister, hold on tight
But to think there's nothing wrong is a problem, oh
I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
And what's this shit about us meant to be together
On the hills
I never had no one ever
It's not right
When the light first came upon us and we saw the Everglow
Who called to say come dance with me
You let me hold you tightly
You say it is much more than just my last mistake
And I don't need you
For the rest
I'm a friend
Cops shone their lights on the reflectors of our bikes
Nothing surprises me anymore x
When your world's crashing down
And as you are you'll be again
Through troubled eyes
And get away from this place
But I need sorrow, baby, life's sorrow is the drug
Over the edge of the world 
And all I can do is try
You said that you would die for me
I look deep in your eyes, hesitate a while
And your arms around me
I will make the room up nice 
I'd like to celebrate you, dear
I can always hear a freight train,
And they call as they beckon you on
In their sleep of the dead
When I look in her eyes
I'll phone you first I guess, I hope I see you soon
I count the steps that you take
'Cause I was tired of lying
Your heart is unbreakable
To this western town
And she says that I am the brightest
I walk, the record stands somehow
I'm all alone with my heartache and my good intentions
"It's the atrocities of history
Have no fear
But I need something that works faster
And maybe I'm too young
Sleep will not come to this tired body now
If you don't mind
Some people don't even know his name
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
When you realize there's no one waiting
The way you made me compound to compound
A savoir comment
Back to the good old times
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Sometimes I forgive
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel
Stars in your eyes
And you know that I'm in love with the mess
Now it takes him all day just to get an erection
Unlock her name from your grass
As fish swimming round in a barrel when you've got the gun
I'd tell you that I loved you before I even knew you
I would say at this moment
Some are dead, and some are living
But that was not to be
The words that you needed so bad
And more heaven than a heart could hold
That splashes on a stone 
See, I'm a wreck inside
When you're born into trouble
But when he wakes he goes the distance
When you're around
I said does anybody need that room 
I took off my shoes and walked into the woods
To be a better man
With an old love letter
And I do love you
You're calling off the guards Am I coming
Love is blinding when the timing's never right
They've flown in the swiftness of time
Driving around on a Saturday night
Down to the burning cliffs 
But if, let's say, it won't work out
Meet me on the other side
And now stuck up inside my head, how they ever gonna grow
You got yourself framed on the wall
"Did you get enough love, my little dove
I want a perfect soul
You took care of the cat already
So they say, so they say, so they say
About the things that I forgot to do
Doll heart
And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself
forgetting because 
I still care for you
And I'm waiting for the day
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
When your father found out what we did that night
I may have lost my way now, haven't forgotten my way home
But I'm sure it didn't ruin her
Happy ending's gone forever more
But he didn't have the money for a guitar
Their minds say 'gotcha heart'
No one will ever love you honestly
Good kind
It will drop down on the floor
Instrumental break
This is my time of the year
But there's a girl waiting for me down in Mexico
Is there anyone I could call
Richard Cory at the opera, Richard Cory at a show
Flowers competing for the sun
The last mistake before you die
With the vines climb trees towards the light
Shouting back to the oldest people
Let me kiss you, oh
In a coma you don't dream
Everywhere I look I see green scenic sublime
In the woodland, the leaves are marking a path
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn
I'm not a bus ride, you can hop inside, and just roll away clean
But you can't paint an elephant
Give me your hand
Well you have no right to ask me how I feel
No more pain
The skyline was beautiful on fire
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
And my clothes don't fit me no more
"Thank you mother sea for letting him see the sea in me"
But I know that it's fun to pretend
It's far too bright for you
But I'm not gonna bless you with such compliments
You were the one that made me feel the way I do
You had the grace to hold yourself
Well everybody's hit the bottom and everybody's been forgotten
Oh I know that I left you in places of despair
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
Only in hopes of dreaming
I'll sing it on the street drunk to a cop
Did you stop at any time
The feelings disappear
If I only could, ooh
Now turn around and don't be sad
That was then, now it's the end,
I'm half my mother's daughter
I see your shadow so I know
Though I saw it all around
Watching TV movies on the living room armchair 
Oh kiss me and smile for me
I've got tears that are scared of the facts
Solace my game, it stars you
I wish I didn't really kiss
Broke my pace and ran out of time
It was real true love 
And leave me with pennies in my eyes
But all I've ever learned from love
How the end always is
I feel like going home
'Cause your hands and lips still know their way around
And every night our lonely planet
You touched these tired eyes of mine
I said they're watching my every sound
Walkin' past the carpet mills looking in and takin' stills,
Don't just stare like you never cared, I know you did
It must make you sad to know that, nobody cares at all
I would never place my hands to your face
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
I'm not living
A soldier's down
Who am I to need you when I'm down
Like a crack in a wall
'Cause if I don't we'll both end up
Where the water flows to
The shortest breath of your young life
All your summer sheets
The first colours, the first kiss
But till then, darling, you'll
One for the heartbroken lovers
In a second, just hang on, all in good time, won't be long
"Well you do enough talk
Past the blues, past the blues,
Cull memory for assimilation
All the windows are glowing
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
You in the pain
But she will always be a broken girl
Take care of yourself
But my heart will stay with you
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call
That I'm losing my best friend
Well this is all new
And my arms are tough
I've tried to see your point of view
Empty inside
Got my balls, my wheels push people
In God, do you still disagree
You say you got the most respect for me
We knew our childhood days were done
You saw her bathing on the roof
We tried to hold on
Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die
A million days later
By the pool last night, apparently
Still have too many dreams
And wash your swollen feet
I'm begging you please, oh please don't leave here
And all breath expired
But right now the clouds don't appeal too much
Do you know I die
Those words he never spoke
Well I, I just see the sky
But I can still read what you're thinking
We're not the same inside
And I can tell you 'bout today
I can't remember why 
And leave you to an empty room
They won't hear, tonight, the words of a lullaby
A couple years went by something happened
You'll find another soldier
Pretty soon, you'll have kids to feed 
We are the resin
There is three new holes in my wall
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine;
The feeling that you need someone
Because the moments I can feel you near
Was capital ME but you can't say I didn't try
And I will not turn again
We are never sad, 'cause we are not allowed to be 
Get a little bit of Bourbon in ya
The night into the day 
Lemme be your downfall
I dressed the kids as well
Last night I dreamt
Cover the mirrors
I find I always move too slowly
But here inside my mind you are the loudest one I know
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
We could go to the pictures and see something funny
With your friends alive and talkin', that was you
As the free fall advances
If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else
Without you on my mind
So scared of getting older
Finding myself in these last days of existence
First my left foot then my right behind the other
And I don't have nothing to say,
Do I divide and pull apart
Where you walked away
You fell into our arms
Is to marvel with love at the sunset
The world doesn't matter
I am nothing more than
And I don't dream since I quit sleeping
It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
I'd turn the car around and runaway,
Well a drinkin' buddy that's bound to another town
And if you won't give my heart back
Honey, cling to me
Can't believe that I feel
It's just the end of the, end of the world
To see if I still feel
You will pray to the God that you've always denied
They measure the room, they know the score
And I'm not coming back around
There is my love
Let's exchange the experience, ooh
Dig a shallow grave and I'll lay me down
Scraping through my head till I don't wanna sleep anymore
Made a promise not to clean the slate
Circus girl without a safety net
But damn Sam I love a woman that rains
Sweet Sunday morning, with nothing to do
It's half biology and half corrective surgery gone wrong
I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
Trying to take something you'll never be good enough
Let the show begin
I've been dreaming, dreaming about you, about us
This circus is falling down on its knees,
Take me home
That you stay surrounding me, surrounding me
To my right cross Seven Seas
And her dad called himself commanderinchief
Too much of you my friend, my dear, and now I cower
It was night when you died, my firefly
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown to you
Dr Jekyll is wrestlin' Hyde for my pride
Forever is right where we were
You let me hold your hand till I had my fill
It's always been up to you
Our unsleepable friend gets the message on an illwind
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
Someday burns down
Lookin' at your feet Failure's complete
You promised it was real and I believe that
I'd throw it all away
I turned my head away
Tears in waves, minds on fire
But that'll never change the way that I feel
I wanted all the things that I haven't got
I'm scared and standing right in front of you
Return, return, return, return
They come snapping at your heels
But tide will dry, upon my baby's back
The heart wants to explode
So alone in love
I'll just sail away
There are memories all over the place
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
Dance me to the end of love
It's raining in Baltimore fifteen miles east,
"There's someone new
So I can find someone to rely on
You got away, I never once heard you say
I am a tree reaching for the sun
Outlet from my cold solitary kingdom
With no need to be strong
Hiding far with everything
I'm coming up only to show you're down for
At every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
Yeah, she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me
Found myself just the other day
Someone stole my shoes
If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do
I want to go and cry
So many dreams on the shelf
And you will find someone
I've spent ten years trying to sing these doubts away
Oh ooh
Together we cry, oh yeah
Turning inside out
So let the light guide your way, yeah
And I'd say
In the wee small hours of the morning
Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
The cars and freeways implore me to stay away
Another two years older
Beyond the gray sky
The Upper Peninsula and the television news
I don't love you and I never did 
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
In the caves all cats are grey, in the caves the texture coats my skin
I'm feeling things are about to change
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Why don't we hit restart,
He's wearing your clothes, head down to toes a reaction to you
My belly released the stars and tears between the scars
And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
No no just another phase of finding what I really need
And I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
This morning's paper's ink stains my fingers
We never change, do we No, no We never learned to leave
Amie come sit on my wall 
There's a heart I love
'Cause all I do is push you far away from me
I think about this place I call home
In this proud land we grew up strong
Sleepwalking
If it brings me to my knees
Always there through, through that and this;
'Cause I forgot you left me behind to remind me of you
I remember the days we spent together,
All my past and future
And you shouldn't try to mix the two
Of all that is to come, the dream has just begun
When your heart was open wide and you loved things just because
With all the pretty things she did 
It's better that we break, baby
The silver thorn of bloody rose
To rest
I lost myself on a cool damp night
Hardened to the point
I wonder whether they got in, turned away no doubt
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go
Somehow I'll show you
That we don't know the meaning of
Somebody new 
In my dreams I see you
Sorry seems to be the hardest word
But the heart wants what it wants
White and red, black and blue
Well I gonna call my home
I feel nothing 
I wanna open up my heart
Don't want to hear you say
And I wrote a letter to my family
I get my way you're so like me
Like in a dream
I hope you'll be pleased to see me
Now Ophelia wants to know where she should turn
You've got me tethered and chained
Here's to you and your lover boy
I'll be back tomorrow, that is if you're here
With your back turned up against the wall
Another day
Will his presence still remain
Your voice, it sounded kind, I hope that you like me
Soul mates never die
You got your heart right
A name in your recollection
I was young enough, I still believed in war
You walked around
You are the morning bird 
Waving your guns
And as it fell from the sky I asked myself why
Hanging on the words you say
Their words, mostly noises
Mom's looking sad
I thought it was there for good so I never tried
We still dance in my outrageously beautiful
No, it's not the good kind
Put it up too much to call home sometimes
She told her son
Still it takes him all day just to get an erection
And I have read the golden seal
I whisper empty sounds in your ear
I read the signs, I got all my stars aligned
Just let me love you
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Love is love's sad news
Metal heart, you're not worth a thing
I'm warning you
Today
He hurt me but it felt like true love
And it's too near the bone
Remember when I cried to you a thousand times
When we were children we played
You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
The eyes of a fallen angel
It's a frightened dead boy,
Yeah, I was a postcard, I was a record
Oh despair, you were there through my wasted days,
An unwanted sun pulls rank in the sky
It took a long, long, long time
When we get delayed can we cast a line towards anyone dismayed
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
I was just thinking, merely thinking
To work from  to "
A hopeful look draped in despise
You needn't be
He grabs her by the hair, he strokes her on the cheek
Ooh I see you standing by the sea
I will never believe in this again
They think are new
I believe in you and me
Is that alright Yeah
Together we always pull through
Come home"
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There are so many of us
Means nothing else would be the same
'Cause we were in love
The one that keeps the curtains closed
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is
But I've got no plans at all to leave
There's nothing left to say
And the hunger returns
Wild horses
Endless thoughts and questions keep me awake
I'm sorry,
In a place where we only say goodbye
No one's gonna love you more than I do
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away
I see it around me, I see it in everything
I can't understand why I feel this way
Setting suns before they fall
Kindness comes over me, what was your name
He admits it took too long to admit that he was wrong
Have we lost all the love that we could share
Driving to the riverside
 minutes, of bliss, thirty lies
No one knows the name of
Mr Postman, do you have a letter for me, a letter for me
And all their tearful words will turn back into steam
I should have quit, but instead, I took care of you
You think one drink
I gave in, to selfish ways
'Cause this ain't exactly what my heart expected
It's got to be more
Playing the show and running down the plane
And the wind will be wailing
All the wild horses
I want to go someplace and find you there
Now I'm thinking back to what I said before
I am always here
The window closes, shock rolls over in a tidal wave
you don't have to say it 
All the press still hounded you
Then the line will never be crossed
I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did
I wish I was your favourite girl
You steal things you ought to borrow
And someone's burning out, out on condor avenue
Falling so far on a silver spoon, making the moon for fun
It's been kinda hard
Sheila rides on crashing nightingale
Just take what you need and be on your way
Never change
I'll grow back like a starfish
But now I'm told that this is life
I should've said your name,
Don't believe you're all alone"
Jesus rides beside me
In backseat staring out the window
Or do you feel condemned
I know you're trying your hardest
But don't bother to buy insurance 'cause you've already died
You can tell them all how, how good it feels to be let down
I never thought I'd
Warm and steady as she rests
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
And I wish I'd known that you were bleeding while I sat
And I wanna see 'em rolling, rolling back
Don't you know she's got a babe baby
I don't know where it's gone
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say;
While you were kissing me once more than once
Honey now if I'm honest
Well I don't need anybody
My senses can't divide
See her come down, through the clouds
Our carefully laid plans
I would have given you all of my heart
Sometimes love has to let go
I guess that I miss you
I love the things that you do
Oh yeah, right on, so good
Thank you for all you've done, forgive all your mistakes
Or a problem is a task disguised in work clothes
Is all that we could ever share if only we could see it
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
There's no going back
Then we could talk it through
No one laughs at God when the doctor calls after some routine tests
Some things never do change
No gloves
I try to say it
Ooh This is the last dance, this is the last dance
Do you hear the static of one thousand detuned radios
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain
Big girl, you ate the neighbor
I asked for death but instead I'm awake
It's cold as you fade into the sun
Breathing in lighting
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all
By sharing these things
That I love you so
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
And I have the skill yeah I have the will, to breathe you in while I can
No regrets, they don't work
Was the most you ever knew
Places, places, get in your places
And be the bird and be the key
A long day
Nothing's quite the same now I just say your name now
And make it out when the sun is ruined
It's last call and you're the last one leaving 
To ever fall back in your arms
All my life I've waited
I send this smile over to you
Letters always get burned
Those sad eyes
When the part is through
If you were still about,
I never needed you to be strong
If we would try again
Make a property line from the bed
It's all of the good that won't come out of me
Maybe I'd be back around
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart; 
Compels my hands to do
You always said destiny
Before you do as the Devil pleases
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must
I saw a movie, it just wasn't the same
Never thought all this could backfire Close up the hole in my vein
Hurts like brandnew shoes
Is already in my life
All the change in my life just fell away 
Of all the things I've believed in
And just when I get so lonesome, I can't speak
So here's one to the pigeons
The morning papers made the most
Will you stay with me in my time of need
Well that may be your best defense
My body's aching, but I can't sleep
I left you right where I want you
Across the county line
That we're not in love
And when I go out, yeah I know I'm gonna be
They just want me gone
Well, I'm lookin' at the snowflakes
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches and nothing
The water keeps on falling from my eyes
But you are such a super guy
Asleep in perfect blue buildings,
You know how the time flies
For something lasting
You were always one of those
And then you got away, didn't you babe
Nose dive in the flood lines
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Your skin makes me cry
Still I push my barrow all the day
Well they found you and they shipped you up the river the same way
But for now I move my feet on the ground
You make it all go way
No alarms and no surprises
You'll say it looks as though I might give up this fight
To always get hit
Now you're asking me to listen
And if you're not mine
A sober straight face gets you out of your clothes
But electricity it drew you near to me
Sweep your boat out to sea
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Live forever, for the moment Melanie C Live forever
The escalator rises as it falls
Take the pieces and build them skywards
I guess I need you, baby
The laughter penetrates my silence
Well the future's got me worried
Nodding and melting and fading away
And I half run away to sleep
Mother, the car is here, here
I may take a holiday in Spain
If you hadn't discovered which I did inside of me 
Makes you want to cry
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye
On Tuesday mornings, I want the same
I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise
The card was never read
Right till the end Ooh
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool
Only get closer 
If you push me but I won't fall
What the day has lost
Any place you've never been
As your skin starts a scratching 
And Rob says
My pulse was as high on my very first date
Run off with a dancer
You always said you'd tell me first
I'll always love you, no matter what you do
The harder I push the farther I fall
That just won't go away
But when they break they go to pieces
And if we find gold
I am the rain that's coming down on you
I don't wanna dream about
To the ruins of time
Pacing nervous 'cross the floor of her bedroom
Now everything is imaginary, especially what you love
This kind of fate was meant for me
Your speckled face
We're working our jobs, collect our pay
Searched through the books on human behaviour
There doesn't seem to be any other way
I will give you what you need
And weightless and maybe
To this heart a little bit closer
But I don't mind
Like the horseshoe crab 
Rain runs over my face
Just a killer come to call from some awful dream
I can't say anymore than "I love you"
It's all that I can say
As time stands still
Those were the days of our lives, yeah
I keep the wolf from the door
Hey, little train Wait for me
I didn't lose my mind it was
Polly, come home again
And think of things that might have been
Go run, run, run
When I see my face in the mirror
Hey girl, open your walls, play with your dolls
I'm leaving this place
Because you'll have to kill me first
I feel like writing you a letter but that's not me, you know me
So I shook hands with you freely
We adopt brand new language
Dass die Sonne scheint, dass sie wieder scheint
That could think about dreaming a dream
But when I call
Shrinkwrapped out of air
A mess like this stuck on your hands with crazy glue
If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
Smoke's filled the air
Until we put him in the ground
Did you call his name out as he held you down
Caught me a long wind
I took down the posters from my wall
I wish you had a favourite beauty spot that you loved secretly
Say something funny
Why did you go away baby
Oh water that had kept me alive
I need some sleep, I can't go on like this
We'd share each other like an island
I sing alone, 
We'll carry on, my only friends
All young men must go
This is the coastal town,
Without the reign of terror over every momentary change
Make you feel the same
Said, I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Have seen everything to see
Jim brought me back
You are a ghost
And there's no way back home no way back home
And I curse the life I'm living
Among other things 'round town
There was a girl with light brown streaks
Could not speak as loud as my heart
I want to go someplace and find you there
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
We're nowhere near prepared, there's no way of knowing
A vision too removed to mention
No one, knows where the shore is
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
You put my shine to shame
One of these mornings one of these mornings
She won't go underground
And I didn't need you till melody
It's  am my heart is beating too loud
So can you see the stars
Got your bible and your gun
And then the next day, how will you know your enemy
Well, she was my catatonic sextoylovedrugdiver
I hope my smile
I will remember your kiss
I'm stayinabove the flat line
There's nothing I can do
Bring my baby back
I cannot repair
Of you miles away
Hoping what you need is behind every door
Clay in my hands
To your house
And here comes emptiness, crashing in
Whenever I was in need of a friend
You know that I would give you my hand
Does it mean something
I am out here looking for you
But in the end
And they get so red in the head you think they're 'bout to choke
Burns her to the bone
Two feet standing on a principle
Being a bad bitch on the side
This is the part of me that thinks outer space is all dead
But here it comes again
I don't want to be the one
So kiss me and smile for me
I know I can't change the way you feel
And something's breaking up Breaking up
What must we do to restore our innocence
Ooh ooh ooh
Stay up all night with the stars
Every time I walk out the door,
One thing's for certain, I'm insecure
You may hate me,
I waited half my life away
It's gonna cloud our eyes again
In the wintery grave
He wasn't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say,
Look lovely today
Take me to my home
But frayed at the ends, he breaks
It's more the feeling of it all
You said you would love me until you die
The things you put in your head
Everything die
All this independent strain 
See you right back here tomorrow for the next round
If you once knew
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters but no pearls
But deep within the corners of my mind
And I can't pretend I won't think about you when I'm older
How can I go forward into something I'm not sure of
Can't I think what I did with that ol' skill and dye
I dreamed about you, baby
Pray now baby
Grey would be the color if I had a heart
No, you're not the good kind
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Like a house that caught fire, it burned and flamed
'Cause somewhere there's a place where we belong
"Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,"
She said Is this the return to Oz
Hey girl, open the walls, play with your dolls
And it's not like her to drive that slow, nothings on the radio
They loved my friend Adam
You're still the one who makes me feel much taller than you are
That I wouldn't cry
I asked somebody what the time is
A father after Leningrad
But in these days I'm so confused
Craving blood poured from the altar now
You didn't phone when you said you would
Towards the mouth and the reunion of the Known and the Unknown
You know they stay on my mind, on my mind
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I cry at night, cry at night, I'll cry for all the words, all the words I didn't say
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one
My short term memory is gone, but my long term's far from dead
I had the notion that you'd make me forget the world 
There is really no one left
At the end of my life
You still sound like a song
Look at this, look at the boys dancing
And finally drank away his memory
Please sleep, my darling, sleep
"You're safe, child, you are"
Don't you let it pass you by it's so beautiful it makes you want to cry
It's never over, she is the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
And I was even having a good day when I'd found out we'd lost you
To the tears and the pain
And the God of Wine is crouched down in my room
And shut your mouth
Boredoms in the bathroom shaking out the loose teeth
In a ditch not far away
I need your car and I need your love
Become a rock star 
When you see my evil smile
I remembered you the moment I met you
Yeah, today is on my mind
Something ain't right
No matter what I do
Forgotten
I lived, I lived I loved
I am my mother's only one
Don't you see me crying
Here, here now, don't cry
And rain upon the forehead where the mist's for hire if it's just too clear
Making love was just for fun
I thought that I found me a cure for feeling old
No prayer can ease the pain
I'm jaded now whatever that means
Oh what a beautiful world
There's no relief for the bleeding heart
I think I kinda like it but I mighta had too much
There were birds in the chimney
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But here comes goodbye, here comes the last time
So, close your eyes
I say, "Oh"
Now that it's time
I hear you're asking all around
I don't want a stormy affair
My hands grow darker everyday
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go"
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
Forgive me, girls, I am confused
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
In the powers of the earth, we wait until it rips and rips 
Think twice before you touch my girl
I put on my best, but I'm still afraid
And I am no longer afraid of anything
Somewhere I can't bring you back
And song 
Gather my skeletons far inside
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
I miss you dad but I've got nothing to remind me of you
Quietly turning the back door key
And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away
Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Why the tears We're all here for you
While I watch the ocean, 
You're the bedtime story
I just wanna hold her,
 Since he's | Senses  lying dead on the floor
Yes I do, I believe
Are they the only ones who laugh at the jokes when they are so bad
I wish sometimes I could take back every word I've said
And out and off in search of someone proud
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever
With the lies they told to you
Wenn ich in deinen Armen liege
We're just dancing, no big deal push people
But after a while I wonder
Can't do nothing at all
Until I'm taken by these bolts of pain;
I turned away as he came near the street below
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
I have my troubles too
Spread your wings and I know
And every time you leave with her,
But that's one thing
Or was that your shadow I saw on the wall
Your folks have bet you gone
For you and your children
Don't walk away
Walk it off, dear
When I am in the life anyway
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Nothing seems to show
I won't pick up the phone
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
There's no need to tell anyone
When you want more than you have, you think you need
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
I never cared before, before, before, before
Making me feel so cold, yeah
I'll find some peace tonight
She fell in love in the first place
I know tomorrow you will be
And we'd live our lives together
Hot ashes for trees Hot air for a cool breeze
How's your life, what's it like there
The harder I push the further I fall
Oh, it's no cause for concern
Oh but dear the sky is low
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me
As someone long prepared for the occasion;
You've shown me eventually, what you'll do
We're burning gasoline
You don't know what love is
And turn it into something you would miss if
Cause nothing feels like home
How I found a love so pure
I thought you'd be here by now
How did it come to be
And surely that ain't right
Snow can wait, I forgot my mittens
Where the lies we tell to the eyes that roll in doubt
Will sorrow be the only lover I can call my own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
And I wish that I weren't here tonight
And we'll never have to listen New haircut
Take it to the tax man
Where the hell's my credit cards
I just want to listen to your beating heart
No name for her but as it comes
All the things I should've given but I didn't
So I said I'd get my head down and I'd deal with the ache in my heart,
There's nothing left here
I've been learning to drive my whole life
Hate is spitting out each others mouths
And can I hold you one last time
With a book in my hand
What have I become, my sweetest friend
For they don't have trees to hang upon
Why, bleeding is breathing
Pale green things, pale green things
Not too sure how it feels
I need to remind you 
You are a guest here now
I am flying on a star into a meteor tonight
For in my own heart 
Don't let your life pass you by
There's a kid a floor below me saying, "Brother, can you spare
I wish I could mean this but here's my goodbye
So we've put an end to it this time
Still miss you baby
And can I choose again if I should lose the reason
Where I stay in all day
Sometimes you've just got to make it for yourself
It seems I've stepped over lines you've drawn again and again
y no entiendo de fútbol 
But it's a flag that I love
Now you're underneath the stairs
Have you made up your mind
I can't go on, just holding on to ties
All the good that won't come out of me
'Cause everybody's gone at last
What the hell is your name
Wish I didn't know the meaning of
And daddy's always working
And prays to hear him say "No more
It's hard to believe
'Cause it's a flag that I love
You are too kind, much too kind
Why're you scared I'm not scared
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
A song for your heart
And tell me I am still the man I'm supposed to be
It's a lonely place to live with just a ghost
And I won't forget you when we part
Who dreams he had you with him
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to take you higher
'Cause the world gets in your way
When she makes me sad
If your heart was full of love
Between the lines of fear and blame
Everybody needs inspiration,
I admire the time that you take
Ain't no coming back
I never needed anyone
And the streets are jammed with cars
When you will be able, able to say
Both a beginning and an end 
I told you it was all yours
"I will always love you"
Acid heads, unmade bed, and you Woodward world queers
'Cause I'm feeling my way through the dark
Trying to make things good for
This is the part of me that needs medication
I am on my feet to find her
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
I was in Guns and Noses, ah
The only way to catch a butterfly,
Only love can save us now
It's been a long, long, long time
This is goodbye
I thought you were my boyfriend
Please send for me
I counted people as I neared the street below
Will you be my love
And I'm constantly turned off
Lately my hands, they don't feel like mine
But you never thought it was enough of
I wanna have control
Without the blanket of sorrow
'Cause you're the one
Oh, for so long I've tried to shield you from the world
I won't let this build up inside of me
And a million miles
Tell me why I feel so low
And all I ask you is for another chance
Now that you're big enough to run your own show
Like a brand new friend
Believe we're gliding down the highway
And who's to say it's wrong
Oh but it's crossed my mind
You are me
You must be a miracle worker
And then I fell apart but got back up again
Tellin' you things, but not tellin' straight
Viva forever, I'll be waiting Melanie C Viva forever, I'll be waiting
How does it feel 
They found her in a small grove of trees
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
I'd be less angry if it was my decision
You can read me anything
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Is coming home from BFPO
And we all end together
The world's a funeral, I run with ghosts
Fist, fist, fist, fistful of love
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
It looks like an early winter for us
I've hardly been outside my room in days,
Lights will guide you home
I don't care anymore
My wealth would render this no less severe
That feels like home
And say the last goodbye
There's a bluebird at my window 
Then in the night, the sorrowing sigh
Spitshined so bright
I would never say to you
'Cause you never read the signs
Fix me to a chain around your neck
And you were driving through the night
And sit on top of me, yelling out my f name
But you're the only one
I guess I'll go home
I'll be staying down
Hold me up, hold me down
Don't let me be carried away
Mutta sielussasi  But within your soul
That There is no truth 
We were running for the money and the flesh
As a man I've never been much for talking to
You come to me with your hair curled tight
My love Your uniform returns to air
The days go on forever
I've gotta live with the choices I made,
Ooh what a waste of
There is a faceplate all brown and red that stretches across my mouth
In the shadows the name is unknown to me
How can you mend my, please help me mend my broken heart
There ain't no way that I can hold it down
It was half a second in, I was halfway down
That she bought from a rubber man
Or a sad song in a lonely place
Betrays my head
Like the kind that converted you to me so long ago
Like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in,
I check the phone
No, it's the course of history your position in line
It's about time that you got sick of me
Instead of reading in a letter that they've gone to something better
Passing by with every exit sign
Always packing all my stuff
She was put to the test
Breaking my life in two
And in I come to lick it up
'Cause she's got nowhere to go
Because the road is clear 
Words are spoken
Just like thinking of your childhood home,
And I feel sad I can't hear you reciting it through,
Just medals and scars
Listen to me, don't walk that street
You've been my golden best friend
A picture of you, holding a picture of me
And I feel pretty, pretty enough for you
I believe our love can see us through in death
Where's that love you promised me
In a house on the street where you live
Counting stars again
But I came to my senses
Weep not for roads untraveled
Drunk on your juices
Frameless heads on nameless walls
The street's wet, you can tell by the sound of the cars
And I will swallow my pride
And I know everybody
I'll help you carry the load
Down on paperback 
I don't understand your heart
Some have gone, and some remain
And the fire that was starting to go out
Let you fall for every empty word I say
Strung out again
You know, sometimes it just feels better to give in
A golden age I know
My baby likes to shoot pool
Will run through my fingers, tears,
Hollywood created a superstar
There's a shadow running through my days
But you just turned your nose up in the air, oh
Friday morning at nine o'clock
I sit and cry
The ring meets my face
So you won't feel bad about me
And there's plenty of ways to claim his crimes tonight
You'd better bend before I go
Again I waited for this to pull apart
My heart is oh so true
I should be laughing right now
Shortly after your first heart attack
Of the high shoes of the old friends
No use sayin' nothin'
I need a good alarm to wake me up
Does it happen all the time
While I recall all the words you spoke to me 
But I feel, tomorrow will be okay
He was ten years old
And you never left me no messages
Laid down in a hotel bed
Pray to be, shake this land
There's no lies, the lies, the lies, the lies
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
Baby, don't go away, come here"
I live, I learn, you will always take what I have earned
"No" is the saddest experience you'll ever know
When Streetlights kissed, upon your lips
Make no mistake about it
Over the sea 
I've got the keys, I'm letting people in
When choosing sides for basketball
You and your big dreams 
To get it together to sing one song
Bringing the clouds down to the sea
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Well I'm not a child 
Why did fate deceive me
She goes her own way
You'll always be mine
Ever defrayed your soul
So she sat in the corner of the room do be do be do do,
And I don't know what his name was
I've stood in a thousand street scenes
All the stars are burning for you 
Sometimes you let me in
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
He deals the cards to find the answer 
Oh he beat her cold, yes he did
But everything's the same this town is pitiful
This is the end
Joey will come when it's really time to go
A night owl
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to an evening of boxing
Ohne dich zähl ich die Stunden ohne dich
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And feeling so very lucky
Her writing's honest
Thinking a blink of these lashes would make you come
When you get home
Its either love or hate, I can't find in between
I guess it was never meant to be
Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare
Shows that we are united
You were my addiction, I got strung out and crazy
You live the blues
Of each married man
And offer you my hand
But all will pass, and end too fast you know
For a child cries
I was the one you always dreamed of
And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying
May angels lead you in
How much I love you
The moon gravitates around you
The painful scream that I, heard last
I know it is always been there
You look like a perfect fit
There's a song that's inside of my soul
I've been alone all along
Honey, you please me
You're right,
I wanna clean up my head
Gives of herself and the magnet head
I like the peace in the backseat
What are you doing hanging out with me
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
Where every new blood
What you need to hear
Oh, my babe, at least we tried
So we trade liquor for blood
I hear you cry
Say one last prayer
'Cause the comet can take us
And you don't even know where I start
Breaking apart all this love in my heart
And dad moved back to the other side of  Mile on Novara
She lives by disillusion's glow
Shot through with starlight
But she kept runnin' away from this world
And I like my candy and your women
I'll never really learn how to love you
I woke up and you were crying
Say the words that you say
Got a YouThinkICare air
But it might not be here where I feel safe
I've reached the end of my rope and it's time that I told you so
My hand between your knees, you turn from me
We were born to die, we were born to die
In full command of every plan you wrecked 
With honest conviction
Forget all the things I should have said
Oh yeah
Down on my knees and my hands in the air again
Never know how I wanted to feel
Don't cry daddy
I was prey in your bed
You're all that I hoped to find in every single way
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste
Too many years I've cried for you
Busby Berkeley dreams
I can't wait for long, I'm sorry
Sorrow's a girl inside my cake
The seasons have changed 
I've been running all my life
By jealousy and death
Yet still inside, I felt alone
You're so far, so far away
Does she hold you like I do
My shits all over the place
It's just no good anymore since you went away
Those days would never end
It's not mine, but I want it
'Cause love doesn't hurt so I know I'm not falling in love
You make me feel like I am home again
Could never take away my misery
If we're alright,
My head is aspinning round
Leave me standing in the starring role in some tragic lovers play
But you never had to try
Turned around squinting
So comfortable, so habitual
"Never never never never never never never never never let me go" she says
I caught a long wind
Because number one was the girl friend from Paris
Your guts and callouses, you had kids to feed 
Eli, the barrow boy of the old town
Give you reason to believe
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I have ever learned
The time flies by,
That night
Living without your smile
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
If you're done with it
There is a storm in my heart
How does he feel 
Tried to tell you I never knew it could be so sweet
For the trouble you took from her eyes
She was playing a part that I could understand
The touch of mist felt soft, felt warm
But you're already somebody's baby
Photographs and brightly colored paper 
Now I see your face in the strangest places
Well something's lost but something's gained
He got mad, tiresome
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
If I had more than my ambition, I'll have time for please
The radio station disappeared
God, please bring the rain 
When you see me fly away without you
You want me to cry and play my part
You walked away, heard them say
We'll find a place
Except everything you had and what was left after that, too, oh
And silver fills my eyes
If anything should happen, I guess I wish you well
You can't break my heart, it's liquid
Ancient history, some would say, another state of mind
For you and it would never end
I'd believe in anything
I don't understand, you've already gone
Why you got to be mean
Looking out the door
I know that I'm still learning
And the pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
The war is on, too weak to move 
You looked happy, and that's great
Everyday is silent and grey
Do we run
On the way, she imagines reactions
Down in space it's always 
I ain't the money man, which your money man, you ain't lookin' at me
Knowing all the things you just escaped
We got tickets they were free
Now, we've got something to prove
Well, I won't look back, I won't look back
And still I find myself outside
Still life
'Cause the tempest is out to wrestle a while
You're lost in the dark  you can trust me
The darkness
And a blanket on your bed,
I had shoes to fill
It's just a movie 'bout a movie to old to die"
Through buildings gone missing like teeth
But you're not coming home tonight
But she didn't ever hold me
Be where you are
Missing all this time
Mmm whatcha say 
I didn't get it 
Take my hand and my
So if I seem a little out of it, sorry
Oh my Barbara, she looks so much like my mom
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
Don't judge me so harsh little girl
I'm haunted by your smile
These clothes don't fit us right
It's just a place I'm looking for
To a place where you belong
These feelings I can't take no more
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
And the places that you go 
But you're in every song I know
I will leave my mark so everyone will know  I was here
I'm on your side
'Cause it was happy, oh, I was sad, and
You call my name
Just set out with no map and turn off your torch
Whoa, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
In my mind
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Give me a reason to believe
I can make you satisfied in everything you do
But no one's listening anyway
I got to know the sky
Keeping everything moving, everything static
Yes all you have to do is cry 
Dam right I fucking changed
With political connections to spread his wealth around
Goodbye You're my sweetest
He took off all their clothes for them
No one's laughing at God when they've lost all they've got and they don't know what for
This barren land is alive tonight
You like your women and you like fun
and each day that passes by 
The branches bending low
Wish I was too dead to cry
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I, I can see their eyes
i don't find something 
I got some friends I barely see
How we spend our days, casting love aside
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
How can I ever misplace you
A band of angels coming after me
When I'm much too far away 
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
From words but not from beauty
A man who drinks just to drown the pain
I don't mind, I don't care
I'm too shy, I should have kissed you 
Jumping headfirst
Where nothing ever happened
When I look at you I see forgiveness
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
Where you say it's all right
Another place to let their hearts collide
We've to feel alone 
I'll tear myself away
Lay rotting where I fall
Waiting for the time to pass
That you're not the person you wanna be
I can deal with some psychic pain
It's getting harder to pretend
And I will love this love forever
And walked outta my life
I've lost the only love worth fighting for
And you look at me and I understand, yeah it's the look I used to know
It's coming apart again
And all of these things remember these
I know I did us both all so wrong
Light the way and let me go
Since you have been gone
There's nothing to do but I don't mind when I'm with you
Ooh You gotta drive all night
Like Peter Pan or Superman
To break my time in two
So I keep sleeping
But I guess that I can live without you
Does it fade away 
In  hours
Ten different ways I could end this night 
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
I don't want this; remember that
No, you don't have to love me if you don't want to
Afraid to love
And run in thickening streams of greed
Keeping everyone in
I'm gonna change everything wrong with me
Just you and me girl was a beautiful time
They breathed fresh air once, a long time a long time ago
Say your goodbyes
It ain�t a lot but it�s all I have
Mother I made it up from the bruise on the floor of this prison
We can pretend nothing's changed
Oh, what to be done with her
You were the first to lie when we were not alright
I will roam lost but never alone, hide with me, hide
There's just a little bit of dust in my eye
Someday they'll open up your world
And 'neath her window have I stayed
A melody, a memory, or just one picture
A man inside a room is
Ah, but you got away, didn't you babe
Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
And you're restless, and I'm naked 
Every single day from the poker to the prize
See, honey, I saw love You see, it came to me
To all you wanted always supportive always patient
History buried in shame
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
You started a war that you can't win
My eyes 
It's just a sound going through your head
I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth
'Til the end
Fears conspire, they won't go away
Where someone's last goodbye
You and me in the dressing room
Never pick sides, never choose between two
Lost in the moment of abandon, you're set free
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place
Each time you get hurt, I don't want you to change
I know what I should do but I just can't walk away
It was good what we did yesterday
What was gettin' near
Summon to the sky
Got no place to go
I could smile for a while
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
Moved on to another town
Or Charo or GWAR, I could sell you tomorrow
Catch up with the sunrise
But it's no sacrifice, no sacrifice
With the words you've borrowed
I thought you'd come over
And every wave is tidal, if you hang around you're going to get wet
We'll be half way to anywhere
These things they go away
I knew it would never last
By changing your perfume to the kind his mother wore 
Bye, bye
All I do is push you far away from me
In a marathon of days too long
Everything I make, I only make for you
From the shackles of language and measurable time
There'll be nothing you can do
My heart sinks
And are you on the list
Tell the papers
I am undone
Last chance, suffer the weight or get buried by this
Because I know fine well that what I did was wrong
I've done some things that I want to forget but I can't
I ain't the dish rag, to come clean up, all the shit that ya dish out
You just hope that someone sits with you
Yeah, the truth is that I miss you so
And I always let you go
That call and say, come dance with me
Maybe it's love, but it's like you said
You keep your distance, I can't deny you
In dull surprise when payment due
And I remember all the things we once shared, 
If she sees how much I'm hurting she'll take me back for sure
You just turned your back on the crowd
Everything washed in a thin orange haze
Do the things that you always wanted to
I'm sorry for blaming you
I want all that is not mine
And they weren't crying, my friend said it wasn't so bad
Someone's waiting in the tall grass
There's nothin' but the rain
You took a piece of me the day you went away, 
Had a talk with my old man
Grateful our cold memories bide
Walking down this dirt road
Should have known what it was like to be you
My life is changing in so many ways
And we could never repair
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
"Come down," they say
Pink balloon of time
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
Now a hole in the head of this wounded liar
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
With a little bit too much to say
And if you call I'll run, run, run
Custa o que correr, corre o que custar, ah
Faster than a seven day week
The father was cruel and he lost his wife
Don't like the things you don't say
And as the seconds fade away
Sometimes I miss her so much, I want to hop on the next jet
Drift away into nothing at all, at all
I climb to fall, to begin again, to begin again
No warning sign, no alibi
And I would do things
I'm not savouring life
Well, neither one of us deserves the blame, 
I'm crying
But I swear by this song
But He took my shoulders and He shook my face
For the killer kiss, kiss
If I could get another chance
You are mine, I am yours
I, I, I, I did it, all right, alright, I admit it
Now you should be holding me
And heaven knows heaven knows
But know right from wrong
Your picture out of time
I never knew then
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
My heart wants to hold
All full of romance for someone that you met
The way it feels to be alive
And I, for one, have felt its bruises
Oh, look what you've done
Bobby got a shad fly
With words like 'Lost and Found' and 'Don't Look Down'
A clear heart of air appears as we shiver on the seats
The news men know what they know, but they
I could die for the words that you say
And in that bright October sun
You don't need to compromise
The future's miles away
I want the things that I had before
There's something missing in my heart
It's coming up roses
Always end up in confusion
I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
Then suddenly, things seemed to change
You got me
Clutches of sad remains
Shot guns with no guns
Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike
And watch as something seems to happen somewhere else 
Gather up all your loose change
And finally see what it means to be living
I'm gonna dream about the time I had with you
I met a girl on the square
I told her my story, and who I'd come for
To the quiet chaos driving me back
And the mountains surrender,
Pray for tomorrow, but for today
It's such a big mistake
Somewhere far away
Until the end of our days
They slip between the sentries of the heart
And I know these scars will bleed
I can't get by on an odds and ends love that don't ever match up
I fell onto my knees
I know you really loved me
That thunderstorm's still crashing in your cranium
Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Wait until my clothes cling to my frame
Baby, it's a long way to South America
And so bare is my heart
'Cause it's been ten days without you in my reach,
You were as kind as you could be
Fill your pockets with the dust and the memories
Thoughts of changes that
LA is getting kind of crazy
etched in cold
When you're young you have this image of your life
Well, maybe I don't need no angel at all
You're my sweetheart
Lie cold in the ground like you did
I know what I should do but I just can't turn away
Well, I hear my father fall
Tears and rain
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
I'm not about to stick my grave with an
Our girl is gone
Bend this way
That you just don't love me
These foolish games
and it feels like it's snowing
There was nothing to
Who showed me how to kill my cares
One time, tell me you need me tonight
your stomach's filled up but you're starved for conversation
Someday you will die
Damn, who knew
And have you seen how the cars when they pass
 AM, day after Christmas
And games that never amount
It�s old news, ah
But you don't have to call anymore
I was afraid to be alone,
I'm standing in a room,
Michael sat on my knees and whispered to me
But you are the sun
The love You taught me most of what I know
This used to be my playground used to be
She walked through bullets and haze
I did what I had to do
'This world always stops,' you said
You were swinging your guitar around
No one will love the way I do
I would hold you in my arms, I would take the pain away
I forget that I hate so many things
Just like our last kiss
Ahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah everything changing
Who could have counted days
Don't get the jokes but I just need to laugh
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson, take my best friend Bo
I saw you crawling to the door
Booze in my hair, blood on my lips
You got in so late it's Sunday morning
Been standing still for much too long
If you think that you're strong enough nice dream
choppy waves
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
But up till now I've always been afraid
Because it brings me back you
But, is there a chance
Under ground, over mountains, through forests and deserts and cities
And tonight will go on forever while we
This song is for the soil
We were strangers many hours and I missed you for so long
Your love
The skyline, baby, is bright tonight
No, don't get lied to
Turns to nothing today
Our voices in the breezes
But I have not left your side
Morning fields of amber grain
Now you say you're leavin' home
And no one should deny
Love me 'til the walls cave in, yeah
You find all the numbers you need
Well that's just fine; that's just one of my names
This is the part of me that loves my parents
But if my silence made you leave
Silence is not the way
Just know that wherever you are
He's pulling up in the driveway and you don't make a sound
Such a lonely day should be banned
You're not sorry, no, no
I can't believe it four years down the drain
But if you hold me up to the light
But it didn't know me
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
Stuck on the rocks inside Opus  stoned
Of the future
Are you sure what side of the glass you are on
Work will still be done
To let lie what's done
She got enough on her mind
Now that I feel it's time to spend the night away
I said real, make it timeless,
Whatever we called you
All of our rubbish dreams
It hurts to hold on
my days without you, 
And I'll be gone
Limitations are set
What is closer to the truth
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
Have a drink on each other and call it a day
You step a little closer each day
I'm gonna walk there by myself
Can't remember what went wrong last September
'Cause I don't need a reason just to hold you
Wondering, the change you'd bring
Ah, just one more
Remember times when you put me on your shoulders
Who really cares anymore 
Than let life go
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
For a girl who couldn't choose between
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Why do I worry about one
My muscles feel like a melee, my body's curled in a "U" shape
I took my time, I hurried up
Would leave you alone
Old friend, why are you so shy
The clubs are all closed down
And to me it sounded like you meant forever, ever
Oh, James, my love for you is stronger, don't you know
But who needs them now, displaced they're easily more safe
And when things have changed
Straight down the line
As the words that we'll hang from
You've got some kind of family there to turn to
I feel so alone on the Friday night
Wondering, when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved
A cold war kid in McCarthy time
And they say it's the fairest of all
Use my hands to use my heart
You just close your eyes
Our eyes are in the flowers
Belied your fort of lace
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
You are the ways of my mistakes
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
And rise to meet you rightly
I'll cry about this
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
See you're high and lonesome
And if I died right now you'd never be the same
Then he turned around and headed home again
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
Like the stars hold the moon
Good love
Threw my smoke down on the ground
Water and dust
Please don't turn your back, I
I promise one day I'll come back for you
And I couldn't help but fall in love again
You would, you would if this was a movie
It's all in your mind
I don't know you, but I still want to
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else
I got a life to lead, America
I think I, I believe I
Tomorrow's turned up dead
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost
Remember all of those days
Sorry, my headphones fell off
Like a bad tempered prom queen at a homecoming dance
Until you turn eternal, we belong
Stormy weather
Strong as I feel It meant the world to hold a bruising faith
I feel I can't hold on
You cannot come and see me, for I set myself apart
If morning never comes for either one of us,
I can play you tonight
And we're only but a second away
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
They don't know you, they don't even mind the weight
Shoulda known you'd bring me heartache
They are knocking now upon your door
Looking out across the next few days
And I knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for me Too heavy for me 
I'm not bitter anyway,
You don't know how hearts yearn
It is not a habit, it is cool I feel alive
And when you left you kissed my lips
In white light
But she's nobody's baby now
Into the haze of time recalled
You were always there
Tuesday night at the Bible study
In the morning, through the window shade
And thusly it ends 
Just keeping the peace between these sheets
I felt so vacant you treat me like a child
Such pain as this
And we've been dead for a while
On a Valentine's day
Now that it's light
That I cannot say
Sometimes, sometimes
But I'll be back, don't try and follow me
Let's follow the cops back home
Don't turn back to me
Turn my nights to sleepless itch
Is that alright
Before you go turn around, let me hold you
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
I don't want to be cold
It goes like the clouds
If you often smile
They've been going nowhere for days
What can I say, I am left behind
And I wear all your old clothes, your polo sweater
He says close your eyes, sometimes it helps
For every time he tried to break you down
I could die from the words that you say
I wanna watch cartoons with you  Josie and the Pussycats and ScoobyDoo
Got me ten feet off the ground
Once undone
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
As you tear and tear your hair from roots,
Tell the whole world I've gone insane
Baby says I can't come with him
She wanted more from life than he could give
But I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and misery
But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
A lump in the snow 
Green limousine for the redhead
In the morning, the film crews start arriving,
Two sides twist and then collide;
It could never be the way I loved you
Words come into meaning
Oh mother, we're stronger
'Cause on a cold day, you can walk through metal
Oh, a little bit possessive, little miss obsessive
I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee
There's no end to the love you can give 
I just wanna go back to being the same
I don't want to be old and feel afraid
Daddy, please hear this song that I sing
Where is your sense of indignation
Over and over in my brain again
From a distance my choice is simple
Look out on a summer's day
I need another place
Take apart my fantasy 
Our love was made for movie screens
I am done
Ooh ooh
He drowns in his dreams
Starting small, and grow in time
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
We may be just a little fuzzy 'bout it later tonight
Lonely little love dog that
You looked all over town
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
Cette chanson, Les Feuilles mortes,
When this broken world mends its foolish ways
We're talking about our lives,
Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone
I reach my cold arm across the bed
It made me miss you oh so bad 'cause
All those lonely nights, lonely nights
And I'm glad you got away but I'm still stuck out here
I think of all the friends I've known
You held my hand so tight
Hello, Heaven, you are tunnel lined,
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
I loved your son for his sturdy arms
Yellow roses in the graveyard
Ever so sweet,
How this fell apart
But it's a long walk and the music is loud
Sail us to the moon
You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light
You took my hand and danced with me
Ain't a love as perfect 
Or your face as you were leaving
Sing out loud "We all die"
I got no expectations 
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall
In a beautiful world
You'll discover that casual friends kept notes in their pockets to remember your name
Nobody loves noone
Did you see mine
I can't beat myself, I can't beat myself and I don't want to talk
Is there someone new now
Like I did last year
Am I the only lonely one of you
Harness your blame and walk through
Your dry blood on my fingertip
'Cause all that's left has gone away
Mama, put my guns in the ground
With cold, cold Campbell's from the can
There are friends who never call me anymore
I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
That hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
When nobody's watchin'
And she can hardly breathe without you
In my mind
Roll, roll, roll away, away, away, away
I tried my hand
When I loved you
But you keep my old scarf
She was my woman, I love her so
I'm well aware of how it aches
She knew they were destined to become sacred roadkill on the way
She'd scolded me for my sinful and wicked ways
Had no one ever
And someone, they could have warned you
Memories are fresh
All head south
There's people making lonely sometime
And I can read between the lines
Of this man
Don't wanna try no more
Where I go to sleep alone
Laughin' and kissin'
We spend our days together
A zombie hides my face
And Dublin in a rainstorm
When I was young I knew everything
Keep us stuck here In the comfort, and the fear
This might be the time to break down
Someone good
You make me feel like your whole world
But I'm still trying to find it
I held her hand but I don't hold it now
We've got a war to fight
Now you mail back my things
Seems like your trying to bring me down
Don't cry
Every direction leads me away
So now it's just another lonely day
I die here as your friend or lover 
No other words would do 
But only in the street man
Greg was always getting net from  feet away  feet away
Tired of singing all the sad songs in my head,
That you feel while listening to every word that I sing
I'm so tired but I can't sleep
That I can't say what's going on
But I am closer to the clouds up here
And you don't wanna look much closer 
Inside of me, yeah inside of me, inside of me
We hope your rules and wisdom
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
Arrive in time to catch the late show
And I hoped you would
Learn to say good bye
You're not alone in trying to be
Yeah yeah yeah
The wheelies are cutting pavement and the skeksis at the rave meant
All because of you, Jenny Wren
I know you've supported me for a long time
Fix my meals and go away
To change anything
One final dance with him
Tomorrow it may change
Good good bye, good good night
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize 
He was so very nice, he was so very kind
Then you hang up the phone and feel badly for upsetting things
You worry so much about not having enough time together
Where is the madness that you promised me
Reach the light inside
Here by my side
Not the name that you call me with
Lonesome tears, I can't cry them anymore
The time when we counted every black car passing
The way my broken heart is hurting me
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky, 
I can stop and catch my breath
The night plays games
Wait for the year to drown
It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again
I don't wanna be the reason why
I'm a river that is all dried up
All of the things you've always run from
And sometimes I just ain't in the mood
You are so fragile and thin
So will you hold me please,
Turn the land into waste
No more lies
I will never let you fall
But I turn them off, and tuck them away,
I'm gonna stay eighteen forever Cut me open
I wanted it this way
Can't find it in my soul
You won't cry for my absence I know
And Mary, after all the pain is gone
I won't tell anyone
I, can't believe my bones
Still laughter pours from under doors in this house,
The shameless kiss of vanity
Still I remember scenes
What has happened to love
So far To pull me up, take the pain
Leaving him empty just because he's a man
Lonely, lonely that was you
All of these traffic signs and lonesome bars blindsiding me and
You're just a human, a victim of the insane 
Can I hold you one last time
For a little while, so did I
Sundays will never change
Maybe I'm to blame for his short bitter fucked up life
And holds you
Still ain't got a job
Everybody says
Better change, before it's too late
Don't be scared Don't be scared
And it must just be the kids
I spoke to you in cautious tones
To even say these thoughts aloud
And I'm thinking about those days
I'm here for the hard times
Like I'm inside your life, I'll follow you forever
It's a picture perfect evening and I'm staring down the sun
But still, you've not passed by door
It's like they're scared of me
Some nights, I just never go to sleep at all and I stand
Your ass it draws me in like a Bermuda highway
Let's go and trip a dwarf"
When it comes to this, oh
We know something's wrong
Who's gonna walk you
If all the sons, all the daughters, stop to take it in
Out of control on videotape
I see the girl I wanna be
Your love was like candy
Our coats aren't in disguise
She went down down down there into the sea
And if I have been unkind
Was trying to get to work on time
I come bearing forgiveness
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Dark skin of a summer shade
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Don't want to be alone
He grabs me by the shoulder and he tells me
The time for sleep is now
Rebel, my new last name
Once my life was plain and clear
I killed a party again
A patient better driver
Well then, there's hope yet
I guess I never will
All this having been done
Come back home from bars
And I think she's gone but I'll be sure for safety's keeping
Left aching in my mind
I'm through trying now, it's a big relief
I look tough enough
He said, "The truth is you'll be okay, anyway"
She got a bottle of tequila, a bottle of gin
That looked familiar
And then I was on top
We look so alike that it makes me shiver
'Cause I'm a bird girl 
If you'd never left these streets
Here I am left in silence
When the thunder calls for me
Wrong or right, black or white
It's only your shadow, filling the room
How can I instill such hope, but be left with none of my own
We'll float in space, just you and I I could still fall in love with you
You know I plan to retire someday
But now Ebonics rule our song
With heaven's help
I shiver and I scrape at your door
To the seal's watershed
Counting his questions in the neon light
This is my snow covered home
You know they say it's better
They kick the chair but we, we helped tie the rope
There's no one here 
I searched for joy but I bought it all
How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say
I hold no grudges
It's just a shame
She doesn't need him
Now true colors are showing
You can't love too much one part of it
I'm tired of feeling nothing, goodbye"
I wish that I could tell you something oh oh
This place is a prison
Please don't go, I want you to stay
But sometimes
My twitching muscles tease my flippent thoughts
I'd rather live outside
I am walking the cow
You have gone too far 
And then you'd bring me home 
But now I feel changed around, and instead of falling down I'm standing up the morning after
Hold us still when everything spins
It doesn't make me smile
To take you in my arms
Every touch is sacred when they leave the room
It's a small crime and I've got no excuse
Get up, get the gunge
I'm clenching my ticket to the only way out
The night has always known when it's time to get going
Ever returning you
Just one more line I repeat over and over again
Stand in the corner, smoking
I learn to cry for someone else
I hope you find this gift
Walking through the city streets
Turned away in disgrace
Send this smile over to you
Because I'm pretty when I cry
Hope fills the heart
We're all doctors trading sadness for numbness
You really got a hold on me
Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone
You're vicious and romantic;
A place that I can share with you
And you're still safe and sound
Of an endless static sea
And is he dark enough
We hardly talked
You say it so loud, but you sound far away
Now you'll just become
In love together, we found a way
Of things heard only in Hell
I see the shadows that we cast in the cold, clean light
And they all look the same
Given you a reason to stay 
Were always done in such a hurry
The stupid thing that will come to pull us apart
Oh it's been such hell, I wish you well, I hope you're safe tonight
Help me get back to your arms
Once the police made you go away
And if I should die before I wake
For all time
While across the room he stares
It's full of charts and facts and figures
I never meant to sound like this
I know it's time to face all of my past mistakes
I wish I could just make you turn around
All that we were, all that we knew
I've got my heart 
Today we escape
'Cause I'm so used to living underneath the surface
I come clean out of love with my lover
Sinking slowly, the waters higher
Say, would you let me cry on your shoulder
And the history books forgot about us
So I won't hear a thing
That I have torn her apart so many times, so many times
The ugly truth
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
Well you do enough talk
Try to push it back
Under blankets and warm sheets
In the cold light of morning 
Don't talk to me, no
These are the parts of your body 
What day is gonna pick you, baby
Said, "Never pick sides, never choose between two"
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
I'm your bewildered child
In between tonight I know it's Ta'zo
I remember cheering from the towers
You swallow me
Ever since the day I left you
When you beam it out all across the sky
It blows like garbage through the streets
Drinkin' tea in bed, watching DVDs
I guess than you did leave me something to remind me of you,
Forgive us now for what we've done
I break in two, and each piece of me dies
And you can tell anybody
Things that were clean, things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
When I get back let's disappear without a trace
Ever so sweet,
Both tender fire and bitter squall
The day
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
I am from the moon, I am from the moon, I am from the moon,
Go back to your chamber, your eyes upon the wall
I rush to intensive care
You turned your eyes to me
You're gonna walk alone
I hate you
I never had no, no one ever
Die Unendlichkeit bestaunt
O and all you folks, you come to see
The promises you'll only make
And buy whatever we can't seem to grow
Though he's gone
I'm down here by the bay where the water pounds
Will dance
Never meant to hurt anyone
With just your song to say goodbye
Ooh ooh, a little fistful
Tell me everything is wonderful now
That goes without saying
The moment you were gone
It will pass away like a slow parade
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
I fell apart, I fell apart 
Heads are holes and clouds
And if it makes you sad, remember all the things you have
I cried like a baby
You neglect your wings like you don't need them
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
That I would be good, even if I got the thumbs down
All down the day
'Cause the good thing's coming
So these lighter days can soon begin;
Four months of calm seas
Late at nightlike a bird calling out,
I love 'most everything that you bring to this offering
Let me love you
Everybody wants to be someone's here
And down when the work's been done
And he's changed his tone of voice
Not many people want me at their parties
She'd walked away
I live all those moments again
I bite my lip
All I want is nothing more
I know I've got to say
And I'm saying goodbye
Ada, don't stay in the lake too long
They keep you close to me my dear
Are those dreams inside your head
Tryin'a find my place some place, oh I, oh I, oh I
To shine a light on your life
And they all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense
I think I'm coming undone
For pseudoboy who would rather wear a blouse
A whisper from your father couldn't fix it
Down to earth then sinks the sun
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
Spread the word of consciousness you seek 
I, I've been thinking about you, baby
I cannot keep what isn't mine
'This feel never goes
Where should I hang my head
You're well out of order now, this is well out of town
I tried to show you just how much I care
A Russian life was very sad
Turned my head and I heard the sound, that reminded me
Free in our love
I guess I've had it with you and your career
The sun drops
Please come back home
Until a new one comes along
Rejoice, rejoice, God's ears are stitches
A part of your soul ties you to the next world
I'm glad you came around today
To feel alive
Like a burning
Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone
We're ripped apart by the crow and the vultures
Upon the pain getting deeper
I know there's someone
I'm gonna be gone for good again
We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
And Laura's asleep in my bed
I need you, I don't need you
My leather glove grips the wheel
Let me put on a show for you, tiger,
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
Watching at the sky
They're gathering round with all my friends
Cause every time you fight the scars are gonna heal but they're never gonna go away
Damn the government
Well, I listen to the weather
A lover's lap where I can lay my head
You say you need no one,
Dear friend goodbye
Not some demon, not your father
Let's pin splitblack ribbon onto your overcoat
The same old tears
I never thought I'd die alone
Take a day plant some trees
Gray light, new day leaks through the window
So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
From this dark trailer park life now,
I looked at the Rubens and Rembrandts
I was going round and round the hotel garage
And thrown it all away but
I'm glad you stood in my way
And my old friends, we were so different then
I just really need your ass with me
And I thought you wouldn't have to keep
While you are away, my heart comes undone;
In the morning, in the winter shade
Mine, mine, you were always mine
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
I saw him in my dream
Moonlight on the soft brown earth
Or your biggest mistake
Laugh like you did back when
It makes me very lonely
What to believe
Fifteen years gone now, I still wander this parapet
I've got to make a point these days,
And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
The flan in the face
All at once you look across a crowded room
I still recall the taste of your tears
With our eyes
And all that really mattered then was that I was a man
Flush my worries down the drain
And you can see my heart beating
She doesn't have to say a thing
Wasting our time
China white, my bride tonight
I still have a flame gun
Better come
She's just the way she is but no one's told her that's okay
I'm not fine, and I'm in pain
When she does stupid things
For breaking your heart
Scraping through my head 'til I don't want to sleep anymore
I will look
Raised in a wild space
I wanna come in from the cold
I've got the picture, long gone
Too many years I've cried over you
There is a time and place
He was selling cocaine
At ten, I shaved my head and tried to be a monk
Your cold, white brother riding your blood
So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home; Takes you home, boy
You think your days are ordinary
Oh, just a little bit wrong
All the time and everywhere
And wishing I was was ten again
Never found our way
Pain won't go, rest in peace
And my mouth's to dry to rage
As the skyline splits in two
Another world
The moment's already passed, yeah, it's gone
Just look up to the stars
'Cause nothing's going right
It feels like we're oceans apart
Of the human race's vice
In the pictures
How did he learn to hold fruit in his hands,
You're the only angel in my life
The darkest country road
I've journeyed here and there and back again
Anybody who comes
A woman now standing
Oh and when your friends say,
And we don't want to go outside tonight
Your cry for inspiration
My love is pure
It's so dark outside
It's ladies night, all the girls drink for free
Is there some idea to replace my life
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
You couldn't have done
Who died with me
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
And sometimes I despair
Like a daydream or a fever
'Cause in my dreams I see you again
It's as thin as our skulls yet it's thicker than air
A black wind took you away
You were only four, but lord you remember it
It never ends
Somebody's not paying attention to
He came back the other day
I may be a fool
How my heart gets torn
She was raised in a New England village
I said I hate me, myself and I
Heartbreak did this
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Maybe it's all right,
I remember everything
Looking out across the next few year
I take away your pain
I rip my heart out
She's havin' a baby
I felt much of the pain
The circus awaits and you're already gone
And I was meant for you
Nothing left to lose
A certain callousness complies
Would you feel the same
I woke up and you were saying
Burned to glass
All my time until I die but I don't believe, I don't believe
My body lies inside its grave
I'm a fugitive that has no legs to run
What a fool I've been
I never thought my whole life would change
Over one last time
You're a sadeyed lie
At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back
I keep on singing, your eyes they just roll
I could never kill a man
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
That look you give that guy
No one laughs at God in a hospital
Just one kiss and I'm alive
You couldn't love me more
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it, yeah
To find a way to say that life has just begun
But my feelings can�t know for sure
Will I see you on the other side
In the cold light 
And from each tiny caravel
But you are unfixable
Whose name I never could pronounce
Menu, write message, so where are you and Simone
Swirling clouds in violet haze
And a lark was heard in the still
Your hand's on my crutch
Well I was thinking how it must feel
I can show you I'll be the one
I attain my dream
Rejoice because you're trying your best
Yes, it shows
My heart is telling you
And I don't want to start over again
Be at peace baby and be gone
'Cause nobody told me
She's never gonna love you
What was I thinkin' about Ah who cares, I'm maaaashed
Treading on people's toes
I feel her heart move through her chest
Read me your favorite line
It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present, you know what I mean
Wrong until you make it right
Because of you
Are you cool with just tonight
She could pull the sun right through me, oh
Because these days aren't easy
Oh my love 
In the afternoon sky
Where feelings mean nothing
To our love send a coffin of wood
And now your altitude and memory's a shame
I wish that I could stay but you argue
Way oh, way oh, way oh, way oh
It's not hard to fall
Broken this fragile thing now
City bird, maybe these hands that feed you need you
And I knew that you were a truth
A warm summer's day
But you never let 'em show
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
See, the cage, it called I said, "Come on in"
Told her, "Wherever you go, little runaway bunny, I will find you"
The girl I thought I knew has gone
Hello I'm your mind giving you
As their shoes fill up with water
So if you call
That stole my broken soul
I can't take my eyes off you
You're the prayer inside me
These days we go to waste like wine
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
It comes with no reply
My lover came to me and we'd lay
Or change the moment when it's gone
Nobody's seeing red
He had everything a man could want, power, grace and style
I work these hands to bleed 'cause I got mouths to feed
Have you abandoned me
I wish you'd hold my hand when I was upset
As we are to the world but I guess you would know that
Since the apple wasn't there, yeah
'Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow, goodbye for now
Are the wonders of my world
There's no way I'm forgetting this
We might as well be living in another time
There hangs a lonely photograph
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
And I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started
But that's not the shape of my heart
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
You lying, trying waste of space
When we were kids, when we were young
And this'll be the first time in a week that I'll talk to you
Look at ya, look at ya
It floods the sky and blurs the darkness like a chandelier
Or maybe to the last, but I'm still not sure
'Member when I was so sick and you didn't believe me
The laughter's all gone but the memories are mine
I was alive from the first now I'm denied by the ghost of you
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
The walking through walls
Take what you need and be on your way
I'll do my crying in the rain
Yes, now you're gone
Remember one thing, the dream you can see
And it's not the good kind
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Jackie oohoohooh
And I won't feel like this forever
Suppose it's just a point of view
So come on courage, teach me to be shy
Life, life is a pigsty
Lord, here comes the flood
Coming for to carry me home
After all the time we spent together
I've fallen down
And try to stay outta hell
Where the highway met deadend tracks
Tiny tears make up an ocean
Now all the things you had, they aren't the same
I'll stay our here all night, it doesn't even matter
But my heart is wild And my bones are steam
Walk past the gates
"I'll die alone"
What do I need you for
When the lives we lived are only goldenplated 
I close my eyes, it's all the same
Happens all the time, love
Who keeps singing over everything
With your hand in my hand, still feel the love
Then you smiled the whole way through it
And every time you're driving home
Come back to me my darling
Late last night, I made my plans
Clear the way for my crash landing
It was in the march of the winter I turned seventeen
He brings her to her feet till she can no longer stand
And I loved the way you looked at me
Consoled a cup of coffee, but it didn't wanna talk
Yes, I have surrendered what made me human and all that I thought was true
One touch and I'm crying
If you still care don't ever let me know
Will follow you around
Hang my head, break my heart built from all I have torn apart
But now it seems that moment has arrived
Everything makes me nervous
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
All the shadflies run at once
Until the day you die, this is no easy ride
You'll never know the way it tears me up inside to see you oh oh
And all my words were bound to fail
And that I've been dying yeah
Never had a drink that I didn't like
I no longer hear the music
The smell of cold, car seat is freezing
We are walking on a thin line
You ran me all around
Till you cry when you're driving away in the dark
They're putting up reindeer, singing songs of joy and peace
It shouldn't have been anyway, no way, no way, no way, that's right
I've been wandering around wondering how
I can feel the blood rushing though my veins
And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together,
Put my little red party dress on
'Cause this is how things ought to have been
Want you in the world
Help, I have done it again
And something has got to give
Oh is the main thing calling me back
And the charred remains of our country
My heart's burned
If I was rude
And the world is so tough
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
Close to nothing at all 
So some say love is a burning thing
'Cause I'm here to say that I sometimes do
Maybe I had just a glimpse of your soul
I'm always there with you
Can you believe she repeated that
But this is my life
So I swore, nonetheless, up and down, it was only me
For your anger to end
In everyone that's out on the street
Let me feel I'm falling
One more little one, I'll go down
Love me, love me
For that second chance
You put the good times into my fun
I always find the words to say to keep you right here waiting
There's nothing to see here now
And nobody makes us wait
Dear darkness, dear darkness
I love you
People won't be dressed in black
The door is closed again
We're in pieces 'cause you're over us
I'm battle scarred
How we break each other's hearts
Can return the love that was stolen
Am I bleeding from the storm
My black shroud
It's so real but it�s in my mind
I get lost and I can't sleep 
What's so different this time that you can't ignore
All the times, that I could beg you please, in vain
Through the tears and the laughter
They can see that he's just a fool
She held the world upon a string
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground
Yes, you build that wall
If I only had an answer to put it all to bed
Just to prove I was right
This is a place where I feel at home
I'm not ready for you now, please don't hate me
Every night, alone now
To tell you I was just a lie
Everything's stinking
No longer shall you need
That when the bell rings I just don't want to go home
The things you did then
Wednesday morning at five o'clock
By the way my words were fading 
This time I have had enough
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
I will not take my love away
Hey Lucy, I remember your name
And violins would play here comes the bride
And why leave me sailing in a sea
After the show you walked right past
When there won't be a moon and there won't be a sun 
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset
It's sad so sad, so sad
Revealed in the sky, to leave all behind
Replaced by every day
Can we dance upon the tables again
It's out of love, ooh
I watch you sleep, you look so peaceful
Nobody's gonna come and save you
Don't know how else to say it
But fall asleep next to me
I loved you
Hold me in your thoughts, take me to your dreams
Would it help if I turned a sad song on
Me and my valuable friend can fix all the pain away
Brought back something,
The how I can't recall
As I paced back and forth, all this time, 'cause I honestly believed in, you
Wishes with a blue songbird on his shoulder
'Cause the good thing is coming
'Cause when a lover aches
But Christmas falls late now
But there is one thing you must understand
And it's been ten days without you in my reach,
But forever's gone away
'Cause on a cold day, you can see forever
I'll be around the bend
And I guess that's what it takes
As I fall, as I fall
With words you used to say 
But I'm disappointed in you
Empty stares from each corner of a shared prison cell
"You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
Down in the sleep at the airplane races
Is getting away from you again
Tell me why I can't be there where you are Can't be there where you are
Some say that time changes,
Can you feel me
And we'll never miss a party This offer
Yeah I'm free yeah I'm free yeah repeating in background
Your hand on his arm, haystack charm around your neck
There is love left in my life, I will see
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
And now I see it's all but a game
And do everything
My love is strong now
Bet you're sorry now, I won't be coming home tonight
Plump bodies blotting out the sky
But if love is like stone
Until the end
You gotta get out 
Still nothing's heard
Saying, "I'd sell off my savior for a set of new rings
Downtown
But sober with no place to go
I swore I'd never feel like this again
I hold you and your eyes fall down
My friend
It's all downhill from here
And negativity lands
Wenn sie dir nicht gefallen, stör dich nicht weiter dran
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
That I clutched you in my arms
And that's all I need
You're gonna make 'em scream someday
His light went out
I truly understand Please, don't cry now
This used to be our pride and joy
Oh I wish you could see the love in her eyes
Till I heard my dying mother sing Old Rugged Cross
You firefly, you tiny boat, with oars
Greed's all gone now, the panic subsides
And every forest sings a song
There are so many skirts under the table,
And I'll say anything to make her feel alright
Lady, all the troubles are my fright, I disgust you
You know life can be long
Ten guys on whom I can depend Thought you were my boyfriend
You see, my old man's got a problem
Or are we ashes
Loves her as a girl
And the best is yet to come
You are impossible, Delilah, the princess of denial 
Ever falling down
And I swore way too much
Every corner abandoned too soon
Oh, but I know you care
The horses are coming
We'll waste some time
I never saw the truth hanging from the door
Don't look down
Though all the world is broken
Always die
Just him and the secret he was keeping
Really wish that we could go back to the way that it was
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
What are we gonna do
You'll always be my Konstantine 
All pleasures the same, it just keeps me from trouble
This anniversary may never be the same
Who can't stay away from you
Totus desiderabilis
I feel lost
And here I am in this uniformish pantsuit sort of thing
Unkiss me, untouch me, untear this heart, yeah yeah
Fucking make up your mind, stop dragging it on
Off forever
Well come on and break the door down
And the footsteps are getting louder
You'll always be my favorite one
And finally drank away her memory
It's not what I believe in
You're watching them as they're looking at you
She wonders if he'll even remember
If I could look across the country
And your Daddy was an alcoholic
Now tears allowed,
I tried counting sheep but there's one I always miss
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I've seen the brightness in one little spark
And I say there's trouble when everything is fine
Voices carried
The buildup lasted for days 
Wrap around me
Telling all the things you hide
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
No wasting away
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
No, no, no, no Melanie C I will help, help you on your way, I will be with you every day
Of a world left without it
I've been talking drunken gibberish
Disagree on the sidelines
I'm so cold from fear
So why did you bawl
But maybe you should plug it with a beer, cause 
Then build it again by the light in the hall
He's gone so far to find no hope
The government is corrupt
'Cause she's folk, so play it, maybe she'll come
Come to think of it, his name was it was you
And the critics are severe
I'll fall asleep tonight
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
Couldn't look you in the eye
But why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why
Lay some flowers
Arms outstretched into the sky
Perfect lies from a perfect dame
Please take it easy it can't all be my fault
Around the holy kingdom
Half painful instrumental
I'd hear how my mother cried for him
And when I arrive, I won't know anyone
Falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Baby, sometimes
And all my life that now disturbs my fingers
Let's have an extended play together
So now I head back up the steps
Now if you're calling me out,
There's one thing causing you trouble
She can't see the way your eyes
This love is fading way too fast 
No one looks like minglin', I can't see her or him
The distance that keeps you 
It's harder everyday
You know that I am home
On the streets of Philadelphia
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
It was dark as I drove the point home
And the billboards are all leering
And I'll tell the world
But I'm always crashing in the same car
Clothes of sand have covered yor face
The broken lights on the freeway left me here alone
The open window lets the rain in
And turn this up on the radio
The caves of our mouths are forest darkness
That we never did
Since the operation I heard you're breathing just for one
I think I want to change my air, my atmosphere
But I swear in the days still left 
To the way it was before
Looking at this world through my eyes
I heard that you were feeling sorry
Of the unfinished line
In somebody's life
My wretched world
I sensed my loss before I even learned to talk
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
this dance is out of rhythm
When it's summer in the city
Take a look, you may see me in the dirt
It's my redemption time for redemption
In love with a molester who's sexin' her crazy
Running far, running fast to the dead
You know I'm down on my knees
It floats like the sky
At the end of the dark passageway
It didn't get there by itself
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
That trick ain't worth the time it buys
With my salty tears
And I'm outside your house
Well if we take all these things and then bury them fast
Until we're home
And rob their houses
I know, love
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed
And back to the 
Tears are falling down endlessly, woah
In this song and rhyme
So if you get a second to look down on me now
Keep me in your heart for a while
I'm attracted to the light, I'm attracted to the heat
At another window
'Cuz nothing else matters
Then I'd run over to your house
But that was a million years ago
You heard me on the radio about one year ago
And when you kiss me
Everything to me
That soon your face will fade away 
And everything I will give is everything you couldn't take
I would still lay down my life for you
parecido a ayer 
And now I'm riding, all over this island
And colder than yours
Goodbye my friend
I'm not afraid of anything 
I'll keep your memory vague
Knows all these parts Cause my jealous heart can't take that
She says, I can sing this song so blue
I see that kissme pucker forming 
Stuck on the end
Maybe I would have been something you'd be good at
But for some reason you didn't
'This wonder always leaves
Sleep alone tonight
There are no signs and there are no stars aligned
Somebody to cry for
I am outside and I've been waiting for the sun
With nothing holding me
And I'll throw it in the current that I stand upon so still
She had wellconditioned hair
He's the smell of the moonlight wisteria
You need her
That I never, ever, ever felt this way 
For now its just another lonely day
'Cause I'm the girl who kisses the dawn
But I gotta find more than what's happening with you
Through the lights of Beacon Street
No, I'm not sorry if I do insult you
Feel the volume of the sky
And love is just a camouflage, for what resembles rage again
As cars and people pass
I won't call you names
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And the time rewinds to the end of May
Years go by, will I still be waiting
I don't wanna hold you
Only particles, some fast, some slow,
One more night, the end should be a good one
Never now I need the other and if you're suffering a lot
No I never was
I've seen sunny days that I thought they would never end
My baby
And no more will I say, dear heart
Here, broken and cold, with great remorse
And fly away to someone new
Stray my love what's wrong my love
I can't swim in the silence of your skin, skin, please let me in
I been with you for too long to start over with another
A black sheep boy revolves
I'm screaming out for a second try
Where I lay my head
They're not around you
I thought hell if it's over
And the next time she tries to feed you collard greens
Take me You're sorry, you swear it, you're done
When you think you've had too much of this life to hang on
It's dark in here
So I try to hold onto a time when nothing mattered 
How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
The black Air Force sergeant was not the first one
You couldn't be there, why couldn't you say to me
Oh this is just a dream
Your hair is black, your eyes are blue
I will not open myself up this way again
You're much to busy to even find the time, 
Cause homeboy just got you crushed
And there's nothing left here to remind me
She is starting to live her life from the inside out
Aww, this skin
No need to focus
Deep, deep, deep in the heart of your sins
I wake up, it's a bad dream, no one on my side
Take us anywhereoh yeah
I'm a solitary man
And I intend to love you
But I'll show how I'm feeling until all the feeling has gone
How many hearts will die tonight
Good things will pass
And I slam the door
A black sheep boy grows horns
Oh heart of steel, don't kill thy song
I'll float away
It'd come as such a show
I've served my time 
And then later, when it gets dark
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was x
Oh, yeah, yes 
Yeah, she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me
That it just is, 'cause everybody dies 
White walls surround us
I kicked in the door
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
For a boy my age
Everyone of us has hope for you, for you, for you, for you
I wanna live life, be good to you
Now all we wanna do is go to red places
You got wires coming out of your skin
At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
For the reason to see the pain through
Sing me anything,
Everyone of us is hurt and everyone of us is scarred
Down an endless hole
The thought of all the stupid things I'd done
From my cold and tired brow
That's what I was tryin' to do
In the living room when you kissed my neck
Is this song to you Ooh Ooh Ooh
The office was a dungeon where you hid your fears of
She had a dream, woke up in shock
All the change in my life just fell away
As I look the other way
Woman ¡Hola Manu Nada, solo para saber si todo va bien, y nada Un beso muy fuerte ¡Venga
And all of birds will sing to your
These are the words I can't erase
Why can't you believe
'Cause you wanna say hey I love you to everybody
Just a little bit
So I'm just waiting on fate to come
And the flowers fell out of her hand
And he loves her as a girl
I think I need to find a bigger place
These colors will not change, you change the way I see them
Hello helicopter, are you here to stay
Put off on your son
While you still have control of the flame
A child to your chest that could lay as you sleep
At least I remember taking them and not a lot else
There are places I'll remember
Would you follow every line on my tearstained face
Though I made plans with you to always have time for you
That in time things would change
What makes it so easy for you to be walking by
And all this like a message comes
For all the Mommy things she's done
"If you're so funny
Give me something that I need
I got two left feet, no, I'm no Jackson neither
Mama, don't go, daddy, come home
I seen you sitting out on your steps
Mate bells me to borrow money
I thought I saw your face today
Of my world
May we meet again in another life
'Cause there's no one there
And the people that you've been with,
And the angel who looked upon him
The building turned its back, ignored my call
So I look to my Eskimo friend
Now I will find relief
For we all know the baby has expired
It's gonna be alright save you
Escaping one last time
Oh I never thought it would be easy
Saw you last night
And a place to stay
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are
And keep evil away
By the river
I've been searching
Given time she may find something better
Is this the way it's gotta be
Missing all the cracks in the pavement
I did not understand
I am crying, a part of me is dying and
Caught me making eyes 
The low fuel lights been on for days
And I still feel you everywhere
For the love of the living and the live cut free
Just bring me back my girl
Here on earth
It is not these hiding places that have kept us innocent
They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right," and it's tonight
Now I watch as tables turn
And I get more than my share
Wild is the wind
The brightest flame burns quickest"
And I've been drunker than a skunk
Keep myself away,
You make me feel like I am whole again
I'm'a try to be a big girl now
Believe me when I tell you
Inside my bedroom all alone
I'm listening, but there's no sound
And I remember quiet evenings trembling close to you
All the love I felt hadn't been in vain
Maybe we didn't understand
You pack my peace of mind 
Send it in a letter, make yourself feel better
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
Oh babe, I hate to go
Looked away,
And I may seem unashamed
Poetry is no place for a heart that's a whore
The one who would never never
With fading lights that lead us past the lives that we destroy
Fighting for a lost cause
Goodbye my love
In between tonight and my tomorrows
This song will be here
Because this happens every time I knew it would
I got nothing left inside
To run and hide
The tight grip and the sun lick 
It's just sadness takin' hold
We are all the same
But why must truth always make me die
Like the ones we've wished on
The summer's gone, so are we
I'm so sad, sad
I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal
Is it a dream
Somebody please tell me, how can you stop the rain from falling down
As your solitude subsides
The way our horizons meet
Release to the sky, look him straight in the eye
Pain on pain on play repeating
And all the shops are closed 
The first time I saw you
Is almost everybody's question
Chorus in Sindarin alone
She has every reason to
Looking for special things inside of me, inside of me
I'm not going back, I can't pretend
And why do they always say
She never stays the same for long
Broken down and hungry for your love
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
When your day is night alone Hold on, hold on
To live a lie, it really got me all excited
Two to none
He has no one
Hide and Seek Speak no feeling no I don't believe you
It's times like these I forget what I miss
No, no, no, no Melanie C You know it's time to say goodbye, and don't forget, on me you can rely
I realize what I am now too smart to mention to you
As life carries on and on, and on, and on
Phone's off the hook
Till I forgot why I stayed
'Cause I will be gone
'Cause my days were rough
Would you hold my hand, no
We're out of time and I can't breathe x
This hex was delivered spent
You're gonna blow your mind
I'm waiting for the train
But you're not here to make my sad songs more sincere
I hope you find this gift 
But we fake, we fuss, and fracture the times
The hook is in deep, boys, there is no more time
No way to deny it
How did I let things get to me
It's getting me down, my love
And though the words tightening
Just live our lives, stigmatized
Last night something pretty bad happened
There may be smiles but a few
Go cry about it, why don't you
I need a phone call
As long as I can see, into your room and feel
But, I believe in you so much
Don't go gentle into the good night
And, James, he came to the door
And I will be right next you
If you only knew the way I feel
Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment Hopefully we will be able to in the future Until then how about a random page
'Cause I believe in me, yeah 
It's deeper than love
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
Passed it last night in a dream
I could never love you back
Just to ask them how you are
I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
The house, the house where
You don't know how lovely you are
I, I know how I feel when I'm around you
Weakened knees call
And now it's too late to hold you
Maybe it's time to find out where I'm at
And I will die all alone
With truth on our side
Maybe it would be nicer if I search out
Which one of us would be the foolish one
Everything is tragic, it all just falls apart
Always danger
That's why I can't love you in the dark
So by the morning light
For every job, so many men
Than the bells of new love
I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield
I heard all you said and I took it to heart
Now nothin' holds significance
Running over the same old ground What have we found
Something's getting in the way
Amphetamine AnnieDog
I was just so happy in your boxers and your tshirt
There's just this human heart that's built with this human flaw
She was cold and all alone do be do be do do,
They still eat their young
Everyone of us is scared, everyone of us is hurt
Has its place and form to fill
To be made of glass
Some things always stay the same
And I search for you in every passing car
And everything's reminding me of you
Where you trade in your blues
It shouldn't have been anyway, no way, no way, that's right, that's right
But you are everything to me
I was only dreaming
All my life, though some have changed
Like a castaway on a warm ocean
She's losing her mind, she's fallen behind
You can see her lying naked in your arms
Maybe you'll think of me and smile
To separate you from everything I do
Hello helicopter, are you lost out there
And I find peace when I'm confused
You turned a man to stone
Who knows, maybe the plans will change
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
With the perfect dream
It was everything I've waited for,
That you both have grown in a different way
Like shadows in a faded light
Was it just a dream
She's got sword in case
And I hang like a star
I don't need much of anything 
Like a thief in the night,
I wouldn't change a thing about it
I'm working on my backwards walk
Out of the nest, it's time
Nothing means a thing to me
Washing you out of my hair
Don't wanna try don't wanna try
Never have I turned since then
If you wanna come with me
Unbreak my heart, my heart, ooh
Say yes before I change my mind
Them back for all that shit on stage
You have a problem with the truth
Tired of dreaming of rest
At dead of night, 'til break of day
While the moon does its division you're buried below
The sacred geometry of chance 
And my heart is like ice
You know I need some understanding 
A song to say goodbye
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
I won't shiver in the cold
But it's you I take 'cause you're the truth not I
Is it the truth
I've always known it's true
I woke up today in London
Draw the bath and remind me to eat
All the things she says
I'm lost in the light
I have decided to start things from here
Your eyes are just like black spiders
There was no tomorrows and we'd packed away our sorrows
They will know how I love 
Without you I'm nothing at all
To collapse and call to them
'Cause someone's bound to hear my cry
Our hearts may break
The dizzy dancing way you feel
So close your eyes
It was late at night and we'd been driving since noon
Any town of any thought
Such a vicious world
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Make it up and you make a friend, ya
And a head that just takes up space
And a bolt of electricity
I'm gonna be the man who's waking up to you
That David played and it pleased the Lord
We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
But I still think it better if
And I start to miss you
Am I waking up at all today
I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time;
Dance by the light of the moon
Darkness falling, leaves nowhere to go
Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
I know it's gonna take some time
Please turn your back and walk away
Thanks for all you've done
We'll make it out of hereoh yeah
Pack your things and go, oh
Give up your books and put an end
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
Let us hold to each other
So walk with me
And everything good is happenin' somewhere else
Lonely is the room the bed is made
Oh I know that I love you, so please throw down your hair
Ja, ich habe ihn gern, weil er so hell und freundlich wirkt
James, he came to my place
Dass die Sonne an diesem Tag auch auf mein Grab scheint
But what I do is always come back to you
Oh meet me on the road
A monkey's built a house on your back;
Speaking words of wisdom, I want you to let it be
But we're trying hard to hold on
But someone, they should have warned you
Clear as a bell and sound as an old engineer
Why do you throw your days away
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
Looks just like a blood orange
It's over and you're gone
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under
My clothes are soaking wet from your brother's tears
Why you gotta be
The bathroom stalls
Mother don't worry, I've got a coat and some friends on the corner
That look on your face
What if there was no time
All of the things we want each other to be
Like a serpent's kiss
Now does that sound familiar
Living your ghost
And I'm dreaming in your living room 
And who will say that I stayed much too long
Crushing me inside
But I've had some time alone, to hone my lying technique
But no one
By what's beyond our bed
She claims society is just a fever dream
Don't keep me around
Bring down the government
And there's no more crying
Mmm, summer turned to winter
The pain has made you grow strong
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
You're the reason why I'm closed
Just break me to small parts
It's a dark road
Call it off, sorry refused
With every word that we'd speak
Together we always pull through
I'll always be thankful
That sinking feeling 
There's many scars
Just stay with me
So why'd you fill my sorrows
And sometimes you take a swim
"Stop crying and bring me my son"
What a waste
Just sitting here and trying to decipher
So you turn around toward the tiny girls who have got no tricks, who have got no past
Oh and imminent
To make this go away
You're crumbling, sadly
Is it could take my whole damn life to make this right
If I could end the quest for fire 
I won't deny the change
My calling, I'm calling at night
I'm under the gun again
The youthful boy below
Everything inside of my heart
Sometimes I think maybe I'm making a big mistake
If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry, about you
As bit by bit, it starts the need
I can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me YeahEh
This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean
Smell you on my hand for days
Give a little, just a little bit
I will hold you down, fold you in,
So, what if I never hold you, yeah, or kiss your lips again Whoa
And hold me now,
I know I'm alone now
If I had you here, I'd clip your wings 
I'll be waiting still impatient
You'd mean so much more if I remembered
After all I tried to do, stay away from loving you
I hung around there wasting my time
I will kiss you forever on nights like this
Don't say a word, Please don't leave
For those of whom still are not found
And all of the mothers raise their babies 
If you're needing something I can give
Gave you tools just to stay alive
I will feel my way down the darkened hall
Between light and nowhere
It was grass stain jeans and incompletes
With my hand on my heart
How can I forget your love
This isn't a mob, I won't need to change 
Oh mother, don't look back oh mother don't look back again
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
I'll never live the life that wakes me in the night 
It's because I'm thinking about a friend of mine who you don't know who is dying
I keep a leash around you
And the mind games
But I hope she smells my perfume
So deliberate so determined
Woooooh, Woooooh
All I see are dark gray clouds
And I rest my head on the tile floor
Only a man in a funny red sheet
For all those starving eyes to see
'Cause it's time that we'll tell if it's heaven if it's hell or if it's,
Oh, we're still fighting it, we're still fighting it
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
Is no feelings, no feelings now and never again
'Cause I'm feeling like
Lookin' in the gun's direction
Whatever you're doing now would probably suit me fine
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
Every line
Just nervous pacers bracing for bad news
And no one's looking anyway
You are the most beautiful entity that I've ever dreamed of
The lesson she learned when her memory serves
It's tearing me apart
It's hard to say I held my tongue
Oh but now I don't hate you I'm happy to say
That blows out the knots I've got in my long brown hair
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
And I'll ask for the sea
Yeah, I'm guessing this is growing up
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
He says "I'd rather switch with you
Golden days before they end
Nichts war zu spät
And cold war kids were hard to kill
That I need you here now
Oh, you say you hate me now, and you burn me with your words
I need a new direction to get me around
And in her eyes you see nothing
It's only fair to tell you now 
Needlework and seedlings
Those motherfuckers got it wrong
Desperately remained at home
On the hood of the car
Let me be with you tonight
I made the choice  I was wrong, you were right;
Dream about the days to come
And I'm weeping warm honey and milk
And all the people in a dream
So you can rest and repair
We can let it change our lives can braid
It's a sad, sad situation
I knew it would 
From the room upstairs
This was my worst love; you'll be the first to go
Until she'd rise and say
And into the room, is it always like this
I try to wash him out but like they say, the blood is thicker
I watch you dance, you look so happy
Must've felt just like old times
And dig up my bones from the clay
So hello from the other side
When it came to mind that I didn't care
People you hate will get their hooks into you 
Viva forever, I'll be waiting Melanie C I'll be waiting
Fading away
I wish I could say to you
If you want to show me
Never let your thoughts run free
Cause the sun it seems to sink now
That they forgot to close down
I sure do hope the road don't come to own me
My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
That's deeper than my pride
Trying to hold it together
To fall down at your door
And take a holiday
What you're all about these days
Oh, see that girl coming on down
My heart can't carry much more
Blowing smoke from my cigarette
Save it for the deathbed
Everytime I feel your touch,
On a lover's shore"
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
And now I've forgotten how to dream my own dream
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind
The things you told me to hear you speak
Would be like it was before
A good friend of American soldiers
Without you, and I know sorry ain't the cure
Me and you baby used to flush all the pain away
It's not somebody who's seen the light
As if on an ocean
Rude and sweet
I'mma break that birdies' neck
In Polaroids you were dressed in women's clothes
Is keeping perfectly still
Through the eye of the needle
Too much love will kill you
And your mouth, your mouth, your mind
That I laid you in your grave
Passedout in the gutter, wornout in your head,
Something is growing
Means for every point you make your level drops
They argue "Walk this way", "No, walk this way"
I gotta think about what wisecrack
Oh, in the perfect blue buildings,
Everyone will tell you there's no place to hide
He threw me away
I know I was a lot of things
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for
So tired of defending her life, she could have died
Like the rains outside
Down one to all the hopes and cares
Our ambition cuts us down 
But I came home early
I' m showing you all the cards
Why do you cry
And I die when you mention his name
When all I got is sinking sand
Was taken away, deliverance came
The sky is falling
And he'll become, become, oh, the prisoner I was
The shorter story
The stain in the carpet, this drink in my hand
Our love,
The light reflecting off the mirror ball 
Throw me tomorrow oh, oh
Midnight moon shines through it all 
For a latenight ride on your rodeo
Her name was Sheryl
My love GLORIA is love
Rocking back and forth
And took the stairs but didn't stop at the street
It's the love that came undone between us
Giving me head on the unmade bed
I bless your words and education
Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
I haven't talked to him, in  years
Hard luck, you've been trying to tame
Back to the same place I sat with you drink for drink
I just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed 
No quarter phone booth calls to home
Stars in the sky
'Cause I'm lonely for the big towns,
Movement release
But he looked a bit like me
It's summertime and though it's hard to see it's true possibilities
Of course I'll be alright
Peace will not come to this lonely heart
I look around the grave
I can't rely on a dime a day love that don't go anywhere
Just give me time
I don't do too much gambling these days
Seeing life in a new way
All of those nights,
And now the time has gone
When her clothes fall to a bundle and she's laid in bed
For the love of that girl
Where no thing of consequence can grow
Still scratching around
And when she was sad
But with nobody in your bed
If you let me have my way, I swear I'll tear you apart
I took off my glasses
Digging in caves to find the treasures of the land
Suffer fate 'cause it's the only lift you've got
You'll learn to say when
That the blood now had soaked
And I'm standing on air
Cause that is when, when I feel that I'm not just counting time
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
I am a mirror, with no reflection
I found out yesterday
Lost, enslaved, fatal decline
There's nowhere I can find peace 
Layers of dust and yesterdays
Baby, baby, please
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Folk singers sing songs for the working, baby
Where I grew up and found my feet
And every time you vent your spleen
With every hope and dream I've ever had in doubt
You were always on your own
A life with love is a life that's been lived
How could love be so thoughtless, so cruel
And you were gazing at the sky
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
We're all weeping now, weeping because
Nothing to hold, all hope deleted
Can't believe that I still want you And loving you I never should have walked away
I've got to let you know
I hate to feel the love between us die
I'd rather breathe than drown in sorrow
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
There's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing
Talk to the man who put you here,
Ohoho, it's dangerous, it's so out of line
I knew we were laughing at you
I guess I should go now
When she says her love is dead
Whatever you do, it's all good
Staying up all night, the satellite
So lay all your troubles down
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
So don't forget to breathe tonight
From all this gloom life can start anew
I don't know how to say
Well, I got tar on my feet and I can't see all the birds
But I'm not looking for an easy way out
All that I had was all I'm gonn' get
I thought we'd walk these streets together
This is the way you left me
Soul mate dry your eye
Crazy, all the lovers have been tagged
And I can't erase the things that I've done 
It's the worst kind of pain I've known
I stand no chance at all
I'm gonna follow the road and let the scenery weeping by
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am
Ain't no good thing
Where are you
And your broken wind chimes
I've got no one left to mourn for me
It shoulda been me inside that car
Lets drink to the memories that we shared
'Cause I saw the end, before we'd begun
And I can't stop from dreaming there's something else
Of tears from me
I guess you know by now
Is my heart breakin' on me
Of the nights we share
I've been told only fools rush in
You got me, I got you, you got me, I got you
It's the simple life for me
Remembering the good times from a portrait hung on high; Hanging so high
I wish I knew just what that means
Scraping the paint off the hardwood floors
And run away before I know
Come on baby and throw me a right to the chin
Ain't nothing stopping me now
My heart has been bruised
And when she left me for you, I was the last to know
You should've left the light on
I won't fake it like the other girls
Round the sea I'm not floating by the saints of heaven
And they're all still around
Where are we
I'm just running in circles all the time
And now you want me one more time
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
Hey, but I don't care 'cause sometimes
Riding with the windows down
She sleeps in, lies around, and then she goes out
Ada, put the sounds of your house in a song
But I always find a way to keep you right here waiting
I can see by the way you wash them clothes
You used to say I won't know a wind until it crossed me
I'm not coming home now
Pulling your puzzles apart
And every day I say 
We're throwing it all away
Something about this might
I won't break your heart
I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
And we'd still be ruled by our dueling perspectives
Why leave me hanging on a star
I wear my garment so it shows
But I'm gonna make it right
But I hate your guts
Pale under the blistering sky
And tell everyone you were a good wife
You foolish child
The clouds are rolling in
How I grieve now you're gone
On my face, I scrape my knees
Tried to point my finger
No sign of love behind the tears
That changed its mind on me,
You love so deep, so tender
The moon is low tonight
Breathe it in and breathe it out
Well, let me say, you're not too far from maybe
But hope is not in what I know
Wakin' on a pretty day
I'd will the meaning of
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
If I could start again, a million miles away
Won't somebody come take me home
I asked what's the reason for tears
I saw six eyes glistening in my womb
I've got to break what I'm making
When you've got the fear
Let's take it back to  years ago
But I remember everything
Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
I thought this place was heaven sent
And you can praise the clouded mind
You say I choose sadness
"The shallow drowned lose less than we" you breathe
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
What about the junk head Could have gone the whole way
Cold cold wind blowing
The fangs are stuck inside my skin
But when you start to pick it apart
Close all the windows 
It's never over, all my riches for her smiles when I've slept so soft against her
But some of you was light
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for
You can't break my spirit, it's my dreams you take
Who knows, maybe it's all a dream
Even though I'll never need her
My silence is my selfdefense
And any way you choose me
So many lies
How do I say goodbye
Gradually gone
Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day
Through all my lonely fears, no tears
Looking for faces in the clouds
I'll have time for 'thank you's as soon as I win
Are you sitting in the lights
Their voices dry and hollow
For when he died, he took a part of you
Tell me how you seek your man
I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away
In the night sky
I've been trying my best to get along
Hide on the promenade, etch a postcard
The better part of me
Don't lift a finger, let me hold you
Smittens me with hope
So take me cross the river wide
Maybe I'm a fool
Hard to believe I played this game
There's nothing left to do
Embracing thoughts of tonight's dreamless sleep
Send message, Dan's number, where've they gone
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I have made
Not another day
And the sun, well, she could not save you
Little part of your life you're keeping together
Always be careful
As I say goodbye to the way of life
Continued on into the clouds
The crossfire fight for action in between your thighs
The receding part of his twenties
I saw you crawling on the floor
Help me to feel the strength I did
You've been racing through my mind
He's volunteered with grace to end your life
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
It's who we are
There's a chance that I'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do
And I'll lie to keep her happy
With a boy like you
It's the loudest sound
I blamed my father for the wasted years
As we lay in the stillness
That pretty face again
Without a hand to hold
But I will remember you
Keep changing your mind
They got refrigerators full of blood
Fresh lilaced moorland fields
I'd freeze us both in time 
No, never have I loved any other man
You are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hand
How it left her aware she was naked
Promises made, every memory saved as reflections in my mind
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
I'm feeling more alone
Nobody near
And barely conscious you'll say to no one
'Cause I'm so tired that I gotta go
And I'm so tired of singing all the sad songs in my head
Wish I was with you 
What a shitty thing to say
All these places, have their moments
She's given boys what they want
Want to be part of that nineteen eighty
So now she's run off with my car
Burned it up and thrown it away
Scream my name just one more time
She says, "You know, we'd all like to rearrange"
Perfect eyes will have perfect aim
Feel numb wanna hold you
Looking at you sleeping
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Oh, you are not useless, we are just
To anyone about anything New Bracelet
Don't wanna try don't wanna try ooh
'Cause everything is just gone
Angel's calling,
Conversation lost its weight anyway
He's got the fire and he walks with fame
So long, this is goodbye
But all our love 
Tearing me apart
For all the hurt that you feel,
Here we are again, circles never end
The feeling sometimes, wishing you were someone else
Try to justify the things I used to do
I guess a guess is the best I'll do
Sorrow sank deep inside my blood
As That the empty feeling turns from black to blue
Money won't get there
Late night drives
Don't back down, nothing can be changed
Stop crying your heart out
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And I know a father who had a son
Or if I like what I've begun
Now for the first time in my life
My mind changed me so much I can't even trust myself
Thinking of winter
One smile and I'm ready to die
Everybody loves the things you do
When there was two 
And that morning at the racetrack was one thing I remembered
I was here
Haligh, Haligh, an awful lie,
Well I cannot believe
I'm sorry but it's too late and it's not worth saving
Tonight, tomorrow and everyday
We built that house of his
Seems like you never really knew how to feel
I need a phone call,
I was breaking in a case of suds at the Brass Rail
To fill that hole
The first time in my life and now it's so clear
Someday if ever you love me you'd say it's okay
And I'm feeling my way through the dark
When you're walking downtown
It'll be all smiles 
If I can call you and tell you I care
It seems like we've been losing control
Away from it
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody even wants to know
O, I need
City boys in first class don't know they're born little
There was little we could say 
I don't care where I start
Get away, walk away, walk away
I don't think that I knew the chaos I was getting in
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
Come back, come back, come back to me like
I don't want to sleep with you
And when I let him in I feel the stitches getting sicker
Hope in my past
And I just wish you'd come over and explain things
I go out every night and sleep all day
Or at least something beautiful
I'll keep on driving these dark highway lines
Who was to know
We all need that person 
Swearing it's different this time
When I showed up and he was there
When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade
Oh, your will is in my hand
People say we got it made
It's just, when it's summer in the city, and you're
When the first bullet was shot
No longer easy on the eyes
Danny came over last night and I cooked for him;
La lullaby, la lullaby, help me sleep tonight
And I feel so low tonight
Our paper flew away 
Are we in love Do we deserve
I'm still remembering the pain
I was dropped from
And I can see it now you're married and your wife is with a child
Would he have loved you, and not let you down
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
But the touch of your hand
Stripped of all my cares, my cares
And they will kill a man for what his father has done,
On the waves
Last time I wasn't sure
But now it's just a matter of grace
You created a stream and it flows forever
Just sees how each day goes
A sweet romantic place
So far from home, do you know you're not alone
If forever is out the door
Is this song to you
But the more I pull on your hand and say
I told you I would return
Kick them when they fall down
'Cause you're too smart to remember
All those words came undone and now I'm not the only one
You never find the one you want
That she knew she just had to leave him
It's the price we pay for the summertime
I can feel it falling down
So now you're gone
And towering over your head
It feels like it's wearing me
The wall on which the prophets wrote is cracking at the seams
If you ever say this
And I wish for one more day
In that mess of details
Split screen sadness
And there's a river made o' light
Trudging back over pebbles and sand,
But we need pills
Through the wall he threw me
They never heard you play their loud songs, on the Bellerophon
'Cause I've made my mistakes
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
I can see the wind coming down
There ain't no memory, that ever gets old
Body free and a body less, ya
You raised your hand for the assignment
I don't feel the pain
Sing me that song
I won't share it like the other girls
And who's to say that it's not right
Why are you telling me about everything
The times that you hurt me
So if you love me let me go
A long, long time ago
At night, I pray 
Only then can we go all the way
Your world's no wider than your hatred of his
I'm waiting, all hated and damned
And lead me away to unseen shores
There is a road I'm always walking 
He lifts his head, handsome, horned, magisterial
Just let me say that I like that, I like that
It's time to make this something that is more than only fair
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's,
So tell me you love me
Let me rise against that blood red velvet sky
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
But all of that just seems so far away from me
I've been standing on the shoreline
When the moon is a counterfeit
You're gonna taste the ground real soon
For the cute, cute, cute ones
I got a good one for you dad,
You can't believe it, you were always singing along
Free from the life that you knew
I take a step outside
And you are wonderful
She's a pretty thing and she knows everything
I walked into your dream
Take a leaf of paper draw your mind
So sleep alone tonight
We are just kids
Sometimes everything is wrong
'Cause I'm all alone again
The shadowlands
Dream of angels who make me smile
And you're hiding here alone
Stay with me, baby stay, stay
Little whisper smoke signs that you'll never get
The first kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
I'm on my way
It only takes two hours to Nevada,
Sometimes I worry that I've lost the plot
I want to say I lived each day until I die,
So fall asleep with the windows open
But freedom is just another word
The last defender of the sprawl said, "Well, where do you kids live"
In need of help I came to your door
And your tears feel hot on my bed sheets
And we could only see each other, we'll breathe together,
We made love on the living room floor
And once again that rising sun is a droppin' on down
We take a walk along the dirty lake
The house set fire to my heart
I'd do anything for a smile, holding you till our time is done
It's time you told your story
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Learning to fly, learning to run
What I said was not a joke,
He didn't stop all day to eat a bite
You know I'll always mean
This special morning brings another sun
Daddy's ghost behind you
Trying to find a way to carry on
I am on your side
Just to dream of you,
Annie goes if you couldn't guess
Oh rejoice, the sky's fucking falling
It'll have a nervous breakdown and fall
Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
That there's a way out
Dearest the shadows
Your father must have lost it your sister couldn't help you
For one more sweet embrace
Could tell each other everything
Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love
Of everything we knew
On something magical
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
I don't need them 
Makes me so sad, girl
Now I don't know why but I still try to smile 
I hope I ain't calling you too late
Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay,
But the way you taught me to just let it all go back
Essence left my heart tonight
It sounds like someone else's song
And all I hoped for
But once I hold on once I hold on
Telling me hold on
I think I left the faucet running
I wanna bust down the door
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
The mask I wear is one 
And the kids
Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
I'm not your star 
Maybe we're better off this way
How did thee fare what have thee seen
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
Woah, I am one,
I've got to take what I'm making
It's the disease of the age
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Don't you know that it's only fear
I don't think it's that sad
Sleep with candles burning
I will set the mirror up to face the blackened sky
Watching an old fight film last night
For terrible things I did to her in her dreams
When I hear beautiful music it's always from another time
I'm not sure I still believe
So poor and cold in their Midwest
And you're modest and shy to the end
Shattered as belief
Or combing your hair again,
Fond farewell to a friend
There is always one addiction
Did I dream this belief
How did you go bad
How does it feel to realize
But I didn't understand
And you'll remember the guy who said all those big words
So we can stay like this forever Sun poisoned
But to know that another man's holding you tight
Anything you want it can be done
All that I've got to pull me through is memories of you
Felt like, I was just a victim
In the way you're walking
So unkiss me, so unkiss me, yeah
All these faces run the same,
It's time that we
"You'll renegotiate"
Feeling hazy in the ballroom of my mind
I never needed your corrections
Still our hands match
I guess it's time to build a boat
I need some sleep, time to put the old horse down
And I never come back to this town again
You told me how ya man playin' games
You got what you want
Found a woman there who said
I wanna sleep next to you
Teach me of honest things, things that were daring 
You could be the one who listens
The neighbors were trying to keep it quiet,
Oh my tears fall down as I tried to forget
That things are reminding me of you
Little girl they'll do you no harm
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
But I just want my memories to remain
Even though soon can sleep
But someone has to sweep the floor
Guardian angels who left me stranded
I can tell you how I feel
And shots were fired
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
I am here still waiting though I still have my doubts
We need lies
The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away,
A moon full of stars and astral cars
I got nothing
Do you know how lost hearts fear
Please stay
I hope all the years will hold tight our promises
'Cause here comes a regular
That I've been wasting all my time
I call her name
I'm looking up not looking down
How many times do I have to try to tell you
And I smiled cause I'd known it all along
I just see the sky
Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist, oh
A girl at the window looks at me for an hour
In this same bar where you slammed down your hand 
Confronts and then dies
Unkiss me
Got my rings around me
I miss all the little things
I've got your wedding bells in my ear
And whatever may go
Did you hear the slamming door
Her only son has died
It's disrespectful, I can't handle this
Speak my name
So I ask if she remembers when
'Cause it's hard luck when no one understands your love
I hear it's nice in the summer
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home
It's hard to say if only
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
I know you said you don't believe
One sear scratch is lying in the door
What are you talking about
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
Time is so unkind
As we learned how to fight
That hide and then shatter your mind
Like the open seas and shores
For her mom
It's all your fault It's all your fault
It was never supposed to end up this way
And they're thought to be lies
I will always be 
And I know that it's not a party
Now comes the night
Why would you think your boy could become
Or somebody else will
I wish I was special
Live for the life and the love I need
Every line,
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
His heart is breakin' 'cause she's there alone
To be here with me at my side
When you've got to go on waiting
But I wouldn't stop you if you wanted to stay
And that was so many years ago
Someone you said you'd always be there for
Woken up from a dream last night
You're the train that crashed my heart
I've been dying inside
And as you turn around to leave
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
And I am much happier this way
Poor girl, no Ma
I don't even wanna breathe
A little baby fussing over my legs
I'll meet you in another life
Have you left a seat for me
No one's laughing at God when there's a famine, fire or flood
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
Can't help but wish that I was there 
Keep my heart
Tryin' to pull her close out of bare desperation
And you're a mess
I started looking for excuses
Wao, wao, wao That side of your bed is still mine
And airports see it all the time
And, babydoll, I meant it
I said, "Kiss me, you're beautiful, these are truly the last days"
Are we in space do we belong
I'm already somebody's baby
'Cause when the calm comes down
And run from them, from them with no direction
A week in the forest
At the end of the tunnel
I'm like the desert tonight
"What is it You look like you've seen a ghost"
Delirious with pain
And I lie behind you 
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
And we were dreaming,
And talk to me
In my hands, and smile, we will miss you
We used to take turns
But they're just old light, they're just old light
At least we both know where the other one sleeps and lets end this tonight
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
On a cold day, nothing's gonna stop us
And my chances are so few
Looking for something forever gone
The saddest part of a broken heart
No one else could e'er have stole me
Hush, my baby, now 
And I lied, I should have kissed you
A blink of an eye
Hold on, hold on ahh
I've lived for years without a life
It's as if there's no time at all
You're my shooting star
Stephanie says Stephanie says that she wants to know She wants to know
Don't come any closer
Dreams of night at play
I hurt myself today
This one last try, goes on and on and on
Nightfall came
Pick up the phone
In small brown paper handbags near the porch
In lackluster, in dust we layer on old magazines,
Drive this little girl insane
Upset with the past, but it's all that holds us now
A song for a heart so big
Oh when the ice is melted away
What once was Emerald City is now a crystal town
You'll say, "Oh, sing one you know"
In that troubled water
And if you have something to say
And so did I,
To take my place in back with the loudmouths
The nights are so unkind
Someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Rain taps the window
flies in the house 
Told me not to worry, "you were just a shooting star"
You played your songs and danced your dance
Mankind, with your heresy
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
I always catch the clock 
And it hurts to want everything
That took my place
I bet you're wondering how I knew
Like a beggar going from door to door
Find my way home anymore
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
My goddess hear my darkest fear
What does he care
Don't you care
Sew a cape of rainbow
Outside my house on Daisy Lane
Why can't I cry about this
But now, you only stop by every once and a while
I may be late
mis dias sin ti son un derroche
It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
A guide dog had to serve the role that you would not let
Well honey here comes a lullaby
'Cause you're so far gone
You made me beg for admission cards
I think I should give up the ghost Don't hurt me
But I'm banking on the rest to clear away
What the hell am I doing right
I broke through the trees, and there in the night
Don't you know this life goes on
Good nightingale
Just stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it, babe,
I won't feel better in the cold light of day
Spends more time with you
Bright, sacrifice,
Alive from the first now I'm denied by the ghost of you
Of what you have just done
Flash flood, you got too comfortable
I wait, await the next breath
He couldn't win the war with ego
I wanna' scream, let the blood flow that keeps me alive
The will to death is what keeps me alive
I guess it wasn't meant to be
The tears we shed
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
There's no substitute for time
With my mother and in her power
And then leave me alone
To that voice of reason inside my head telling me that we're no good
The only way to let this go
Return
Well, here's the consolation that will change your heart and mind
Oh this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees
But I can remember
I wonder how you sleep
If I lay my head down
Are we meant to be empty handed
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
There is a wound that's always bleeding
I wish I knew you were safely at home
To do or say
Sell me a house that stands, oh
Falling from your mouth
All calendars pass
Sees the sun going down
I don't know why but I feel conned
Like talking it through
All we do is try
And I've thrown my words all around
But these feelings won't go away
Would you let me rest in pieces
It's a long time since I
And my love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be
But why should I lie Everything reminds me of her
The imitation picks you up like a habit
I wish that without me you'd be spending the rest of your nights awake
Say I'm still the soldier in your eyes
You are unfixable
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
When they talk at me like I'm just a child 
A heart to wrap around so I can find my way around 
Leaving was not an option baby never, never
But it don't matter
Cried for no one
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
Beside the green apple sea,
And promises and leftbehinds 
I'll carry this flag
Bring some peace to your mind
Putting all the clothes you washed away,
Ever since I was eight or nine
For all the things I do
One man's righteousness is another man's
He'll never return it So when you come back, we'll have to make new love
Livin' alone
Because before too long you'll be a memory
And I brought home that flag
By three or four years
Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
It was just my old memory of how much I care
I never really thought that I was lost
With the wild wolves around you
Tiny tears make up a sea
It's another family's turn to die
It's funny I know
And I feel your burning eyes
You've been waiting a long, long time
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I don't want to feel anymore for you
Someone who could never love you
There's a look in the faces tonight that's untrustable as the hope that you'll never return in a while
In Detroit, on a Memphis train
All the people you knew were the actors
On a maddening loop, these clothes
To smoke my tears away
And say, "it's all for love"
But I didn't want it to turn out this way
Oh, it has begun
Tryin' to figure out this life
I know exactly how it's gonna end
Step one you say, "We need to talk"
And everything you need to know
For us to say goodbye, what a big surprise
And your hair smells of smoke
You step a little closer to me
Barely surviving has become my purpose
Bad day, looking for a way home,
Sometimes I stand on my roof at night 
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
How can I forget your tender smile
I'll say, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"
I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd
Life to Me To please come save me from myself
Of my wrong turns
But no one wants you when you lose
I feel numb wanna hold you
I see them snakes come through the ground
Watch my luck turn, fro, and to
Every day
Watch his mouth its open wide
The lone neon lights and the heat of the ocean
Make it over, make it stay away
Then I'll go away for a long, long time
And the bird girls can fly 
But I don't hate like they do 
The world tilts back and pours and pours and so
Which of yourselves is truly gone
Two words I always think 
You do not need me
Everything I said, oh, well I meant it
Slowing my heart stealing my breath
The stars are out tonight
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
"I'm starved of mirth
With not much making sense
I am a bird girl
When we were teenagers we wanted to be the sky
A note that says, "I'm sorry everyone
Don't say a word,
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Who never became who they thought they'd be
Love me, oh Lord, he threw me away,
Gotta be honest 
Again and again this feelin'
Remember life
Thought I'd see you one more time again
The clouds in your eyes 
That's why I turned away
I'm glad He set you free from sorrow
It's slipping away, there's no tomorrow without you
Why'd you fill my sorrow
Why am I such poison, girl
I will poison myself
You are safe
They call them rogues
I put its rope around my neck
Everybody's busy waiting for the goahead,
Thought things were okay
I would dig a thousand more if I needed to
Never been one to hold on
Like a skyscraper
With my mama's Mason jar
There's a movement out the door I swear but no
There isn't anything that you can say
To look into your eyes and see you looking back
It lives alone and it barely knows you
If we live to see the other side of this
The first thing I saw as I walked through the door
But I'm already somebody's baby
I'm miles from where you are
I'm gonna have to go along with your way
I should have looked again,
Skinned knees
What's a boy supposed to do
And your mother got scared and locked the door
I said "That sounds pretty good"
Who turned your way and saw 
The best thing for you is to leave this awful town 
I'm of age but have no children
And I'll fall on my knees
And I'm so happy, so happy now you're gone
You got me trapped inside
So I turned mine, away from your sadness, away from the nothing that you feel for me
I don't know how I feel
Why can't we overcome this wall
Well, I pictured somebody else
And now I'm older, gotta get up, clean the place
As heard on Building Nothing Out Of Something
You know the nearer your destination
I was a rolling stone
Yes, and the morning
'Cause light strikes a deal with each coming night
We're the coolest kids and we take what we can get
Pluck every last daisy clean till only I may love you
Dangerous, 'cause I want you so much
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
You can't stop the fire,
If you were wrong then I was right and this will be the right time
No, we can't talk about it now"
Like we never had a chance
If words are dead 
And I say thank you
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Who will fall far behind
And your mother didn't mind,
Trip on fence post line
And you can thank me for mine
And if it's alright
All you say is sacred to me
Its hard to say that I miss you
At the other boatmen's wives
Put me onto your black motorcycle,
All that I have is on the floor
And my mouth is filled with blood
Beat out the bed bugs, 
Your firm commitments tangible again
Living the life that we could've had
I'd feel rather afraid and insincere
Nothing I feel pulls at me at all
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
I will miss you, distance aside
As I'm fading away 
You were easy you are forgotten
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean
May you rise as you fall
Falling softly from the branches of the trees
Ain't that the way it always goes
Maybe someday you'll look up
Why does tonight, have to end
Endless talking
With yellow lights on a dark night
And empty beds and bad behavior
Whatever, he left her, and she had the baby solo
The first time you ever saw me cry
I'm careful not to fall
Well, I'm tired of being down, I got no fight
Still my heart beats, for you
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now,
All the papers had to say
And wave them like you just don't care
I hope you're waiting for me
I could do this right 
The setting sun is set in stone
A night out in Los Angeles
You've left us now, but we're not alone
Everything 
I can see by the way
rain fall 
'Cause now we say goodnight
In a town where your memories lie
I was young but I wasn't naïve
Lead me to your door
'Cause we believed in our candidate
Stay my love my love please stay
It's four in the morning, the end of December
Sound of failure calls her name, she's decided to hear it out
And become a man when you handle your own
And I should really watch you dance
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying,
I guess I had lost sight
So how can you mend a broken heart
When I could run, pulling arms to love her
Anytime she goes away I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
So many things
The singing sinew
Then ignore, put out and put away
'Cause you've flown away, so far away
And I think, I could make better time of my time on land
I can remember where I come, come from
Are waving goodbye
I'm finding I'm falling in love with the dark, oh yeah
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
Find your name
But I remember how it was back then
I'm going to wear a smile and walk in the sun
And now my sorrow seems so far away,
Last seen with friends wishing them well
Only darkness every day
Bring in the past with the postcards you send for me
Up tight against the side of me
When you were mine
No there's no making sense of it
Little light, shining
Somewhere lost in war
Hope your're feeling very clear
Empty eyes
Haven't laughed this hard in a long time
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
This world you must have crossed
Seems to be all over you and everyone else
And she's thanking her mother sea
So I turned on a picture show, I disappeared the lines
So I wanna live in a wooden house
I'm a happy man
And there goes my life
For telling you I thought that we could make it 
I got a ribbon of green on my guitar
As you sit and watch me sleep
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
I need to be alone
I'm over existing in limbo, I'm over the myths and placebos
All night long, laid on my pillow
Everything I love, everything I hold dear 
And I'll drown in my tear storming sea
So write some sad song about me 
But I didn't, now it's all too late
Where I say shut your eyes
See Slim; shut up bitch I'm tryin' to talk
I'll never kiss your lips again
Because I miss you love
And the love you leave behind
That you are in my life
We're not the only ones
The worst of starts, the mercy part, the phone
My hand is okay
Greg was always getting net from  feet away He had game, oh
Suddenly everything has changed,
He might have stayed at home
That's when a lover breaks
I see the fire, I see the end 
As you climb up the stairs
Long ago she was pulled from the mire
You're a drunk and you're scared
I'm tired and I, I want to go to bed
Thinkin' how things weren't so cool to me
Send falling stars that seem to cry
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
It doesn't help the hunger pain
And anything to make you smile
Had an element of danger
Your sorry eyes
And the older I become
It's a loser, a sinner, a cock in a dildo's disguise 
And you're gone too
But I still love you more than anyone else could
Makes one hardened but
Remember how we used to feel
It never was the time to let me in
Big family dinner,
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms
So for now I'll keep believing your words
It's gonna set the sails, and send me back to you
'Cause you'd been abused by that bone that refused you
Please hold me under the sea
Tonight's the last to say goodbye
And my fingers press onto the strings
And I've fallen by the wayside now
To the pulse of the feedback current
Yeah I listen It's taken me a long time
And all the sterile striking, it defends an empty dock you cast away
When that line had to be drawn
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
Doors swinging wide, you walked in to hide
If it's night you demand
There's no point in direction 
At a cocktail party when listening to a good Godthemed joke
She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
You're still the only one that feels like home,
Well, I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why
You found another way to bleed my soul away
Took you a little farther away from me
A horror soundtrack, from a stagnant waterbed
All those pretty years gone by
"As we put it this way Rich gets richer Poor gets poorer"
Well on the way, head in a cloud
Why don't you hold me
Beyond the ridge to the west, the sun had left the sky
And walking away at the dark end of day
We need to talk about it
Baby, I'm a man and I was born to hate
I'm gonna take you home 
I hope we both die
I can't blame you for losing your mind
My love, I'll make you understand
Will dance reflections of the fire in the night
You never really can fix my heart
Where I loved you so
She doesn't care about anything
Well, maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
Fucking come on and break the door down
And they all mean one thing
She was doin' it every day
There will be a hidden message about a boy that loves a girl
And as you move on, remember me
Oh baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
And I will try to fix you
They don't give up too easily these days
Oh, I just told the biggest lie
This can be better, we can be happy, try
Better call with some resistance, better way to feel no shame
'Cause I'm thinking about a brand new hope, the one I've never known
I love you forever
And do I really have a hand in my forgetting
Do you wish I was there
But you don't hear me askin' around
Even now in the final hour of my life
Turning tables, yeah
But I want you to sympathize, alright
You got a fast car
The mother of the willow green
There's dry blood on your wrist
And I really believed
But we all got wood and nails
Money
I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
But I can take you away
But there's someone who's torn it apart
To see if I can catch a dream
He used to call me DN
So we meet again and I offer my hand
The California sun cascading down my face
Who's returned from the dead 
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
When you get up in the morning and you see that crazy sun
It's hell when you're around
Deeper still and wholly
And somewhere a baby is crying
Traveling a street that I did not go,
The doctor, he asked which way we were headed
I wanna close my mind hive or heart
A net to my hand
So I showed you who's really in control
His girl took a week's worth of Valium and slept
He's come so far to find the truth
Through the darkness and the light
And I never really got it
There's a place where we belong
I won't be seeing you for a long while
Instrumental
Oh, can't anybody see
A silent kid is looking down the barrel
I walk home alone with you
I thought we'd be precious together
Pretty Mary K with some little boy in blue
the playground toll
Only an echo, just skin and bone
Does he do all these things
Nobody seems to care
And I will say thanks if you're pouring my drinks
I see the lights
A twoinch deep incision carved
All the things we talk about
Got lost in the fire
My whole world could cave in
I know somehow,
So now she's rolling down the window
Take my hand, stay Joanne
Why can't you hear me Why can't I sleep
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
Being a man made me coarse
After plaid shirt days
I had a bad night
Let me lose my way
Maybe I should just turn around and walk away
Tapping doors, but irritate
And what did you find that would leave you walking by
I could sleep forever these days
Hadn't been there long and didn't know what to say
Even a smile would do for now
I'm all alone again
And besides, you're probably holding hands with some skinny, pretty girl that likes to talk about bands,
I found the card where you wrote it out
A crown of gold
I won't walk out until you know
As you blocked his head away
You could see me breathing
The transience of life
That's okay, you don't need to win anyways
All the ones around me
Broke your glasses but it broke the ice
Tears drying on their face
And if I died right now you'd never be the same
Weathered faces lined in pain
I'm gonna make a lot of money, then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I found the love, that I knew I had missed
Enlarging your world
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
He told me I was beautiful
But is still a chair
Like it's all real, when it's a lie
The shape of my heart
I know there's little use in crying
You stay and forget where the heart is
Oh, come on oh, yea yea
And every man wanted her and so did I
How can I try to love someone new
Makes me love and love them more
Where does the love go
Memories of a life that's been loved
And the rest don't really matter
It's taking everything in me 
On their shoulder
If you can't make up your mind
But she'll never change her ways
It's not a silly little moment
With fine winding tendrils
Blue battered naval down slip kisses
When she no longer needs you
Leavin' home ain't necessarily the only way
Am I good enough for you to love me too
Hey would you say, "Whatever, we're blanket friends"
It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Just too bad they stare, just too bad they stare
But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie 
Carry a torch for days,
No earthly ships will ever bring him home again,
This road won't go on forever
When will I come around
And is that alright Yeah
I lack the reasons why I should be so confused
I'll take care of you
Let me back
As soon as I find out how I can move from the back of a line
And I didn't understand
I fake a smile so he won't see
It was the loneliest day of my life
Everyone now, is so terrified
Was a sign on the wall that read
Those were the days of our lives
I'm sleeping so little these days
Oh, I don't care how long it takes
Sayin' let me walk away, please
And you make it stronger build that wall
I've got no expectations 
You know I can't let you slide through my hands
Ohoho, I'm sorry for blaming you
Na na na na na it goes around the world
And there's so many things that I want you to know
His father burned his skin
It's the only way I see clear 
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
About the properties of man
With the sound of your voice
Of the girl who died with me
You'll have to wait till
Walk in silence
Maybe something will change
She We never thought of ourselves
I'm gonna peel you away
That kind of gold washes off
While everyone's yawning 
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
There's no way she can kiss you
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind
Still ridiculed despite how hard that I have tried
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
Scallop the breastbone, roll in toll and fold the long winter in it
You're gonna walk on home
'Cause when I talk to you on the phone
I want to believe
Oversaturation curls the skin and tans the hide
If you'd only let yourself believe
Oh but when you're gone
I'm gonna find someone someday, who might actually treat me well
Here I'm standing on the seashore
You didn't leave it all
To my nightmare with the devil
I remember the car you were last seen in
And now I am supplying you the time and space
It hurts my little children so
No I want a taste of love no i
Just another soldier on the road to nowhere 
No time to think, my turn to go
When the joys of living just leave you cold
I've said some things I wish you'd never heard
And I try to be, but you know me, I come back when you want me to
To keep the world at an arm's length
So plant the thought and watch it grow
We are just a moment in time
That'll put roses on my grave
Take your economy car and your suitcase
But I will try
All this time
And he'll be forever screaming, sometimes I hear him say, on a quiet night, he says
Lookin' at my scars
Just to say goodbye 
If you ask the church then I am no believer
With children, my time is so wastefully spent
And then one day she's gone What should I have done
And if you chose to walk away, I'd still be right here waiting
It's not warm when she's away
Tell me when you hear my silence
While you're hiding in the trees
You, take your economy car and your suitcase
But the wrong words will strand you
She screams "Religion kills more than it saves you, man"
So far away, I'm gone
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
I married an executive company head
It was a straightfaced lie I believed
I closed my eyes for a second and when they opened
I've always been with you
Must I dream and always see your face
Torn to pieces by her longfingered hand
Ada, I've been hoping you know your way around
But it will be a different "kind"
We were sleeping in,
You'd better bring me back my girl
I don't want no fight
And float in space and drift in time only fools rush in
And when I come home
He listened to my tears till dawn
We tumble out into the streets
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
Be running up that road
If I'm going away your hearts coming too
The neighbors were starting up their cars
The night has fallen and I'm lying awake
I'm not half the man I used to be
He's pointing at my throat
So I'm someone to hold true
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget
I know I should've fought it  at least I'm being honest
My hand you took
I'm sorry for walking you now
My feet are walking over him
Done with what we've lost
So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
It will all go back 
A haunted man who can't outrun his ghosts
I'm sitting alone in the café front way
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, mmm yeah
There's no justice in the world
Turn my head, turn my head
'Cause I need you now
Scared that I couldn't find
And when I dance for him
You never loved me
Verse after endless verse
To keep you off my mind
And I thought that I found myself today
So we run back, scrambling for cover
Fear is the heart of love"
The pants are tight
I am wasted, losing time
So there goes my life
Love me, love me, love me, love me
How could you know what love is
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
And everything's a mess
They say that Richard Cory owns onehalf of this whole town
It's a damn cold night
And says to her
But when I get to your apartment I climb the rail outside the building
You've been closing me in, closing the space in my heart
Try it for sleeping instead
I don't wish you away,
Been kissing me so long, oh
Midnight late last week, my daughter's diary
But each time you turn a corner,
They hold high their prized possession
It'll put that smile back on my face ya
I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started
No one will know
Since you're gone, I sat at home
I'll get home and meet my friends at our favorite bar 
So let's take the time
But spring came bearing sunlight
Think of all the people we could meet
Have become, all I love,
This is the part of me that learns from sitcoms
In your life we take our cover echoing what is not
When nobody's there
She lives by disillusion glow
And move to the back of my mind
She saw poverty breaking up her home
When you gonna love you as much as I do
Or to call out your name through my phone
Let the window down
Stand around here in this small town
Oh yeah, come on baby, come on baby
He was young just like me,
And no alarms and no surprises
Come back and bring back my smile
Shooting stars and satellites 
Where I'll watch your face
Behind this same remembering sky
How to save a life
Got out of bed at all
And now we're all alone
There's nothin' left to believe in
On moving pictures
It makes me lonely,
But I'll remember to love you
And cry on me, yeah
Dreamt of marimbas made from the bones of our relatives,
I used to be a little boy
Ashamed of bein' broken in
Chooses his clothes to match his pallid complexion
I know I wasn't perfect, but I kept trying
Did I say that I loathe you
You're in your oldsmobile driving by the moon
And being on this road is anything but sure
She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
No time there's not enough
To return to oz  we've fled the world with smiles and clenching jaws
She was so pretty
I find the map and draw a straight line
Face up against the glass
I once was blind but now I see
Has a mind to serve the other
And when the color goes out of my eyes she's usually too
You were so beautiful before today
Only one
I sit by myself talking to the moon
And I am feeling so small
And your sandy colored skin
There's a corner of your heart just for me
Of rain falling on the ground
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me, make this my last request
I'm gonna puke it anyway
But maybe for too long
Yeah, I've gone mad
And it's been a long time
I'll be around to grow
Let forgiveness wash away the pain
You won't try for me, not now
And the mannequin's eyes
Dancing around in your old suits going crazy in your room again
Need a change
So that the mouth can barely speak
Long ago in some black hole before they had these pills to take it back
I get the point  fine, me and mommy are gone"
What ghosts exist behind these attic walls There's got to be a simpler explanation,
But it's all right
To sit by your side
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
There is no love here
There will never be a time more opportune
Sells love to another man
Smoking his last cigarette
Set things right between us
I know now You're my only hope
When she puts her eyes on
Just bones, a lonely ghost burning down songs
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
You say my time here has been some sort of joke
Think about all the foreign places we could be
So tonight to compensate I will
Oh let's go back to the start
'Cause feelings mean nothing
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
To this love
Tail in hand, dizzy and clearly
The shock bleeds the red from my face
In my room
Can't go home alone again
I'd fall down on my knees,
I'll die
Just make her smile come back and shine, just like it used to be
We walk through the ash
so full of nothing, 
In the morning I awake and I couldn't remember
Take a look at me now
How they run
You've eaten something minty
I'm alone
I miss those blue eyes
I only need one more day
You'd always be there,
Instruments shine on a silver tray
I've looked at love from both sides now
Tryin' to be misunderstood
She who dares to stand where I stood
If it happens every night
Down there in the waves, faded and erased
That you fashioned out of sand 
You can make it last forever you
A side parade, with a single balloon
I think I want to change my attitude 
Until the wolves are away
Not one inch of doubt in my mind
That we all go away to a better place, I'm told
I'm gonna find a reason
I'm holding up the queue
The silence scares us more than leaving could
And dry my lips no words could make
I haven't seen them in a while
Stepford wives, who are we to complain
And you who love to love and believed we can never give enough
For all my heart's mistakes,
I miss everything about you
And now I wish I'd stayed
And nothings gonna blow me away
She loves him more he loves her more
But sometimes I don't understand
She's still here when everyone's gone
Would you find it in your heart
Slowly up the stairs
Try to make you love again
We watched the horses run their workouts
You just got to see me through another day
And God knows I've got to live mine
I try to remain
It ended bad, but I love what we started
From the only place that you've known
As I draw up my breath,
Your garden grow, and it's your day to wed
She says, love, I hear sound, I see fury
The fairground's lit
Everytime I try to grasp for air
How about that livelong day
So take your fast car and keep on driving
No more crying, ooh ooh
Oh, when I run
So don't stay mad, just let some time pass
Under their desk in an air raid drill
On a rolled up coat against the window
Ohoh try, try, try
that i'm still alive, 
I heard you found some pretty words to say
Cover me, all I need every
turntable scratch
First love grows then it does, and it's all white lies
But it won't change a thing
All the things that never were
Said it's not your fault
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
What you tried to say to me
When your soul embarks
Fade away
But all I ever did was look up to you
When you are lost
He comes dividing man from brothers 
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit You don't care a bit
And they echo through my head everyday,
I'm feeling strange, I need a change
The Devil told me "No room for cheats"
To the way it is supposed to be
Don't let the days go by, glycerine
And you don't need my pictures on your wall,
But now you never show it to me, do you
And I'll know that my life was good
Like the one that I saw on the screen
The whole collection
After a hard day of nothin' much at all
Her life was stole
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see,
Some were ripe and some were rotten, I felt nauseous with the truth
But always wakes alone
Some sort of window to your right
Everything is like you say
I am alone and she has left me
So you can see me, I put makeup on my face
'Cause you wanna say hello to everybody
'Cause she spread her love
You see it's not the wings that make the angel
In the trenches, in the hard rain
Can you take away the pain of hurtful deeds
Well, let the poets cry themselves to sleep
Such a foolish game
I make my bed, I change the sheets
My eyes demand like broken eaves
I thought once that I saw you, I thought that you saw me
No one standing at your door
I watched the clouds drifting away
I'll spread my wings one more time
They'll tell you everything
Away from the light in my eyes
You've made me realize my deepest fear
One day goodbye will be farewell
And I don't know how we separate the lies here from the truth
These days are all gone now
Or so they say, hey
And it remains for me alone
You'll hurt your knees
You took my heart away
I'm trying to be cool
Right in and out of my life
When those tears start rolling you'll be back
You took your coat off and stood in the rain
Work each day, all for nothing at all, at all
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
And the rain turned into tears upon your face
I'm on my knees in front of him
And it's all right where it belongs
And it hurts like brandnew shoes
And how safe it is to feel safe
Fall asleep while swimming
The days are long now
I will not lay like this for days now upon end
We'll live our lives, We'll take the punches everyday
I need a place that's hidden in the deep
The singer in the band made me want to cry
But an angel came down
Without  oz of social skills, I'm just an ass in the crack of humanity
Must be a different view
Right on, right now
We're still fighting it, we're still fighting it
They painted up your secrets
Calling and calling, so cold and alone
Into the light of the dark black night
When the night shows
And now spikes will keep on falling from the heavens to the floor
'Cause I too know love from you that
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
So good to me, so right
Oh leavin' home ain't easy
And do you think I'm wasting my time
But this could be the big one
If we run far away
It's clear something hear ain't right
This one world vision
Letting the cables sleep
I never asked for help, I take care of myself,
In the city where we still reside 
As my goad into my grave
Then live the rest of our life
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
And you'd be inclined to be mine for the taking
Don't try to fix me I'm not broken
And I'll take you away I'll take that kiss now, but 
Our love was like the water 
It's that sorta thing that makes you lose your objectivity
I still see you inside of this Godawful house
'Cause everybody hurts
In silence row him, row him
And then I fell apart but got back up again, yeah
It just ain't right, it just ain't right
'Cause it's all been done and it's all been said Eyeliner
It's only lies that I'm living
I am in such a mess
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
I'll visit your picture, I won't have the nerve
The winds been humming on it all day
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Then everything falls apart
And the complications when I see His face
Go off to sleep in the sunshine
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah 
The shower or the bath
The silence keeps it easy
Trumpedup excuses as he told mom
But we can't go back, we're on our own;
They pass away the day
Through a hole in the drapes
You let the needle drop
And in time you'll be glad it's gone
You're right back where you were
You say you wanted a solution
And explained I was young, he would say
If I could walk around I swear I'll leave
And so I fly into the brightest winter sun
You're like a picture on the fridge that's never stocked with food
And nothing's alright
The unrequited dream
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I'm not cryyyyyyyyyying
Another sadeyed stare
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
You broke me 'til the day that I die 
All you can be is just you, 'cause you're real, not the plastic type
Never got the chance to go that far
The spin of the earth impaled a silhouette
And keep your mouth shut
And baby, I wished for you
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
To the bed that I once made
I've lost my face and now it can't be found
Was an endless land until our ancestors
There's no more heart to bruise
I was discovered by the love
'Cause this has got to die
And your light's always shining on
Never thought all this could expire Never thought you'd go break the chain
I'll be your engine driver in a bunny suit
To know you all wrong; we warn
Well then tell me 'bout everything
How we gonna breathe How we gonna be together
In this river 
I will fight until the end
Easily enter my body
That I'd already taken too much today
Our eyes are in the branches
Unwelcome care, and a conscious dream
Oh, Mary K, I can see your face
That I was loved for who I am
Twisting heartache into fine
Your life will shine, File indisputable
I never knew time passed so slow
Something that's mine 
The Mexican princess is out of my life
I have seen your eyes
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
My floorboards moan under my feet
I guess it really is my time
Now don't you believe in a love that's worth a fight
I'm just trying, to breakout
And you can make it last forever
You make it all go away
We small talk, work and the weather
Out of the lightning dream
Love is good and love is kind
Long were the nights, when my days once revolved around you
So help me stay awake, I'm falling
Fell from the sky, heaven replied
Into a thousand pieces around you
No we, we could, we could hold each other tight
Just gotta let it go
Remember when we used to look how sun sets far away
Is that want you hoped you would find
And lie awake, every day
Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts no, no
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
How's your mother, how's your little brother,
You and me, Bess, we was as thick as thieves
I'm trying hard to hide your soul, son
Overcome and completely silent now
We cried we lied
I only wish that I had been prepared
You'll always be special to me, 
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
The things we do just to keep ourselves alive
And I never wanted anything from you
Yeah, we all got wood and nails
Time, there's always time
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
Sometimes I can almost feel the power
And do back the things it did to you in return
While I'm melting in the rain
Yeah, she's alone and I'm alone
And in this old horror show
They're putting up reindeer and singing songs of joy and peace
'Cause they wanted to hear that sound
I was central, I had control
Oh well, happy New Year's, baby
If only I could walk through the wall
Honey, don't you weep don't you weep for them
We're far from obvious this time 
Three boys in hoods
When we just stood still
I need some company
When I see you walking with her
Where have you been Where did you go
And I'm not ever coming back
Just play it cool, yeah, and try to avoid being seen
Oh, sing to me once more, my love
With nothing underneath
It's a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes
Now you live in the trees and salty seas tripping out in the blue skies
Oh, oh, right now I'm too young to know
Forget about the ones that are cryin'
Don't let this end
Oh my God, no one came to our side
So dear friends, your love is gone
Trains and sewing machines
She keeps repeating "I bet she needed"
If only that someone was me
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
And she's my friend of all friends
Your tears are cheap
And all the promise we adored
Wash your face, dry your eyes, oh
Go ahead tell me you'll leave again, you'll just come back runnin'
Laugh about it someday
They crawl from the oceans
To keep me from sleeping
It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing
Searching the shores these long years
Am I making something worthwhile out of this place
And the clouds above move closer
All the seasons where you dye your hair
My eyes are red
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
Loose your hunger, you loose your way
Just for a while want to
I wished your love away
And before you know, goodbye will be farewell
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself
That means another day without you my friend
Don't give yourself away
Oh, brother, are you gonna leave me wasting away
Your sweet loving tenderness
No regrets they don't work
And then you're bound to see my other side
What good is a life 
My friends call
Until the day I die
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you
I got no distance left to run
A sandpaper kiss
Love goes cold in the shades of doubt
Brandishing themselves like a burning branch
Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And so he called her on the telephone
If I could open up my window
I smile when I'm angry
You got wires going in
My friend 
Increase, delete, escape, defeat  it's all that matters to you
And Rob their houses
Hey, I wanna crawl out of my skin
Now haven't anything to grow
Deep in thought I forgive everyone
And I won't look back
And though I've tried to lay her ghost down
Corner street societies
Crocodiles cry
See in a moment
The world was younger than today
You take your time coming over here
I don't believe in true love anyway
I was sticking up for my friend
I'm full in my heart and my head
But darling you hold me prisoner prisoner
In twenty years from now
In the breath between the markers
They say that God makes problems
Theyre asking me to export all of your insecurities
That's what the white coats say
Just scratching around
What I've done
I don't know what I've done
We both dove and rose to the riverside
And when I'm done I feel like talking
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
We gotta make a decision
Swimming through the garbage dump that fills the air
Don't want to be first in line
White carpet thick with pet hair
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
My simple girl, my simple girl
In the dark, in the dark
As long as you're something to own
With you as my quarterback
All these things into position
Why are you crying
Since you're gone there is an empty space
To the one thing that I need
On my mind
And now I'm a crushed credit card registered to Smith
But you've got to walk away now
You're a bedtime story
Sat in my kitchen, buttering himself a bread and the cat was on his knee and smiled at me
I just want something, I just want something I can never have
Hour after hour day after day
Keep yo' hands in the air, 'cause we gon' take you there
This faint and shaky hour
That reminds me less of youth
We're alright
I still want you
And you're not happy, but you're funny
You grew your hair, so I grew mine
Of course she lied awake
Won't upset the pace on distant stars
I said my goodbyes, this is my sundown
Let's do something crazy
No I, wanna taste your love
Is ever gonna love you more than I do
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble
I need you in the world
I'm left alone
We all waste and consume, destroy and ruin everything we touch
Why do I always spill
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby
You stay home
And every night I miss you
Oublier le temps
But you've never been a waste of my time
Because I know today has been
Counting the clicks with the living dead
Everybody hurts
On her words I don't know what
Nobody cares
I waited a long, long time
And leave you alone
In this life we have to learn
Pray your life was just a dream
In love with the answer phone
From the house that built me
You are driving me home 
I'm out of melodies
Good morning bird
Of what I heard was wrong
To love you in my way
Another century spent pointing guns
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
And because of all their tears
You take your heart,
She was heartache from the day that I first met her
And if you care, don't let them know
And the kids that keep me alive
Worms eat my skin
I was naive
I know you'll have the heart
I took off my clothes,
Your knife will fall out of its sheath 
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing that I won't touch again
But you didn't want to play
Haunt you every day
Will allow rest my head
That alright Yeah
If You can take away all my love
With a book in each hand
Long time ago
Working on the record seems pointless now
Down on Main Street They're singing their songs tonight
The one you painted blue and glued with jewelry tears
I'll look back of my life
Never thought we'd be here
Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
Singing 'ain't this life so sweet'
Though it seems we had such little time for us
I'm faithless I'm scared
The day I break your heart
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And just are you, who are you this time
I'm holdin' on, I'm still holdin'
And on any given day I'd rather ride a limousine
Leave the meter running
The night of the living dead is on its way
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
All I want, only one, streetlevel miracle
Leaves like ton to the winter load
This time I will give you more
Don't ask them why, because life is short
And I crawl back into your open arms
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable,
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust
To be so condescending, it's as much as I can take
Just be careful when you shine
And it's been hours now, to be here like this
And you won't disappoint me
You're gonna make it big someday
Come back and say you love me
I wanna make it right
At least now I can say that I am trying
You will never stay
And if I am crying
Oh, babe
So you sailed away into a gray sky morning
And you're walking away, away
Everything will be explained
That the ice was getting thinner 
There's no one laughing at your back now
When I'm workin', yeah I know I'm gonna be
Still it's you, you, it's you I can't deny
Well sir, if you only knew, what the answer is worth
Somebody, please help me mend my broken heart
Oh darling make it go away
But all that I know is I'm breathing
I know there's a big world out there
Electricity between both of us
If you ever get that chimp off your back
I never met a more impossible girl 
Every night I fall asleep
They've got me on some medication,
Everybody else ends up these days
It sounds so ridiculous but I just can't lick this
I will lie awake
And you sink in your chair
And it hurts my soul
And I don't know where we are all going to
A restless imagination
Everyday you find new ways to hurt me
To the soldier who faltered 
In the way that we did
Before life removed all the innocence
And tear it from our side
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast and, Johnny hit his knees
Who makes you feel that this life is a life
You want me to lie not break your heart
It's gonna be alright
I just wanna feel
We noticed a bonfire
Ya me he olvidado
Now these years locked in my drawer
Mama can't help him, but it hurts to hear him callin'
O my love
Staying in my play pretend
Well I wish that I was as good as you at caring and trusting
When we were alone
You really shouldn't carry me no more
I'm in love
Yellow water, final scraps of light
In the shadows I climbed mountains for chairs
Need to feel you on the line
I saw a spaceship fly by your window 
Well I don't look like they do, and I don't love like they do 
Went away 'cause I didn't wanna face the truth
I've got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
It's a song to say goodbye
I swear I have nothing to prove
Are all thick and dull, all gravel and glass 
Breath that I breathe don't you know
And your ship may be coming in
She never loved me back, ooo I know
Illuminate the "No"s on their vacancy signs
But what I do know, is to us the world is different
And I was glad she never walked away
No wonder I'm scared
I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
You wanted to find Elvis and I didn't understand
Even heroes have the right to bleed
Sleep now and your angels will come, dear
They shot an arrow at your head
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
As I read the words I hear you telling me why
He calls me to the ocean
Suckled on the hope in light brassiere
'Til I find somebody new
No one's got it all
I'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
But I will surely cry
And I'll feel pretty, another hour or two
Those vicious streets are filled with strays
You got a playboy mommy come home
But when I left my shit in your kitchen,I said goodbye to your bedroom
To know to smile
No, It will never be the way
My heart don't care anymore
In my broken heart game
Knowing I am safe on the inside
Scarred, your back was turned, curled like an embryo
Maybe this year will be better than the last
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Oh rejoice, your nails all got chewed off
Don't cry
I had seven faces
Children, don't do what I have done
Way back, when we were just kids
You are the everliving ghost of what once was
Good for you, you've just become
But the wind carries sounds
Until the night
Lovely life I thank you
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost
And my traitors of kind
Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
What I was thinking 
Never die
Would they be kind enough to comfort me
To fall down on your knees
We are the same, oh
All the ghosts, all the ghosts
If you want money in your pocket
Round here, something radiates
That I gotta mend
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I feel like our world's been infected 
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmooohoooohoohoohoooh
But you've got to walk away now, it's over
What if all the world's inside of your head
Even your friend said I was better
It's almost over, and here we are
And love all you have left like your boy used to be
But your heart, is just sand
It is the day, I wake with my ears cocked up like a gun
The needle and the thread
I will try to find my place
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
And they say they take me home
These are the things that I
Disappeared, no trace
Is all that I'm asking for
How cruel is the golden rule 
If it takes me all night
And read me the story of "O"
Until I see the ground
On the one sunny day that winter gave up
We hurried to our death
I guess that our being together was never meant to be
This sentence may seem like a lifetime, a scream
I can hear the sounds of the city
Don't wanna look this dead, don't wanna feel this dread
Won't you just hold down, hold down
I've had it all forever
I will die by your hand
We've gotta get out
But nothing ever happens
This loss isn't good enough for sorrow or inspiration
Everybody got to have a home
And things we're all too young to know
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven
She's not in your history books, lost her mind and kept her looks
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling
See the sterile soil, poison sky
With flaming locks of auburn hair
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
"All By Myself" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
I'm just a lonely, a lonely love sick boy with my rhyme
And there was hope in me that I could take you there 
Even I realise I'm here am I just wasting away
For you and it would never end Thought you were my boyfriend
For sure it's the valley of death
It's not a bad thing
Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth
And the pain will make you crazy
I ruined it for my friends
I've been your friend for many years
I'd do anything for you
With someone new
Wake me up when September ends
Highway
I'm just trying to understand the way we are
Oh my God, Barbara, she looks so much like my mom
You get the people and the government
'Til you come back up in full
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
There's a dream in my brain
The thought of reminiscing
Are we ever going to get it right
The man of a thousand voices
Her weary heavy head in
Leave me alone to pick up the pieces
My words just break and melt
Pearls for her little girl
More than some pretty face beside a train
And if I dried his feet 
Well, we'll just throw it away
'Cause you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
Is all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
And at the back of what we've done
And waves are crashing and stars are falling
How do we carry on
Now you still speak of day old hate
Barely conscious in the door where you stand
You know it breaks my heart in half, in half
She broke down the other day
With my dirty hair 
Carve out your heart for keeps in an old oak tree
I have been here many times before
I loved the way we used to laugh
And it won't leave me alone
Long enough to know that it was him
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
I need a raincoat
To take it all away
I'm too hard at work 
Another night, another dream wasted on you
I wanna hold you now, now, now
You better shut your mouth
Through loves fields, so blindly
When I can't feel what's in it
Bled into the sea
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
Was tainted by the rest
And before you know, you're feeling old
Watching you fall, fall into me
Takes a look around, no regrets, no regrets
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
I've been going alone to the cinema
Sprawled across the bed,
Stop start, what's our mission
She sits in a corner by the door
'Cause you feel it when they take it away 
My eyes are falling
With no velocity, an empty headed heart and far too long
'Cause I wanna go ride away
The thought of another man
And you're not even around
So I'd like to make some changes
Then I could hurt you in the end
And don't misunderstand me
Or make you feel I belong
And I know what is right
But I'm not giving in this time
Did he come to save, did he come at all
Child, you know how much I need it
I thought that maybe I could find myself
'Cause I don't need this life
Sons are like birds, flying upward over the mountain
But a song about love's not enough
Just give me a sign
And so easy to say
Even promises may bleed
Nothing we could do
But we only exist in this song
And if you'd just rest your head, stop repeating the charge
And treasure every moment
The black eyed dog he called for more
From the brightest reds to grays
Cursed the day he let it go
I took it for love
i don't know how to prepare coffee 
But it doesn't let me run too fast
I wouldn't want to go messing anything up 
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
Then die
I purchase a hazy escape at the alcohol place
Something about those bright colors
Out my mind
Send me roses, I just let 'em die
I'll walk into the sea
Remember, you promised me
Well, what would you say if I said that you could
As I pass down my old street
But both my hands are tied
I loved you first
Your words to me just a whisper
This is me all alone
My recollections are
You said I was on your mind 
But now it's just another show
The pretty lies
But she don't come to see
What's the point of this song Or even singing
And then the Welshman from India, who came here to stay
People emphasize the weight of the world
She is everything to me
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate, nothing so childish
Mr Curious, well I need some inspiration
Now I know all the wrong turns
The days and nights are long
This path seems the blackest
Whenever paul thinks of rain,
A man needs something he can hold onto
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
I don't know if the change made was grave
Hey, are you lonely
Together we cry, whoa
But I'd rather walk alone, than chase you around
Calm yourself, he says to me
Falling on the floor
Skating around the truth, who I am
And land on top of the sea
So is it wrong to toss this line
Spring and Thompson on the first of May
If it all ended tonight,
I never know what the future brings 
I don't think I can close my eyes
Pour out of this life 
I don't need much
I'm too tired to fight your rhyme
You're the glitter in the dark
Who would have thought that you could hurt me
With your charm and in your pride
Where your nightgown used to be
"Why do you cry
She says that they're all dead
Be careful darling you might fall
He had to leave though I begged him to stay
As you threw me to the ground
Songs about happiness, murmured in dreams
But yes, it's crossed my mind
You don't want me back
Nobody's home
Were spent on one more beautiful
All day  and all night
Goodbye brown eyes
And now you're gone, there's like an echo in my head
If I had it my way,
Pretend
You take My hand and pull me next to you, so close to you
Just one big lie
But you are not permitted to leave 
Beneath the stars 
It can tear your soul apart
You must have made some kind of mistake
It echoed though the park last night, he wasn't our son
 alone,
And I feel all right, so please
Never say you miss her
When someone takes advantage of your kindness, you think you're never gonna heal
Everything else is a waste of breath
Until he brings out a gun
How's the husband How's your kids You know that I got married, too
Just to show life's not made of gold
And drive around my faster car
You just see right through me
A navy knot with arms at night
Cashmere, cologne and white sunshine
You can hear the words she wrote
You told me you were coming back, right back
I wish you could stay here
Content to be alone
Before I dive right into you
Darlin' I never showed you no, no, no
I knew there I'd die alone
Hope it's nice where you are
Her tears fell
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
Isn't something
I know because tonight is just like any other night
I said before too long you'll be a memory
And amidst this bitterness
I know you'll come in the night like a thief
Than the angels do
And when it rains it fucking pours, but I think I like it
And I scream as loud as anyone,
Is it better than keeping my mouth shut
She's holding her tonic like a cross
It feels like it swallows,
Fill my mouth up full of sand
And the cynics won't get in our way
First, you both go out your way
I will not leave you all alone
But I'm warning you we're growing up
I walked alone
I see the truth
But how long will you stay with me, baby
And how eventually my mouth will just turn to dust
But just a cloud that lives inside of me
And a better daughter or son and a real good friend
And anchor this lost soul 
Except when you signed it
Matters of heart are hard to address
She was lying on the floor and counting stretch marks
Would happen in a thought from now
At the Bottom of the ocean
Yeah I'm weeping warm honey and milk
I'm still remembering my life
Tell me why I can't be there where you are Where you are
You've made a fool of everyone
Because no matter where they take me
You can't save me this time
We'll work on you
In all the dogs and cats
A light that shines behind the veil, trying to find it
Tell me what's making you sadly
You have changed so much that I don't know,
So hold your fire
Why, why did you go
I won't pretend, that I can't see the end,
And that's the way it's been
I need you to show me the way from crazy
But you want to be with someone else
Let's not fuck around
I guess we always settle in and we know
Recurring, a dream that can't come true
All I ever did was look up to you
A few more hours
Vaan niin että tunnen sinut  But so that I feel you
All the times, that I felt like this won't end
I love them
A past so deep
The side of the road
Make room for Clara's bare feet
I've done some things that I'd love to forget but I can't
A part of me I'd never seen
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
And we all seem to need the help
I know you're not a travelling girl
In the cold light of day 
Do you feed and clothe yourself
And I've heard that music
Found a way to understand the time you're burning
Are you still into it 'Cause I'm still into it
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
With my little red party dress on
But we�re light and light and light
Watching terrible TV, it kills all thought
And he finally got there around midnight
And I'm ready for my sun
Trying to wake you as daylight it breaks through the eye of the storm
When I'm pulled away from you, I fall apart
A hole from which to see your head, 
I'm holdin' on, I'm still holdin',
I said, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"
She could outrun the fastest slug
You're not coming home tonight
Do we throw them back
There�s a search party but it�s getting dark
You're crushing me inside
The way that I do
And there will be no pain tonight
You were my lesson, I had to learn
It always seems like you're going somewhere
Paint your palette blue and gray
We go where the wild blood flows
And you'll kiss me in your living room 
I love you so
Softly we tremble tonight,
And all the angels singing
But I'm glad that you've come
Now the drugs don't work
I worked for the Capitol Air, in the bags
All the LA women
Away in my own misery
Mother, the car is here
Studying my case must have made up their minds
The downturn, brave little burn cub
Every thread, every hair rearranged to resemble
I know it but can't help feeling differently
These days I sit on corner stones
We live in a wheel, where everyone steals
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
We'd never get anything done that way, baby
Home We struggled hard all our lives to get by
I'm a stranger in this town
And everything I need to know
Dear Isobel, I hope you're well, and what you've done is right,
They locked the door
I'd say she was his sister but she doesn't have his nose
Empty and bothered, watching the water
If you fall, you know, I'll be there for you
You have no right to speak to me so kind
He says opportunity knocks once then the door slams shut
Charity standing orders, on Sundays ring road supermarket
Roses on my grave 
I drank a thimble full of fire 
Noone who wants you could want you more
To hide the people watching her
You say I have turned
It is not a habit, it is cool I feel alive, I feel
Everything that happens is supposed to be
That I knew you didn't know me that well
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
By giving you no time instead of it all
And cancels out the day
Just smile dear, make them thankful for every breath
Before you walk out of my life
Baby, why'd you have to run 
And here I lie
And it's true I always wanted love to be
And you flew with it on your back
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's her eyes that fill with water
The building fronts are just fronts
That called you what you like and even might
You paint a blue sky, then go back and turn it to rain
The more you turn away, the more I want you to stay 
I know that we could work it out somehow
And loved it why I never knew
Beneath the stains of time
Doesn't help to know you're just time away
I think there's a heaven where some screams have gone
We're at war, we live like this
As strong as what I believe
And doesn't feel she has to hurry
I'm keeping an eye on the world
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
He's in pain and misery
I'm not alone
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
When I'm down you're always there
A nightmare comes
He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he'd done
A falldown drunk with his tongue torn out
Like somebody else
The only dad I'd ever know, but pretty soon he'd be gone too
To the door and I thought you were there
Like I'm made of glass
Like a kid alive and talkin', that was you
As the sky returns to gray
I try to keep myself occupied
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
This darkness will turn to light
It's the only way
Say you'll love me again
At the thought of being stuffed in my home
I have to climb your wall
Kneeling alongside old Sad Eyes
I'm in love with your daughter
I thought this love would last forever
'Cause you're afraid to find out all this hope
You know my heart So tell me honestly, did you ever really want this
If you just hold in your breath,
We all became friends
Part of the future
You have no new messages, so why haven't they phoned
My eyes are lungs, I'm a prophet and I speak in tongues
Wonderin why their bodies go to silly places
Sometimes sugar, it just takes someone else
Got no time to watch them grow
The refrigerator's whining so I've got reason to complain
And while I'm gone everything will be alright
Oh, unbreak my heart
Yes, it can be done
And it's all because she don't want things to change
If this keeps me away much longer
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways
I acted that way
I've been erased from the picture
To shift my point of view
But I never planned on you changing your mind
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
Holdin' on, the days drag on
This has got to lie down
They'll run down forever
Went and had a talk with my boss
With every grimy word
But I hate your guts
To these lives that we are livin'
Your good friend
When you and mom decided nothing could be saved inside this house
If I could go back,
So kiss me with your mouth open
While the memory of it fades 
The valentines I never knew
It is a foreground
And much to old to break free and run
And I told you to be kind
Older kids trying off the roof
He married a girl in Virginia
You don't know what I fear
But I know how you feel, I know how you feel, and I do care
It's time to surrender, it's been too long pretending
I was standing on the wall
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
Because we all need a little more room 
Take time silently, feel real room, high five
Short love with a long divorce
I've tried hell
I'm here to tell you loves not some fucking blood on the receiver
You know that I wouldn't mind
Amazing still it seems
And all that I could do was touch her long blonde hair 
What are you needing
Nananana, yeah
Content to see my garden grow so sweet and full of someone else's flowers
Everything that I owned starts to pile up
And if you catch me I might try to run away
And I'll still love you even if I can't
 cela il n'est rien a faire
Its color's richness won't appear within your view
Twisting round and round
You're asleep when I get home
You'll be sad to hear that
I pull off the road
A funeral keeps both of us apart
In bar rooms
From that same head that you have twice removed
And here in the sky
I will always love you
I sit and watch the children play
Now that I finally found the one thing I denied
My recollections are all that's left of you
Is it true what they've been saying about you
But I take it all back now
And the world is caving in
Burning bright
But it never made sense to them anyway
Why am I running away
You only feel sorry for yourself 
Keep in contact with old friends
And he trying not to eat you
Our voices in our toeses
But it's nothing new
This is where it has to start
That I might break out, yeah
A little bit of shame
And the moon, it leaves silver but never sleep
Yet I see no end
They come in all quiet
How many times will I burn it down
Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
'Save him, save him from the hand that he beats me on'x
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
I walked around my room
The sky's cruel torch on aching autobahn
My Cheshire cat doorstop with tears in your eyes
I walked upstream
Most people never find a love 
In your eyes again
My mother birthed me down a dry ravine
When the stars would fill the sky
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
For you to be mine
Where'd it go tonight the sun shall see its light
I'm a roman candle
But now I've got to crawl to get anywhere at all
Found something real that's out of touch
I sit tight, don't want to miss the show
I'm gonna stop wastin' my time
For truth, for love, for my desire
Break away
You didn't talk for awhile, you were freezing
For to leave her is to love her
That's where she lies, broken inside
And my old friends, I can remember when
I kinda like it in my brand new place
You broke your children for life
I could die a happy man I'm sure
Oh baby why
And part of me still believes we can find a way to work it out
Just your smile 
Running scared, I was there
You think she needs you
mis dias sin ti son como un cielo
Will I get better or stay the same
It might have been just a dark pretense
What the hell is going on
I sing tonight
What is love and what is hate, the calculations error
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
And out and away from everything that makes me what I am
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
Walk away walk away
I know I'm gonna look
So I'll fall back in line
There's no more places to hide
A song to keep us warm
Into dust
Embraced my soul you loved my mind
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Until you've flipped you're heart and you have lost
Still I go to the deepest grave, 
After all this time
Love one's daughter
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
Spin me 'round again
And you are in love
I hope we didn't break yet, but I'm glad we broke the rules
Long haul, counting the miles
A summer storm graces all of me
It's worn for protection, nobody gets in and nobody gets out
Never knew love like this
The sea spread out there before me
A generation drenched in hate says
Her heart's a bloodstained egg
I listened to his song
But I always cared but I always cared
Instead of a cold goodbye
There's nothing to do 
I never meant to cause you trouble
You see, the moon is bright in that treetop night
There was no one in the town and no one in the field
To help you see beyond the gray sky
I was so excited to 
And stop pretending that we care
Come back to me
And I was wrong
Wanna die, wanna die, I wanna die, wanna die
He said, "Ask anything"
Well, hell, you, can I take you home
Just what it was I had
So mother, I thank you
Fly like an angel heaven sent to me
The things we do just to stay alive x
I hope all of my days will be lit by your face
Highlights, clear view on the vista 
Send me your position 
Just keep in mind you need no more at all
Because you know I hated to close the door on you
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Lonely little love dog
Just a product of my childhood
The tile is cold I can barely speak
Do what you're gotta do
Why life gotta be so tough
To fix it up, make it up somehow
No love to set us free
With no one here just by your side
All my lovers were there with me
I'm all alone with my deep thoughts
Love is love's mystique
Mama, let my heart go
It's making me die
And I was strong, strong in the sun
'Cause all I do is put you far away from me
As the daylight comes around, I turn
You handle your own when you become a man
So please help me stay awake, I'm falling
Don't leave me here with these tears
"Oh come on and have a drink with me
To repent for someone else
Now that you love me, I love myself
Well take a look at me now
I�m free to care, I just never do
Let's see how fast this thing can go 
How I wish I could, but you're so far away
They paint a broken life's
But soon the world had its evil way
I'm missing just one thing, a brand new start, yeah
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
That you're not dead, you're sleeping
Just slipped through my fingers as life turned away
To spread my wings and fly away
Speak to an ear deaf to my voice
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like a jewelry store case
And you never would have thought in the end
And it feels like fading light
I'm your little lifegiver
Goodnight
Pace mine for you, hold my horses, patience
Didn't do the things you meant to do
You are eighteen year old girl, who live in small city of Japan
Deep down inside, I apologize
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
If the city girl was ever there
Your supermarket Jesus comes with smiles and lies
I cannot wake up in the morning
So take care what you ask of me
I'm feeling my way through the dark
I'm barely holdin' on to you
Pushing my face in the memory of you again
Grey areas
And I don't have to stay this way
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
Excuse, oh no, anything goes
How did I end up this way
The knocked up girls, well they've all got their share
Not a sound to be heard
If I lose my head, just where am I going to lay it
Like this lone bachelor in me 
No, I This girl is only gonna break your heart
Sophisticated points of view
And I don't understand what keeps me breathing
And it's all in your mind 
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so look at me and listen to me because,
I'm pretty when I cry
Happy glands in the mild issue of our disgrace
How's it going to be, when you're not around
It wakes me every single night
Carrying the world on your shoulders
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause you've been waiting a long time
Could you please start explaining
Another needy hole
'Cause it's really not that sad from here
I never really knew how to move you
Just like the things I used to know
I should've known this wasn't real
And the holy dove was moving too
That there's someone out there who feels just like me
It was the sweetness of your skin
so filled with nothing, 
To bat me back
I'm going to go down in the water
Now that I smile
Where I got friends who'll care for me,
Splashing 'round until it's dark
And hang 'em on the line
You never let my heart go
Your golden lies feed my role 
That I would be good if I got and stayed sick
That leads to your door
Everyone loves the fun, everyone comes by
Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
And all the Spanish candles unsold away have gone to this
A beaming sunrise buries the night
Behind thin walls, you hid your feelings
I don't want to die,
Nothing in this whole wide world saves us from this situation
At least I can say that I've tried
This silly game of love  you play, you win only to lose
But I need your hands on me now,
But she knew all the words that I never had said
'Cause I'd give everything I have
I thought I might get one more chance
As I talk in circles round you on my bed
It might just change 
So many tears I was wasting, oh, oh
Like snow, like gold
In case you would go walking
He spends the afternoon between your thighs How's that for gratitude I apologize
Singing Life just ain't fair
Trouble is the only way is down, down, down
I knew, I knew, 
My heart's beating to quick, I'm fucking tripping out
And that's a fact so
And broken mirrors
If I'm a dog then you're a bitch
Man, you wanna see this kid, he was so fucking unreal
You've turned me away
A newspaper blown through the grass
Bottles break, music plays
Showing me its comely powers
Never once do you think that they would lie
The kids were young and pretty
How do I turn this thing around
No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around
The King's Crossing was the main attraction, dominoes falling in a chain reaction
It's shaking; my life is crashing before my eyes
I should've wrote a letter
It looks like some kaleidoscopic breathing exercise
You can't cry
I was here
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right
But when I dial the telephone
I'll bail you out, show you what you should see
Dreams escape fire
As it was withering
I think, "You're damn right there is, but we can't talk about it now
You healed these scars over time
And I'm so tired that I gotta go
Dark clouds cover her paradise
Stand inside an empty tuxedo with grapes in my mouth
The world has changd or I've changed in a way
Here her head, she lay
Or is it just a waste of time
Taking heartache with hard work
Left empty handed
I check the phone again, I call your mom
It's just a little sacrifice
As friends, after so long
You might be just what I need,
Crying tears of goldlike lemonade
But it don't matter 'cause
You've got them on your side
Lucky stars in your eyes
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
Tidal waves don't beg forgiveness, crashed and on their way
It's the loudest sound I ever heard
What if I ripped your heart apart at the seams 
Tide will dry, upon my baby's back
In the shadows buried in me lies a child's toy
I can't forget the day you left
Remember those who win the game
'Cause your eyes told the tale
Turn and head for the door
You're already the voice inside my head 
'Cause time's no chain
Cold child
On the first of March, on the holiday
Sad eyes, I'm trying to hold it together
Now I have nothing that I can keep
The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning won't exist
Life taught me to die
But I'm still near you
And your heart is breaking
Too many too many problems
What if she thinks so but just didn't say so
I've got a sad song in my sweet heart
That you fight and you stay crying every night Oh baby
So let's make this night
To lie here, under you, is all that I could ever do 
This is the mess I've made
I welcome your new life for me 
You know that this time will turn all the locks
Around you
I know you care
For your footsteps trail
Is to hold her when I'm not around
Heart strung is your heart frayed and empty
Sweet Sundays, sweet Sundays
And you move like water
I need this, I, I need this
And know all that has spoiled in your heart
The wheels of a car
To believe in all the meaning of all the bad dreaming
She's in her bed
We're all gonna die
Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
I'll pray for stormy weather
The grass is dead, the gold is brown and the sky has claws
And talked a little while about the year
We still dance on whirling stages
Coming back as we are
And when you're gone
"We have gone to Hackensack" 
Give them back to me
I think I'll start a new life
Victim of political pride
From our own separate sides
I hope that you will just let it go by
Suspended animation glue
Rip back the time that we've been wasting
Tunnel and sky collide
You flash before my eyes, a final fading sigh
Melt away and leave us alone again
In my dreams I can hold you
Well, honey you're just being lost
It was the summer 
Lying here, lie, lie, lie,
To the only place
And mine
Beyond the furthest star
I thought I would need
I miss the air, I miss my friends
In the end
It meant the world to hold a bruising faith
Why am I so troubled, girl
It didn't get there by itself ooh
I called up Eugene
Gonna run to the river
Haven't had a dream in a long time
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I love it when you give me things
But all the broken promises I won't miss
When the sun comes down
But we shared a moment that will last till the end
So tired of the straight line
As weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine
There's no water that can wash away this longin' to come clean
So I'm holdin' on I'm still holdin'
I think I, I know I, I believe I, I feel like I gotta
There is nothing left of you
So if you find someone
Brushing my tears away
If you're looking for it 
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive the woman's heart
And a twisting mind
Oh baby
When just one remains
Everytime I walked away
And I stood nervous next to you, in the dark room
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
And if I could hold on
I remember at Michael's house
Can't say much of anything that's new
Into my window seat electric chair
I play you're song just to hear you say that
Just one more go
My love is unusual
I'm looking for love this time
Twinkle, little star
But once I hold on
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I guess we only settle in to what we know
When the doorknob turned we took off for the stairway
I wanted you, you didn't want me
Close my eyes when I go to bed and I
I'm holdin' on I'm still holdin'
And rejoice although you will not survive
I'll take your pictures all down
How to ever make it home
I'll take this soul 
Forgot where I was sleeping, none of the lights were on
All I need is a little love in the dark
It's a grey day in the fall
Viktor was sent to some Red Army town
And the way you seem to flow, circumnavigate in hope
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And when I'm dreamin', well I know I'm gonna dream
He said "Son, have you seen the world
Your eyes perceived by the sound 
We may be dead and we may be gone
When the chips are down
And the day has come where I have died
We never change, do we We never learned to leave
I'm not answering the phone, let it ring
Of this love that we've been working on
If heaven is on the way
And your wounded eyes
Only proves you're my best friend
Ease his worried mind
People I've loved, I have no regrets
I can walk but I will crawl there
And to my mind
His tears have turned to poppies
The lot of the marina's teeming minions
But now old friends are acting strange
It takes time
Raindrops falling from heaven
This could take all year, but
Has one chance
Up against the wall crying black and blue
Can you hear room 'three eighteen' 
And if you want an ending to your screenplay life
The wild wives of unknown men
And this is more than love
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
Tender nights before they fly
Till I moved so far away
Making my way, away, away
And all the stupid lies they hide behind
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
Who's gonna be the one
But who said that I wasn't right
To hear the time in his mind,
Here's to you and your lover man
Pieces of the life I had before
I was wishing you could tell me your fears
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And it's way way way it's way to cold
I'll holla tomorrow
Is never waiting for the wings, and
It's cold as you face into the wind
I remember the time you told me
You never promised me anything
Give me that little kiss
By blood and by me, I follow your lead
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Können Sie nen Moment warten Dauert nicht lange
I guess this is growing up
You make me real Discard my friends to change the scenery
My leather glove gripped the wheel
Oh heart, don't break the promise
Ripped apart by the crows and the vultures
I lived it out from hour to hour
The wasted years
I adored you in every one of those
You took my heart away and my being
Did you notice when the clock stopped running
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on
But I wanna sleep next to you
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife
I want to go home
It started out as a bit of fun
And I miss the love we shared
What was the answer you wanted me to find out
C'mon, you little lifegiver
Now I wish they'd leave me alone
Hope you're feeling well
And the birds all sing the blues
I am some son
Help me stay awake, I'm falling
I'll run, run, run
Someone I don't recognize
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
What we don't touch we cannot feel
Pray unto your fear
Another day here
To lead him through the dark
And I loved you
No one will ever love you for your honesty
I get a little warm in my heart when I think of winter
You in the dark
Characters of flaming eyes
And no more shall we part
And you're givin' back some glares
And every, everything isn't only
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
You make the hardest things
Do you care enough to see 
Please his newfound lady
Ich habe Blumen mit, weiß nicht, ob du sie magst
So love me now, hell is coming
And I'm thinking about a brand new hope, the one I've never known
Du hast der Fügung
Oh, they slip away
It could bend or it could break
Up and away from the bar fights and neon lights 
Of my secret life
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
"When you gonna make up your mind
Be sure to come around
Everything was such a blur, it didn't come out right
Live or die
They're calling your name out
But I can't bring you back to life
Hang on travelling woman
Having thoughts
In the shadows, I will listen to their every movement
I tend to lose my concentration
Find the grace to be nothing at all, at all
That I leave early in the morning 
What do I say when it's all over
Stars, Saturn and moon
So I put my hands up; I say, "Enough is enough
The life he leads is unsafe
To breathe again
To give me some reason to move
No I will not leave you crying
And I know I was wrong
you're just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
Who suspect they could never love anyone
I need you
But I just turned my head away
It's on your side now
Drivin' at ninety miles per hour
There's a moment in time
Like you to stay
'Cause mine stopped working
I hope it stays dark forever
Why'd you have to phone 
I've been sleeping
Why do you sleep alone tonight
Spun the stars on her fingernails
I will stay forever here with you
Driving away from the wreck of the day
No you will not be forgotten
Ten years past and now you'll flee
You'll never learn a thing
It was so like you to visit me to
And here I am to garland you with flowers
No one's left to stop you
Shadow of a shadowy man
I used to know the sound of a smile in your voice
Yes, and I feel too young to hold on
Oh, how the rain
With the end surely near
In a dark and distant, dark and distant place
The love I give returned to me
They say they don't know when but a day is gonna come 
But here I lie
Till your eyes shed
You're not alone
And what have you done
And when the church doors opened up wide 
I feel better when I hear them say that
As they steal your best memories away
For all the times she sang God's song
Don't have the strength to part with them yet
I enter your new life for me 
I could stay or leave
Takes four legs to make a ceilin' like a thing
And part of me still believes when you say you're gonna stick around
Before I can kiss you
And though this fun has past, those mythic dreams are meant to last
His name was Perry
I've got nothin' to lose
I feel I'm sinking
When the lights are turned down low 
Like time, there's always time
To our love let all the pinkeyed pigeons coo
Could put right what I got wrong
Hot, hot, weather in the summer
Is to know me all wrong, they warn
Old long since gone
Oh man, I said I'm under the gun, round here
I wanna come apart
Left school together, went back to my place
For great love and learning 
Give me a reason to stay alive we're gonna die
Man I'm 'bout to get crazy, just run away
So many things
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Under the ground
Picture perfect fading smiles are all that's left in sight,
'Cause I will comfort you when my days are through
The lines in the letter said
But I love you
I am a dreamer and when I wake
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
All my old friends, wait
This, my saddest song
I wish that car had never been discovered
Make it go away
Can start me crying
Cause hell what's it all about
I'm proud to be the one you hold when the shakes begin
Your eyes are almost dead
And ohoh, say you'll miss me say you'll miss me one last time
I've walked these miles
Always changing sides
About people who are "nice"
She wants clean sheets, and fresh flowers
These days aren't easy anymore
With my heart beside me
Story of my life
Every mess that I made
So mother, I thank you and I thank you for everything you've done
Whenever I run
Hard to believe my heart stopped pounding
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
So we're speeding towards that time of year,
And we both of us knew how the ending would be
Don't say "is he gone"
In despair or incoherent, nothing in between
Nananana, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cold light above us
I am feeling frail
Put my arms around her, tryin' to change what she's saying
I'm sick of hearing my own lies
I took you to the train
I don't want to play the brokenhearted girl, no no
And when I asked for a separate room
I'll be a brand new day
Oh, honey sweet, so full of sleep
Several times, over several days
But it's starting to all make sense
Both of us were dreamers, young love in the sun
And the machine is bleeding to death
I've got a long list of calls I must make
But you just smile politely
As a kid with my mom and my brothers
I'll be your downfall
Is still burned in the back of your mind
Till the time you start changing the rules
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
Wanna be something you would do
I stray from love, this is how I feel
The seasons escape you
All shall fade to black 
And it's dark and there is nobody driving
All day these bastards are leavin'
You are fading further from me
There's so much sad, gonna flood the ocean
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Lived to see a lovers
And hold your bad luck hand
We'll float in space, just you and I only fools rush in
Sorrow waited, sorrow won
And I will give you what you need
God is a place where some holy spectacle lies
And I won't let it show
Talk to the wind
There's no one left to finger
I never met a more impossible girl
The clouds above opened up
You and me were kings over the parkway tonight
Zusammen im Zeitraffer
'Cause everybody cries
A white light glowing below
Don't hang around once the promise breaks
And I don't need this life
When I woke up today
Before you walk out of Monica's life, baby
And hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose
I'm ready for my sun
Give up the thing you love
We talked all night
Can I help you find the peace and the star
Somewhere in London, living with someone
Skin white as winter
Barely see my breath, surrounded
There's a shadow hanging over me
And it was then I realized that conscience never fades
You learned the hard way to shut your mouth and smile
The bright tide forever drawn
It's two hearts living
It's coming 'round my soul
I suppose that I'm one of the few
Tomorrow, see the things that never come
'Cause it's cold out here
Managed to save just a little bit of money
That you'd be better off, or you like it that way
I I I I I was robbed
No way to know
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
Will you leave this empty world
Faking now faking who you are
It's all in your mind
I can't hear the songs he sings
You're still dreaming
There's only fears
I won't settle on  hours
From sour home Chicago
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need her again
I am the daylight when the moons shines no
Till the break of day
Then I'll follow you into the dark
So break yourself against my stones
'Cause I am lately lonely
Now the time has come to leave you
I will love you always and forever
Which one of us would be the fool
The broken locks were a warning you got inside my head
We got airplane rides
The numbers lead a dance 
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
And it's hard to say how I feel today
And where is the lamb that gave you your name,
You're a nobody, girl
My mind my mind
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever know
She's all I'm always wanting
Screamed, "I just completely love you
He told me he's packed up your books and letters and things;
No chance of escape, now selfemployed
Black eyed dog he called at my door
Only they can hear you breathing
Oh, hidyhidyhiding, whatcha trying to prove
When you're living your life, well, that's the price you'll pay
You bring me closer to yesterday
Do not say the moment was imagined;
Pangs of silence
Old friends, memory brushes the same years
It lies but can't stand up
All day
And map my face out line by line
But I'm still trying, to breakout
This place would be busier than O'Hare
Out those sliding doors
I know in the past I've found it hard to say
She just needs someone to take her home
I said, "You don't need my voice, girl, you have your own,"
Your words in my memory
I've had enough of this same old game
Bad skin
Blends in with someone's sigh
It's hard to let your children go, leave home
Anyone could ignore
Bleeding, birthing his black diapason
She told me how you'd died at last, at last
Just shine a light into the wreckage
To be with somebody you knew
I'm gonna find you 'til the end
Like spun glass in sore eyes
And I am staying right beside you
Just another moment in your eyes,
Just relax, alright
Curse my enemies forever
One day they'll see what goes down in the kitchen
She lives in a bungalow
Somehow it seems colder now
Please put all the drugs out of your hand
Every day for us something new
It was dull and browny red
They say that good people
I look for a corner or a quieter room
I want what's yours and I want what's mine
Sparks are swirling faster
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
I should have held your face,
Will you be mine
I told you everything I possibly can
And when you're standing in the shadow
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
And the world's got me dizzy again
Then what'd you say forever for
You don't know anything
An early winter
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
It's a half life
All things have a place
See some colors, light hangglide off the moon
All we gotta do's avoid each other
In your hospital room 
I never thought there'd be
They say I've gone mad
Sometimes betrayal can make you happy
There is another world
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
You used to shine so bright
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
﻿And look no further for happiness
How I wonder what you are
You got me, I got you
I'm gonna make it up for all of The Sunday Times
Dancing a jig in a church with chimes, a sign of the times today
The markings on your surface
Mercy mercy, Mr Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey
Here I am on the phone again and
Counting stars wishing I was okay
My pillow still wet
Will all be lost in time
For taking his hands
Because of the things that they heard she had done
And all I ever did was look up to you
It's been a long cold winter without you
And I didn't know it at the time
We couldn't care less
What I've always known since the very first day
But beware my heart can be a pin
When I meet you in another life
So much time so far apart
Long gone from the city
Yeah, yeah, a lot of people think he's fine
And do I have to do just one
And I remember how you told me all that you wanted to do
I hear you talk about your family life
The cards were stacked against him
Deep down I must have always known
Don't wanna be stone cold
Oh, all my old friends are staring through me now
How does it feel, how does it feel 
"Great great minds
Everything just takes me back
The soldier on the ground 
A little trick I picked up from my father
All across electric wire, it's a baited line
And the dust just settles right there on the feed
And your jokes are always bad
Someone's talking back
Something's missing
Something makes me brake
Concede to do the work for free
I'd be smiling if I wasn't so desperate
Rage, yeah woo
I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue
We have the answer to all your fears
And he drove his car into the Navy yard
At your funeral I was so upset
I see the sun reappear
I don't remember the good times, I wasn't there when you were kind
As they take me to my local down the street
I'll be home when I'm sleeping
You are an expert at Sorry
Well, your faith was strong, but you needed proof
I had a brother once
As I say goodbye to Ruby's arms
All the lovers I've burned through
Holds her head high, then gets in the car
Me and you at the park taking walks outside
I've been giving out chances every time
But you don't really care for music, do you
This is love, this is porn
That's what I heard her say
Round here, we talk just like lions
You know I never would have run away from my home
I must have called a thousand times
So I'll drive away with all my things
There's a place your mother goes
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
For they could not love you
'Cause I need it right now
Now men with purple hearts carry silver guns 
I need to be alone to heal this bleeding stone
Previously I never called it solitude
Will you remember me
So I drift through these days
I'm the one between the bars
You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
So dizzy, Mr Busy, too much rush to talk to Billy
In this love
There's a train leaving nightly called, "When all is said and done"
And nothing feels good for no reason
Where I belong to when I'm not around you
It shouldn't have been anyway, no way, that's right, that's right, that's right
Leavin' home ain't easy
Since you've been gone
Unusual fools
Can turn your world into dust
Trying not to catch the cold eye of the gulls
It's ink that lies, the pen, the page, the paper
Take any boy in the world
I'm coming up only to hold you under
Now sadly I know why
But I know I'll do the right thing
To take you by the hand
I guess I'm just burnt out
Slipping through our fingers, like the sands of time
I can hear your heart
Hopeful thoughts of soon returning
To carry us away from danger
Share some greasetea with me
I dream of times when you were mine so I
I've reached the end of my tether I've torn all your letters up
I'd give you all I got
Drinking in the late night establishment
'Cause I remember it clearly
Gasping for an extra breath
Getting drunk, getting stoned all alone
You're the only one who really knew me at all
I've always been right behind you
And still, if I yell at the top of my lungs
You can mend
Own these dire nights
I just haven't found it yet and I need it
And we passed out in each other's arms
Sat on the floor in a grey, grey room
I can't keep my eyes open
Ain't got no check for em, if you checkin' in
I remember it well, the first time that I saw
Go sing your song, try something new
I want you to believe in me
That are right now headed silent down the highway
Leading your own sorrow
Waterfalls
What did I say"
This time was different
And don't go home
I've been watching your world from afar
When I'm standing in the fire
You can't remember, you try to feel the beat
So hold me up, tie me down
Just for a few habit forming years
Left this world a little better, just because I was here
You're in the arms of the angel
Every carriageway a mile for her
I'm barely off the medication 
There are no reasons to believe, I buried my faith in another plot
And it's stuck in my mind
But, you see, my hands were tied
Tells herself that no one will notice
To have loved and to lose it
Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen
I loved you all along
I was thinking that maybe I'd get a maid
It's ripping me apart
Givin' me a million reasons
When everything is lonely, I can be my own best friend
Out of this home
The snow won't go away, My nose runs down my face
Oh eey yeah
You tell me that you need me
The days were short and the father was gone
They're explosions in the sky
Your quiet eyes
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
That you told her that you loved her, but you don't
You're so far away
That no one knows the name of
I wanna get me a little oblivion baby,
The sound of failure calls her name, she's decided to hear it out
Smiling faces I can see
Why would he come back through the park
Before your war against the suburbs began, before it began
We're swimming in the blue
There's nothing left to lose
What you love
Children are playing
The nicest man I ever met
And even fancy things have finally lost their charm
To live the rest of our life
My wounded rhymes make silent cries tonight
Tied to a railroad
And I swear you moved overseas
So leave the light on, I'm coming home
I'm not sleeping
Don't you know she's got a I know
Some people like her for her charm
And I hear the others all whispering, "Come home"
With a father on amphetamines 
With my heart beside me
I can't find a flight
I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
And she smiled at me and held me
When I'm kneeling at your feet
I just feel it, that you're over us
Well, there's gonna be a snowstorm
Oh, love, well I've waited for you
In the halfway house of ill repute
Every step that I take
Nobody says it's wrong, so we don't ask why
Radiation sore throat got your tongue
She loves her mama's lemonade
Wait for everyone to go away
The smell of hospitals in winter
When fear strangles a soldier's pride
I love the way you love
But she got me warm
Why won't you just believe
The road is long, we carry on
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
And remember when I moved in you
And somehow growing old feels fine
All that I know is I'm breathing now
Did you say "No, this can't happen to me"
I can't take my mind off you
And now you say you're leaving California
I was buried alive
Walk away
Well, I never meant to cause you no pain baby, yeah;
I'm all tired of tears
Let the golden age begin
So please hurt me
You will never see the one you love again
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape
There ain't much to rake anyway in the fall
Signal when you can't breathe no more
And the only time I've touched you is in my sleep
I'm going to haunt you every day
No earthly ships will ever bring him home again, 
I wonder, is there anything I'm going to miss
Well I see that the world is upsidedown
Maybe now everything will be so clear
I'm not calling, I'm not calling
I left a dozen roses on your grave today;
And ground never seemed so far away 
Like I am living at the edge of the world
Is a memory as useless 
Love, love, love
Now I never leave my zone, we're both alone, I'm going home
Don't look in the mirror
Oh and I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
In the next seven days 
Something suddenly unclear
Why are children always first
I been working on my backwards walk
And it feels like you don't care anymore
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
Inside two years alone with you
Sweet summerlight
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
Now I'm guiltstricken, sobbin' with my head on the floor
I smell it still
Anything has before
We are the everliving ghost of what once was
And you're too drunk to notice
Let my heart go
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
Remember that you're one of the lucky ones
Oh 'cause I don't know
I wanna fly, and never come down
It's a lifetime guarantee
I was hunted down by hounds
Taxi driver
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
No you still don't like to leave before the end of the show
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
Like empty promises
We all go to sleep in the same place and in the morning hope that we're all the same
Feel your fire when it's cold in my heart
And now the walls are closing in again 
That's breaking my skin
They'd only hold us down
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
And the Bible didn't mention us
Still wanna go
Now I can hardly remember her face
"You'll be okay, anyway"
And Pops had nothing to let his anger on
Everything I can't be, is everything you should be
Rain on the brain
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
And don't get me wrong, dear
Your foot steps get louder
You'll say you'll never give up seeing eye to eye
Six years ago today
I knew it when you said just then
Another world outside my door
They'll tar you and drag you through town 
Before you kiss me you should know Papa was a rodeo 
Stuck on you till the end of time
And keep the things you forgot
I showed up insecure
You come to me with positions
Tell me how's the way to go
Need a shoulder Well if that's the case
I feel
Holds his head in disgrace he can't escape the truth
I'm coming back around again,
No need to argue anymore 
You've been my soulmate and then some
She's raising hell to give to me
Life, it taught me to die
Junk bond trader trying to sell a sucker a stock
You tell me all the things you do
You want to feel how it feels
Another year ago tonight
Truly hate myself
Hold my wine, hold it in
I wish that you needed me
It's getting lonely down here 
Won't you let me show you how it feels
Just looking in the mirror
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
But if you need more, I'll just do it in some, right
Please don't you cry anymore
I ask you if you remember
But I'm about to give this one more shot,
The ghost of my joy 
Take it all away
But ah, the days are long
So could you please collect your things
Your face saving promises
Oh is this the dream I've been saving
All the bags are checked
Kinda like you're startin' from the top
Those yesterday's feelings
I'm growing old and I wanna go home
Nothing can save us
It's only tears that I'm crying
There's a house on my block
Best of all I hope
And number all the jets and airports
She loved me and I did too
Gray would be the color if I had a heart
And your mother's still calling you insane and high
All of this and her dark hair, oh Lord
But among your books, among your clothes
Sorry now that you've fallen from my eyes
But still I'll hide from you, hide what's inside from you
We tore down that hatin' factory
Rage on against the dying light
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
Looking for some cover trying to get away
Take all these strings, they call my veins
How much lessons did they teach
And you smile there with me
My mother birthed me far too soon
But now it's time
Now you're gone now you're gone
I'll stick it out, skin pierced for nothing
But If you loved me
Your heart yearned to stay
Can't believe it's hard just to talk to you
All the years keep rolling
Suppressed by all my childish fears
Ooh ooh oohoohoohooh
These days I seem to think about
When my love for you is blind
Will you try to live the way in which you speak
You're still the same
Fly through my dreams
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together,
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
I'll tell you stories bruised and blue
Won't cry these tears anymore
The treasures that she misses make the man
How can you love me if you don't love yourself I love you
A nine pound hammer or a woman like you
The glorious ending of a knight
Though I try to fight
To just let go, my party piece
You already love will end
But I played along with my birthday song
Close my eyes and I count to ten
The leaves are changing color for us
You catch me 'cause I'm falling down on you
I had gone when you couldn't see me anymore
On celebrating nothing
In two separate worlds
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
Keep on making the same mistake
Started reading about dreams in your favourite book
You need to leave that clown in the dust
All of the trees were bare
But I can see the stars
Mother remember the blink of an eye when I breathed through your body
A hand to hold, a song that clings with mine
Lady lights a cigarette
Worth a righteous one
In a day and a day love
Open containers that sing songs
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Na na na na na it goes around the world, 
One endless moment
I'm starting to scare myself
Shouldn't hold me back, shouldn't keep me from you
Leave the world alone and later
With a different house and a different name
Eyes of stone observe the trends
But the morning finds our bodies
With my laugh, my lone companion
Ultraviolence Riviera girls
I just hope you're happy
My mouth has sprung wide open
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
What made you want to end it all
And of your past and new walls painted
Caught in a dream
I've got my pride
Walking on air
What a fool I'd be to start complaining now
Held your standards close to heart
In its proper season sheds its shell
Don't trade it for gold
Thinking nothing, thinking nothing at all
And I remember my birthdays
All right
Yellin' cries mercy she's beggin please beggin please beggin please
Hard love what we've done, when with anyone else
And the water filled your tiny lungs
And we're alone
I don't need to be
Is this the life for me
It's time that we got this flaunting down
And wait to strike 'til their backs were turned
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
The strange face in my mind is all too clear
And we are still alive try, try
I try to pay attention
With two tickets torn in half and a lot of nothin' to do
An empowered and informed member of society
I knew a lovely girl with such pretty pride,
Here's two for being unaware, that you're gone
But just stay with me
Don't go back on your words
Touching my heart, my soul
The trees had burned down to the ground
These LA lights, no no,
I have seen pain
All of the words, All of her men
'This feeling always goes
I mean, if I get sidetracked
Love was such an easy game to play
Sometimes when you're doing simple things around the house
Throwing caution to the wind
But I�m still hopinthere�s another way
Whoa, everything in the room is spinning, I think I'm going to fall down,
I messed up let her let you go
And she may rise, if I sing you down
I just might die with a smile on my face, after all
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Such distance from our friends
Well, I could go away and you could wish that I had stayed or just stayed gone
Do I know what you are feeling
But I'll come back to you some day
Forgive me if I'm young or speaking out of turn
Brother, see we are one in the same
With your kind of hesitation
Supplies are endless in the evening, by the morning they'll be gone
Sparkled with broken glass
I am out of my mind
I was on your porch
And learned to cry
I'm still an asshole playing with candles
Someone found the future as a statue in a fountain
I say to myself
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
But you just tell them my name
There will come a time I will look in your eye
This is the deep and dying breath
Your just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
Somebody leave the light on
I can't breathe
When you look inside, all you'll see is a self reflected inner sadness
Well, it's all in your mind 
I smoke the whole thing to my head
Tell you I set you apart
Try to slip past his defense
This is a song about the girl next door
Pretending there's glamor and candelabra
But please return, return
What are we doing in this dive bar 
He stole your heart from you
From finding life out on my own
Ignore me in the parking lot
And in your soul
Woken up from a dream
Only love, only love
Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven
Left a message, but it ain't a bit of use
I would fall asleep
Or ever thought was real
Slapback kills the ancient remnants
All we got left's right here
But Jack comes tumbling after
Tonight, tonight
Even though she doesn't believe in love
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
I know that this rest in the deep is what you want
So call it quits
Because I'd hate to see her make the same mistake"
Open your eyes Open your eyes
We go 'round and 'round again
There ain't nothing right, nothing wrong
In every new seed
But when you call me baby
There's no eyes in your head
I miss you love
Finding love in a distant instant
It's like a cold hand on my shoulder
It's the end of the end of the end
The sun shines but I don't
Of drum machines and landslides
But never is a promise and I'll never need a lie
Little bird, oh don't you know
Since he walked through that classroom door
The more you pull away
There is a house built out of stone
Even heroes have the right to dream
Let's see how fast this thing can go
Snow will fall, be a storm, there's nowhere warm
