All about the tragedy and how you haven't slept right
This shit should have gone "beta burns babylon, the end"
Two thousand other souls burn bright tonight
Meanwhile we met your pal in its worse, you spit its thin
You better watch your man 'cause he's spendin' all your cash,
Can you crease the wrinkles back into the cracked and open brain
So when I bomb first, nigga, who you rollin' with
Now baby, baby, baby, why you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad
He knows their hopes will fade without the strength of his hand
Be my enemy
Then I'd throw it in your face
Next day I went to the dentist
Right into my backyard
You wanna know why
We started out friends
Supressing the power inside
Erase my soul for all your sins can never be undone
Kerosene around, set me on fire
What to think and what to play
But I'm not a slave
Do you miss the blend
And you're sure no one's there
But that's not what you need some day a sign arrives and that day will be left all in flames
I want mine right here, right now
All of my hate cannot be bound
Left, right, left
In you I never had a doubt
Pass me the sugar and things still won't be right
This shit remind me of a driveby
I don't know what else to say
And everybody loves what they hear
Feelings I harbor, all this pentup resentment I hold on to
Who ever stand in your way
And I beg your disease
Now the sluts, they wanna bone when they see me, whoa
I wouldn't waste your motherfuckin' time with no bullshit baby
Your gatt looks rusted, disgusted
Trying to get rough when it's obvious they ain't rough enough
Belief no more of what's been forced into
My happiness there just to die
Out to the lake of tears
Talkin' that shit, punk
The shame, the lovers
But now it's winter, my bones
Guess its just inferior man
So bury the good and let that shit rot
Such an irreparable disintegration
Well I'll cut your tongue
I'm through  I kicked it  I won't kill myself
When niggas speculate, what the fuck Pac would say
 I'll get there, I'll get there where man can't
Yup I know how you work, you ain't nothing but a flirt baby girl that's one of the risks
Shadow soldiers
Please forgive me I have sinned 
She's nobody's fool
Don't give me your hate
Too late yank crime
Hemmungslos mein Geld verprassen,
I'll pass almost every penny on to you
At least I'll always know which side of the gun I'm supposed to buy the farm from,
Outro Tupac Talking
Coward
Deciding who to blame for each and every heartless act
I'd go through hell for you no matter
And honey honey the call is for war 
The game is lost, eternal hate
Au revoir la triste gamine 
Black black black black black black
But I'll never fear thee
Till I gave you a taste
I'm the flame I can't get burnt
But I want to see you
Loose bitches in tight jeans
On life's highway, God with thee"
Alike turn to nothing
Here comes the war  put out the lights on the Age of Reason
I'm repeating myself again
I have crawled a million miles to reach you
Tyranny awaits rebirth
You don't know what I want
You know I can't count how many times I've heard people say
But then you're fucked
Losing ground and falling faster
Very sore, unsatisfied
Do I have to walk into that room
Sold from door to door
'Cause Marshall Mathers the rappers persona's half a facade and
Does your life stand for anything
So another six months won't make a difference to me now
You want me to fear you, revere you, never question your lies
Who camouflaged emotion in a thousand yard stare
I knew that someday I'd end up
Ignorance is bliss, you know it's true
In the line of fire  watching empires fall
There's still glitter in your eyes 
Something saved my skin
I'm just lookin' for a big yellow
Right now
I blink my eyes and I am so
Well at least you could just let us die
Somebody better give me a sting
Bright coloured wrappers to suit assorted greeds
So put another penny in and turn the crank
And take her fucking with you
Leaves with a blood stain
To bear to hear the truth that you have spoken
I get unemployment, you work and we making the same shit
Then I think you'll understand
In the land of dirt and plaster
The history of betrayal continues to today
And what do you call assassins who accuse assassins anyway, my friend
In squadrons passed me by
That shit don't mean nuttin to me No nuttin to me no nuttin to me
Hey hey yeah, like your hands on my back and
I know what's coming to me
See, you're not, going crazy, it's me, I'm your best friend Tyler
Dirty deeds, dirty deeds
Didn't quite, fell apart, where the fuck were you
Hahaha, yeah yeah yeah, hey what's up
Everybody needs to find their own way through life
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
You need it
We've got nothing better to do,
With a cement sky
th album, no  mics Then let 'em hate
Solarising into pictures
'Cause they drivin' me crazy me crazy
Your life is on contract
I'm not here for your entertainment
And everything you gave to me I want to give it back to you
The things that you think
Grows my heart in solitude
Seven hundred miles to play to fifteen angry men
Is, therefore, not to desire her
Evil, evil, weak and now feeble, evil, evil Evil man
It breaks my heart
And I would kill for you
Take my arm, break it in half
It's, my, life
We'll have a window and we'll have a door
And that forest burned You see smoke
Oh, I will not forgive
I don't play, I work hard for my money
In the back room there's a lamp that hangs over the pool table
Kun opin puhumaan, sanoin "En haluu sisaruksiaaa"
My head is not a football for you
Because they ain't got no heart for this, bust a gun and body shit
Let me bring in the Devil Dreams
Wish you'd shut up about everything
You fight me tooth and nail to disavow what's happening
I'm not gonna step aside I'm not letting you make the call
Strange, how you claim to tell the truth
And I'd be nothing without you, my darling, please don't ever leave
But now it's turned to shit and it's because of you
Waste my time, if I'm lovin' only one thing yeah
I feel good, I am a liar
Two perfect worlds, it just cannot possibly beoh oh oh oh
You are a liar and you are a liar
Ewe know  bones will be exposed from the force that I unload
That I'm not fuckin'
Who'll deliver me from this body of death
Tell me what you want
And does he sing to you, incessantly,
And the innocence you spoiled found a way to live
When it's nice it turns fire 
And if you ain't the king
Motherfuckin' snakes,
I'm simpleminded
Hang around us niggas all night and you'll get yo lil ass whoop
Doors 'n' the suits that make 'n' break da law
When every star fall
Burn burn burn reclaim this land
Tell me a truth that I find not deceiving
You ever got within a hundred million miles of my soul
With the head on thatwards
James Van Der Beek and them sisters from Sister, Sister
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
You say sorry like it's supposed to change everything
Crawling on bones
Absolute destruction is the battleground we're given
Follow the smoke going higher and higher
We always seem to fall with only photos to hold
My dress is on fire
For the rage that I feel
And I don't need it, I don't need nothing
This girl didn't know what happened
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know
Spend more, burry the rage
We are building up a new world
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
I wanna see your booty rubbing against my dick when I start buzzing
Can't recall my crime
The truth is sickening
Me you're sorry with a straight face
Not even tryin' to stand out
I'm writing the folks back home to tell them
Sadness and hazards six six six havoc that crafted Sadistik
Take their life and rob me
With this war 
Don't you ever try to take me back
Wipe these tears from my eyes
There's no sense in running from nothing x
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
She could call for the minicams, or take up a gun, or be politically correct
They'll take a fork and turn you over
I'll make you cry
But you've always been there for me
But I'm an idealistic girl
Glaub mir, es tut sehr vielen leid all denen die dich so verehren
Taste thriller, break thriller
Reliving old reviews is a useless tool of confusion 
In which we drown ourselves
So the pierce screwed up your face
With spades and hoes and ploughs stand up now, stand up now
With thoughts of failure sinking in
The most intense of burning hells
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
If the door wasn't closed
Cringing through life wedgies
We're all prayin' through the smoke filled sky
Begging, "Mama, shave me please"
Just thought I'd mention the new extension
My bones are tired, Daddy
For a little bit of time even made it work okay
The ghosts fly their asses off tonight
I can't pay no doctor bills
That's what they tell me
Down upon my face, I catch 'em in my mouth
Flashing through your mind
Nope, in fact I'm so enamored with this standard
So  who ya tryin' to clown your money like Chris Rock
And I'll find no solace
All that growling need
I've got to close my eyes
Radio is counting down the top twenty country songs
I smell a massacre
Little punk wanna be a big star
You set it up so no man will ever do you
Hey your blood is showin' through
Kill the fucking lights
You make lotta noise
We got preachers dealing in politics and diamond mines
And now please let me in
All of my niggas bang with us and let's ride
With the taste of fears we create
You say my time here has been some sort of joke
My sky will gather clouds
I won't close my eyes, I can't close my eyes,
On everything I call mine
Upon her all the positive things
Nobody gets a record deal, you gotta take that shit
I took your car with your baby in the backseat
Still fucking hurts
I'm blind and waiting for
Cannot take, cannot fake
Tell me when the lies are going to stop
I wanna do something freaky enough to win your heart with"
Hahaha Well I ain't prejudiced, I don't give a fuck
Pogo on a nazi, spit upon a jew,
Everywhere I go I feel it
Dig your claws into my flesh
As shadows unblind mine eyes to see
We keep fresh paint on the countenance
Especially when I rip out your heart and on my sleeve sport it
Out of bed and to the bar
I got to box her for the money, said it might end
Neon black branches hanging from the trees
Stush like you don't wanna try to be yush
Represent the ruling class
What Oh my god, don't kill me I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin' around
What say you and all your friends
The circle never breaks
And all that goddamn negotiatin'
It's the sure shot X
They say to chill, they say my homegirl's not available
That I'll fall down
So don't be telling me to get the nonviolent spirit
Nonstop disco
American made
Oh no, I don't believe so, no
And I waited
I don't know
I did this for a man like you
Kiss and scrape ivory, revenge is mine
Don't focus all your anger and resentment that you have
Back to bed Run along
And die by the gun
I got the nose
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Like a shark's tooth or gator skin boots
My god comes in a wrapper of cellophane
How 'bout your fuckin' face
Fuck a wrist band, let's all do a keg stand
We get paid to rattle our chains
Got a grudge that I'm holding
And it's a "newspaper tragedy"
You wish me hell on earth
You're full of shit, your words mean nothing
Kill all the blacks, kill all the reds
You run away 
Comatose wanna get out wanna get in
So you say, so you play
It's fun to lose and to pretend
Another sucker behind a desk
We're doin' the cockroach, yeah
Whisper the name of the enemy mine
Because you push me, push me over the edge
What's all this black crap check page twenty one of your contract
Do anybody make real shit anymore
To a world that doesn't give a shit
Crazy world to live alone
Well, easier than other ways
Got a strain uncontained that could turn parade zombie
And attempt to make this failing heart continue to beat
Where's the black and blue
Like Bronson, ain't got enough to flip his face to vigilance again
Of all the devils I have known that suck the angels dry
For ShangriLA is always dry
You pretend to be my friend
You weren't raised in a shack so you better not act so
You work against me
Turn on turn on, turn on turn on
Goin' out and doin' the same shit
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
When they don't like what we say, then they stop it in the courts
Or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
Stop looking start looking
Not to knock it I've been off it never moving very much at once
Hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide
Not a fighter
The music stops and the party's over
There a chance you could die
A new day rise in me
She's still mine she belongs to me
And blacken everything except the goal out
Take me to the place you wanna go
 Do you remember Christmas morning
You wear all the finest clothes
You're hiding now
Believed in you
Opportunity I guess that ain't enough for ya
Love me all the way completely yeah yeah
Lost like, you possessed her, tellin' me to mind my business
Unborn suffer the norm
The perfect mismatch and disharmony
That breathing less air beats breathing you at all
If my life were a movie
Y'all wanna kill off the black man
And when they get to work they hear drums
Then when you put it down, ten feet down in the ground
I'm not awake, but I'm not dead
I get so mad
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And all that's left is your bill and
I will always draw near to you
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Face pumped straight full of Restalyne every bitch in the room just Hester Prynne
Beoreutcheoreom jeonhwareul georeo sulgime
Hell spawn, the air is ripe with fear
Stay right where you are Get out of that bed and get down on the floor
So their tongues can attach
I can't hold on To what I want when I'm stretched so thin
To just kiss someone and make them fall in love with you
And I feel caged in my mind it's like my flow is doin' time
You're someone we'll never trust 'cause
In this big step I am taking seven seizures for the true
We run dis Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch x
Give you children, if you want any
There's an innocence we look for in the stars
I live at the end of a  and  minute hallway
That woman
To come and pay your respects and help the family pray
You are a liar You are a liar
Y'all ain't feelin' who
All I want is a little respect What
What's real, everybody who doesn't feel safe
So they flew the SuperConstellation all the way from Rimini
All that I am turns to fear
And kiss your crucifix your boy's a certified sinner
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we'll keep them panties dropping
Vex seal with spit
For the beats, beats that go with losing any war,
And while she's lookin' toward you, I bet she's beautiful etta
Strip it away, this flesh and gore
We're a mess of eyeliner and spray paint
Here comes the war  put out the lights on the Age of Reason
And we don't want nobody
I run this shit they just chase my ass
Sunny day, cold heart listen up listeners
Sitting on a fence is a man who swings from poll to poll
But in the meantime I'm a have to say goodbye baby 'cause right now you're not my type
You gave me a chance to prove I'm more than just an also ran
Every now and then I drive just to get away
With his dick in his hand
I just wanna be catchin' up to you
You left me like a broken doll
We live in a country where John Lennon takes six bullets in the chest, Yoko Ono is standing right next to him and not one fucking bullet Explain that to me Explain it to me, God Explain it to me, God I want it explained to me now Jesus Now we've got twentyfive more years of "ah" Yeah, I'm real fucking happy now, God I'm wearing a huge happy hat, Jesus Christ I mean Stevie Ray Vaughan is dead, and we can't get Jon Bon Jovi in a helicopter Come on, folks "Get on that helicopter, Jon Shut the fuck up and get on that helicopter There's a hair dresser in there Yeah, go ahead in there, yeah yeah"
She'll cook soul food, know what I mean
Have a gun the size of a black
Not even zero negative one, a crying dove
They needed boats and armies to get there
And blood will run
The game is lost, eternal hate united with the eternal day
Drop dead right where you stand
Don't tear it away from me, I need someone to hold on to
It's me taking over you
So who you wanna blame for the Hate That Hate Made
I don't believe
If there's anything you have left to say
They get throat slit 'cause they're talkin' to me like I'm thick
That feeling again
I know there's been worse
But I feel old and tired
I'm on my hands and knees, I want so much to believe
And I guessin' is cause of the fact,
It's not that most don't know how
God made it, men use it, governments put people in cages for it
He ain't give a fuck I ain't give a fuck neither
I want to get off one time and look you in the eyes 
I'll always have those mornings in
Just not on the inside, Yeah
'Cause your girlie liked the taste
Smilin' at my face and winkin' at my best friend,
Just wanna lie here
I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm
Oh, yeah Well, don't get so distressed
And I ain't the lord no I'm just a fool
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma
We are the nobodies
I'll keep my hands warm
You will never see me cry 
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
These idle hands don't know their worth
Tell me, tell me, tell me dogs
I learned to settle for
But he said things that were so uncalled for
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned
You got lucky, you ain't talking to me now
Let's play tictactoe
Mais attends tu sais,
I played it quiet left you deep in conversation
Would blind my eyes then
I think you are living in denial
And dig out your blue eyes
This ain't the circus, I don't see no big top
Jus Allah prays on the minds of the young
And I can't get it out of my head
To feel this pain
The wedding crashes and the rings fall off,
Really hand it to me 
But when it comes to gettin' ahead, they put us way behind
I love the way it moves me
I'll say that you remind me of a girl I knew so long ago,
I hate it when you preach your case
Hey mind your own business
He said, "Well I hate that it's come to this
You grab a hold of what gets thrown or else you drown
I'll do whatever I can to stop that
Oh, you make me want to run away and hide
If you love me fucking let me go
So uh instead of me sitting up here doin' a little dance for ya and singing "On a Monday I'm Waiting"
Get away, suck
Soldiers of merits, inherited for way back
Just one last time please be nice to me
He is stalking the minds of dark poor souls
No, I'm the fuck now
'Til you died But you're still alive
I'm sliding like a lizard on my belly and back
Today, as you listen to this song
'Cause you've always got something else in mind
Lawyers before love, surrogate sex 
Can you see the light above your head lighing the room
My thoughts are race cars running 'round my head
Only desire
I wanna save your heart
At the top of your lungs 
It isn't hard for me to see you didn't stop for anything 
You got a little kid yourself now
When you're lookin' at pain you're lookin' at truth
But there's no one for me
I'll make you to lick my injuries,
That you drove me to drink
In a time where violence blocks the summer shine
But though your words will kill
I got nothing but the taste
Fuck the morals, does it make any money
Oheeoh goes the kid on the street
Please hold me down
Cut some flesh away
Roll wrap late nights been the shit on the beach
With a desperate cry
Neon black corpses, stacked, eclipse the horizon
The smell of cold, car seat is freezing
They promise everything, but it's bullshit
Are you fucking happy
Oh honey now I'm afraid that this is way, this is the way
If it wasn't for patience baby, I couldn't wait it out this long
Need the power of two
And their speech is growing increasingly unkind
Why, that's the one right up top a mine
Yeah, her tits were higher than mine
Over and back and below and around again baby how I'm bending
Deep in the mine, behind everything shared
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
Areunareunhande gangnyeolhaejineun mal
Destined by a fate so cruel
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
And no one will accept all of me, so the fire will stop
Oh I will die without all the attention
Now, no one will listen to our song
And a heart pumping blood
Never liked what I saw in the law
Dropping her kids off so she could come out and dance with me
But I just couldn't make it so I began to shout
A electric head all over
I'll throw your gang sign up, and then I'll spit on my hand
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
And the dissidence of miscreants
Three and a half years
I've never been so cold  I've never felt this way before
There has to be some type of change for this day and age,
What do we care if the world is a joke
I'll bet you smoke in the garage, too, man
Hey now, all you killers
A guy, a girl, in love with the whole world
But no two things you say are ever the same
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her
For our souls have crossed oceans of time
Any fucking time, any fucking day
Paranoid and lab aware
Your war
che hai distrutto
La promozione incombe e nonostante questo
And even when their kids were starving
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man
There's a young man with
If you fuck with me I fuck with you
The city's done for you
Jestem facetem, czasem wzrok ucieka w bok na inną kobietę
To find I've been turned over
Looking over cliffs of eternity
For the pain
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do
In the halls of death, you get left, I'm in the top 
You can tell it by the way I run away,
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
Justice stings like the back of my hand
My sympathy you don't need
Mine eyes have seen the glory 
Sex, death and money, honey
Every drop of blood you could bleed
I am so full of hate
Bo bo bo bo bo quandbass
He removes his hand so you can see the cut
You might as well let me know now
The CIA tryna kill me, we bad news
One shot and the world gets smaller
I am not what you want
I wouldn't tell them anything
It's no mystery
So I just try fail and try and try again
And it worked
I'm just afraid of being ignored
Yeah, must be some young phenom
And I am what you want
Don't do the things you do
Take a look at what you believe in
Hat der Wahnsinn mich endlich eingeholt
I watch your body turning pale
'Cause I'm not here to let you down
That reminds me less of youth
This sort of feeling isn't pleasing
There's no discretion in my voice and you need to stand clear
I'm like a chainsaw
I'm stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I hear voices calling me, givin' me fits
Is the door locked
So get out of mine
War Ooh, ohoho, yeah
What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
Doomtree, Rhymesayers Entertainment you know the name
Still spittin' real game fo all the pimps and players
Your fuckin' men are mice, you shouldn't answer that
You bend over when you realize you're broke 
I just want to make you bleed 
And I wanted only you
The hours seem so endless
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
You know I don't look forward to seeing you again
Oh lover boy, oh fever head
To protect me from the enemy, myself
Take over television and radio station
Wine in the pantry, wrestling on my trampoline
I've got my tongue in my cheek so far it makes me mute
I want to shoot out all the lights
But the sex is great
Getting sick of all this
Deciphering the truth of us
The way you always attack all the things that you say
It just depends on how far down they can go
Those who know, lust Trust the flow is disgust, touch
In the streets of shame
Couldn't you please just set me free
Now as it's passed onto the next one
Y tiende al otro su mano 
Rob me, tear that asshole out of place
I can almost reach my mouth, now, now
I'm sick of always writing songs 
I am not your ruby to gress
Love me or die, tell me, did you ever open up
With a steeltoe, how you feel though
Background Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart, eh
I watch your face on TV
Did you ever believe in me
I wanna put on my sweatpants
They're acting like somebody near
Back before the time when I was running from you
On the floor, knocked down by booze
But now it's slippin away
If this is really living
You'll be miserable every day your luck will always be bad
Jesus descends, Dachau his father
Behold I come like a thief
Somebody better make me bleed
All within me gone but pain and hope
The way you thought of me
You and I both know the culprit
XEcutioner style, cuts and blends like a syringe
I stare into this mirror, so tired of this life
Now what the hell are you waitin' for Chester
You wounded them for life
Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
I like to feel this abuse I'd like to give some to you I'll steal the tears that you cry my fucking eyes so fucking dry
Chewing my ears from my head
Fuck a war
And in the fields till I sing a prisoner's song
What shit they write in the Stone or NME
Tried to warn me
We made a biscuit do the talk and it became richer
Locked in the brain to lacerate ankles
Part of me, the heart of me
You're choking on big black bloody mouthfulls of it
No matter how strong no matter how tall
Was my number now
They caught on her Ave, flossin in another nigga cab
He's a old man
'Round the sound
Consumed by hate and guilt
Nigga fck your feelings, this is me
Know you heard that shit before
And take my memories of her with you
Well, the prince he died screaming he showered me with shit
Don't play that awful song
The hooker layer  motherfucker say your prayers
And the branch never falls too far from the tree
No, not of you, of all that's been told
Now I smell the stench of my own piss
It's not your fault that I write these things at night
'Cause, I watch TV and Comcast cable
You never know where you find yourself
take it back, sorry it didn't help
This is dedicated to the kids
And it tears me apart
Ground sure don't like the way it's treated, so now
The saga continues, with the worlds most dangerous group
I can't tell anymore
A great new wave Hesparian death horse
I need a little privacy
I'm not what I seem See, I've got
Contrary to popular belief, this time you caught your foot
Turning to the left
With girl poison
A Pre canned star for mass production
To get even with my enemies
Put the rope around your neck and jump my nigga
And she's skinny
Yeah, when I get back I will talk
Do you even know who you are
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door
Great insidious sound leave me leave me be
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stonefaced while the building burned
Clench my teeth as I sleep
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
Ain't no doubt about it
Why the fixtures turn to serpents and snakes
I don't know who sold you that baby but it's a fake
"I've been believing in nothing since I was born
And "I don't mind if you break it all"
In the backseat of a car
In the eyeless dark
I think it's time to make a move on the contradiction
And pretend we're meeting cute
The life on display is trouble for sure
The air is breaking around our heavenly speed
My little girlscout, your mouth is getting sore
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
Will dominate your thought
Wir kannten uns seit Jahren sind zusammen abgefahren
Try to swing and hit, cause the things he can't control
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
I'm blind and waiting for you
They told me to teach you everything I know
And every single meeting with his socalled superior
And I spark a fire for the cold and the dark
Fall in love get married and forget the world
I put the balls on the money divulge in where
Too much alcohol and weed shot my ass out
I did this for you, I did this for you, not for your religion, not for your patterns
I can remember
We're talking just a little less shit
I love you, I hate you, I love you, I hate you,
And then I hear it click shut behind me
Should've listened to the facts that the black's been telling ya
Onceoccupied minds are activating
You missed another one
'Cos I got money to burn
You live in shit
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart
Desperate in his pain
I couldn't find the desire of my heart
I need help
When your innocence is gone
Oh, you know just playing a gig tonight
In the end unity will be thrust upon us
Some people thought I died that's just a rumor though
I like the way it moves me
A kiss and a simple goodbye
'Cause when they signed you, they thought you'd make a hit
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm liable to mate'cha king with three rooks
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
There's no point to grow
Why is the world cheating on me
And I, can't pretend, can't stand these trends
And everybody speaks in a dialect of rhyme
But it's really not funny
I was scared but you told me I'd come home if I wanted
This is the motion of the new revolution
How many of you have ever been
Could it kill me later on
And feelings will be hurt so your better of if you mind your business
Here comes a shoutout to the professor
A charade we play time after time time after time
For he always had a dream of that revolver in your purse
Well, you can write the play
My face seen as often as god's
Kick rocks, mother fucker
Naughty thoughts and a surprise under their shorts
In no general direction
Watch the bathos drift forth like the petals from a wild crafted rose
Too many times you're gonna go out river walking
It's nothin' gonna happen nothin' ever will
Little punk is the bull'seye of the industry target
I think of a lot of things walking home
Money is power motherfucker
And where'd I get the idea you
I used to have a girlfriend
I'll blacken your Christmas and piss on your door
And I rest again peacefully peacefully
Your life is over, your life is over
So fuck them too
And it might not come this way again
Take it to the street beeeeatchh
You try to tell me that you know best
Sometimes it feels like the weight of the world is on my shoulders
Doin' a buck and some change, not knowin' where the fuck I'm at
Tie this sin between your teeth
But they know, like I know, the black rhino
She takes the pills to fall asleep
And when the hope's gone the weight falls on me
das war kein Selbtmord
But she smokes a man's cigar
You wanted it
Love me, like me, come ahead and fight me
You lookin' like you doin pretty good, man
You claim to win battles
I'm the top of the show
He'd already wrote the note
Yeah, yeah
I know what I wanna do
Used to pride myself on living a life without any regrets,
Back to the light we return
Motherfucker, I want your blood
Now the ladies show me the goodies under their Wonderbra
Let it not subside
I'm human just like you
Nothing less and nothing more
Needs a piece of my respect
Oh it's all mine
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
Coming back on ya every woman you insult
The time has come and it's going nowhere
Desperate to see you in my rage
You would see things differently
Welcome to life
Weirder here's another burner born and big in ya
Niggas ain't real, please believe
My mind, my heart, my soul is calm
If there's war between the sexes then there'll be no people left
Keep the wack beats out true motherfuckin baller
Seven stars surround me as I burn like a saint
'Cause I'ma put a hole in your head
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting
And you don't have to please them, or try hard to save your name
You seem to think that I can't read between the calculated lines
Inside your heart I dig for more
I can fuck you betta, etta, etta, etta, etta, etta, aye
And you my friend
How can such sweet kisses come from such a poison tongue
I'm dying just to taste your lips
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
I fight all the rules I don't see the way
She maybe be crazy, she may not be right
Notre force la voilà, donc à nous d'le faire 
You're no use to me
Kick sand up in my face like I'm a wheel guard on your dirt bike
I feel so lame, 'cause that's the best I can do to express myself
More land for the people
Too many times you cleaned your love dry for your family
Scar Scar Can you feel my power
Was one who always did what you said
I hope you choke now sucker
You find me so hard to understand in your world
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
'Cause right now I'm dangerous
And I've cried with my little cry
Take some time and warm it with your hands
I've had enough mystery
Any ways
No more pain
Don't need you to say we're alright
You're not even tryin'
Nothing to play with
And the wild ones like to hide
When all about you doubt you
With secrets I can't tell
Than you've ever learned to face
Lick off the shot my stories shock ya like Ellison
Do not sit idly by, do not remain neutral
Got me a raygun
Don't want to hear about it
More schools for the people
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
You're not quite right
Only to wake up in their own personal hell to go through,
We're gonna have a TV party all right tonight
Shut down by a guy I never wanted to kiss
Big brother, beware, 'cause some of us do care
Peace to my third world equivalent,
I don't want your reptile embrace
I am not a pretty girl
Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear
The ball I threw back days ago
That turns the tide
Jackie O with the top down open
Don't feel like Satan
carne e cannoni ed io
You told me you can't wait to see me
anche ai loro sentimenti danno un prezzo
You fucking in this shit
But he said "Do you guys need a place to stay"
It's high class meets white trash
Yeah, hey hey, few things that I wanna sayay
Where there's a nest filled with baby birds that starve for their mother
These wounds, they will not heal These wounds won't heal
And get my future plan
And they know it now but no one makes a sound
Single, my ass
I want to be a good father, but
It's like when I'm feeling happy then I'm jealous of me
I will see you screaming
Yes I guess we need the drama
Must I always be playing, playing your fool
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can
That keeps me living, keeps me breathing
"Baby, your kiss don't do anything"
Uns gehörte die Welt und dafür brauchten wir kein Geld
Witch hunt burn this girl
Turnin' the double play
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a vacation cause all this shit got me stressing
On a cold white snow, plus with the right flow
I live to blasphem, You'll never understand me
Dass unsere Liaison jetzt vorbei is
See when they offer me book of gold,
Homie don't play that
Well heaven's not so far away
You noble diggers all stand up now
Turn it off, turn it off
Lost to butchers, lost to child killers, lost to narcotic ritual
And without consternation our laws are lost
I've watched men
You get hot rush feeling on your lips
I'm potentially the illest lyricist upon the planet
With a fuck you, fuck you,  a comium
These people don't change
Little punk did it all for the nookie
On life's brittle glass
I'll rip your mind out, I'll burn your soul
She licked her lips and said, "I had a really fun night"
And I'm colliding with the space you're making
Well I've got a bad feeling about this
Listen, I'm sure, you've got a few ideas
I want you to know, I love you my dear
While a thousand miles away, in a warehouse complex down by the river,
Baby, I said I want to know
I can chew like a cannibal, I can yell like a cat
I regret that I trusted
Fear is how I fall
Something in your heart
When I die, set me free from the lies 
Decended from a line
This could be my chance to break out
That meaning you heard means you were making me sick
They're gonna kill your sons
The price of your soul is less than the cab fare 
Hey man, have fun
I pick myself up off the ground 'cause I don't give a shit
Prolly got me on a radar with a dot
She ain't made of westside plastic
All I want is a little respect Some respect
Gimme noise
Window pain 
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight
Thugs that'll blaze with laser guns
Nothin' but burn riches down, I should grab your jaw
I'm in my room
I can see the truth lies in your eyes
Mobbin' in the park after dark wanna start shit
I've kissed so many faces, lips smooth, just like a shark
You wanna be rich right hell yeah
But I'm crippled with desire
My spirit can smell your fear
I know I'm big and proud all over, not just on the stage
I don't think that it's so punk
Go 'head playa boy that's how you get shot
And I'm fucking you
In your head
Att självmord är den enda vägen ut
Ill thoughts disperse, we're the first and last
You wanna take it all, it's never quite enough
I have a fucking brain, You should know it
Bad blood  Up to your head
Pumping melodies and memories too, my head's killing me Ooh
She wants to stand
Hand of God, I feel the finger,
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
Stop it, stop it
Half the world is down the toilet
In the streets there is no EQ, no didodidodido
Radio won't even play my jam
I still believe it, John, we lived those nights
A feather bed where slept a psalm
But first you have to help yourself
Obnoxious nigga, murderous lyrics, I know that you hear it
Fuck your religion, fuck your decisions
The devils own
Too bad if you don't believe it
Set them up for a fall when you can 
I'm not afraid of happy endings
Just pull the trigger, I got nothin' to lose
I'll show no allegiance
Ready to slightly lose my brain
Till you loosened me and let me go toward the everlasting light
Looking for someone
And we wander through this soul
I'll fire back a fuck you
The next few lines because they're directed at you
Never say enough
I need someone young, willing and able
And it's always comforting
You wanna know what's really bothering me
Off her back, jab her if she act
They just glide through my eyes
If you don't believe the theory, then argue with this logic
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely
How many you betray
If I knew the answer 
Are we out of love now, is this just a bad patch
Yesterday, I was dirty
The way that you turned your back on me
And it's three days old, going on forever
I'd get right back on the aeroplane
I beat her at that one good 
And the fax fucking rings and rings
And now in your eyes, I can't find you
Spinning till they hit the ground
We choked on street tap water
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments indeed
And the band played on
I hold on
You know it makes me wanna shout,
Said I'd get to heaven if I acted real nice,
Some life must die
And they fall on my skin making tiny holes
Who is that punk with the three point shot
And I'm sorry, Dad, no, I'm not making this up
What I want
The loveliest and the naughtiest
Lie  I just wanna 
When will this ever end
The earth squeals and shudders to a halt
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew
God knows it's gonna make me smile
I'll carve these bitches one slice at a time
What's out tonight calling to nothing
Martyrs bleed
inem and Kim combined, *kch* the maniac's in
I wanna tell ya 'bout a girl
Do my dirty work
If you don't have a record that's the main attraction
On some silent shit just get it stuck it's some violent shit
Don't you ask me how I know
Oh sweetness, all I need is a brand new heart
With music and words I've been playing
When they get what they want, they never want it again
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you
Now I have come to be a walking enmity
You don't know how to save my soul
It just cannot be defied
A loss of feeling, a sense of threat
And there's an error in my soul
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Eminem
MY best interest is What are you trying to say, I'M crazy When I went to 
Squeezing your own ass, so pretty, except the way that it's used for shitting
Soothe every ache with the touch of your skin
Out of this wasted life
They're tampering with our minds
Don't touch, back up, I'm not the one
I didn't tell you which way to go
Oops, up on the wrong side of the bed
You just got burnt by the controller
I probably just need a rest,
Damn I make her feel all right
Who'd rather arm the world than give it food
They drill them to the ground,
Well, you may be king for the moment
And I don't want your religions
Dirty little secret, dirty little lies
Your hand's on my crutch
Commemorating sickle moons
My hands are tied
"Compton", a nigga gotta scream that shit
U pussy like a bitch
Pray them a prayer and turn out the light
Profit made
I can see the truth in you even when you're lying
Drawn to the taste of broken glass
At the door we don't wait 'cause we know them
Den enda sanna tron
Safe from pain and truth and choice and other poison devils
City of Baghdad City of scholars
These people hate each other
The sun in the sky
No way, I don't need it, I don't need your love to disconnect
Got burnt once, but that was
If you're sick
I'm not stopping the car until I make you cry, I'll drive it all night
I'd rather be working
You punch 'em like a mother fucker even rape a few
You're all going to die down here
That death ain't a sin when you're living in hell
Dareunmareun anhae ginagin chimmungman
Everybody wants to scratch your back then
Where all the pretty people go
"I just wanna be with you"
As his brothers not his enemies
The nigga makin' you sick, ask the  monkeys
And I'm the one to dispense it, She seem almost defenseless
To hell with you and all your friends
You're not worried 'bout what I'm doing too
ne tahtoo Ingalsin Lauran
Your will to ignore, but when it cuts back round
I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are
She's heard it said, by the drone in her head, that the wages of spend is debt
Making the world a nicer place
My face is numb
Numberless troops lie wounded or dead
Because this is not my trip
With eyes wide open
I'll run wild through the fields
In your back yard just to fuck with your guard dogs
I want to drag you down, down with me
Where these beads of sweat feel like a flood
And then I'll fall past
I wanna kill and rape you the way you raped me
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Black earth energy receptor fields
We on the look for the advantage, we work hard
If you live in the eternal now you're a ball in hand
Shells of ourselves outside
Call me anything you want, call me everything you will
You can watch on TV,
And she's getting a degree in fucking you
The end of time
Well, you can tell everyone I'm a down disgrace
So High and you can't feel it
I see your finger fly
It runs away 
Yeah, go and run, tell your little boyfriend
Just to let you turn the other cheek
Wait patient now they're alert to your call
Like kill me in law
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
So you can just suck my cock
That covers me with scars that never fade
But me know I'm not a fear to you
Power to the people and the beats
That needs no consent
No, sorry won't turn back the tide
The body goes back to hospital where it comes alive again
Have sex in the back of a black Lex or an Acura
You hear the voices as the wind blows
No no no no I don't care
BUCK BUCK BUCK, 'cause I don't give a motherfuck
Let me count the ways
Flash faster than my eyes can meet
You may not like what they said
A painting of morality
Chinese New Year let's call it a day
Feel this hate
Squeeze on MC's, with bullet train speed
Now we agree and understand
 gauge waving at your brain, strange universe, I'm too famous
And now I see stars
I watched that episode too
Oh god please listen fast
She's crying 'cause of what he might do
The sins, the sins the heavenly limbs that greet below the red, red lights,
Before I saw cats, making weapons out of your thorax
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
I'll bust off on her face, and right after this segment
Inherited the trait to make both ends meet
Is this what you do with eternity
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us
All it's hate, all it's pain so
Everything I do would be interesting
I'm not no whipping boy for you
Mais ça on savait, y avait pas égalité au niveau des chances 
Does it matter what anybody cares
I've lost and can't have back across the aftermath
I attach no importance to it
It's all fucked you've blown it
The names are always changing, in the end it's just a game
And I would never ever try and hurt you again no no
And if you're scared by what you're left with
But I need sleep and it's kind of late
And to laze around in bed
You feel to moan but unlike before
Then if you're tall, handsome and strong
Hornblende flakes have wedge shape
I don't believe you when you fuck me
My niggaz love fuckin' bitches that they just met
 mm inoculation
But I'm not really convinced when you say that you're impressedhell no
All my friends are embryonic
Where the kid got shot
I just can't help but sort
Ow, be like wild with my style
Walked backwards, fucked like a fox
To fall down at your door
Always a little lover
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself
My world is evil but American made
Screw my brain 'til it hurts
I can't breathe if I cannot see
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
An adult film star paints thumbnail portraits of elderly couples, fully clothed and smiling
But I can't remember when
We are the world's most dangerous niggas alive
Just how much you fucked with me
And they know they killed our heroes too
As the library was burning
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
This the shit niggaz kill for
Why'd you call me by somebody else's name
'Cause I would walk  miles
I'm gonna behead niggas that don't believe this
The bosses want decisions
I divorce the taunting acts of violence
When the beats drop, you'll get hold of 'em
Where we made mistakes
Oheeoh goes the cop on the beat
Singing hallelujah the king is dead
Going "straight" will get you nowhere
I'll skin your ass raw
Places are being prepared and readied night and day, night and day
So oh, no, no, no
Themselves, shot down, or
Tearing at the doors of education
At war with the demons that live in infernal regions
Denn jetzt fliehen sie im Scharen
So shoot the president
I think I'm being watched
I am sleeping
When you hear a sound
Fuck that motherfucking bullshit
And leave my song standing longer than the Parthenon
From six stops away
And it runs deeper than you dared to dream it could be
Round here, hey man, I got lots of time
Why was I never good enough
Anata ga koe no,
And you don't give a fuck about me"
Friends will come and go as it seems
For precious progress we lay this world to waste 
Feel that I know you do, guess what I wrote it too
It seems to me that you couldn't care less so I'm not going to do it anymore
Condemned in his mind
Was I sleeping What How can you be so sure
Weakened knees call
Most black folks be made to die
I live with this guilt in my head, 
But everybody knows it's all about the things
And why do I defend your ignorance
You roll like the road is yours
Had to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your bitches
My body yearns for the warmth of snow
So I took the shotgun off the wall
And waltz to earth so gently
Someone put in your head
And get ready for tomorrow, I gotta waste my whole today
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
Of nothing
Solemn words that were both spoke but not emerged
Your mind is sacred
With her own innocence surrounding her
I'm gonna watch her die
I really used to believe
I'm smashing every country, bitch I'll send you a postcard
Cold and alone, dead and disintegrating,
Take another look at me now
See the sin in your grin and the shape of your mouth
Go ahead Say your peace
All my friends are broken toys
I got a feeling we ain't meant to live this way
I'll be waiting with my eyes closed
This is for right now
We don't play fair
Everything about me is a lie,
Reading through your messages my favorite way to die
When emergency diversions ring the celly or the doorbell
I scanned the skyline
What better way than rid the world of all the walking waste
Time will tell what has been denied you
Oh I just move in another dimension
No I wouldn't have kissed your face
Many man you say hello to the bad guy
I just want things to be the same
I can yellscream and small all I want
I wanna leave it up to you
I stopped lookin' then they found me
They brought this nightmare to life
And dead your eyes they cannot cry
You better get off my back
We would have made a hit
Older than days and age
Don't want nobody to follow me 'cept maybe you
I pity the fool that falls in love with you, uhhuh
So he crowned himself king now no one remembers his name
When you say "best friends" means friends forever
And I'll never come cryin' for sympathy
Oh, what's the matter Kim, am I too loud for you
Did you think that I would disappear
Why, oh, why just like a snowman
I'll be there, and see ya and now you gotta open up your eyes
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Like a wall 'cause I'm hard, I represent GOD
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I'm losing my mind, everything's fine
Fight the power for peace
I felt in your pocket and found your sweet woman's comb
Water, food and drive
It happens everyday
By just thinking of yourself
And needs a friend on the end of that other line
The weight of the world is on our shoulders
Woh, woh, bullet the blue sky
Don't blow those brains yet
Wage my war internal
Leaves me for dead and nothing drags me from
The collision is always licking it's lips
Four dead in Ohio How many
Dear Preacher, thanks for making time for me today, I hope you don't mind if I hide behind the curtain It's been fifteen years since my last confession; by your good book's standards I sinned like a champion, but that book seems a tad bit outdated
Now this angry little girl
I take my glock and I point godpoint guard like Brevin Knight
On est venu squatter les sommets you mothers fuckers don't know me
Maledetto me che sto morendo
I will surely find another way
Le noir est plutôt gris
We seem to end in nosedive 
Denn ein Sinn für die Wahrheit schlägt in ihrer Brust
Live for your taste
No way, no way, no way, yeah yeah, to disconnect, yeah
Bare hands will decapitate and bash your face
You lost control
New sweat to drown me in
This is not the world that I remember
Can't stop now give me all your money
Suck, suck, suck it,
I annihilate a fake persona for spare change
I don't want him
How 'bout me being half awake and crying 
The pain in your veins
There's no innocence
Stripped me of my power
I know what it is I can see it in my dreams
That one day
Alone on his haunches the hair raises on the back of his neck
Can you please hurry up 'cause I find you obscene
And if you diss the code of honor we takin' your head;
Could it be that I'm demanding
'Cause when it comes to rocking something fierce
And I'm still a manikin
My heart is cracked from being left out in the cold
What's in my mind
But don't ask why, bitch Ask why not
And I'm feeling torn apart
Is the only sound
I've got something that you all should know
I feel like I could lose my mind
And the black markets,
My friends said "Man she'll give you the blues, so man, don't get caught"
Then write a book about how I wanted to die
I'm A Swing It watch me bring it to the next level
You were never the martyr you pretended to be
First things first I'll eat your brains
And I know what they mean
With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me
But most of you rap niggas is hoes to me
Heavy weight on my mind
In the brain
Niggas saying "Free Earl" without even knowin' him
Squint, think and squeeze when you can see me and the whites of my eyes
just until my hands are steady
That's in my life
'Cause no matter where you are, a struggle's nearby
So the city just wants the same
A group of teenage boys watches a video of a father playing catch with his son
Draw a letter on my skin
Padłam na bruk, tobie wprost pod nogi
Look at us now,
Cross back with your kind
 Will you forgive mine 
Yours, unconditional love and hate 
Taste I have no taste 
My brother's blood
How many men unleashed their frustration between her thighs
These are the things we come to recognize as truth
So you tryna get some attention by cussing and eating a fucking cockroach
Gonna rip your heart out the way you did mine, Daddy
It's alright I feel no pain
He's big disgrace to our beastly ways
Tonight, rat poison for dinner 
'Cause you're bad right through and don't know right from wrong,
The skyscrapers
Cathedrals labors loathing, leaving the lookers soaking,
As I'm watching our decay
He knows what to do and moves to commit the deed
To ya if you got a minute you'd bobbin ya head like a walking pigeon
I need blow
And with nothing to do on a night
Tell me now what have we done We don't know
I don't believe you when you tell me
L'amore non dura, baby
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Sunshine an enemy
Your fucking culture alienates me
Tha power pedulum swings by the umbillical cord
So don't make it seem as if the only one bleeding is you
She's right where she always wanted to be
I think its time to cut out those envious eyes
New found power 
Look what's happening now it's all your fault
I can shop for clothes without her help it's cool, it's fine
There's no sense in running from nothingx
Whatever, whatever, I can't speak
Creative control they withhold
Really hand me a line
Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker
My country's enemies
Me, yeah
Where money stood, we planted seeds of rebirth
Not a fucking thing
Stickin' feathers in your ass does not make you a chicken
These lebels think backwards They push the acts that need it the least
And I'll wait my turn
Go on drive me wild
I can't breathe until I see you waking
As cold as ice not witch, you're ice, ice baby
See now they acting like they ain't knowing
The maniac psycho, Cool J screamed the shit, but I still can't believe it
I am not for you one
You've got to get your self respect
Break up with my girlfriend, so I can bang sluts
When there's nowhere left, when there's nowhere left to go
I'm just afraid my life won't work that way
Everybody needs to find their own way through life,
Everybody knows she's the number one suspect
With no color at all
But I know it's 'cause you think you're adam
Every day it rains, so every day the pain
Squeal if you want to
When your blood begins to thicken
It's your world
She's got a body and you've got the answers to all of her problems
And every crotch is a siamese gun
All us gripclip samurais and safety pin street beggars
I have no friends, I hope that's understood
Don't call me, don't you call me, I've just had enough now
Just know I'm doing something you ain't
Sinking, spinning
I go wild 'cause your promises are broken
Sex, death and money
You want to make up the rules and the provisions
Get gun Shoot
não me peça pra entender
 heures de TIG, j'ai fermé ma gueule et j'ai assumé 
I'm not that straight A anymore
And maybe its cause you can't wait
Next in line to get fucked up
Sometimes I feel you're not listening
Idon'twantanythingfromyou
The embalmment fluids goes back out, the blood goes back in
You say one thing do another
Hold back your breath
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Cause everybody want to get the black
It don't mean a thing 'cause I don't wanna mess around with a joker
Those kids suck, yeah check emcee
Look at these niggas with attitudes Hello
Then your engine in the driveway
I have to for myself, yeah, yeah
I Am your voice your vow to be
I know just how much I love you
It's all gonna change in a hurricane of darkness and pain
And I kissed a girl with a broken jaw
You're off track tonight, and if you snooze you lose
Psychiatrists play god  I know
Woman like a man, woman like a man, like a woman like a man, woman like a man
With his new found friend
They said "Son you're a oneinamillion minority"
There's nobody left who cares you're alive
A little love crime
Yeah, when I get back I will call
In the center of the earth
Cave into kisses cold and wet
Can't take another dusting cause the egg is going to crack
Denounce the spears
Cleansing every sore
"Nail me to my car tell you who you are"
Like trust ain't a factor
"Here is where you rest"
You think I've lost my mind
I raise my fist up to the sky
I'm sick of always writing songs for you to slit your wrists to
Fuck the righteous wave and ride the evil undertow
Because you push me you push me over the edge
I don't deserve my broken heart
Bloody Sunday
Helpless die for you in vain,
You try to help
Listen, somewhere in the jungle you can hear the devil laughing
I don't care what the critics say or saving for a rainy day
Sometimes I drive quick
Erst wenn i woass dass
Shed no tears
There was fire everywhere and nothin' was spared
Walk in half view
Your heart says "No" but your feelings show the poor baby never knew
My inner storm blows
I killed myself so many times
But some things are better left alone
And I met your old girlfriend,
I think I had enough
They used to, though, back when we were hardcore
My pride's at stake
Turn their bleeding hearts
There's something strange about the way you move your body
There's so much more I want to say 
Japanese cars man such a pity
But you still wanna hate, be my guest
Wildin off a zone and a whole half a gallon
And build walls from fragments of my past,
And when you learn your lesson
I could use someone to talk to
And now my dick has a permanent imprint of my hand around it
We should be indicted for bullshit we inciting
We hate love
You'll be in the corner crying
Leave your fuckin' necks clipped
One goddamned word I ever said
Well, deep water, deep water, senseless denial
Freaking techniques  this creature of speech
The pain that won't go away
But I don't feel like crying
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain
And you came crawling back
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
I would jack off so much back at my parents' house
I keep my distance
Your man is mine
And read the bloodstains on the sheets
Make sure everybody dies, when we ride, on our enemies
You choke like a son of a gun
Just a ticking clock
I want justice I want you overthrown
Killing just as many
I'm sick of muthafckers talking about "the West died"
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I won't be thinking about you baby
She didn't know what to do about dad
And I don't give a damn, my heart made me drunk but my mind is sober
Forced into evil, It's all in your head
I watch the snow make slow time
Got too many things to do
Thought you could get all you wanted
I should've said to go to hell and take it all with you
Releasing the fear
On a rack of skin and sin 
Sitting on a fence is a man who sees no sense at all
You can all be winners if you let your soul fly free
She gets the skills from the pills
In my head, I'm on my knees
Died, go to hell
Desintegration of humanity
I know there's nothing left to say
So I'll walk the plank and I'll jump with a smile
That someone understands
Cannot be allowed to pollute
You feel black and blue
I will not bow
I bleed forever and not a thing you do can comfort me spoken
Keep on rockin' in the free world
I know you do
Now I don't know and I don't care
Stand up now, stand up now
I can fuck you betta, baby
Yeah, that's them, the migrant seasonal workers
Your self respect
So much crap coming out, it must take you all day
Kicking back a whiskey 'til the sun come up
I'm looking the mirror
Def jam greedy, we all know priority greedy as a motherfucker, hahaha
And that you're standing in the doorway
The indescribable is up for discussion
Like a man, man, man, man
Peel away the shell and we're frightened on the inside
There are two types of morningsmournings in this life I can surmise
Her mouth was distorted from razor sharp kisses
Then break up
Lick my licks, I'm on fire,
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me
I see this whole world headin' for damnation and I'm ready to leave
Will you speak out Will you defend me
My revolution STARTS HERE
A ball and chain I call my own
There is nothing left and I have got no hope
Where's your mother
The revolution has gone the way of so many before
When there's no one left to pardon your sins
I'm living in a human teenage mediocrity
They just want to see you
The way I got police barricading the block off
You always disappoint me
Putting their product in your hand
I won't have to mention that's always what happens
Isn't there enough to talk about
Like a fist fight
Life used to be lifelike
Until Jesus is the only master we'll never break the bars of this jail
If you'll be my enemy
Murder rates increases, bullet holes the size of fifty cent pieces
Game, Biggie, Hov, prolly Pac, Nas, no particular order
Yesterday don't mean jack shit 
Ah, you want to know what makes me tick
Is used, it feels like you used it up
Every fucking thing that deals with You is fucking suspect
Absolutely no respect
Let these old punk ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit
Niggas fear what they don't understand
And anyone around and all the people in the street
Just give it back to me
Time to sing
Found so many ways to put them all away
An American flag he hung down from the roof
But I know you see exactly where the bottles is going
If your heart was simple just like mine is, then you would know just how it feels
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart
Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin' Damn homies is dissin you
I'm reminded of your death
Comin' back again 
Come on, rear your ugly head to me 
I've lost the fear and the horror
And she stares at the fire all day, mumbling to herself
Ich lieg' in meiner Kotze
We hold on
Now I have taken control
She screams for more and that is not a dream
Had to make moves our home was so fucking little
The people have spoken
On your flesh
And my fear broke apart like fifty balloons
But believe me I'm innocent
Take a good look at the sad state of the world,
If you are thinking, you are winning
One another And I'll live without you love,
Of this beauty and her innocence
Je ramasse mes parts de marché as a millions dollar boy baby
Amantiamicionanistiribelli
And it comes to me as no surprise
But no matter what I try
Pure flesh and bone to rip through
What you want, what you want from me
Damn woman she makes me oh so blue
Shame on a nigga who try to
Living in your own world
You're the king of the sleaze
Your body like a basket
On your back drop your ass like a heart attack
The end is spoken, long since overdue
Funny how no one knows we came
I I I I I was robbed
I try to leave all things behind
Selling papers in the street
But I can't remember what it was that made me
 Okay then, wha wha what'd he say There only one way you can bring about a revolution for people
I will rebel in the face of all tyrants
The wind was raging, and the stars were black
Yes, I am alone, but then again I always was
Nunca quedas mal con nadie
The lawyers they conjoin stand up now
As a century ends
There is no one here that understands me anymore
Of a lifeless happy ending
Hey, would you tell me why
Whose fruits might never not ripen until after their life
The end of an era
Tear the scar, be a fighter
You know it's only the beginning 
They cannot repress me
I'm starting to see now
It's still so dark because it's
Backstabber 
I divorce the thoughts of you in love with me
I don't need what you ain't got
Strike a match get back and watch that sucker burn
My best friend
The river runs red and I think I'm dyin'
Can you be happy for one moment in your life
I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin
I wszystko znowu trafia szlag
My nigga Jasper, dirty fatass, that nigga boxers stink
Y'all check this shit out
Make a body work
Fuck you You did this to us, you did it, it's your fault
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
I get money
She wants to free the kingdumb
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Paying lipservice to shame
It's like I'm a welcoming freakshow doormat
You keep on asking me this question
Outta her nightmare and back into mine
He's a quick boy walkin' round the bend
I always knew there would be times like these
Niggas on a chain gang used to do that Huh way back
You were a sentimental mercenary in a free fire zone 
As you catch your death
But I lost my taste
As you claw at my eyes
So stupid but not stupid enough
But retreat is not an option
I tear, tear out my heart
Wants to own up to the truth
Like a necromaniac raping a corpse, up the anal passage, while contracting genital warts
I left it out all lying in a box 
They act so discreet, they are hypocrites so fuck them too
'Cause they make they own money, plus decide how to spend it
When all of this time, you're turning
I've seen it turn from white to red
At both ends
This disease infested ball of lust and carnage
Well the days go by and you wonder why, "is this really true"
Mammon, opiate of the masses
Until I get with all my loyal niggaz goin' the length
Do you think it'll run that way
A photo the size of a kiss
And for the straights that got fire cars
A deep sore dragged through ages
It didn't take long for her to know me
Human sacrifices, cannibalism; candles and exorcism
You have no answers to our questions
Who you tryna fool
It's the blood in your tears
It's making me sick 
Yeah, that shit hot, nigga
I am never enough, I am the forgotten child
Predicts that passion turn to strife
Clawing it's way back grinning You know
The drugs have given you all kinds of different sores
Let the light in, Let the kids play, Let the people know
Stay out late, make out, bring a friend
So let me tell you something Mr Whyyoucan'tquit
Did we distract you
What the future could mean
And choking on your candy flesh
I can see your face
Kick it back in its face, my God
I'm sure she's down for what anyone's down for tonight
The music she make, rubbing our faces in the feces of the daybreak
There are so many things I want to tell you
Tell me what's the game now
Yeah living in yellow skin so I shed and borrow shed and borrow
Making up everything that's in my mind
It made a mess outta me
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
But I can hear the most melancholy sound
Waiting on a revolution that I can follow I can follow Yeah
Among the excrement of my sins
Made a promise not to clean the slate
Motherfucker
The cardboard change game, it ain't far from someone else's truth
Clean up what is left of you
Get someone else to do the thinking please
Bet you sleep like a child with your thumb in your mouth
Sixty miles talking
Seeking love without exception
How they love you now
The taste of your lips I RECALL
Baby you're always using mine, why you get
And you speak in tongues to me
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
Out of shape, out of mind and out of time
Let's burn down the parliament and watch the flag cook
There are ways
I hate to say it but fuck it, shit I done lost faith
To know that the flame still burns
To know the eyes you stare at me with aren't honest
Sudden swoop skyward iron horse overpass
I wanna new face right now
A big pill but you know that you need a poison
Now Don't fuck the style
With the taste of sweat on my tongue
Touch down new ground stop living on the moon 
So sink in your tusks, mighty walrus
Sacred chickens pecking cement
Once in a life you can look down one road
And I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
She's got it all, that's what they want you to think,
In Schlangenlinien durch die Fleiß und Preisgesellschaft
Gonna move on ahead
There's lots of good rubber left on these tires
We sat by the fire and ate a goat
And as I wait, I'm dying
I pack a chainsaw
But you've got no right to sit there saying I abuse it when you only sleep with girls who say they like your music
But ah the bums say oh
Devastate my life
If you made plans or not
Please forgive me Jesus for now I know
Don't cry,
Do you understand
You're a scumsucking shitty guy, so die Taylor, die
Save this, my rage is bliss, I'm taking names and getting pissed
And I've done nothing but lead you on and on," she said
Now she's feeling more alone
I'll lick my wounds, could you pass the salt
You're not rid of me No, You're not rid of me
Load your gun the damage done
Das war ein mieser, feiger Mord
I've been beaten
Where was the fear, when I said I was scared
The game is lost  the game is lost  is lost
Scenes of violence protect this
Lies you're bleeding 
I don't believe you when you hold me
The rivers are flowing with blood
I hold an element of surprise
The blood is on your hand
Pushed straight over the edge
For you know this isn't the first time
I'm not the one
So we about to blow like Parliament in "V for Vendetta"
To come till I tell
It's time the truth goes out
At home with a roach hazed, alone or with hoes great
I am not the son of shaklak klak
It makes you go to hell
I am a liar, yeah, I am a liar, yeah, I like it
What's the matter with you
Now the world needs to see that it's time you should go
The jewels around her neck retain a curious sheen, god is in my heart and tearing at the seams,
I wouldn't be in the crib, I'd be loadin up, to run in your house
I'm not Jesus, Jesus wasn't there
Shaking as her sex takes hold
It's the feel 
Edinburgh Castle hugging the sky
As I smoke my tree, medlar, South African
I went to a church and stabbed the pastours heart without a warning
When it might have made some kind of a difference
My second life has just begun
You could say everything's no good
But I'll be back to haunt them
We let him fill Our needs
In the days of rage
This is not what I want, this is not what I need
Pardon me if I'm too intense, just tired of common sense
Depression drinks me deeper
Keep looking for some thing sweet,
Just what you're gonna do now
I lost it all to that flicker of pearly white
I love our sunburnt country, I love it a lot
I feel your arms surrounding me
You married disaster, it ended your life, 
Every foolish game, every midlife rage
Step up to my friends in the alley tonight
And I can't get to sleep
Let me bleed for what I've done
You get too drunk, you get too high
I'm above you, smiling at you drown, drown, drown
I'll never be so quick to trust, trust again
I am human, I'm alive
Oh no, I've seen it before
The bag turn it  degrees
And all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge
When will you come to get me out of my fear
No hurt, no pain, no shame
We need vices to wave to the funeral days
Don't apologize  I hope you choke and die
And we hide behind loss, anger, hate
One kid took another kid
Sometimes I feel like I've broken through
You coffee shop revolutionary sonofabitch
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
It's getting all your friends
And take turns to burn religious doctrines
You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back
Fell from your lips
I was hoping you would be waiting there for me lately 
Hold on, hold on
When lies are easy to find
You're living your life in total hate
But to unplug is to spill a restless world at unset knees
Why not kill your maker instead
The whore you'll miss the most when you're away
I'm sorry if I disagree
Fugees Fugees and Mobb Deep tryin' to diss now too huh
My young hips, they know how to entrance
She says, "I can help you, but what do you say
The drugs 
The things I used to hate, I have learned to accept
Making lies up for all the right questions
Perfect lines like space and time extend across my room
I still know your name
This is not the first time I came to the planet
Search me So you want a piece of this
Pass me the key
Bell hoppers to the death while Irish hoes deep throat
They got us using drum machines now
Lord my soul ain't satisfied
Goodies in the basket
The first time always hurts you know
You can do no wrong,
The fear I see when I look in your eyes, hey, hey, hey
It's running in the family, hey baby
Me I take the cynics role, throw scorn on your empty mind
Well I ain't no superman
Contestants in a suicidal race
There's nothing I can do
Or at the falling of a tree
This is it now
Glaub mir ich kontrolliere das nicht
Tell nothing except who to idolize
The cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing
The time we spend
'Cause you were thinking about you, so 
He laughs as Kiev burns on the six o'clock news
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
Everybody wants somewhere
Oh now you can see the reason why not everyone's the same
Oh, why do I defend the state you're in
What about human rights
He wants to grow to twenty feet tall
A war is taking place
Everything I hide ends up in lyrics
Too many things I got to know
Been loved to lied to been a bride to a death wish
Per ora non ho fatto il cash e va bene Marra
I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it
Was one who always did what you said baby you cared
I cannot rest, or my consciousness contest
I need to belong
No kind of life, this is no kind of life  I've got to get out
Das Haar voll Glanz, die Haut wie Samt
Just remember we will always be here
I know blue eyes get boring 
Struggle just in living, that's the realm of
As stonewalls caged the beast
But right now I just don't like you
To be born again in the thrill of sin
Ich sah mir meine Hand an, sie hatte noch nie gesprochen
It's looking more like a kick to the face
Screams of pain dismembering the wind
For life is a chain, cause and effected
Dirty, I keep shit stinks in my
Burnin up in the atmosphere of life
Take my head and kick it in
Do I need therapy, or do I need a good kick in the ass
Cellular phone soundin' a death tone
Hard enough to believe in myself
I'd get down on my knees if I could beg you to see
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
Tellin' me how sick I am
Lord I got into a fist fight
What better time than now to bandage your bleeding
Dr Dre Was it a bitch in the mix
So heads a wieder auf
No stranger's feet
I had to beg you not to leave
We'll never let up until we hear every voice scream
Get a grip right now
To burn your candle
Battle battle battle
And nobody makes us wait
You'll come and go but I'm a permanent sight
While you're in the benzo messin with broads
I thought I could change you
Whose soul are you tormenting now 
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
A shallow little xxx kiss art disaster
See, I could never be a fat guy I'll tell you why One simple reason the first day I wake up and can't see my dick, I STOP EATING OK "Honey, I can't see my dick Give the dog some of the food, 'cause I'm going to Ethiopia I CAN'T SEE IT Can you see it I can't feel it" Freak I have to see my dick first thing in the morning That's the kind of relationship we have Wake up, first thing, "Hey, how ya doing" "Good, how ya doing" "Terrific, you wanna jerk off now" "Ya, why not" Oh yeah, jerkin' off is like an aerobic thing for me now I'm forty, now I do it every day I do it eeevery day I've even gone beyond porno, I'm back to regular network TV Oh yeah People wonder why "Caroline in the City" is getting such big ratings I'll tell you why I know why
I could write or I could read, go next door and smoke some weed
Been gone more days this year than I have been home
Where heaven looks down
Keep your drink just give me the money
With their violence and pomposity
Crazy fraud lovers kill off inside
I want to stand alone
You made me suffer for so long
Was it not what you wanted it to be
Don't you fucking know what you are go on get back to where you belong
Only thing I know
I'm a dark storm cloud that's floatin' over top of suburbia
But I ain't one to jump through hoops to make the first impression
I swear I'll never never feel like myself again
Don't try and front fool
And when I smoke, I will smoke gaping holes in my chest
Kick Artist jump the knocker nothing but a shife
You gotta' just trust me to hold your hand through
Way up in the heaven
I throw it right back at 'em so happily can't believe that they have the audacity
And it's wild wild wild wild 
If there's one thing you remember
But right now I just don't
Everybody knows you're no beginner
The people I looked up to are not for real
The old man is dressed in white clothes
But who knows
They're the backbone of this town
But you've lost your soul
Ieeieei and I die fadin' straight away
I want to make you bleed
Said they pack the , they fire it at prime time
I'm 'a fucking snap like Berman when he acts right
The cinema speaks as you take off your clothes and burst into dissimulation
Yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
Tú te crees un juglar moderno o algo así
You're no better than your enemy
There will be without the Motown sound and thunderbird
"How come you ain't made it yet"
For once you're a man of your word
Murderous rap revealed goin' for kill
I will begin to turn it around
March march march to the beat of the drum
Your brains are in your sac, you two faced fucking fake
I know you know, I know you know"
"I want to be cured"
I want to go, I want to get out
Past tense, my best friend
There's no devil's haircut in your mind
His dead eyes pierce the night
I'm just tryna survive today
With a flat fluid embrace
A real party not just people who're faking fun
It' s sad when someone you know very well decides to fuckin' die and go away
And Juliette had her Romeo
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta, etta, etta, etta, etta, etta, aye
Tell me they lucky I don't suddenly go off and cause another Dem
You monkey, you left me 
Even through the darkness, I can see you shining
You come around looking 
If all I've got is everything and everything is all you want
I feel like I could explode
So I could sleep some more
Silence when I try to talk to you
Wanna be somebodies Na, na, na, na, na
With your gun, nightstick, and mace come on be a man
Friend you'd better think again,
But I'm nicest when I'm clappin' at my enemies neck's
I hope you break every bone
There are evil voices in my head
And I'm in your bed
To take this headache away
Titianium, criminal minded, swift
I don't do this for my health, I do it so I feel like hell
Cause, if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine
Sometimes fun others run their mouth or away
So don't go out tonight, don't
So live your life, you've only one
It's every players favourite crime, to make you feel
If you relating let me hear ya say yeahyay yeahyay
seguindo ideais ridículos
I wrapped it up and send it
God puppet beats a drum
Hey, what's going on man
And everything I've hoped to be or ever thought I was
A life that's growing feeble
We're only making plans for Nigel
My mouth has sprung wide open
The feeling is so that I'm sick and I'm breaking up
Then we moved
You're the ones sitting in church every Sunday
Want to feel something of value
They'll hang the bullies and the louts that dampen down the day
If everything you said to me was a lie then
Hah hah hah hello hello hello hello
If you die, tell 'em that you played my game
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
Did you sing "Oh happy day"
That it's no sacrifice, because the price is paid
Is death the only way to get attention
I was fine before you walked into my life
United with the eternal day
Don't call me boy, don't call me, I've just had enough now
Know as an outsider, recognized as a lone wolf
They break like waves of hunger and desire upon these eroded shores
Und die Liebe führt uns ans Licht
Em ain't no reason for us to be fighting like ooh
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
We had better learn to play dead
And all that glitters isn't gold when inside it's dead
It's not what it seems 
Because she thought I was Jewish
Step up 'cause you're the next one in line for the kill
I bust another cap in his ass and he died, time is 
But that's just it baby, I'm not affected by you baby
So I wander and I wander
Swallow all my pain
He don't believe my speech
Because you're not the one but you're the only one
But I ain't fightin' behind no goddamn oil
He loved bluegrass oh, brother when I said Shania he sneered
I'm upset 'cause I betrayed everything that you gave
I'm using bogon and I'll take on all comers
We wait, but nothin's comin'
You'll never find a place that you can call your own now
Laugh so loud that the whole damn restaurant
Totally fucked, five minutes later
At  the brother "Smooth" he got a record deal
The flame still burns
Fuck all your opinions, I'm tyin' 'em with a shoestring
And I'll jump off with a rope that's wrapped around your head
Takes a nation of sellouts to keep us back
Understand it be flavor
Doin' the cockroach, yeah, yeah
Gotta get drunk before my mom wakes up
This is a hell on earth, we are meant to serve
I never thought that you would go
We have to shout above the din of our Rice Krispies
So I made you lie 
But I don't suppose you'd understand
Fightin' in the age old battle we've sometimes won before
The Special Ed kid at lunchtime the bitches wouldn't stand around with
Why should the whole world step aside
Oh burning fire
I haven't met another you since you were with me
Live to the full, always act flash,
I know you lied
I woke up with my head on the floor
Throw away the darkness, I wanna see you shining
Been rooted in a slopin', quickly given golden sand
Even if you sell a million, you'll get burned
And I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face, oh 
You know, the man just upped my rent last night
Did we stop you
You make me sick
The sun has come to wash your pain away
But you're always on the way
Ma quante notti al caldo stretti, stretti
In the end, makes you better, Yeah
You pretend it's the end
Might last a day, yeah
Paperface
I turn my head and look away
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
Back on the street now, now, now, now
I'm thinking your the one to know
As if the heart beat wasn't enough
What is it you adore, won't you tell me
Eclipse Bleed you Cut you away
The last laugh's not on on me
Into their teeth
Fuckin' with Ren, playin' to win
Rival gangsters sit down to plan an afterschool program
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Look at you now
I need you more than ever now that I've come so far
It's your world, do with it what you want
Searing pain, expose your flesh
Drunk off blood from dead cops and
You don't know shit, you're a fucking therapist
Don't hold your breath for the turnaround 
Hail Mary full of grace smack the bitch in the face;
'Cause power's just another one of those things, baby
vendicare
When DA in back of us, I'm stretched out nervous
That beacon falls from your eyes
And I don't wanna deal with your mistakes
And if you're lucky then someday I may
Now the damned have no time to make amends
About ancestral innocense
You decide if you still want to play this game
A drop of blood to let them in
Not running down an empty hole
On my hotel t v, fucking on my t v, fucking on my t v, on my hotel t v, private hotel t v
Hard to come by, and harder to hold
U want the dog I'll let him out
You've got a lot of nerve to come back here
Afraid that I'll never squeeze enough
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Now don't you sell me no future, yeah
 I'm innocent,
Secret power fueled by hate hate
I'll live until I'm fucking killed
Still I'm sittin' skits and laughin' while they all missin' this
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck *Clucking*
It's just the little things
I thought we were decent
Und er fragte  was ist gefährlicher, rassistische Polizisten oder Saharasand
Fakers must fade, the stakes are now raised
Where I stand
The innocent will pay
So please let me
It's poisonous it muscles it aches
And try to believe
Heard people say
Welcome to a state where the politics of hate
Do you feel the way I do
I am not an angry girl
And watch the devil start kickin
I would infinitely regret it and probably get a headache if I was stupid and got with you
To wash this headache away
Time to sing 
So I wanted to impress
To a city fair rode I
Lets go kill 'em
Am I evil enough
And You are a liar You are a liar
Well, I am hell a miracle overloading
The live it, you fuckin' gimmick
The lie, want to know, has it met
Blasted through your head, blasted through your head
The king of pop
And guns
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
Daddy left when I was three
To deny and confuse the ideal
What everybody else already knew
Out my  slug and it ain't missin'
This heart is a joke, & my life has been choked,
Lemme put you on game gunshot
I let the fire rain down
With such an appetite for taste and grace
We're not the ones who made the nuclear bombs
Come and make me a part of your story She has a name an old word she has a name fantastic and utterly unknown, for it is old the first word strangled from the void was never spoke again Whether right is right or wrong, she'll turn you to the empty parts, she'll fill your belly with regrets, old manacles are faithful yet She wounds, she wounds, she has a name She is the beating drum that marks her by the bodies she collects She is always, she is ever, she is the scourge of kings and devourer of light, she is the lust to dine on flesh, oh she'll watch as you perform, for her you'll die to speak to her once more Give me a love that makes me real, hold down my breath for meanother lonely world to fall ingive me a love that makes me real, I would write it on my arms your misery's a gift, your plaguea comedy
Frustrated self hatred my hands turn to fists
It's like a fight to the top
The whole world seems a little bit brighter, brighter
Don't even recognise my own face sometimes
So bad to hate somebody else
When another girl violates that That's right
I don't wanna wait for you
One more time, I'm gonna need you, I can tell
I saw the sourceless anger eating at him from inside
A sip for every secondhand tick
My niggas real in this Bitch
Grabbed her by the hand and said
Wild like hell
All I ever wanted was an afternoon
You can't feel the flow because you died, facedown on a suicide
The right to my silence in quiet discerning
We bring war to pacifists
So why do I feel so desperate now
Betcha didn't know, woohoo
I'll hold
I speak in monotone
Bis die Meinung der Masse auf mich einbricht
She was on fire last night
Yesterday I changed your diaper wiped you and powdered you
Don't stop talkin' to me please
I surrender, giving up all that is me
So they're kicking out everyone
We end up dead in the end
I envy you your ignorance
And I got all the time in the world
Made a million plus and still don't give a motherfuck
How blessing will set me free, yeah
And puts your name to shame
I've buried half my life in the same place you've soared
Betrayed by the ones that you hold close
I can't feel you there
Hey hey, now motherfather
People like you just burn
Otherwise I might fall
Jam your brain with broken heroes
That gets you home before the living end 
Don't believe in you anymore
The Devil punched down to the monkeys
Hoped you were thinking of redemption
Go to sleep And I'll sing you a lullaby
False hope, an inch of pride that died when I left to hide from non stop
Making The Bombs
Tourniquets of velvet ropes, my fourfinger crucifix
The things you had, the life you lived
Work me like a slave while they laid back
You put me in the clutches of sin 
No sleeping pills no old tattoos
You picked him up but he's a total stranger
She was college edjamacated but got fired up at the law office
Till it's cold and dry and no longer bleeds
Well put the pistol to your head and empty the clip, pop nigga
Give me back
Only the dead have seen the end of this war
You always remember your first
Oh, yeah
They won't break me
See my blood  and see my gun
I think my mind just goes outta control
You've been helping yourself this whole time
And there's so little of you left 
And greed, all it's hate, all it's pain, so
I run in circles but I won't crack
'Cause the ocean, she never sleeps
And make love to your one desire
And this is how Mary's garden grows, this is how Mary has her ghosts
I hate you
The day's reality around the bend 
Sapphires You make bracelets
Silence, no communication
Break this take control
I get so choked up anyway
I remember you
J'ai entendu dire en bas
The messenger of love
Yeah now you're right here
Less the talking bout mines is mine and become one mind
He tried to tell me it was the only job available
I can't get enough of you
Every single night I play your music right at bedtime
They are surplus to societies needs,
If I won't face your grave
Where's the drugs 
Or a box for a smoke
I've come to bring you hell
You did nothing I see
I'm living life my way
They clench the fist of ordained might
If seein' is believin', then there's more to live fo'
You were thinking about me 
She figures that's better than nothing to show for the years of tears and sweat
I'm just afraid of losing and I am afraid of DYING
To make you all believe
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem you stayin wit me
Come and join the mass debate
Stop
The sores are my own, I know
And things just keep getting weirder and weirder
'Cause city slums have never been where our drums are from
Which opened up his heart,
Here's your trophy on my face, it's just an eye anyway
Somebody, somebody just tell me that much
Don't you mess with me
I wanna see it come down
With too much patience and too much pain
I'm leaning over backwards
'Cause you're all whores and I'm a fag
Fills up the air with his pride and praise
Duckets out the window ends on the street
I see dying people
I left my arm in my coat
In the madness that calls 'Now'
All that time, it cannot be,; Easy said, it cannot be
And I do know what's good for me
You've got to know you'll burn in hell for all the lies you've told
The dirty old man from the trailer park
In the field Cotton you yield Your skin peels off your back
And then, you meet me, and your whole world changes
Before somebody else 
See myself disintegrate
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson
To defend the flag hanging limp and bloody above the village church
To grant us they are loathe free meat and drink and cloth
Both sides are losing now
For all the ones who've left
He drinks my beer and plays guitar
He'd be just another bush surrounded by a couple orchids
So your dirty guilty braids
Cats hatin', 'cause they know I finga girls twats
I don't think that I can stop
Without concrete belief, you step up to the edge and follow
It's alright if it makes you feel better
From what I've seen, I hate humanity
And what if there are no damsels in distress
You are mine, you are mine, you are mine
Now it's a couple trouble makers making mayhem on the double
But the sky is just a little sister
You watch them
I am living torture
You want to share what you've been through
That I'm not going down, I'm not going down I'm not going down
Why did I come here tonight
Dummy tree chopped off all my living roots
All my doubt 
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
I'm thinkin' of no one in my mind
Everyone makes one mistake
Not knowing when
Truth, tell me the truth, the truth motherfucker
Hat your guts and tell you they love you
Spit out and sucked back in, the reason's getting thin
Cut up bleeding beaten cheated
Find your faith in your security
Life's miseries pain is deep
Ich möchte so besoffen sein, dass ich alles nicht mehr seh
In these days see the people run
I hope he's with your mother,
Treat the record label like a slut, then rape that bitch
We stay stuck in the maternal gaze suckling the demons breast
There was no trusting you with my foolish heart
I think I'll take this hate and
Oh, baby you're killin me
'Cause I'm tired of you stressin me Tired of you stressin me
Six feet in the ground is where the living begins
Oh I wanna get connected
I pay for what's called eccentricity
The world lies in the hands of evil
I don't give a fuck about your dignity
Through our life lines 
Caught 'em in the 'gaitor shoes his girl probably bought 'em
His bitter seed
Er war vom Whisky bald verroht 
I've watched you smile as the students bow to kiss your feet
Who's the one you call Mr Macho, the head honcho
Yeah I thought this was it,
On the back of photographs
I am cold and distant
Can't wait till I fuckin' buy me a jet, there gon' be some hoes on it
A city, city's
They always want to take a bite
I'm using too many covers
Think it's time you shut up
Suffer not But extend your hand
Couple of portraits then ignored 'em
Neonazism never can be the sollution of the matter
Smoking something, stomping on each of you Tims
I hope we live to shout the tale shout
Right down towards the residence
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
I see you each day get up ninetofive
Not enough to feed the hungry 
Why'd ya do it, she said, when you know it makes me sore
You know you try to categorise me
Her body odor always smelling like some bacon and farts
We work like perfect puzzle pieces
Your head upon my breast
The long walk home, an hour and a half
And what do your hissy fits teach you except how to cry, pussy, cry 
Think that you got the world figured out, right Wait till you're older kid
Like the songs your roommate sings
I can't believe this violence in mind
I'm just faking it and you're holding
Go ahead and psychoanalyse that
I have become a superbitch
Your lips taste of poison
All is never what it seems, take heart
In your beautiful red earth
I thought that you would keep your word
PC she speaks impotent, sterile, naïve, blind, atheist, sadist, stiffupper lip, first principle of her silence, of her silence 
We're sinking
This same old graveyard
If I may paraphrase the government notice reads
She was a thirst monster now she's gothic insane
Tellin' them you died in the line of duty
Shot a nigga the fuck up
I sit and stare in a cork tiled room and it doesn't get much easier
Who are you, so full of lies
Against the fear, it feeds the fire
And all her bones were haunted
We invented the zero But we mean nothing to you
It's the way your lips shake
File out face first
Your fate and that of everyone you know depends on it
How do you like me now
I'm just stupid and I'm angry is it immature for me to say
And three, three, three for my heartache
There's a record, so you put it on
I need some company
It won't work
Or should I go to sleep
Do you know what they say
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
But you will never get the feel 
If I died right now, you'd turn the fire on
Believe me when I say
Well fuck you
Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
Entranced in noise 
But I think that you made it up, I think that your mind is gone
I'm on my hands and knees
My brain cells swell  the intellects extreme
Take fame intravenously
What have I got Four walls
So lock the door
Until I became an alien,
Desire, desire, desire
Followed by fault lines that cannot sit still
Y'all niggaz better pucker up, time for some real asskissin'
But I know that to possess her
A lot of people think that, what I say on record, or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life, or that I believe in it
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Now they try to tell me different
You It's always been this way
Lenny helped out, and that was real
The stars are singing in the sky
Make devils drop and they just can't spite this
Where the fear of illusion is real
Yeah I'll have my coffee black
The way we push through equivalent to rocket thrust
Now, I look at your small life and it doesn't mean a bit
I really hate you
And bore use to death with your auditory sedatives
I don't care anymore I don't care no more
This sense of cynicism will eat me alive,
To the dead, dark and past
No more war traitorism, it's only me and her
Anarchy and freedom is what I want
Of the sound of the peeling ground
A psychophant, the despoiler of faith
My personal attacks snap back to murder cats
A little bit closer
But there was a time I asked my father for a dollar
Want me, fuck you, hate me
The sponsors of 'The Johnny Carcinogenic Show'
So turn around and come on down
Why don't you throw your poison idea away
And is it in you now
I thought you were a good man
A burnt and withered land
The fires imminent
Simply reality, my dearest friend
My skin is begging you please
The dead part of you leaves me with a blessing 
You just left me lonely somewhere
I am the idiot who will not be himself
Pay no mind what other voices say
To kill you if they could and rights from you to hold
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Just turn your head to hear my plea
When it comes to sex you get mo better
I bleed forever and not a thing you do can comfort me x
Pick up a gun and learn how to fight
That my desire's gone with the way that I've been living lately
Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area
Everybody get down
Keep me company as I hunt down and kill my enemies cause there must be someone to blame
Think I'll blow my head off
Just something you should understand
And I love the way you hate me
You can try to blame it on the devil
Das war ein so seltsamer Unfall, dass ihn noch niemand kannte
Don't speak, don't say nothing
When you start to speak and my warm blood starts to boil
Addressing most littlest
And all the children sing
The mess was in my head 
Animals having sex with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits
That marks the beginning of their end
He said you kinda did but I don't mind at all
Everybody talks too much and argues
Islamic Bombers, no contender is parallel
High life, low life
You know, you need to maybe get away and like maybe you should talk about it,
Break, break, break, break, break
Nothing ever made quite clear, beware
Has made you drunk
My hands grope for my head
Just look at the face
It can only be that way  yeah
Can't you see that I need you
All you wannabes
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
It's begun everyone better fuckin' pray
You've taken everything that you wanted
Don't know where I'm going
While we go away for the neighborhood crime
I waste time in my mind, thinking of you
I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
There ain't no reason why you let me wait
Until they run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
Tat nach ihnen flehen, greifen, fassen 
The kids on the wagon
Mindin' other people's business seems to be hightoned
Don't you feel the same way like I do
Where your bitch at She'll get fucked up too
Nobody's home
Ruthless records greedy, suave house, greedy
Everyday I wake up
You stand by the waterfront never sure of your choice
I fuck ya ass up fuck him up
Oh and all I want is company
And you sat on the corner of my bed
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
As far as you wanna go, down in Dragontown
We know what we need
What's your pleasure, what is your pain
You'll beholden to no one
Darker side Of all the people that I needed,
Bringing the legendary
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when
Ooh, a dirty little sister
Far beyond your bed wetter kindergarten compositions
No no no no I can't take this
All I'm really sure is that you're not too impressive
Brothers and sisters there is a place for you in America
Genocide and the minds of men make
Their meagre ambitions, their impotent fury
For like three and a half years
I'm sick instead, write it into
And the bottles that you've been pissing in 
Hey hey, now bloody mind
And watch him burn
Muthafucka you heard player murderers
Just then I thought
I wish I had a bullet big enough to fucking kill the sun
das war kein Selbtmord, das war Mord
Follow for now, swallow this spit
I don't know when I noticed life was life at my expense
Now I'm restless here, can't seem to part with fear
If everything is all I've got and everything is all you want
I'm always here
Making me understand 
I don't want to play this game
We're leaning on death against compensation
Speak your mind and speak it clearly
Oh God, you gotta be joking, I get it she's smoking
Makes for better telly, makes us look mugs
Before I forget who I am now
How's it feel to be a woman
Gonna let nobody love you
Want to wait
If I cannot bear to face your grave
The little chips that know where home is
Until eventually, no one surrounds him
I stand all alone here at the altar
With the weight of love and the grace of the Baleen Whale
Showed us what his shit hit her, hell of a lick BUT
Charlie sang for a pocket full of pills
You play along to the same old song just as long as you can win
He who got the finger on the war button
That you would leave me now
You�can't�break�my�soul
My friend from overseas said this countries got the dumbest
And I would stand for you
He is ready for his sneak attack, he's gonna go do this shit and not look back
I've been making money off of my indifference
And look down in disgust at our misery
You plant a demon seed
I wanted to be that, to be that special girl
You're mistaken
In my hood, bitch ain't nothing funny
No no no no I don't care at all
Streets that burn, a bullet flies
Throw yourself on the body
Love the girl that weed and shit what
I don't wanna have a talk
All the way crazy, shady
I want a perfect soul
My world is getting smaller everyday
I'm the predator of the lies
That you can't trust anybody if you can't trust number one
Je reserve mes dernier mots a ses petites bitches qui pourraient douter encore
Concoctions of pain hits from eight angles
We took a room back full of kids and threw a heart at it
This is our biggest fear 
You try to cry but it's just for show you know I know you know
Whitewashed all my boyfriend's features
And I know
A war that your friends were involved in
Or love is blood,
Greed, your master passion
Into the abyss will I run
Dumb flag scum
I am down on the ground
Turn on turn on the news
All I need, set me free
You need a designated driver for your hostility
The body's just a vehicle to hold
Yeah I was feeling strong mouthed and weak willed
A mother fucker on the war path
Well all I know is that I been down here tryin'
Say you like to play this game
Still I curl up right under the bed
Who am I with today
World ending, it's just beginning 
Ruler ZigZagZig, we don't fuck with no pig
Why did the chicken cross the road
This is all we've ever known of God
I'm innocent
You think that you're God's gift to life that we should fall
But keep in mind my darling
The choir on the black box rejoiced splendidly,
Directed your furtive hand
Follow it, they said, to paradise
Nail it to the House of Lords, you will be buried in the same box as a killer
Everybody's waitin' to see
Tyler calm the fuck down
The new born babies drowned at birth
There's no good way to end this
Takin' out a police will make my day
There's shit on the telly there's shit on TV
But no one can remember
We are antimovements, we are antianti
I'm staring down the road my life has gone
I know I didn't say somethin' wrong
Hiding my hands that tremble like earthquakes
Give me a faith, something I can believe in
You might not think its phat to apply the cross
Go to sleep Sleep my child
And everyone knew just what it's like to be somebody else 
I know soon still that platinum is coming
Oh, do you remember my name
My life's out of reach of my arms, but I'm holding on
Be me  put my eyes in your face
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it
And I've been sweatin' and cursin' and frettin'
I'll fuck ya ass up
Ah but I know you wanted me to be there oh oh
What's she thinking Does she really believe
I don't care for making ends meet, getting on or reading books
Big talking, small fry
The counting down of the days
From the start I see the end
Everybody else will have to wait in line
I want to live
Dirt on his hands
I scream within WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
To drive me slow
Baby, I think you'll understand
On these New York city sidewalks we walk
You goddamned kids had best be gracious with the merch money you spend
Than stay and watch you make a fool of me
You're gonna be left alone
The sound you make is Muzak to my ears
You a good guy that's living a lie
Enferme nos reufs au cachot 
What you, what you want from me
Bad milk burns on your tongue
Some tried to run even though it seemed useless
No I am not a bitch
I'm standing in a room,
Those smarmy bastards would steal from their mother
And you smile as you ease the gun from my hand,
With his feet inside your shoes
I'd have seen Dre rockin' parties for hours
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I am the ism, my hate's a prism
We've got plenty to talk about because some of them you just
And the grass was green
And I get choked up
The way you always speak your mind
No no no no more son of a bitch
Runaway, runaway girl
Justice and the law
Friends looked at me and said,
But we'll see who stop the black guerrilla
Of our own black hearts
Where I gather all these thoughts for all your broken info
Sing, sing, sing again
And send his ass home belly up
The universe is mine, a few disturbing times
I walk without you, but I need to believe
Sit back pop bottle y'all sit on y'all feet
I wanna have control
So fuck it all 'cause I don't care
And the dirtiest thing I've ever seen
Do me this one favor and pretend we never knowed
Hell's doing great but I am serving no more
But he doesn't spend
The fear and the mouthpieces
Truly, fuck the world,
A thousand motherfuckers died for nothing
Slipped, and I fell, got back up  slipped again
Hand over my heart, gun to my head
Went to the bar, yeah yeah
I won't need 'em anymore
What do you want from my life
You left me free fallin' like space junk
Say more jobs for the people
And if you're planning a future of indefinite grace
You bleed and it doesn't mean shit
But it seems that the gate holds the only clue
Oh my god posthardcore kids everywhere
You'll get up and sleep
Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
So I gotta watch what I decide to say
She says she's tired of life
They say no man's an island
When you left the door was
Yeah, they may not go down in history
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
Follow me I run, I run, follow me, follow me
You had a better look than I, you caught it from the top of my world
This my motherfuckin' nigga Em on dem motherfuckin' boards in case your wonderin'
Everyone that I meet, I wanna punch in the ear
Beat smooth enough to slide through like bobsleds
Starfuckers
They'll fuck you if your rich
Just don't know how I'm supposed read into your convoluted mind
I'd be spitting lead at you, to dead your crew
They say "It's not our policy to kill civilians,
How many tips can I take home tonight without them getting mad
And calling down fire on what he don't understand 
It'll help if I practice and act immature
You're eating off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face 
The war is on, too weak to move 
Shed some of this blacklight to surrounding towns
That's the man, I say his always ahead
Did ya think about me being half awake and crying, 
I'm so sick of trying to fit in, I don't even know where to begin
Tied down just to control you
Don't tell me how you feel
You tell me, you talk to Ren
Around these silent streets the seditatives tell you everything is alright
Wait Hey wait for me
You fucked up  you sloppy little shit  bitch  ah
And a rocket to depart in
One's born everyday and everyday she was your sucka
Scared of the lyrics, and when they bitches hear us
What a resignedly of motherfuckin you thinking what they Uh
Fuck you, and fuck your man, both y'all niggaz is puss
Nuclear showers there's nothin' spookier
Life's for the living
You say you're taking me over 
You've got to feel
Hey now everybody
I hate so much
Purify the dirty things
Belaruse no longer feels the sun
Oh, I'm sorry
Is all the world jails and churches
Before I do it, tell me, tell me what's in it for me
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
You stupid dumbshit goddamn motherfucker
Never returning again
'Cause it's her car but she lets the bumps steer
Johnny always lock a nigga down
I thought we were so damn cool
It's time you made a stand
I talk to myself when we are alone
All we wanted was a home
Rip away my fears
And it's now arrived and my mouth is fulla saliva
I'm just afraid it will hurt like, hurt like hell
Shrugged off the shit in my youth
Don't need no nausea
Well, I look over yonder to that burying ground
Nothing can compare to the way she would say to me "Darlin' You know I'm gonna beg,"
Rancid is the sound of my voice,
I wear skin like Jesus
I knew I couldn't handle the words
My pulse reverberates through this malleable shell,
I am the blood of this city,
And for making me smile when things at home weren't great
Climbed over the side, closed his eyes
I'm sorry for my blues
I want them to do this to you 
I'll be back in twenty years,"
I'm gonna let nobody, gonna let nobody love you
I can hang out with my friends, do the good times ever end
Boy you ain't the one that I wanna take
So I shook hands with you freely
Than to tell the truth
I said, people tell me what to say
And leads you to making a sacrifice
But you always know what to say
You love this ass, so don't fight it
Anyone anyone will do tonight
There is anger resolute
With coppercore wound veins, a pumping cold hydraulic heart,
Teen dream, scream queen
No, no
Off with her head
'Cause you lied, you lied
Because I'm telling you
I've been trying to think about life, trying to come up with some sort of flawless system that explains it all, you know, just something that makes it all make sense, preferably one that comes in a nice easily digestible sound bite, quick and easy and without too much effort, because life can be quick and easy and without effort, and I realize the only one thing that brings me any sort of joy is anger and hate Rage is the only thing that brings me what one might call contentment, rage is the only thing that even begins to satisfy my need for fulfillment and then I realize that I have been wasting my rage on bullshit, on things that didn't deserve it This one gift of mine was being squandered on things that weren't worthy of it, and this angered me, I'm not going to slut off my rage to everything and anything any longer, but rather now wish to save it for something really special, save it for something noble that really deserves it I wanted to hate what I respected and I don't respect anything I long to hate something worthy of the emotion I can't hate incompetence, I can't hate the pathetic The pathetic demeans my hate I want my hate to represent my purpose, to become my purpose I want it to be worthwhile and looking at you, thinking about you, knowing what you are I realized that to hate you would be a crime, it would be like hating a stain, like hating a pimple, a zit I can dislike things all I want, they are a nuisance, a bother, but hating them would drag me down, drag me down How could I build up energy for this How could I really care I'm tired of having my hate watered down by irrelevant bullshit There is nothing worse than wasting the beautiful energy of unrestrained anger, of uninhibited fury, on something like this, some impotent meaningless blur And then a calm overcomes me Nothing can bother me now because nothing is worth the trouble Underneath this emotionless surface boils the true essence of unrestrained anger, I now walk through life like a ghost, like a zombie, for I have reached a transcendental state of bliss, and by bliss I mean rage, because I know that what I now hate is the core of everything, I don't hate your trivialities, you bullshit, your irritants, I hate the essence, I hate truth, I hate the very fundamentals of it all
You look sick, homie eat a gun I tell you haha
They twisted the knife further in
You live like a wannabe
I'm not that kind of kind of girl
To feel the things that we must live through
You ain't shit, just a puddle on the bedspread
Everybody's got a little someone to trust, but me
"You came from heaven and came here to me
And I'm aching from fucking too much
Can we pretend
These veins are bled
Shake your hands Like they're full of feathers
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go, all over again
I thought the world should know Ho
I just want to get inside you
And you can't pass if you're missin', G
But as long as I'm alive I'm putting this on my life
I'm a fist, I'm afraid, I'm a link in the chain
Turn my fucking thoughts against me 
I don't know why all I need is someone to save me, I believe and I don't know why
I also wanna make an announcment, that I am protit all the way President Leary is protit all the way I love tits I would like to be the mayor of Tit Town if I could I'd like to drive a big truck full of tits down the Tit Turnpike right through the middle of Tit Town I'd like to have my own talk show about tits, "Tit Talk" That's how passionate I am about the tits, I love 'em all I actually love the small tits better than the big tits because the big tits get all the attention The peach and plum little handshaped tits, they're great I love to look at 'em "How ya doin'" talk to 'em, "What's goin' on Look at me I've got my face next to a tit" Men are mollified by tits We don't know why, we just are We don't have to see naked tits to get mollified, we just freeze up even at the sight of cleavage Waitress leans over the table the wrong way That's how we can end war Get the Good Year blimp, paint it up like a tit, put a nipple on it Fly it over the Middle East during a confrontation, "Look at the tit Look at the tiiiiit The tiiiiiiit The tiiiiiiit"
Better leave the lion alone do not pet him
Oh, yeahyeah
With Halloween teeth that I can break
These bitches all on the dick
Lock in cages penned, hemmed in shoulder to shoulder  arms outstretched
I'm back in this bitch, we was gone for a while
No heart is infected
Like a ghost that I can't shake
To the west, to the left
Bucking stone 'cause I'm known to play for keeps
And we both like to stretch the truth
The fearful losses confidence
Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus 
And you feel as if you died Whilst you're standing on the line
And they march hand in hand
The need to escape all visible space
Why do I get shit all the time from you men
You're in the grip of the controller
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
Your heart doesn't belong to me
But milkshakes melt, people change, and you dumped me on my birthday
Under the silver knife
Now she cannot move, no question
I'm a fist of rage
I am on the mend
You suck my blood like a leech
We need vices Oh
I was trying so hard to please myself,
They pushin' rocks here, in the dead of night
Don't want no damned Jihad
Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
If you want to take a shot at me, well get in line
Shit basically they juss playin' sick
And now we proudly present
Until the day I crossed that line
Don't fucking weep
Like cheap tarts in a red light street
Better call the ambulance, I'm coming to choke y'all
I've seen this monotonous world make dull, what used to shine
Stop, listen, get the guap'
So please don't keep on asking
Brother give me another tote
Don't tell me how it feels
I don't fear the confrontation
You could say what she wants to hear
You'll never end this in me
If I could only see you now 
Do you sleep do you keep me anymore
The motherfuckers made a motherfucking tape, Odd Future Tape Volume 
Won't you ever let this die
What's that dot on you head
My trust you're earning
For all the scars that never heal
 dispatch ma'am calm down, deputies are on the way
And I know you're his girl but you should ride wit me
That burn fiercer in throes of upheaval
The lonliest soul in the universe
I think the wrong people got a hold of your brain
I want to break through but I'm though if I do
I rolled ya up and smoked you like cones
They steal your soul and keep it hid
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
To rescue they advise, such fury they devise, the devil in them lies
I want out
Barely our friends, who think about what's up with Jen & Ben
I'm not the type
Of your spirit
And I warn you now
Why It makes you feel better
Your self control has gone away
I know you want to be free
Now I'm ignored
Pull back  there are some things to realize
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
I lost you once, I won't lose you tonight,
My will to hate is strong
In these days I don't know what to sing
Rikki Sun, Alex and all hoes and walks in arrogant gems,
Take heed and run
They act so discreet, they are hypocrites forget them
Blackman
"You lose your life, you lose your job if you don't do this shift"
Big brother's got no heart
I hate this song, does this look like a big joke No
I'm falling apart
You just don't know it
Terrible lie
How can you buy or sell the sky
And act on what we believe
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine
Somebody get a shovel and find out where she went
Turn 'em on to niggas who deep into that thug shit
Get down  back into hell
Consider this a spell and watch where you tread
So tip the bottle back
So do I, sweetheart
And never have the left to cover the bleeding
Well, it's all somebody's fault 
I will spit right in the face of all you whores 
You need a little more suppression of you appetites
I hope you fuckin' die
Gotta make it shine like glass
Say goodbye now
But I shut them off because all they do is make me miss you so much more
And when it all goes to hell
I got the blood of Christ on a cup of ice
Let the black blooded vein come to your brain
I'll sit right here I'll never tell
Feel like screaming So go the fuck away
You had a problem with your newfound wealth
It's only anger that your waking
With a little bit of dough and a pager
Roses must someday crumble to dust and fade away
When the world can live without
The sky is too
Am I gonna have to put the law on you baby
'Cause the collapse you'd cause would pull us down with claws that don't let go
Now who got 'em face on money
And I won't pretend
And she says it feels good
Ass and you ain't giving no help
I don't even feel the pain
It'll kill us all
You're the reason I can't control myself 
I learned how to sustain myself
Can I just be another risk you're running Can I
Of the war in the courts
That the cream cannot help but always rise up to the top,
A fortune teller he said
"If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to"
The powers that be let take hold a movement which they abhor
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
The shell you've built around your world lets nothing out 
Everybody
They throw shit in your face
Although you may not ever believe that it's so
You think your shit is potent, but ain't nobody buying it
Go fuck yourself, well I'm real sorry that you sacrificed your time
To stand up for myself
I break a smart ass grin
Shifty and EPIC, now when you be
You can't bring me back 'cause I give it all back to you
Sent the whole world into a spin
You don't even know me so don't hate me
The glitter sores will heal themselves I'll play the part of someone else
A blistered revenge awaits in me
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed
Dragged me from my bed
Passionnés passionnément 
My albums in store next to Kanye Wests
I failed you
And my eyes glaze
Wir haben uns einfach treiben lassen wir wollten nichts verpassen
Damn, that money that we gave was just a bandaid
Shake your skin Like it's sewn with insects
I gotta story to tell, So kiddies listen up well
Those Italians need a lesson to be taught
A crown upon a dead man
So blow out the candle and tell us another of those great stories,
The blood is on your hands
Have left me with an empty heart 
Fuck the rest and stab it dead
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
If it's not the defense then you're on the attack
My wingtip shoes, boys
An alternate plan
Holy smokes, city blown to the bone the death server
I don't wanna be dead 
Trumpets sound
I'm building tension but not any bridges
Don't wanna live my life in misery
Sky high and six thousand miles away
From now on, I'll try to look myself in the face
Please don't tell me you're not perfect
Internal conflict riddles my brain
So run, make amends, feeling torn
Better run, better run, better run
Way you snapping' a flick
Was not an act of war
They call me osioso obnoxious, I'd rather get fired than quit
Well now you're gonna see
A lot of folks believe it though, but I'm not surprised
Can I run up in the settlement
Make you understand
For real you make me know and
One thing's clear beyond a doubt
Holla if you hit the bottom runnin'
 dispatch , forty reporting
Step up 'Cause you're the next one in line for the kill
Never say, you weren't warned
Ladies, make it hot, girls, make it hot
Raised their arms to a leader outside
I been wounded by ambition
And now you've gotta live with it
Girl, I remember when we was sittin' on your couch
These voices in my mind,
Like it's his world it's the inevitable, it's going down
Yes it's fucking satirical
There is no future when the past soon come
Prayin' to me now, I ain't God but I pretend
You are the reason I can't control myself 
Only if I had one more time to kick
That's been stomped away from every single dream
I was livin' my life in dead man's shoes
I think I would have said to go to hell and
There's no light in your eyes and your brain is too slow
Read my rights and shit, it's all junk
Battle back your liberty
I hear no, see no, speak no no no no 
I'm not a nurseing protein
A principality morals, maybe your standards might even make you
You're walking down the street
So far so good no one saw you
Lass es sein lass es sein  das schränkt mich ein
And people ain't waiting night and day, night and day, night and day
Yeah, I'm holding out I'm holding out
So don't call me a faggot, not unless you are a friend
I hope it's not the last time
You got a lot to learn my friend
And I remember you and me used to spend
Would you feel the way I do
This world is a chaos, this life is a chaos CHAOS
But then I made enough money for me to fund a tour
Had enough of feelin' sick
I need a drink, I need a pill,
When I'm locked in my room
Come alive and murder your senses
I'm looking old I'm feeling young
I'm looking old, I'm feeling young
But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad
You want to see me disappear
Not every saint is a fool
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
So you end up throwing in the towel
Why do I find myself here again you disappeared
Terminators back cause a dat is whack
I hope you don't feel anything when you see me
An object of destruction made for Madame Ray
Flippin disco raps used to be whack
Well in a back room in Harehills, what did you mean
All alone, bawling till my mothafuckin' eyes bleed
I've got to talk to you
Sad to say it's over now
All I want is a little respect Whoa, you better
Keep your self respect intact
I'm not no crocodile
Lemme put you on game
At any given time she wants to do you, screw you
Can't hide me in dark nicht places 'cause in the spaces
Now's the time for thinking
No thought for me remains there
Talking to ears that have been deaf for as long as I can remember
With spades and hoes and ploughs, stand up now
Because glass to glass, street to street
What you trying to hate for
But you want to be my friend
Ha ha ha You died out long ago
They fist and they fuck through the night
For dancing and for singing
You did nothing new, 
I'll play the part
All the wounds that will not seal
Oh, wait, would you mind getting some, um
Live on borrowed time, feel the fear in me
Every rumor's gone, I no longer doubt this shit, You�re the one
Disrespect my love, I'ma be LAYIN YOU DOWN
All rollin' in a benz
But heavy rocks are falling
No I don't give a fuck
We'll cry about this
Make major league niggaz show signs of fatigue
Great Milenko, wave your wand
And his rage and her shame flow through him
I know she makes me frown
If I can't square my fears
Like working for white people after watching Rosewood
I'm a man's girl drippin' with the sweat just to torment you
To make your lips evaporate
I ain't buyin' no future when the past is so far away
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
This could be my chance to say goodbye 
It will never close, this fucking sore will never heal
Slow, behold
I see the boys that I once called my friends
Will hear a note that we playing
When there's nothing left
They say, "You the devil"
Maybe you're not looking for acceptance
I've been here waiting patiently
In any case there's no use in dopin' chokin' mopin' and sobbin'
I can't sleep they takin' polaroids
I piss and take a shit on your beat for fun
Don't break my stride
As far as I can tell
And I ain't even like that silly nigga
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
You motherfucker, I want your blood
And if I catch it coming back my way
Shadowless and cold
With love, hate, truth, you
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
It's really not my problem anyhow
What you've been waiting for
I'll be the biggest scar in your sky
You shouldn't be so beautiful in my eyes
Send more money
Turn it from sweet to sour in this bitch
He got the coke in hand, I got the juice and gin
I can't live life wondering
I'm hanging on a ledge
Whether or not you ever show up
I know I don't belong here and I think I ought to go
I will never break
I'm not a Buddha boy
So in reality I didn't give a dime, or a damn
A played out love song playing in the background
I'll choke your friends in front of you, to prove that you be falling off
Know I'll always love you
It gets you nowhere; your life becomes a hit to a hit
Yo His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
Reel your heart in, run away with it
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
But what the fuck you preachin' in my face about it for
Turn me on, yeah
I don't really care, how much you cry
Devastator sleeps under satin sheets
But we fake, we fuss, and fracture the times
It's like I'm in this dirt digging up old hurt
"Ladies and Gentlemen tell me what you believe" played backwards
Ist traurig und schade oder abgrundtief böse
To try to dare, to dare for a little more, yeah yeah
Needed to feel you so much 
Can't you hear me talking to you
It's somethin' so ridiculous, funny, so fuckin' sick of this
'Cause you messed up good and I cannot ignore
Are you sleeping
Thorns So you want inside of me
That I was born yesterday
I never did anything to you, man
Pants or dress, "Hate fags", the answer's yes
You never know what's gonna happen
It's not fair
Oc life is not the life for free
But I believe in peace
All that I think about, yeah
You can keep them other hoes
Or resting in the Zions
Your self inflicted mass suicide die with the mob
Dripping sex from every pore
And never come back no more
He even talks like Buddy Ebsen
Are you willing to sacrifice your life
These motherfuckers just got wicked
When the fuck are you gonna realize
Back up and a lot of weight, but now
And to all the clubs that let us play
To the tree of life to come up short
I'm gonna kill it
I like black and I like red
Wouldn't be caught dead working for the man
I have my life, and it's only mine
I'm standing still, moved so peaceful
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Lick thy mother's bleeding lips
A practice made perfect, matter over mind 
In these days in the firmament
Así te vuelves distante 
When a nigga wack found me, shit, I was selling weight
I am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind
Pig, 'cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
In the end, makes you better
She's my only reason now, and my only hope to live
But somehow the lord never smiled down upon her,
And I get ready for tomorrow, I gotta waste my whole today
Louis Vuitton kicks and tricked on some sucka shit
You know I really try
I hope you're really felling happy now
E chiedi alla polvere, fra', piace pure a tua madre
I'm gonna die
I'm fucking burning
At my journey's end
I got seven ways of going, seven ways of serving You
I'm gonna kill it yeah
Madman, madman, oh
For me to burn
Disguised and disfigured and you thought I tasted like rain
Why have we waited so long 
Well, do you want it 
I'll tell you what let's forget about the fame
Anything in your life you own
College guys try to spike your drink, they wanna fuck a chick like Tyra Banks
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you
Fixate my sickness as long as there's air
We used to blaze with the bitch, faded off the lick she xrays the clip
I'm singing it proud everywhere
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts
I stitched odd and future together like a leather vest
Just because uh I don't know
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
And I'm looking for a bit of sympathy
And if this be thy will, then fucking pass me the cup
I asked for Providence to smile upon me with His sweet face
The five second heaven
Oh, well I woke up in hell today
And I pray to God she chokes
Get him against the wall for the witness
To make a stand
My mother did drugs, hard liquor cigarettes and speed
But they just don't work
One thing is for sure I don't need it
Joe the lion made of iron repeat ad inf
Confused and a mess I'm losing my mind I'm losing my mind
Do you think that it's cold
Sitting like a cork on top of my town
Niggas like you always fit  feet deep inside a ditch
U wearin' panties like a bitch
To convict the heart of sin
Drinking brew after school, kissing exfriends girlfriends
It's wild wild wild wild 
As of the kids shunning convention with clinical disregard
Big shot screaming, "Put your hands in the sky," 
They say gold paint on the palace gates comes from the teeth of pensioners
I was hoping you'd be waiting for me  
Fucking fat pig drive around in your car
Where you just won't know what to do
First eye contact yo that's the moment when you wanna die
Oh, everyday I'm hurting,
I empty my head of all that I know
To get everyone the fuck out of your way
It was fucking with his head, but he beat us instead
And the tears roll down my face
Keep waiting for a Santa that will never come
Everyday  I live it
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
She was a no one who killed her baby
Lets run away out of these vows of these men of structure
In place of the doc, because Dre couldn't make it today
From every heart you break
Everybody wants to be
I hope the next boy that you kiss has something terribly contagious on his lips
Ayo I'm starting to face that a part of me's fake
But we know all her suicides are fake
Where is your courage
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
Hit y'all niggaz for frontin you caught up in that hell what
I've said enough
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Hey God Can this world really be as sad as it seems
It all seems so strange now
And now you reach for my hand and you cut me again
Snoop Dogg Well it had to be
March march march the time's at hand
Shinin back to brighten up the sky, many die
Cause in my hood and you jump into hell and back
I'm not Jesus, I will not
I'll take them out and give your new boyfriend a nice surprise
I really wish you'd tell him he should go to hell
And the medics and all the passersby go back to where they came from
No charcoal breath who be hitting a stogy and not one that'll say shit to blow me
It's all we ask but instead we get our asses
You satisfy my soul
I'm sick and tired and I'm saying goodbye
I've got hands that like to break
Against motherfuckas I don't know
And my fingers run through grains of sand
Why he and she gotta die
No wall at the back
Were you always crying wolf
I found my place in nowhere
All the money in the fucking world couldn't buy me
But now it's time to find a reason to be here
One of these days I'm gonna blow you down
We work, move, and hustle with the rest of the gypsies
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
Elle s'accroche aux paradis artificiels 
Do you even know what you have
Turn to watch the sun set red
Galaxies full of nobodies giving us the farewell runarounds
We sat on my back porch and watched
You're never gonna see me closing in
The distances
How long I can take this shit
So let 'em all kill each other,
Well, people say I hold out like a holden caulfield
But what if the doctor was evil and very, very mean
Spit shine my soul
Like some crazy TV show
You're diving face forward into a antiquated past
If You really care for me, prove that I need to live carefully
"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute"
Reminding you of our true romance and
Than thou, hide your head in your hand 
Can't you feel me
We're not the ones who made the streets unsafe to walk at night
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces
Hablas que con el planeta van a acabar
Your attitude just stinks, you cowardly little shit
I'm not Mr *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
How do you want me
All I see is these niggas I've made millionnaires
God damn hoes, here we go again
Could fill it back up right now as the tears fall from my eyes
You say that I cannot leave you
Watching the expressions on the faces
She will not let you go
Like a bitch in heat
'Cause I'm fragile and you broke my heart in two
Like your first day of school
The pains of man
Who brings this down No, please don't make me,
You've got nothing to say
Is there nothing that remains
Now you're gonna make me flip this switch, I'm gonna make you my bitch
But it makes no sense to me
Is suddenly speaking to me
The dope fiend splashes gash like a nailbomb
Hush, just stop
I don't know why I feel the need to lie and cause you so much pain
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
You can't keep your soul
This time I'm not lying
Segregate the mind
Sayin' sorry is my problem
Left before he raises his fist to smash all the lies he thinks I've told him
The resistance is just waiting
Because you've got no time
Oh Zion please remove your glove
I shoulda known I was in for it
It's the awful truth you fight for your life
What I'm capable of, Without their bullshit life
The boy I love, he, up and left me,
The war on terror, war on drug, now everybody have vices
Always move forward
There's a whole new generation waiting to be wrecked by you
I do not feel the romance
My tears have faded, all hope of your conviction
With his crying statues and his flying bomb
Come on now, come on now
Another day, some other way
You say you a good girl that's no fact, can't roll smooth 'cause your axles cracked
Turn your back on me, and I'ma make sure you get it back times ten
All around me, my people's dying
And live my life in a righteous way
And throw rocks across a bottomless lake
Who doesn't have a wife or a girlfriend in a closet somewhere
Then We watch the other two die slow
Ain't that nothin'
I just made you up to hurt myself
Tarantulas, burn flesh like a nine glock
In the day by day collision
And I will never bother you no more
You got desire saying pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it
They said they'd let you live at home with mom and dad
You're not the one but you're the only one
In the end you're gonna wanna pay me
Twothirty AM talking to sleep inside that diner
You see I don't have a calms day rest
Say hey Mr driver man, don't be slow
It's not gossip if it's the truth
Under the floor where I stand
Had his finger on the trigger; just about to end everything
These kids is wildin'
The prince opens his mouth he vomits shits and pees
Met back up with the boy I love
'Cause I know that I won't be away long
'Cause you've been lied to and humiliated
It's truly mind blowing, I can't deny it
On your brain I induce pain, so I'm insane
Everything can change on a new year's day
Heartsick
Give me a hundred grand, give me your watch, give me your chain
When I defeat you weak kings
This is the fence that turns one into two
And now,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
Our struggling faith,
The way it is does not have to be
She says she's closer to my services and further from my world
So if I stick my hands in others blood am I sick
Our ghosts were made of good that got in the way
'Cause you know damn well if I was fine
Saturday night
Though I run into the twilight Incomprehensible
Mistake the pain I feel inside
Aight, man, whatever
When the party finally ends
I can't believe this happened
Get outta my face
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
You fucking sweater neck, feather peck, rosetta checks
Curious white boy when am I gonna meet yo mama
Left robbed, unwilling Can't fight the feeling
I made a word to give this state a name, this game a guess
I can't relate with your world
Why are my days so far from home
Jump when your mama tell you anything
Your democracy, is not for me
Well one day you will look back on your life with just complete disgust
Who's ready for war, I'm ready for war
And I never bought all that shit on love anyway
And all the little things that got him here
I should have seen my end coming from a long way off
It's a rat, it's a rat race
And my mind feels like I'm about to erupt
Those who betray all must fall
When you walk by a group of quote unquote normal people
You broke the rules but I should have known you do it all the time
It's like a red flag
This twisted mind
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you
They could kiss my ring
And all my love was left behind
And I plan to get on your little sister just as soon as I give her a call back, oh and you know what else
I'm leaking the blood of a fool I'm full of it, I'm full of it, I'm full
You can fuck a man, mack a man
It makes you want it more
Can't you fuckin' read
And you ignore it, you implore it
No one knows the things that he knows
Some bitch was like, "Hop, you got me crying
I have to for myself, yeah
Don't need no more boxes I can see
The only good thing that's creeping in this city
Chorus x Willie D
Cherish the fears
Get the bird, catch her, shoot her, I don't care
With your eyes turned up above
Expirations are needed, I facilitate the end
You filthy liar
I've got a bad feeling about this
Though you made it clear from the very start
If the sky's going to eat us 
Everybody knows you can talk all day yes
These days our pleasures are all behind fences
Rip the quality control from your burrows to your borders
Believe in neither but fear 'em as well
I feel sad for you
It's a fucking crusade
And then you realise that it's nothing
But I'ma let you know now
In a Betty Crocker oven that I will break
I'm a junkie and god is gay
He made a decision
Yes, it's all over now All over now
It must be this fucking dark winter weather, I torture myself too much anyway
 revolution incomplete,
Whether you levitate or bend spoons x
I woulda shared eternal time before I left
Yeah my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
Involuntary servitude and slavery it prohibits
This lifelike dream ain't for me
And Romeo wanted Juliette
Is that a way to treat a lovin' woman right
See somebody else
The die is cast, the scene is set
One day, maybe next week, I'm gonna meet ya
Piece of garbage with wings and she has the guts to sing
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you fuck you fuck me
Some of them slang guns when they six years old
It's your fault
Blinding me with smoke
Shut the fuck up
I'm down to earth and I'm an honest dude You barley be giving me any homage dues
You have no time for that anymore
As the blood is dripping
And when I die, won't you bury me
To be in my life
And I'm real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
Who's this that lies under me
Did you regret the morning after
A free ride just to bleed me dry
Hey yeah, like a zombie breathin'
Between the radio stations
I broke my crown while kissing little flowers
They don't believe in crime
And as the vicegrip choke holds
Battle, battle, battle
Embedded in the trash can
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
I get a feeling that you're doing it on purpose
From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black
The words of my heart lined up like prisoners on a fence
Live your fucking life and give me respect
This is my day in the sun
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
You smell the scent of something burning in the kitchen
And the message coming from my eyes
It's alright if you need the TV
My life is back on course
But in the end, what leaves you broken
I'm sitting here waiting
You had to rub it in my face
Man, fuck dem muthafuckin' pussy ass niggas
And you will always be around
You know these fucks have the balls
Think it's time I got stinking drunk
Expression, confession I can't wait
The city's not the same,
And talking shit will get your neckbone disconnected
Always darkest before the
Keeps us always returning
The rage of Angels Yeah, uh huh
Got a fucked up equilibrium
Oh, you catch me if I'm falling
His mother's bad
We're taking this lying down
You know I wish them all
Take you by the hand
Smoking the bones of children
Distrust is my middle name, self hate is all the same
Forever and ever since this cold black world began
Jetzt ist er explodiert
They cut the cord, it cuts everything that's living in me,
Hey hey yeah, give me what I, I need
To make all that should be killed to crawl
I will never tell a lie
And all that was needed was the opening
Psychiatrists play god
Nice spite work, the fancy knife work
Laugh at tits, slappin dick, in yo' bitch bitch
Kendrick, And I wear pendant on my shoulder, soldier
A long time ago before the ice and the snow
Do my dirty work, do my dirty work, yeah, come on
To make a trap for fools
And it knew not to swing
Know that I'm just fine
Halite rock salt tastes salty
And all this time I never thought
Everyone knows they need a piece of lollirot
Heaved into the ocean to drown with your brothers, your brothers
I'm singing you in every breath I'm left to heave
As I wake in my sleep and it's you I hold
Yea, though I walk, I used to fly, and now we dance
Our hearts littering the topsoil
A way of saying no where we'd always said yep
And world war is the battle cry 
But I'm not going to let you go
They told you not today
You didn't get the message
A million bodies piled to the sky
'Cause I don't need new problems today
She said "No way man"
And you know that it hurts
No matter how much medication
But he is the body of man
Like American companies that did business with Hitler
You can't miss me, I'm white blondehaired and my nose is pointy
Just to fuck you up
I'm a prickly cactus, a barbed wire bulldog,
They said it's all you want
Many days
I got the minerals
Set free your fear, it's a perfect day
Right through the rest
Now you're crying on my phone
So leave the lights off tonight
A disease of the mind, it can control you
Lightning as armor and it's today 
Who says it's okay
And they pretend that they are sleeping
But, Lord, there's gotta be another way that's better than
Hot tears come splashin' down
'Cause I can feel it "In The Air Tonight"
Trapped a loose cannon
One day you'll eat us all up too
I found myself on Forrest Road
Wings of the arms when you heels like Pegasus
Motherfuckin' rats,
And that's okay
You kick my foot under the table
For the sake of escape, to turn a knife on itself,
I just can't get my life straight
According to you you're a god fearing man
We are all angry, angry on the inside
I walk around town with a frown on my face
Our hands are reeking of rapture
There's something about this psycho bitch'
Now I sit here crippled with desire X 
Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be
Copters break up house parties
Insects, in your kiss
Hand over my heart, I swear I've tried everything
I'm not living without you
My banger is great, it split the top of your dome
Tomorrow, I'll know I'm just dirt
'Cause you don't need to come to me
My life I'm feeling so sick your life
With all the foods you hate
In and out is like this it's like a fist
Been slaves since days of Julius Caesar
Creator of heaven and earth
They don't like my ideas they label me insane
I can't help but believe
Let them split their tongues to doublespeak again
About who is running this mess
Kill, kill, kill x
Fiending all the foes in middle
On the street
I suppose I'll be dead by the morning light
Look at the boredom in my eyes
Lend a hand make all the right moves
And in the end you'll never ever ever
I'ma keep mine tight
Get me the fuck right out of here
I've been hanging at the end of her fucking rope
Well, go on and dig your holes in this ground
You're under my skin, fuck
If I won't speak her name, if I won't face her grave
The blood is coursing through my veins
You know what I mean
You wanna be the master of yourself
Then one day they say the sky gave way
It's the last time that I'll try today
You say your hands are burning
But I changed my mind 'cause he's broken the law
You and me were best friends but I'm the one you talk about
Makin' second to none shit, nigga like Quik
Whyeeieei do I cry when I say Good
Two thousand years of babylon rising
I swim in blood
I can't even beat my dick without getting convicted
Deep in the ground
Give me soul and show me the door
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
They'll make you kill
Don't you wonder why we never talk about the future
He walks the streets full of dead meat
Oh, ya sit all alone in your rocking chair
That I do not want to do
I can't speak whatever I can speak
So you can see the faces of everyone
They'll be no surrender bender in effect,
Got guns for the strength they lack
My swag makes the ladies wave like fat stomachs with bone ripples
I am lips, hips, tits
Cover up everything you know
What ever we want
Was it playful and flirty
Why you don't notice your folly
For a sunrise or a sunset, you're manic or you're depressed
You shit lover, offbrusher, jaded, bitter joy crusher Failure has made you so cruel, you
I know
Listen, I don't give a fuck what you believe most guys don't want you to see
But he can wait for you
It's not my fault anyway
Cramer dans nos clichés, renfermer dans nos carapaces 
Do what your mother tells you and put down the sheriff's horse
When the fabric of life is a horny goldmine
But you turned you back to me
Passer à l'urne afin qu'ils cessent de nos casser les burnes 
All hail the rest that never gave a motherfucking shit
Is to titillate the brain, Stimulate the immorality
Why don't you want me no more
We're living in a time where loving is so hard,
E come dirlo allora che non serve
I've been put upon this earth in female form
Come on, gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground
You feel helpless, real jealous, we killed Elvis
Human obscene 
Thinking 'bout all the lonely nights I cried
Heavy crystalline 
Way they planned it
I couldn't keep her clean at all, every dealer that she called was a friend
And tellin' my screamin' mind what to do
Your brick wall it stays up
I just wish you'd get the fuck out of our hometown
Whoa, oh, oh The grip of fear
If man makes death then death makes man, tear the torso with horses and chains
When he sucks you deep yes
It tastes so good
Their twitching never ends
Where I am stone and you are glass
There's a shiver in my soul each time you try to break me
And I need all the love that I can't get to
To make a dent on ignorance
Hunyak Uhuh, not guilty
Let's put this work horse in gear
Our world needs
At times I feel like my whole life's a rhyme
Shake your wings Like they're laced with sound
We are all sick
I was thinking about thinking
Are your memories pleasant,
Pull the car over you're frightening the kids
She wants to be a fallen angel without their swollen scars
Behold the capitalist
Love can't be forced as you know
I hope you get all that you really wanted
You needed someone to depend on you
He's just damn bored
It's no bad mood
It's a nonstop disco
Cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky,
And it's wild wild wild wild 
I keep a wall around me, block out the herd
I dare not ask, I dare not ask for more
Oh my god there's assholes everywhere
Temptation's page flies out the door
Give me blood
Alguêm me chamando, dizendo meu nome
My deck is stacked, if I could only get my shit on wax
I know you're gonna leave
And another exwife
But my head got lost along the way
This bad coffee's filling me with equal parts joy and rage
In these days nations are militant
It's life or death
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you
I am down on the ground, yeah
Left with a heart exhausted
To erase yank crime
If you ain't got no chains
To be back in Glasgow again
So that my hate can be heard
I don't want you to be alone down there
I need it in my veins
More bereft of life than an old jackson pollack painting
Written off my heart
Would you break me out and would you help me
A knife of relief, from all the petty insight,
See the sky ripped open
Put a hand in the air
I don't know who to trust Tell me what you believe
He will not stop
They say jump and you say how high
Nobody breathin' in a coma
Bury your soul down in Dragontown
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
As your wheels hit the gravel,
Watching the door lock
These niggas think they sick I come and kill the infection
But life imitates tv
Into the air, into these walls
You got nothing to say, gettin' in the way
Adessosolisticoltelli
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
So I sat alone and waited out the night
I'm gonna fuck the whole state of Illinois
But you're not the kind who would be waiting, not for anybody 
Take it how you want it but your bitch is on fire
But as I was talking, I couldn't look her in the eyes,
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
Ill bust, if you act all determined
Fifty ways and maybe more,
Cause yesterday don't mean shit 
I do things that I regret
And there's Veronica and Charlie
Accept this red shit that drip from me
Ask somebody Trina been the shit on the streets
I've covered them in blood, but this
Could it be that I'm still hungry, hungry
And there's no one for me
Everybody put on a show
While the fat lady sings
She's all I'm living with when all this fades away
denn er wußte noch nicht 
On my birthday
A speckled bird Splayed against the mosaic sky
Did you sell me to wanderlust
Oh precious wife
Step out of the fire
We've underestimated 
Obumbrata,
With a peanut for a brain and volleyballs for chest
Dizzy at the falling stars
Why you gotta be so undemanding
I go wild, 'cause you break me open
That puts an end to their days
Is this supposed to break us
You will feel young again
Oh my god hardcore kids everywhere
Is there more to this than I can comprehend
On the people we held closest to our hearts
Heal yourself with sinner's salt 
It's on that he needs to focus 
Fuck all these people
Sometimes I act like I do because of this voice in my head
Because this is dedicated to the kids
And his jacket holds a flask
Running through inside your knees
I watch the rain
Snap your fingers, snap your neck
Taking everything that's in its way
On my hotel t v, turn it off
Don't fuck around this is how I make a livin'
All you have is yourself and your mind
The bitch, who told us 'bout the bricks exposed us to the nigga
Always copping my truths
But you'd look even better in my bed
Between the lines
Who will remember me
But I know your master plan
Like such a stranger
Put your mind over matter
I am bending over backwards to get close to you but still I feel so far
And showing up to church half drunk
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
I have the scars to prove the clock strikes with her hands
I hate the way you look
And you don't give a fuck about me
You've got money, you've got fame
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
And in this decay I find another day
Or just your clothes incite
I'm the yeah
Dmx, swizz beats, uh, double up
I feel my meditation so deep within
Well you can't say nothin'
The more I know the less my tune can swing
Severing every animal
Hair in the blood, fly in the disappointment
I can't feel my faith
I'm not that girl anymore
You talk now, what you need to be
So you got so many diamonds
But that was knowledge we weren't supposed to have
Watch another burn to the death to the core
Betrayal is a sin
A passive aggressive, you didn't get the message
Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong
I don't mind seeing your face around, but we can never speak again no no no
She'll turn around  you'll dis her
To rush baby don't mad I'm sorry can't you see I appoligzle
Reagen plays the lyre  the flames are burning higher, while the world burns down around you
Oh God I wanna hear you say
And now the world is full of sorrow and pain
You're so full of sin even the devil rates you
Take it, myself, my life
I'll be there for you as long as it works for me
Theirs just no point
Time to ask if you're alive or just pretend that you died
Who needs who
You are a walking contradiction
But much worse to hate yourself
When I peal the blind back, up jumps the iron cough
But I don't need to hear your depressing remarks
He's right beside me when I fail
I shout out loud
Take what's yours and leave the rest
They say they're telling us the honest truth,
You lied to my face
Skin against skin blood and bone
No body had been capped no body had been killed
No one took time to comprehend me, or even ask me what was right
As soon as you put that gun in your mouth
Want you want from me
And I know your coming backwards 
Show me where the needles punctured
He's life's on the line with anxiety now
It's the ideal way to order the world,
Or degrading and dirty
Italicised lies, headlines, bold type 
The words rolled off those pretty lips
Is she gonna say yes Is she gonna say no
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
I dress to die, aw ,aw, aw
Then I'm going to Hell, and I'm taking the renaissance with me
Wait till the day you finally see
I'm sorry I don't swing that way
This is not culture
Complained or assumed
Tried to say, tried to ask, I needed to
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
I can't pretend, that I'm fine
I'm not afraid of looking ugly
Darked deeds to marry mine
A vision of her body as she stretches out on your bed
My life is a game, my life is a shame
And that nothing can be taken and that nothing can be taken from me
You got a sad tale, buddy somebody got  worse
People call me Strokes, aka you know the Iceman
When what you don't bite you write halfheartedly
And the forests belong to the king
The heartland ma'fucka, sippin' whole milk ma'fucka
She was lying on her back
What a disgrace man and you know it's true
Feel my heart
Bit heads off those who fail and try to imply her
When you told me, oh, you didn't need me anymore
Freddie Mercury
That's what your world today
Genocide, revolution, lost souls, prostitutin
Moving like a hunter through my back door
Hunting to find the answers
Tell your husband that his screaming just invited it in
Everything you say's gonna turn on you in some way
Else's mind
And the trees are on fire
You've got to know you'll burn in hell for all the lies you've told 
Ah, but now the tables have turned, my move
The lava of a volcano
Or the way you talk
Do you ever cry
The world shines,
One last time I need y'all to roar
I don't care if I don't have an idea track, it's an idea track, it's an idea
I'm a fucking ill, trill, kill at will etc
The reak estate is not to blame
You can't just work it out
To tell you the truth I prefer the worst of you
And you know what they say
I can't sleep until I see you sleeping
Feel my pain
Thing to ever hit since LSD, hallucinate while I dominate
After your second LP sends you directly to jail
Will turn and look at me and say
Everybode wanna be on a tropic honeymoon
You never actually get a grip of my lithium spit, saliva acid trick
But good things last
Jones house, cough without the bones
Lead protests, kill women and children
The gentry are all round stand up now, stand up now
A bass beat transforms the level of the street
Well, maybe I put too much faith in the accident
Now you look so seamless now
To die nameless on my floor
You listening I don't care no more
I am the whiteman and I paint you black 
Take in the sights, feel the breeze
And to all the girls from back in high school
And the life you lead is fake
Oh, this is what you get, karma bitch
I'm a ring on a tree in a life that fell
But the more I turn my face from the crowd,
All the fucking clergy men
We'll bite the hand that feeds
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
But I didn't know the meaning of pain yet
She don't remember shit Just the two hits
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
But I know there's someone that loves up above
While money doesn't talk, it swears
As if I need to make mo', I got a mansion
I miss the warmth of the summer
Ain't no one safe no more
To erase the thought
Rock the city with the number one sound
I've made mistakes before
I'd have jumped out of bed with a scream
Into the dark is where you're draggin' me
And it holds only your ghost"
Off wit the head, off wit the head I say
Sie lieben mich nicht, ich liebe sie nicht
I know I'm not insane
Vent these voices from the dark
When the storm rolled in
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
I see envious eyes, envious guys, different states
Points up to heaven with cathedral spires
She likes to drink
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
Strike the match and watch the doll come open
Am I lonely Heavens, no
That's I know about the girls he had
How many times have you been depressed
When I need to wipe my face
Like a woman, like a, like a
Walk 'n' cry
Done dirt cheap
This is my world
I'll be who I wanna be
I'm�not�even�trying�to�justify�myself
I ruin brain fluid  the UNKNOWN IS WHAT I'M AFTER
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
It surely works its ugly way outside
The disabled
Gonna break you
Mentally controlled, Never to be set free
You are not
The Jews and Hitler come to mind
For everything you cry for 
Everything breaks down
Got sick and tired of seein' sistas being treated ill
Was losing them to drinking and to driving
Do I need prayer, I've got too many things to ask
Worldwide and real webbed
Shared by the high school jocks who made your life a living hell
I see the shelter and contrition, best to limit wagging tongues
Yeah, turn on turn on, turn it on turn on
And I wish you luck but I've other things to do 
A whole world full of hurt, addiction and lies
Criminal, you goddamn right
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
Picking up chicks for me
We've had enough
"Oh, you are far too cute" or whatever he said
The faulty mechanism of hope has disintegrated
Now you're aiming in the dark I see your face no more now you've ruined everything and let it go and there ain't no heavy law to lay you on the floor
While emcees fight to see who can be the commonest
Just think bland thoughts
I have just one thing left to say
I know the games pms must run through you
Gun control, the sound of soul
Snap your fingers, snap your neck
For fucking freedom
That you have made
Gotta find a new place to hang out, because I'm tired of living in hell
All I ever wanted was a piece to myself
While I'm standing in the river drowning 
More food for the people
Stand up now stand up now
See just gotta hold on
I'm undead, unfed, been sleeping on bunk beds since ten
I can see it in your eyes, I know that you're hiding
I take what I can take, when the taking's good
I drawn to the sound of broken glass
Well you know I nearly fell down and died
But I always feel I have to
It's so hard to find out who you wanna be  oh
Wicked games that's the way how they wanna play
You're skinny
Wild animals show their teeth
Is this what you need
Through myself and back again, where I don't know
I think you know what I'm getting at
I wanted to be friends with her too
Into some bleeding hands over solid lands
Dying fighting a life of abuse
Plan your attack, and I am still waiting
And this is not what it seems
Mother, mother
Attention thrills and then it kills
You don't have to do nothing, you're just being you
Feel somethin' move
Now you're all alone now
Turn the bass up, get mothafuckas to go shit
When I'm working, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
Every thought got lost in the translation
That's enough to make a nigga flip
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
Drift among the faithful, bury your desires
'Cause that's all it takes to buy a gun
And I could liken you to a lot of things
Can I give you my pain, to feel
Who the fuck do you think you are
Into the toilet with faces removed
I wouldn't wait around if I was you, na, you're good but if you ain't team clean, nobody gets anything
And I just do not got the patience got the patience
Yeah mother fucker, I'm sellin' narcotics
Singing along with their dying concern to my bullshit
And I did, clear shots and no regrets never
Sometimes I sleep past noon, Daddy
Do you really wanna be the star of it
Technician of repetition clips and the numbers of tradition zips
You're so respectable
The virgin's feeling cheated
Close my eyes on y'all niggaz, the bullets'll watch yours
I've yet to feel that brilliant afterglow
You smear your filth across the world
And Everything I do and everything I try it never turns out
Kick his ass till I'm smellin shit
Cut my skin it makes me human
I don't have an agenda
I know he's in his grave turnin' like a ferris wheel
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with the new style
Well, nobody cares, well, nobody cares
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
And the people that confronted him were many
She don't have far to go to drive me crazy
It's always best to keep it in mind
I've cried myself to sleep
I try to relieve myself 
I wanna scream till you see
In sterile black and white
From now on, I'll try to find someone who knows I exist
Praising the devil the said
Be worshipped by the earth
Halos of truth now they surround
Sad news, sad days, where are you now 
Is every time you make yourself beaten, yeah
I'm a shoot your funky ass bitch
I've come to bring you hell
Well, I'll wear the claws if you'd like that
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell
Got my bitches on the outside writin' me letters
All the branches of knowledge All the branches of knowledge
The enemy The action I can't condone
She had enough and he had plenty
Let the roof burn, Let the girls love, Let the heat flow
I can see clearly from my diamond eyes
Does your life stand for anything
War censored, no blood on TV
I'll watch you sweat
My heart and my soul have turned to push and shove
Sucking it out of me
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
Don't you give me give me give me your nothingno
Will look like it was my fault
Start a fuckin' cult, clash his talents in a brash way
No one's comin' no one's comin'
'Cause you're not worried bout what I'm doing too
Insecure, you're the man
We got no time for fancy mathematics
And the worst of the three, you now have to expect
Chucking up  burning bodies in a 
You're the god that makes me stronger
Are you happy, mad I am
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press
Treated like a joke
While bloodhounds wait down in the lobby
Tonight Rat poison for dinner, 
Is it turning you on 
Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle
So roll over sweet thing
And I love to hate you
I hear the big old floppy shoes
If you ignore that I'm alive, I've nothing to cling to
They dress to kill
So be sick of listening
Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill me now
Sleep in a warm bed
Can you hear my scream way up there
I'll never be a snowflake
I wanna see you try and take a swing at me
Check before we work
We're out of control
You're not anything like them
Now I'm trapped and want to find a getaway
Kiss it, fist it, 
I work and don't get paid
She goes down, the sacred whore
Plexin and panic oppression and pride
I've never seen you frown this much
I need you
'Cause you can't erase my words, can't erase my mind
So expect a payback in return
After giving me a secondhand roach
You will beat this starting now
Just so you can have your shit heard by the nation
You know them type of chicks that walk by
Och att var dag återuppleva denna inhumana misär
C'mon niggas, c'mon niggas
Of burnt out trash
'Cause I know everyone here treats friends like family,
There was blood on their hands and a plague on the land
And you can suck a dick, if you think I ended it wrong
War Ooh, it's nothing but a heartbreaker
And after all I'm glad that I'm not your type
You've already been paid and made it
My feathered friends' end will justify the means
Damnit with the blood
We drop beats
Faking smiles, breaking promises,
St Jimmy comes without any shame
Just like you would always say, we'll make it through 
But now I'm laughing
This is nothing delicate
Ain't no afro or halo can pick the cotton out
Please take my life tonight, let's disintegrate
Now crack another bottle and let me knock one back
I'm tired and I've felt it for a while now
So fuck Jerry Heller and the white superpowers
Won't turn
Left you in a vessel with severe battle fatigue
It's time to walk away, yeah
Ever since I was young
Well, you dicked me over but now you'll pay
Common people like prostitutes
For a foot to kick me to the floor
Ice Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin LM
I fear my selfishness will be the end of this
On things I don't really care about
And thousands of mothers and their mothers cry
I am the blackman and you are the white 
With all that shit that needs to stay back in the shelf
And forget what you think you know
Last time I believed
Don't talk behind my back just call me nigga
My face has changed, you know it's me
I gotta be a fool
Darkness can't destroy my drive
Never will I front, pass it up or let it walk by
Get out of my face, out of my face with that shit
He used to pay this bitch, gave her lots of shit
Mais j'attends, je t'attends
You're fired too
She burns me up
The face of alexander remains not only solely
Another summer rolls by
Fuck tha police comin' straight from the underground
I can't and I want to so bad
The devil made me do it
Now they're fighting to get in
Tell all those other bitches they can kiss my ass
What they want from us motherfuckin thug niggaz
They came in a kiss
I'm that heathin always bathin in christian blood
Just sit back and let your soul decay
Instead of pride before the fall
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope
Lock and load your favorite gun
I freaked out, thinking people didn't love me
"I gave Them life, I gave Them all
Of endless oppotunities
And it's not what I thought it would be
Sometimes you gotta voice your opinions or you're better off dead
But what if there's never a someday at all
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
Millions of tears for a soldier's wife
But if you're gonna bark boy, you better have a bite
You got a broken heart
Forgotten and repeated
How I love to hate you repeat
They wanna get with me
But I wanted to
Find a school near the top of the league,
Baby no half stepping yeah
So down on hands and knees
The oneeyed man
You had me thinking stupidly
Hey hey yeah, like a days last moment
I've never been on the receiving end
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep Don't fuck with me
In another town down the road
Checkin' in the same hotel in the same suite bitch same balcony
I see how you're playing innocent
Baby you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Poisonous screams
My mind is set on overdrive
 Like forgotten merchants of disgust, if I don't crap out
In the city of Molotov,
It filters through its neverending shades of green
Not close enough to you, not close enough to you
Well, they take all the flags down in the evening
Roll over twice and hold the burden like a man
I could never swallow your false ideals
Now I sit here crippled with desire"
So all that I believe I am essentially are lies
No patience is in me and if you offend me
Beyond the world
Detonate feel it break
But we don't talk to them
'Cause tonight you lose me one more time
Now we're building, building a new future
So when the ghostly ruminations that are kindly disobeyed
Never get what I want
Hoping that the pain would fade away
And it feels like that your promises
For these drop shots who wanna be down
They blowtorch the doors
And still we stand tall
You make me hate you
That you never say when you pretend that you 
Darling, I feel like a god when I am next to you
When there's nothing left, on this plate your handed
Told the truth before
It's not the way I see it, man
Just 'cause I'm lonely, yeah
If I'm'a die, I'm'a die bustin' and strugglin
I'm gonna kick it in the ahahahahah
But I'll still cut ya neck out, how's that
There's nothing you can do or say, baby
Scar me with your loveless hands
And found your faith
Drive in church drive in back
Un étranger devient français quand il marque deux buts pour c'pays 
Pull the wool over your eyes
Four walls Four walls
Show and prove no grease couldn't scrap a lick
They say, "One day here, it'll make sense"
'Cause I've trusted for nothing
Stronger than yesterday
See this world as it really is
As they burn alive 
And now he's gone
I don't believe how you lie, you don't care
There it stands way up high
I'll survive without your help
Lick my legs I'm on fire
Passing slowly though a vector
Dog eat dog, every day
So scream, I heard about your message,
You're free to whine, it will not get you far
You know I love to hate you,
Who cries for the nameless whores
The record goes from blue to gold, so thank you for all your help
Boys all think she's living kindness
Maybe you thought you could throw me away
Bourgeoisie brothers talk about sufferin'
And I hate it when you preach your case
Repeat  till end
Drove back home and slept a few days
Been a lot of shit that I held back
See me cry
But I'm crippled with desire"
Your body is private
To feed the need to feel the need to feed the need to bleed
You can't bring me back
My heartbeat
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
And flowers die
And Romeo had Juliette
Roll out the bedroom window
Here it comes hissin'
Touching new life 
Gunshot
Now, this will be the last bitter song
To wipe up my drink
We're making monsters, we created you
I don't want to think
You lie, you lie, you lie
Everybody needs to find their something
They fuck in my head
Perhaps one day I'll grieve
And I Want to believe
See I'm not your friend
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to
Someone, somewhere might understand
Whenever we hold the memory close
No one cared to tell me
Koitan nousta ylös, polviltani
Are you feeling happy
Hold on for dear life  My hands are blue and I
Come save me from the awful sound
Let me know the way through this world of hate in you
We drop beats that'll crack your cranium
Ignorance is bliss, no wise woman's failed to mention,
So the real crominals get exposed behind the clothes
Can't help but feel this cold
No, I don't want to be
I can't remember why my knees are so sore
My life's become a phase, rushing past me in a daze
And we want Kissinger on trial for real
My body's numb
Nineyearold puts his money down
Now, if the greenbacks don't stack large on my side of the yard
I've turned you on to what they call the fucking devil's son
I won't be whatever you wanted
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city
And twisted around for a whole fucking week
My soul is reborn in fire
Is how you do it all for your own damn attention
And I'll pretend that this is real
We have had about enough
Beneath the yellow street light it became a situation
I don't know how old she was but it doesn't matter
Tell me How many niggas wanna ride tonight I do
Everybody's got a little someone to crush but me
Mister President, tell the truth
So we better stop it now
I remember desert places
You print the label that turns me outsidein
No more living wasted
Ordered his gun and its done and its done
I wanna be in your head while you're at a bar
Maybe I'll get another
Put a banner over my grave
If all must we damn for this moment
Yeah, you're not rid of me
Voices with nothing to say
Independence baby I shot off all my
Brother kill brother, side by side
From the pain that's here to stay
The clergy they come in stand up now
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
But now we've got tribe
I'm sleepin' in every hallway
We're sinking
Louder the tattered wings they sound
But I gave my life to be your whore
The sound, what a broke neck
I'm standing still in a shattered mirror, staring at somebody else's face
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
You can wear the uniform and I could play along
Filling your head with an urge to be dead
Yes, I think we got a problem
See me fly yeah
I wanna see your brain start shrinking
Or does it bring you shame
Ladies know how it feels
You should spend some time sometime with the person in the mirror
But here comes a warning,
Metal and man have melted, settle in to the FEMA, dreamer
I am so distant myself
Cause now in your eyes, I can't find you
Movin' 'em back, clickclick goes the gun
Wage war on the weak
I can't take it, runnin a space ship
Someday someday someday I'll be born
Oh, they say the battle's over now 
Fuck it all and fuck
You liar, you liar, you can't live the dreams you're spinning
Got to ease my aching head
Drinking coffee from a cup three days old
Alone in this world
Somewhere in this dying day
My words are limp, and my mind is dry
ma di questo nostro amore
I'll meet you now wherever you are
That's all, that's the end of it
Yeah this is it now
For the love of Christ you're the boss boss end more like
That's for calling my father a boy and, KLAK KLAK KLAK
To a no one there
Welcome to my world
Across the country through the fields 
And she can't give a damn on cue
Nothin' stands the test of time
Soon as my back is turned you're like a rooster at a hen
She got me down spinning out of control
Every time I turn around, it's there
And punish the whores of your wishgod and the martyrs that they slay
Before the hail of bullets there is silence, the pow
Greed, give me everything that I need
Just tellin' the facts
Nuuh 'cause I know how
We have to stop this immediately this fucking mess
You bleeding heart,
You want to know why
Go out and make a last call or sit here and do nothing at all
To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks
Get familiar with Cartwright
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Sail as white as heroin, white like weathered bones 
I'm the ghost in your machine
Now I have a perfect world, now you're goneoh oh oh
Who the fuck you tryin' to be
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear Abomb
And as you passed out fast on my shoulder,
You so used to running back but I won't let you do that
We're not afraid of you
And they both fuckin' smell like shit
Brush her hair, noone else will
Now my world is disconnected
'Cause we're perfect together and never wanna be apart
Candles burning
Like you and I would someday be
And when you get to the end you'll find a chair
One day I'm gonna bust
Like white celebrities buying black and brown babies
Make me feel like I want to kill
And throw coins on his back to taunt him 
You got tha realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
I been stabbed
I'm with stupid, caught my finger in the door
Live the lie and take a dive
The sound, what a dead neck
Let's just say enough's been said
Don't need no ad machine
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
There's too much therapy I need
These memories 
Get me the fuck off this track
I look in your eyes
A gaping hole running right through their neck
And if I ever let the words, of another nigga bother me
I'm just being real nigga, fuck you
I'm just so sick and tired of playing the game Forever meting and deleting all the simple mistake Here I am, god, help me I am slave to a name not possible or possibly the person that I'll became See, everybody's borne in battles but I'm trying to breed out, by never doubting that in doubting I've created the doubt if I'm about the best bred to lead the canon'ed devout then can I realize and factualize my fictional account of how I'm born again Forgive this life loving friends and friends don't give a damn for damning is the means to end I've been trained to live lost in a hole, where poison could equate to control, is controlled by my hand, here it is, here I am
I'm stronger than yesterday
So fuck all your protests and
Grin fuck
Aw, honey you're a bitch
How many wishes do I still have left to fix the way it ends
Es war ned einfach so vorbei
I know you are so am I
I came as Solomon, to a people that was lost
I never knew it, but the rest of my class knew it
I am the assassin, with tongue forged from eloquence 
You hope and pray everyday it works out
You take your turn lashing out at me
I have been fighting the good fight
When he said the world was round
Must be having a good shame
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
When we're dead they'll know just who we are
Gym Class Heroes
Or maybe it's just a game
Let me bring in the memories
Don't take it away from me, I need someone to hold on to
On the sacrificial altar to success, my friend
 takes a lifetime, but Bobby does it better
Tie it up, now boot it up
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
You outta work, I know it's tough
Down wit the niggaz that I bail out
What's this madness all about
Excuse me, Mother, I am only bleeding
And let me sing forever more,
Just when things are back on track, I sabotage myself
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
I know I am so fucking angry
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Veins are a racetrack for fuel that I need
I sit back with this pack of ZigZags and this bag
It's a shame because tha man's slain
Hell, there's a car in the driveway
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you
That she's above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets
All I want is a little respect All I want is a little respect
My darkside love affair come to my protection
Nigel just needs this helping hand
They teach them how to kill when they hunger
And I'll see you in hell, I'll be laughing 'cause you're dead
And feeling someone's hand around my neck
Babes on the run with poisoned lips
They're an inhuman race
I need to hang on
He only wanted someone to play with someone to play
And rape your children now 
You're accused but not on trial
Twisted beyond a return
I know you'll think that I don't seem to care
'Cause they don't want to go home
When heaven falls
I could do a lot of things and I do
I'm a pound of flesh in a drum machine's dream, we watched
Don't know how to treat a lady, don't know how to be a man
JFK sold us freedom, or was it just a business toke
Your voice ringing out
To defy the lies
Just let me have one single day to myself
I saw you go faster than the morning comes 
Oh, don't you know that anyone can come
But your ego obscures reality and you never bother to wonder why things are going so well
The world like cold as shit
Than the British museum today
Rolling in pain
Every feeling that I have
I synonymer till fantastiskt, ja det var vad jag var då
We're kissing violence
If it wasn't for truth, we'd have taken our bow
The memories are bittersweet;
You know it's only the beginning
Your weapons are already in hand
You better take a good look 'cause I'm full of shit
Well I'm not
Don't kill me, I have two kids at home, don't kill me I said I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you, hurry the fuck up
It's not that No, you think I'm ugly Baby
Love is speaking in code
This is part of daily life
A will to survive and a voice of reason
I'm living in a dream, and no one hears me scream
Yeah, this movie's gonna kill me
Everybody, everybody, everybody dies
On phone lines
É tão humana e tão errada
And I don't know just who I am
So fuck you
Blind your eyes to what you see
We'll scar your minds
Believe me
That skate hard, Thrash black hoodies, try something
I'm gonna like you know, I'm gonna prove that it's my own voice
I told myself to keep my mouth shut
I don't need to relive it
As a kid I'd play, just create the day
You're no longer daddy's boy
There ain't nothing fucking with this ya know why
But I won't stop now Real Niggas
The qualifying factors are politics and class,
Rusted clotheslines in the sun
I don't know if you got a man or not
You think I'm gonna come this far and let you niggas stop me now
How do I say no
Big guns are pointed at me,
Cause the wrecking crew come knock'n down the door
Don't know what I'm doing
Chorus Second half
Funny, how familiar
Il nome intero è Marracash, ma
Like stop suffering
No no no more wishing
Open your brain and I'll destroy it
You're so fake, you make me shake
That blurs like an answering machine
I'm really getting tired of taking
I'm not too amused with humans
All my life
Life gets dragged like racist lipstick on men's faces
There is no way to escape
Who the fuck wants to live forever
Your face looks so green
Pretending not to notice
Old growth forests, first you go and log it
When you peel out and drive away
We wanna live our life
Do you think I'm scared to play your games
And in the morning
Makin' on time,  years we on tour we blow you back off
You want that personal attention
Just let me lie here next to you
To make yourself the fool
You want me to believe 
Love, hate, lust
I am Sam, I am known to go HAM, the full retard
Well I didn't wanna hurt your feelings, honey
It's not what I mean
Us girls don't need you
But now you'll have to pay
Nothing is worth the sleep that I've lost
Wanna end up with no one to talk to
And now I'm ready for my adversary, talk is cheap P Dog
I'm broke as hell, my attitude is no good
Well they can fuck off, 'cause they ain't got me, and they can't buy my dignity,
Who hypnotised the guilt in career rhythm trance
When she's thrown into the fire
Open it up, the stink of you sin
Can get a woman thinking her period is late
Well, I move in another dimension
I'm a razor blade slittin' through a wrist of hate
Rule nigga
Got a room for the night
Living in a world full of cokeheads, butchering jokes, wanting all your attention
Stay put man, here come
I'll kill you right there
There, now that's not so bad, is it
You know I hate you
See somebody
Stop begging someone to hide you
Put the plastic back in the machine
Come on, gather round the sound
Here comes the war Did you think we were born in peaceful times
Wild when the waves start to break
Now, now, now
Crawls back up his cheek and slowly disappears
So debauched in your slick mink
Say my hearts full of lust
Fill your hungry wretched life
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
It's life, and life only
You thought that you'd find me in tears
Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore
Forlorn dispised
A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not
Every time you think you're walking, you're just moving the ground
Oh, dear God, Everybody stay calm
But every chance I get to put a smile on someone's face I will take it,
So I resolved to make amends
I don't complain and I don't take a stand
Pocketfil of mistakes
I'll carve them all with a flick of my wrist
And there's no crashing until I see this through
Starfuckers, Incorporated
These lifeless days
The nose in the clouds
Knowing full well they'd prefer you were dirty 
Keep me company as I hunt down and kill my enemies cause there must be
Watchin the danger and niggaz double crossin they peers
But they don't tell you what to say when your whole life has gone to Hell
Do you know what they do
I'm not no animal
I ain't got no muthafuckin' daddy, he ain't teach me shit
Maybe the first day of school or going to visit Dad
The fools Slogan has become an anthem I watch ascend the charts
And some talking about our car and imaginary mansions
Where all my lovers turn to stone
Twofaced junkie social mores
You're saying words but you know I ain't listening
I've got a heart that aches
Set me on fire, kerosene
You hold me down, you hold me down,
I know now that I'll never learn
I'm not underdressed, you're overdressed
Your now about to witness the power
The angels singing
I taste the embrace
How it fell right through your shaking hands 
We could've made it out, but oh
The silent guns of love will blast the sky
But I never saw so many goobers
I know the the PJ's the plats and the plays
You need to elevate and find
Kansas City motherfucker, full of dangerous skill
Through the clouds, in heaven
Will you remember me 
And I didn't need you till melody
II want you
I believe I'll be taking my revenge
I'm here to tell you loves not some fucking blood on the receiver
Hey Chi man is what he's speaking
Taking no shit when push comes to shove
Well lady and gentelman, boys and girls, you know what'll happen next, I've got my prince, and few weeks of beautiful happiness, and then the prince got ill and die of colon cancer Fuck I found love, and it got cancer So I gonna hang around the shithole called no more, boys and girls I'm gonna kill myself like you will, and I'll take that bitch stepmother with me
Shut up When I'm talking to you
And a law that they set out what's love
Yo, Em What Don't kill nobody this time Aright
You just keep me contemplatin', that your soul is slowly fadin'
With nowhere to hide
Am I on the right train headed in the wrong direction
That we're sitting still in the garage and nodding off a mirage
Cause my people on the streets are the majority
I wouldn't have screamed
And I'd like you to know that I don't care
Take your voice away
So next time someone makes you feel little
And burn them and flush 'em 
I torti restano,', fra questo so
Minding my own business,
When in fact they're not
Tune into the prudence of the dark heart news
So I'll beat my meat like I'm a fucking butcher
Stalk my enemy and let the fuckin' silencer cook
When you leave him your key, he ends up having sex in your apartment with miss NonBitterness
The missing bride
And the wind is always shifting
By a memory that won't help
Hat es zweck zu fliehen
And the master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo
Bring them up in noman's land where no one really wants them
Ill make you feel just like a lowly worm
Play a fool
Sitting on a fence is a man who sees both sides of both sides
ma se io prendo chi è che dà
Hair trigger reflex heart full of defects
On a bus bench singing that song
Said that I was sure the world was gonna change
You know you're not the boss of me
And I really wanted just to be in your body
You have to play fair
'Cause it's my fate
Please believe me when I say
I cry out for guidance, I cry
But failure's a lesson that's best learned alone
Better leave real quick cause you know me
After we smoked too much pot
You best ban TV if you want me stop
Just wait a minute
Please understand that these are the years
You want a choice want to make your own decisions
I don't need you, I don't need you 
You lie to yourself and remain alone
I've lost all control
Fuck me, fuck you, fuck you fuck you fuck me
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
 No, I'm sorry
I'm taking over thoughts in your mind
He says we're fucked up but we're not the same
Y'all swerve in my lane, I'll pull up and start popping ya brain
Ah my mind going next, sucker punch solar plex
So fuck it, guess what, this rap is about me
Actin' like it was my homie, just a fuckin' phony
Whatever happened to protecting each other
I'm the one that speak the language and the anguish of hate
All the pain inside amplified by the
There was no guilty verdict
Never waking up, say it
I want to break free with my heart 
In my glass coffin
Behind a plastic wall
When he was standing
When your ashtrays are filled with piss
What is it you really want
You sucking the life out of me
So don't be trying to blame the world for your nonsense bitch I'll fuck around a smack yo ass
I live like a dog in a house full of shit
Makes sense to me
All I know is
Push or click over like somebody's trying to beep in
Devil's got dandruff got her nose to the grind
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic
I'll hunt the hands that took my place, and hang them
Sometimes I get pissed
Make you sorry for the fact that you attempted and failed
You're, you're looking distressed
It makes me wanna bite who's on stage like Carlos Mencia
How dare you stand corrected
To make fakes promises to me
Sampled and soulless
If they never know I'm gone, they will never notice it
Strangers in the world it seems
Some people chose the road to be hoes
And you know, that little short gay lightskinned nigga and that fatass nigga Domo
I know
Got the town crazy over beats rhymes and life
It's just a natural  you never fuckin' possessed
Surrender
None of this really matters anymore
So back up off of me in this Bitch
I'm gonna get up, and out, and wild
I've given you everything, baby what do you want from me
In der deutschen Verfassung steht
You come around sounding 
You're pretending
So will the worms please shriek on the count of three three
Courtin' fate and fate 
Do you remember my name
You adhere to a set of standards and tastes
There's something about the things we do
What the hell am I doin' here
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine
Give me just a little to hold on to
Oh, god help me
DRE with that fuck a bitch shit fuck a biatch
So, one last time, I'm back
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
And you've reached the end
How can I eat such a harmless animal
And I'm not even human, I'm a body shaped demon
A bump on a log, guard ball, I'm god awful
You will rise upon the sound
I wanna
Molly Connelly ruined my life
All the while just showing your teeth,
L'Etat veut notre peau, espérons qu'on sera aux choses divers
That you fired the first lethal shot
Just a pain
Everybody's got a little something to hide but me
But here's the kicker, it doesn't matter
Deeply I scream from within
Feel the love and appreciation from all of my niggaz
My best ain't good enough for you
But you know just as well as I
These streets have signs that point somewhere
He sees the masses dancing so he sternly reprimands them 
One day you'll be the end of me
I'm taking one step sideways
There was no young punk
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
We got a right wing king making third world war
That always makes me smile that artist has got some style
I was waving around a bleeding open wound
Get out of my life, tonight
So I can show you who really ballin' in this bitch
You young, you here, day dawning, eyes wide
Right,�left,�front�and�back,�it�overflows�with�despair�and�pain
Just a Cassandra too drained to painfully word it further
I need a man
Bored as fuck with this street cornercover,
Always falling
I wanna feel
Who you know fresher than Hov' Riddle me that
I'll grow myself right up to the sky
To defeat your taste
Your disease and you your disease and you
Well shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you, you know why
KLON, Los Angeles, KLONE Radio We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else
Points a finger at me finger at me
Motorhead, you can call me, motorhead, all right
I lead a life of crime
It'll get you just a little bit sick
Neon black lemonade drip drips from his grin crammed with cool charm,
I just wanna know
Down to your heart
And maybe we'll come back to earth, who can tell
Raggedy ass, holes in your kneehighs
And one day it will be fine
You're the drug that works
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
The game is lost, eternal love
We don't want your fucking love
Now you know how it feels to drop the ball
As she raised her hands in the air
Then they stab us in the back and lie to our face
We are all crazy
He treats his brothers like his enemies
Sometimes I feel you don't understand
Tried to pretend it was all in her mind
Voices healing my pain
It gets tricky don't be picky if the slipper fits you wear it whore
Just bodies, they brightly scratch
Nappy ass hair
A soul is seeking salvation to squander
I don't need to choose a side
And each endless night
Got a job, got a life
What I want from this, is learn to let go
Have you got any money
Nightmare without sleep
Rockabilly man come to pound the coffin nails
Systemised atrocity ignored 
Today, my name  is pain
She couldn't run away 'cause she was crazy
Have no regret
Like the lick of carnivorous winds
Leggo my megalomania
That was Every human being should have his freedom
And his friends made me swear I wouldn't tell
'Cause I'm not angry with you
And I see you hand in hand with another man
Reminding you to breathe
Out of the soul
I don't want to be a child of disgrace
I'm more than a man,
There's bullet proof glass in case there is trouble
Paint our money black
I'm steady waiting for the day I get to see his ass P Dog
Mai tais on a white beach, coconuts bitch
Out on Bail Y'all don't need to know about
For everything you die for 
And it always seemed the juice used to flow
Don't wanna see your face
You paused in the doorway
Your voices aren't clear enough after all
By grace, my sight grows stronger and I will not Be a Pawn 
Niggas off the chain because they affected
You can hate me now QB
But see when I've got a bit of heartache in my system
And muthafuckers lost their minds
I want to rewind every frame from this moment
As time passes by
Bags full of smelling salts, mad as the magazine
For dear life, I hold on
Round here, we're never sent to bed early
Beyond good and evil
If I could find the will to kill
It feels like nothing is
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
They cannot change me
Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap
Believe me when I tell you
Than sadness and pain
I don't need religion
We want it back today
See that reason down before you die
But now it's never here
Yeah, I kill what I need
Two thousand other souls burn bright
I think of what it tastes, taste
Ich hau den Haken in die Öse eurer Sprachverstöße
Another day
Kill kill kill for Acht Zwei Null
Some broken glass
Left with images of you pouring from my eyes
Ride me away  I want shade
You'll never grow up to be a big rock star
Cause no
Tucked inside the heart of every nice girl
It's run in the family, hey
"There ain't nothing no girl so sweet"
A will to kill, a will to destroy
Didn't react, too busy choking on the fat
One thing leads to another
There's a woman on our party line, a nosy thing
Pressures on my back
Streams of melting glass
But you moved me in a way that I've never known 
I haven't got fucking anything
To make it Sunday worst
I got a bad feeling about this to hell with you and all your friends, it's on
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
The inhibitions of their prey kept them from screaming
This life is ruining me
But can't knock my door down
When the day had begun
With a face like Keith Richards
It's ladies night at the bar
Flashback
Mówiąc "adieu" ty się śmiałeś do mnie,
I'll watch you crawl
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
I've created a world that is devoid of love
I want to take you away
Then shout
"Dammit Lent, fire your weapon"
We are dying on our knees in this grey broken land
Hit and run, your will be done
They all screamed, and cried
Of the beautiful people who live without flaws
But you haven't so now I grab this vocal and just cock it
I'd have lit the fires but I'd have pulled you out
I don't know how to
And night and day, night and day  the white boy's plotting night and day, night and day
And wisdom always chooses
The thought of War Ooh, it blows my mind
Burned all of my porno 'cause you were PMSing
Come here and sit and talk about it just for a second
Tell everybody that you ever saw
Faking the emotions,
As you pump drugs into your bloodstream
I'm demanding
And then play it again and again and again
The frames of mind
You want to open up
Now we're so strung out we wanna own
Payback on your ass 'cause you're over due and I know I owe it
Crying for a love that you know you never learned how to make
'Cause you can't put the life back into this hospital ward
Another day here
But won't somebody please explain
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against the wall
I'm taking back what's mine
Two weeks and three days
I wanna see what your insides may be
Back to me, actually, I got a lot of girls throwing they ass to me
Now feel this come down on you
Now what sound of my DJ cuts
Keep killin' me baby, put your feelings aside, keep solving me slow with your skin, tell me, who am I
And we know that nothing's true
Or is it a string of endless flings of bitter resentment
The graves have all been dug don't let me forget one for myself
Her empty needle is my unsharpened sword,
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
So I call out your name somebody to save me
I just want to die
Her lips were still curling
Don't wanna stay around now, but I must try
I've got nothing to lose but my apathy 
We may fall
That's the thing that fucks the most I know for a fact
They are na've and are driven to find their own identity 
So I'm indisposed
Is all the future brings
So, we treat you like a bitch
Communication's lost to the radio
As the dirty priest confides
Real live thug shit, genuine, you know what I'm sayin'
Say, "Okay, I've had enough, what else can you show me"
weder witzig noch gesellig
And piss upon the stage
Around your knees that crackle into the dark
How could you let him sleep in our bed, look it Kim
And I know about this privilege,
And heat is cold and birth is death
That you feel bad about it
When you want you're bad
Maybe next lifetime
And when it turns on those rains
Yeah, you deserve it now, it's all right
They keep on screamin' these words, screamin' these words
Tryin' to be a damn hero
To stand for you or fall for you ever again
For there are none so blind as those who will not see
I know you think it's sweet
Someone's yelling fire
Through the submerged distance
And what you know about no heat and no electric
As we turn each other into the blinding light
I wonder sometimes if you're looking down
Me and DDot all we seein' now is ready cash
Making A Ruckus, Hungrily In Remorse
At another's disaster
Better tell her keep on walkin'
You noble diggers all stand up now, stand up now
What are you questions I know you have them
You should have seen the ratings that day
Can you hear them singing
This is nothing fraudulent
My heavy steps get a little bit louder, louder
Look my nigga, we can scatter like buckshots
Hollow minds stalk ropeless gallows in turn to idle on immersed
I've got a piece of my heart
When our hopes and our dreams have all died
Motorhead, remember me now, motorhead, all right
All those things, you taught me to fear
Sachant que celui pour lequel j'vais voter, va pas changer quoique ce soit 
When I rock, there is not a label for it
What happened on that day back then
My mouth is dry and my hands are shaking
I think you just play what you play
No one gives a shit 
Up jump tha boogie then bang, let'em hang
Hell no, you can't heal my pain
That's some nasty shit, and you still don't ban it
On the bathroom floor
So sound, so evenhanded
Take this to your grave, and I'll take it to mine
She likes to stand, she can't afford to sit
And I'm who you run to
And I'm in your head
All signs pointing to your sins
Yet warm and close
You can't control your own life don't try to rule mine
For he's a stranger who comes in the night
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get
ein Supermann, ein Sieger,
Carry it with you till someone forgives you, I laugh, 'cause there's nothing to say
'I don't know how all this started but in my religion,
You want the loot and weed
So I wanna be a member and I wanna be a name
Shot glass seems to hug your soul
Oh, baby For just one day
I'm in a perfume heaven
Werd' lieber niederknie'n
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
I can never break free
We always knew that it'd work out right and we could start anew
Somebody sighs
Too much complainin' gotta fix my head
As I  skin the burn to relearn the royal plan
But you mistrust me
Are all my best days and years behind me
And I'll be waiting
Quinine's bitter, sugar's sweet
In anybody I can find
While others say don't hate nothing at all, except hatred
Come on everybody let's go to the show
Everybody wanna talk 'cause I'm rappin'
And I will return
I always loved you
So your dad will approve
You burn down the trees
You are scum, you are scum and I hope that you know
Well the man tells me my future and it's not so far away,
You eating off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick
You came to me faithfully
Here's to mad cow disease and all that yummy MSG
Covet love it learn to rape
I know your daddy and your brothers too well
She stayed with me for days days
I need you
'Cause all I want of you is just a let me be
I kept picking at that scab
Go home, there's nothing there because
This is your honeymoon, in separate rooms,
Chillin' with the clique got the mad hops jaming
Takes the CD out of the player and puts back in its case
You wanna be rich
I'll be the girl that you hate
Your resistance to a mirror I feel screaming from your body
The day laughs in your face
While there's diamonds in the mind
Found so many ways to hate myself
But I don't want to be alone
We're only making plans for Nigel 
And there's nothing to feel
Until I moved to the west coast
In my eyes and tell lie after lie after lie
How's my father
I know you know, that
C'est qu'aujourd'hui on est kpone inc et regarde bien qui vient de cogner chez nous
Big to little o' brother, you leave me like blood from my veins
And everything else I'm burning
You wanted me, not to tell me why
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
You're inaccurate, hotheaded like a Capulet wanker
This is that sure shot itchy finger lingering behind your target audience
Vicious thoughts are my incarnation
The taste of anyone's fist
And you split my head in two
I'd take a whore to the funeral
Leave in the end
All the crap is building up, my mouth is open and just won't shut
I think of a lot of things when I'm walking
You know I am a Doctor of the third degree"
The velocity I'm gathering
Sing, sing again
Their broken backs
Looking up without knowing 
When your heart skips a beat it's ruthless and aimless
I had never thought
I'm taking back what they stole
It's the mind manipulator  the WAR CHILD
You brain dead You gotta fuckin' bullet in your head
Und ich spüre jeden Tag was ich verliere
Crawling back to 
He only wanted some one to
Fuck you and that horse you rode in on
Other people, they're not looking
Goddess, queen, mother, sister, lover
Oh, and in the judgement, he will remember the ones you've robbed,
Panzer attack
Your life's a mystery without a clue
Come pay me a visit if you feel that you may be offended
Your word is the word that always won
At the end of the bar
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
Full speed ahead you go with all of your heartache
I'm hangin' on a ledge
I don't need shit and you ain't nothing
Dirty needles break the skin
Peanut butter smeared on his chest
I'm never gonna talk to you and
And took the stairs but didn't stop at the street
And hope they never come back
You can keep on sucking till the blood won't flow
Or just to die by the hand of love
Laughs a face of a girl who just got paid for
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do
Life passed me by, but it's not my fault
Don't buy the shit they sell
But morning's coming and my sleight is dry
But not everything that it takes
But there was never a moment, not a moment
I ain't no damsel in distress
Society has made me mentally insane
Back on the street now
Look ma how I've grown now
Or do you feel condemned
Take his anger out on me
But the first law of nature is to defend one's life 
Taking the land under command
These wounds, they will not heal
Cuttin' at the beams with a hacksaw, on a camel's back
All this shit, I gotta believe
Keep my faith even through the darkness, yeah I still believe in love
Down the barrel of a gun
Of my days peddling hate out the back of a Chevy Express
It's quite depressing, there's no fixing to the problem
nell'incertezza è meglio prendere
Welcome to the city
New day but it's all the same, what a motherfucking basic art
Niewarte mnie
I can dry up a sea, yeah
Yesterday
My secret self has many sides
In a myth of sin 
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
I'm headed out to Sydney Australia with Tim Donnelly
Still sick
They say they're gonna fix my brain
Shit what you know about death threats
Disregard how you feel
Well You know what to do with your hands
She can clean my gun and I can help her clean the floor
You never leave a message
I'm holding out, and I'm holding on 
It's you that I can't believe in
Cause you know I'm not buying
Left wing macho street fighters willing to kick arse
Especially when it comes to my money and the contract is exclusive
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
I see your parking sticker
And a whole lot of misery, mmm yeah
Right before the lord
Tell you mama
Set me free from humanity 
Can't see no future
And dispel every trace
I sit around all day
Saw me once, saw me again got your pistol
And it feels so good to be on top of you, on top of you
One foot in the grave
Tell her she don't want no problems
This industry shit to hell with that
Yeah once, once is real conniving, it's easy now,
Here's a mirror mirror to peer, fear grows clearer
Blue water, deep water, senseless denial
A light upon the swarm
I just hate to be the bad guy
'Gainst lawyers and 'gainst priests stand up now
'Twas better to die 'neath that Irish sky
Be the voice of truth in a world so truthless
Consuming, confusing
People are violent, yes, but if we show them the way, they will buy us power
And move to a communist country 
Oh, I wanted to be a star
Where ever we're standing no body knows
You know how to touch me
And she's banging on the door; she's losing all control again
Fuck you Ice Cube, that's what the people say
Pay back, for every time that they called me a spic
Not knowin' if I'm comin' home or not
You sell all the living
Tie up your horse before the night falls, can stole your wife,
Take your sorry ass
The star probably don't know that he the house nigger
I didn't know what was at stake
Blue babe's gasping, revenge is mine
Out of the old and thin and control, we spin
I do know how to replace it with revenge
You do not need to think
There's nothingwrong Mom
Turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on
But Smalls don't get down like that no question
That vaguely leftist doctrine of beliefs
It happens Lord everyday
And move as one
Statements and a plan with a map of the land
Push to an end into the darkness ahead
Look both ways when you leave the building
What brain can you pick
Hit the road hit some hoes videos
When they start to sing,
Or say what they mean without drinking
I need direction, maybe a sign from God
You're not rid of me Yeah, you're not rid of me
You can say what you want but nobody's there
It don't mean shit to me
You've become the sheep you hated
'Cause I wrote that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
Picking every last fuckin' piece of paint off the walls
The sound came outta rusted crate
But it sure is fun to advertise a fight
Call me God, cause that's what the black man is
In the wall of good fortune
Doing that surveillance on Mister Michael Render
Late night catechism speaks me to sleep
Turned my senses into spite 
And all those clowns, what can they know
You cannot help me to forgive you
There ain't no ain't knowin' me
Grand openin', grand closin'
It ends tonight,
The bible tells us Mary Was a whore
So she's planned a little trip to France
We controlling the crews, drinking Belgium booze
So they don't turn out as bad as me
You're not around
Or you'll be sorry
Hear my voice, hear my voice, hear my voice
My life was ended by your hand
I'll never see your face again
"Go, go I'll tell you when to stop"
And the scavengers are feeding 'cause the killing fields are bleeding
Let's get together, make a record, why the fuck not
Only gonorrhea
A complicated heartbreak losing its direction
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
Your station has been assigned
The way your eye shifts makes me wanna go
Better ask somebody baby
In my head in my head, in my head, in my head is real
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
And I saw my life in a different way
I got a bad feeling about
But you bend, you're bending my mind
Now who is able to make war with the beast
That's gonna be killed if I talk about it shhh
Choć mieliśmy tak pięknie skrojony plan,
Rims and new trucks your man 'Livin' It Up'
On the net, Ken Bigley got his neck tek off
Just like babies killing babies girls assaulted in some park
I don't know and I don't care
A me mi basta il sole e non lavorare
And watch you play dumb I'd like to see
You left me feeling hopeful 
Make a meal of nothing at all
I swear you live your life
Won't need no strong man
I'm coming, fuck, I'm coming on you
Escobar season has returned
Sometimes I try to do things, and it just doesn't work out the way I wanted to
I feel it slipping away
Somebody get me out of here
You think I am bullshitting, then read the th Amendment
Everyone I know of
I feel you
Thuglife niggaz Hey, pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex
Because I was always taught boy meets girl
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, 'cause she's fake
Respect is a virtue that strong men command
Several days
You was heartless on yo' hits
But for now we'll all just smile and sympathize
On this burnt cursed ground
Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay It's fuckin' fiction
Drop a tape rock a show sign a line
Old apathy in the brain
So you drop all your defenses, and you drop all your fears
Se io prendo chi è che dà
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
Straight A's on the honor roll
Tell, there's nothing left to tell
I want your everything and I want your head
The breath of the storm that begins
But if I were a good man
I'm feelin' kinda trapped don't you know
If you were a woman and I was a man
So unknown
You're, you're looking older
How the hell is she gonna get it back
Local redneck stare
They left him to rot in some stinking council hole
The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin
You see the sun dissolving
Having nothing can be really hard
I'm strong but I'm wild, they say I drink too much
Who the fuck you think let y'all wild niggas in
'Cause she want my worm like Carmen
Buy, buy, buy, my new record
You're telling lies to everyone who will listen
Yours is no sacrifice
Rattattat, kabooboom, now take that and just a bit of this
And def jam  negroes turnin' up their nose
Won't you let her breathe a recipe for drugs to see clear
That's the motherfckin West side, you test me, you test God
Like a serpent in the sky,
The slowest race around
Oh, I am a fool I know
Familiar landscapes
The feel 
Living deaf, dumb and blind will get you nothing
I will fight
Dr Dre Why the fuck not
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
I'm feeling like less of a wreck
With my soul with my hands 
Y a eu de nombreuses victimes mais personne pour payer 
E tra l'amore e far paura preferiscono fare paura
You cut me off before I start to sing
Now I stand here with both feet planted firm on the floor
Y'see I didn't wanna be with any people I know
The Friday night abattoir spills out into
Our country and all its people could be in danger of nuclear attack in minutes by enemy missiles and hours by enemy aircraft
And bring meaning to this life
A conversation I believe
But it's not Salt 'N Pepa
If I was a miner
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, "BIG"
Writing on the wall
That seems to invade my lungs and mind like salt
We're taking it, back in the day to the Golden Age
But salmon pink skinned Mary's still caring
And you tell her that you miss her
And break the fuckin crucifix
Men are cursing, women praying for release, but when a white man kills one of "them" no one sees,
Looking for that someone
I hope we live to tell the tale
You know I still got my one good arm
Punch 'em like a mother fucker even rape a few
As I crawl to my knees
You know you should be on with me
She's on a diet but my pockets eating cheesecake
You don't think I know but I can read between the lines
A selfmedicated handicap so I speak to myself
For my king
'Cause they want five mics, I'd rather have five Mallories
Yes Jesus loves me, the bible tells me so
Does she need you like I do
For those feeling that what I said offends you
There's nothin' left in me
You used your money and your friends
Keiner weiß wer dieser kleine stille Junge war
My guts are gonna drop like flies
Peel all the scars from our way
"Nodbody move, just stay where you are"
And lay us on our belly, while they fingers on they triggers
The rivers are flowing with blood
I'm gonna be the man who havers next you
I didn't understand you
We've watched it all from the window ledge,
Not gonna hear this singing of this ringing triumph thing
But it really did was let the police terrorize whoever
Fight the feeling
And with a picket for a knife
A knife for the men who keep you awake at night
No one else knows,
Pack your shit and leave
All simple monkeys with alien babies
No disrespect
Whoa, just another lonely night
You can't embrace it
Keep the faithful entertained
So shame on you 
It's darkest before the dawn
A man he shouts alone
I've already spent years at the back of the line
For your, for your pathetic soul
I think all the tracks I'm hearin' from niggas is whack
When will they comprehend, comprehend
Break some bread for all my sins
Close your eyes, just settle, settle
I'm going door to door, with foreign swords
Soul and body cold
To make me feel
Why'd ya do it she said, why'd you let her suck your cock
We can run with scissors through the city fair or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs,
I don't feel no pain
Feel my soul just siphoning, make a girl wanna hibernate
I could turn around and walk away
And I've never seen you frown this much
I can just sing my troubles away"
Disenchanted, disgusted
With the great spirit on his side
Your daughter's chillin' up in college top grade
Would you feel everything I do
It echoes in my brain
When inside we'll smoke the, when inside we'll toke the, when inside we'll smoke
What the fuck is his problem, here, we have two doses to give him, here
I can't keep my hands off you,
Stand to salute and say thanks to the man of the year
He had six wives; one of those Mormons, you know
Each sickening smell announces a flood
Nothin' like survivin the shot
And please, be honest
And the trees took a knee and the seas rolled in
I don't feel what I am supposed to feel
Inside your head I'm singing
This is how it feels
And if all that crap wasn't enough
I do just fine, my car and my guitar, yeah
What do you know about relationships
We need vices Oh
Life is a journey, not a mystery
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch
Just a rite of passage, you held me down and said
And again when your head goes through the windshield
They burst into flames and crash into my bed
But I ain't saying it to your mothafuckin' brain, skull
Spit you out, spit you out
Butterflies in the jar
Innocence fuels my foolish mind
You drill Pulling the blood of the earth
To the man
My first mistake was to smile at you
You need to step back kid and give me some space
When a trembling distant voice unclear
Chasing me down like an insect
Oh, she can trace the tricks of the tracks like the ribs of a rattlesnake
la volante quella notte
You're not who they say you are
I'm at the edge of myself I'm dying to talk
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
Oh, there's a wicked young man
This is a song about the girl next door
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Instead of drunk belligerence
Just a rock flaoting
You got to steal the time of a life that's passing by 
I'm gonna put them in a gun man
Seven on the beat
Gotta focus in on what we're choking on
I just don't know
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better
If one more cop harassed me I just might go psycho
The city smells fishy
And you can't blame the sky, it collapsed twelve times
Fill up with all the empty needs
I want so much to believe
Can't see my heart in the blender
Allowed you to put down ya guns, and raise ya pen
Remain enthralled as breathing stalls the course of your mind
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness
Doch hat niemanden gestört
Prototypical nonconformist
We'll see if I'm leaking
Please, forgive me for questioning divinity  it's an ugly job but I think I'm up for it I'm not saying who's right, I'm just saying there's more than one way to skin a religion There's more than one way to explain our existence
Your every breath now strengthens my affliction
There's no hope, no doubt, no faith
But he's not in the House
If talking's a waste of our time
I'd have made it perfect just for you
There's no eyes in your head
Bedroom punching
I'd feel more comfortable with myself
Living life through the words you hear on the radio
Combed my hair to look just right
Oh my God  I live for You now
You feel so lucky
Knows that she could never hide
Now I know what I'm about to choose
Just give us war, worn lipstick by the purifying flame
So no one gives you a damn
And teach them to hate this place
Round here, she's slipping though my hands
She's about to do Karabo's laundry now
A week in the forest
Fuck you and I'm gone, fuck y'all niggas
He says, "Give it up boy, give it up or you're gonna die, 
War Ooh, ooh, yeaheaheaheah
And sitting in the long grass in summer
Bruv told me what happens when a loved dies
Digging graves to feed the bossman, to feed his family, to feed his slaves,
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
I'm a mess now drippin' with regret from the worst damn night I've spent with you
And some decals for your fingernails
I'm knitting jumpers, I'm working after hours
You alienate yourself,
Disclaimer We should all have hope and look towards the day where a man realizes the sounds exiting his mouth are mostly complaints that a change occurs
You eat shit, you mean shit, you fucking whore
Of the mess you've made
I hope she knows
At those fearless men but few
Take out your sharp teeth
And you suck it
But not today
What were you thinking
What, what's the matter
But still you paint up a picture as if you're the victim of some kind of terrible plot
Instead I set the thing on fire
The time has come to scorch the earth
There's only one thing I can say this life is fucking mean
I fuck yo ass up
The king is back
*I should tell me not to little everyday*
Step up 'Cause you're the next one in line for the kill
There's no hope for you my friend 'cause they're coming to get you
What if he's looking up instead
I'm falling down one thousand feet
I'd like to tell you different but I can't because it's true
Make sure they won't bite you
Ich sah dir in die Augen sie war'n tot sie warn leer
You want someone to hurt like you
You did nothing
Thrown back by
Hoping you don't suck it down
That's what you wanted to hear
There's still a hole inside of us that may not ever get filled
No, I will not forgive
A round of applause, it's all that you want
Guess you'll buy a gun
Licking your wounds
Out of your mind bent on revenge
You wanted all control so
But the takings are up by a third, Oh So
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Put it in my face, I'm gonna do it every time
I'm so tense, gasoline machines can't save me now
Wage war on the bastards
They don't care and it's just not fair
You wanna be a woman like a man
Nothing's sacred in the faces of
'Cause I need both my hands
You tell yourself
And I emerged the chilling stranger, my friend
Shoot planets, don't get frantic
My dead eyes
You're never around when I need you
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody even wants to know
Like how to deal with despair or someone breakin your heart
This is a war
But I will not weep
Pervert flesh on a plate
She likes the things that I like 
Ask a fellow waitress
All y'all club managers uh huh
He'll never change he's just not there
I see right through your soul
Turned into a ball and chain, mmm
I saw horses fall
But it's, my life
Well, I've never recovered but tonight betcha that whatcha
Prends conscience de mon manque
Truth is truer these days, truth is manmade
Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby, bevor du gehst
I'm sure somebody find you tied up in this bag,
My skin is not a football for you
I've learned to stand aside
My heart aches to bleed
Every karaoke love letter, lyrics undiscovered
Brought up as peasants at the bottom of the hill hobroken's only view a mountaintop rubber plant the factory whistle blows twice every day smokestacks make the skies black so thick I could hardly see I ain't gonna waste away for the price of steady pay townsfolk look like zombies gotta break away got no welcome mats you leave no coming back wasn't the first to take the same old crap this town no one leaves this town no no one sleeps so uptight no one breathes this town ain't for me don't give me no lip 'cause I quit the hometown if that's all there is keep it for yourself I've had a lot of steady jobs I've had enough another day's too much gonna pack it up I'm city bound catch the five fifteen out going to the coast hobroken nightmare used to be a dream hobroken nightmare gotta break free
Tried to fuck me from behiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind
Will it help you to sleep well at night
La vera storia non la insegnano
Cocksucker take one for your team
This song has not yet been released
I shoot the lights out
People just pretending, that's a let down
Holding hands
Don't need you to tell us we're good
I don't know what you've been told G
Rough shit, don't even attempt sleeping
All of a sudden, this picture I painted just turned ugly
Fear is how I fall Fear is how I fall
Stimulate my heart 
Rotten like a crackwhore, begging out the backdoor Show us what you're good for, post it to the noise board
I'm here to stay and you need to hear
'Cause now I see the destructive power of a lie
Jump kerosene, now what do we do
Whizzed past his kid and his wife
You're in the dark, so I'll turn on the light
To rise above all the dirt and grime
If you take a look at my life, you'll see in my eyes
We love hate
And I am not afraid of snakes
How you loved him 'til you hated him and made him cry for mercy
Sucker Sucker Oh, sucker
There's no telling how long I'll be here
I hate the song they sing
Peel away the shell and we're from the inside
The one thing I can stand up for is resting supine on the ground
To say that you wanna
I got a piece of shit from 
Third person in the inner monologue again
I'll be massive conquistador
Somebody getting' killed from that sewer in her vein
I don't need your sympathy
Don't give me your nothin'
From earthly gods not heaven,
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
We doin' this shit hell motherfuckin' yeah
Evil, evil, we who would kneel, evil, evil Evil man
Now it's everybody's problem that you're unhappy, oh, come on
My mind to distress
Also lasset uns freun
And you deny me of my needs
What you need to breathe
All hail the mighty father
I'm hostile for the people, for those devils and corruptions
You little fucker
And I will never know you're gone
They take you to a restaurant for a feast,
Hell bound, wretched eternity
Rest assured but not assured, all is well, but I think we've dealt
And mother please shine down on me
No need  I've burned enough times myself
And I know that God had something to do with it
Ain't you, mama Imma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm breaking myself away from that chain
And she walked along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Holy matrimony is not for me
Now it's nothing but ruffage for lunch and punchlines for dinnerfeed me
Sie konnten nicht mehr lachen sie warn müde sie war'n schwer
Here now alone with all who love her
Instead of ring around the rosie, we play hide from mommy
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
MCs I be warning them
So when it's blackhawk over the glass walk,
Leave the angels in the city
Shitty little sick kid, the Gipper's hitting for dolo, now I'm rarefied
J'attends que l'espoir prenne mon temps, baby
I know who you are
I hope I get to sleep tonight
I don't need your contradictions
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone that's my word
Here they come it's closing time
Enough of this world
I don't wanna go to sleep
Well I'm still working to make life better, though I've fallen from God's grace
It's a long way it, it takes all day"
I'd like to go back  years
With a dick
When I come home I be smellin shit and furnitures moved
Shook her head to see him snoring in his sleep
It seems you would say I was too softhearted
I'd date him with no prob And if he wanted to I'll let him beat the pussy with no condom"
What about all the shit you've done to me
Because this is not my trip 
I am so full of these feelings
Alltagstragödien in benzinhaltiger Luft
Eyes of fire staring back at me
Anatomy of my pain
Tell me why  tell me why 
You'll never find a fucking fingerprint
It's a miracle I haven't fallen through any cracks
Show me my leader and I'll pledge obedience
You little punks think you own this town
 He's the head of China He's the head of the Revolution of China
The lawyers work in shifts
Check my slant on it, give me a beat and I'll dance on it while you act robotic
Yeah, not even if sober
Yes, take me deep inside so I can heal your pain
Tut es mir leid das ich nicht härter zu dir war
At the end of that dead end road
They got an army bigger than Dday
This is my body, this is the blood I found
Cause you like, all of the rest man
Get me out, please hear my prayer
Knamsayin, word up Make it make it a record real quick, do yo' thang
The whole goddamned day in bed
You my peoples when I see you I embrace you with love
Their existence is a crime
So please don't waste my time kid
Tell me, how do you sleep
There is never redemption, any fool can regret yesterday
And now everyone LIES
Hopsin
In ground, what a broke head
Empty arms and an aching heart
Bang bang, down another casualty
I spend hours in front of the mirror, making my hair elegantly disheveled
You followed footsteps in the dark
Unplugs its life
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
Just how to make my world turn black
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
I tell ya right now
To raise my middle fingers up and say "fuck you"
Feeling like I'm drowning and feeling all dried up for what
With the fear for far too long
All that tangled talk
And I'm a make sure nobody ever signs with you again
Ok the rotary phoner grow to be notably mobile
Cause now I know this isn't at all right
Take a souvenir and stop your staring
To waist this love on no one no no time for you
And save your lie about needing to be free
Just to make ends meet
I go ahead, never, never turn back
And now I know I want to kill you like only a best friend could
And neither do the  hired sheriks that examined me
Yeah, gather round the sound
As the pinnacle  lyrical master  queen of disaster
Near me now, the demon's son
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
How do you pay for war
I never set out to exploit another,
And I cannot sleep without the radio
It feels so good to say what I want 
These scars won't heal
Tonight two great ships will pull back to their ports
I just want to scream
Of color she left in your black and white field
You're right where you always wanted to be
Pick up the phone fucker
Why the fuck are you looking at me
I go by many other names
Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh it's cool now"
The clouds will part and the sky cracks open
Bet a mil that I slaughter, serve niggas, give a fck what you ordered
You know it never meant much to me
It's time for you to choose the bullet or the chapstick
One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
Ambulances were picking them up That's what you get
He's not listening to a word now
Say hey Mr driver man, drive that thing fast
Daddy only stares into the distance
Take a lil bit of this a lil bit of dat
I put my faith, my faith in them
Lying on the floor and waiting for the break of day 
Save me, save me, from my, my hell
A handful of pills
I got fed like a fish full of open smiles
No one will accept all of me, so the fire will stop
All the searing smoke and the blinding flash
Monsters in my eyes today
The days keep dragging on
Hey rabbit
Makes my life a war, What a bore
How can a bed of roses hurt so much to lie upon
Where was God when I needed a friend
Denn um die Sicherheit im deutschen Staat
The way you left me for dead
I don't care if you're ready or not
And fuck ups and fake ups
Otan sinut vastaan hymyillen, kukkia kaduille sirottelen,
As what you hold
Nigel is not outspoken 
Someone's drawn tits on my neighbour's back door
And in time you'll face the darkness 
Then you go, now you're back
Sometimes my face gets pushed against the fence
Fit a hearse with a burner, whip to the church of a murder sermon
Yeah yeah yeah
If you still wanna hang
All votes invalid, use any old lie
Breathe slow, don't move 
Hey can't you see we've been fooling around
I went to your concert and I didn't feel anything
Strike Twice OK so roll
But I would walk  miles
You can't begin to consider the palpable hate in the air when you're here
Thinking you could get away
You were only four, but lord you remember it
Despite all the earth we feel
Beat me to the ground
And when you got no one we'll give a fuck,
Stumbles towards a dark figure on the other side of the street
Our Kingdom is slowly falling down the stairs
Shut your mouth and open up your eyes
Why do you, you wanna break my heart
Will I drive out in the night
All this shit I'm seeing
Falling inward 
Daddy, daddy taught well
Choking chicks and sodomy
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you
It kicks my humble heart around
Should I feel grateful to play
You're always in my way
Do it now, do it now
Now I gotta stand with the Glock in my hand
Someone killed
Wish you'd would shut up, you'd shut up, you'd shut up
This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean
I'm visualizing battlefield scenarios
Always gotta scream and shout
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
Under our noses
You lost interest, you lost your spine Whoa
If everything you said to me was a lie then,
Sweet kisses, baby ain't even know she was your mistress
The plans for revenge have all been detailed and laid out
Your race is burning the pavement
But what it is I don't know
You know, she lives in Room 
You make the same mistake
Knocking before passing through the doors
That it's all your fault
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
Don't wanna think about the new armed forces
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you
You can't find a good man that's so sad, I think it's because you act so wack
I feel it in me, so overwhelmed
How does a man begin  fall
I'm gonna piss in her face
Can I give you my loss, to feel, to hold close
There's no such thing as space or time
Reflexlaugh if you wanna
First figure ankes the body of Christ and all almight
How can you doubt a love
In the neighborhood you thought about repenting
Nigga die slow oh oh oh
When corruption rears its ugly head
But there's nothing in this world, nothing in this world
People from around the world
Well the clock's heart it hangs inside its open chest
We're innocent
Hound crow hold onto your hat
But in a society so sick
Nothing matters anymore, at all
And I want it bad
It's Payback
And blessed by the lord
Yo what the fuck do you mean kick rocks, man
So they put him in chains
Live by the gun
As though a thought stole you away
It's in your head
I ain't snappin' my damn fingers to get in the game
Climb, but they're not mine
Don't leave me, I'm bleeding,
I remember when we met
They said, "We're not going to protect this heart you have"
Another love has reached the end
That red diesel you like
What about the times you said no one would want me
You don't know who I am I'm not your friend
It's a dirty game so whatever is effective
Pipes smoking litter in church, valiant and thought provoking
With the bitchass styles I hit you like Deacon
Remember the , pound guy on Long Island a couple years ago, had chest pains, and they had to cut a wall out of the house to get him to the house to get him to the hospital Folks, that's the first sign When you're calling the construction crew before you call the hospital, STOP FUCKING EATING "Look, I'm having chest pains Knock this wall down here Yeah, get a crane and a dumpster to take me to the hospital And then, uh, call ahead to the hospital, get some walls taken out over there, and get me a dozen donuts, cause this fucking virus is killing me, it really is"
From one another, no one should ever come in between us, between us and our love
II feel like I'm losin' my mindmind
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
Always comes back for more
Wack MC's have only one style gun buck
Make you hazy, make you lazy, drive you crazy
Disregard for bone and flesh
The ground
Who brings this down No, please don't let me,
I don't know what I can believe anymore
And said "My friend you're not allowed to vote"
So warm in here
You wanna spar
Make him shut up, man Stay right where you are 
Forced removal of the people
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em
And I'm taking more
Just let me have my fun tonight
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
I won't remember
You motherfuckers don't even know do you
And I'll learn to take what's mine
Put them to bed
Voting doesn't work I have seen
This ain't a record
Controllable
Apocalypse now
It's run in the family, hey yeah
In my hands I hold the proof
I've got problems of my own
I don't bother to use my brain anymore
Get paranoid when you hear my Glock clickin'
Okay, okay, okay
I have known that nothing's fair
Don't wanna give them a reason to despise and hate
Sideways eye on a sinister boundary
Once I swore I would die for you, but I never meant like this
To hate me for standing there
Nigga fuck all your cheddah
I only wanted you, to open up your eyes
I know I know
Hey hey yeah, be a bigman or bleed
To steal your heart for good
Cunts are still running the world
YOUR institutional learning facilities
And surrender
'Cause now I think I'm at your mercy
Hold no sway with me now she's my intended
And fuck you, fuck you, love you
And I always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
Uh, Harlem Underworld
This means war
Promises of a better life
Show y'all brothers how you not a gorilla
Can't be real no more, your mask is skin and bone
She's got her perfect friends 
Hey, who wants to party
You have enough problems of your own
But thanks to Reaganomics, prisons turned to profits
Now I'm stronger than yesterday
I'm feeling fine with myself I'm feeling fine with myself
Stay gold
That didn't make any sense to me
We never get respect
It also sucks we had to share the month of June
I let you fool me
I'm a climb the game till I'm on the top of it
Tragedy
Your pretty little ass
But nobody in it there but me
Do you know what they steal, what they steal from you
Your life is over, your life is over
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
The rage of Angels
But we've got no future
Don't talk to me about being free
I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that
How am I supposed to sing
Burn the flag with a FAG
Now I know, now I know now I know, now I know, know
Do you know how they prey, how they prey upon you
I will not put on a smile
Si on a l'malheur de l'ouvrir, elle sera nous faire taire 
I turn into the wind
And filled up our garden with snow
Why you and not me
I try to extend the line 
I can see the end
Whisper "I know who you are"
Like rockets from the crypt spilling the festive morning beverage of your preference,
Beat the shit out of someone so you can get paid
It's getting colder, it's too cold
Stomp Box speak my thought
All my friends are broken, too
See I'm just critical of living like a criminal
You deserve a broken heart
You take two steps back
I'm not all right, but I'm OK
Say you want to leave 'cause this relationship failin'
But you know
You can say I have a bogus mind
Don't gimme that noise
And in the bare workshop they'll be molding plastic into little prosthetic limbs
Peep the break down If tapes cost  ,
And give him two from the barrel of a black guerrilla P Dog
It's like there's nothing there to lose
With my arms around your chest,
I remember, yes
See my thoughts  and see my scars see my clothes  I dress to kill
Lying half dressed
Business men and money spinners rape the earth for gain
And sugar land express what you know it
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
Dust to dust, earth to earth
I'm gonna work the straw
How to sustain myself in storms
I said suck, suck suck
You gotta bullet in your fuckin' head
I'm maybe someone you've never met from across oceans changed over night
You walk in and see two kids on the floor
Out across the city
Bad milk runs in your gorge
Don't need you to say we suck
Sacred cows are headed for the slaughter
I'm left with a problem now
How do I mend my heart when I feel so low
Your mouth is like an open sore
And now I'm
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
Watch them flee, hiphop heads
Miles of flat neon spelling wellknown names
And it leaves you with an empty feeling
If fire is the passion I only aspire to be free
A reduction of their stance to some kind of earthly hell 
Was the same as it had always been 
Through the veinses of the fiends,
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
She stares at him so madly 
This school's a living hell
Evil thoughts is creeping through my mind
Before he has a chance to get in the driver's seat
Unemployment rising fast
Who we gonna look to now
Talk your shit like my life is some kinda game
Where the future is clean, the dope is free
Now I know you're having fun
I had happiness and now I'm just about
For that sound of your voice
A passing phase of quiet indignation
With so many light years to go
For nothing that'll rock the boat
Eres un artista y no un guerrillero,
Oh my god, someone kill me
You're in violation, you cross the line
I was thinking about my dad
One more time before the feeling fades
I don't wanna be up or down
Give me a reason to purify my mind 
'Cause it's my world
Saying sad things that don't make sense
He feels so damn obvious that he must be glowing
Pretending your war
Spitting on all that make us sick
NOW now I'm God
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
But those days are gone forever
Hello, this is Bushwick, motherfucking Bill
It's in our soul, on the road, wherever we may go
They don't care, and that's not fair
They cannot take my life
I will burn your love letters in a parking deck
Oh how I wish I was somebody else, baby
I may be a little twisted, but I swear that my life is fine
Never thought twice about holding your tongue
I just can't stand the things you do;
I try to hide but can not find
The will to deny and I'm standing in the dark all over again,
I'ma leave how I came screaming covered in blood
A fickle incision from the hand that fed you in the first
I sleep to dream and dream of sleep
What double up, y'all gotta feel us
Do you hear the sirens scream across the city
So I want to kill this waitress
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
I'll be your noise
And I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
When all we need is something true to believe
Now what I spit, it's medicine for the sick
I want you for my wife
Or shut me up, because it won't work
It's like a fucking drug deal
All the lies deceit and arrogance
When we ride  on our enemies
I'm never coming back
I wanna do you favors
Watching the tyranny with sober eyes
When I got to break you off some
I've got this feeling deep inside,
Voice in my head, voice in my head
We'll drink and dance the night away, drink and dance the night away
Before the veil could part our embrace
Now lift up your fuckin' dress, where's the rest
I realized my idea was wrong, dangerous and foolish
You gave him your blood and your warm little diamond
For the vibe in the back of his jeans
Thuglife niggaz I'm out on bail
About the art of people leadin'
You never learn
I'll take you and I'll play with you
Can barely walk tha city streets
But you're always parting somewhere
I'll take a knife to 
I ain't fuckin' with it
And niggers know I'm blowin' up shows like a terrorist
Leave me feeling ill at ease
To fleshcolored Christs that glow in the dark
Said, they pack the , they fire it at the prime time
And all this empty space that you create does nothing for my flawless sense of style"
Wild 'cause you left me here
This is the new fucking millennium BRAND NEW AGE
When there's nowhere left, this crutch is broken
I am just so sick of thinking my head is broken
To fight the war on drugs
I'm�just�a�thirdrated�star�covered�in�blood
Sick, sick
The birds still sing
Until you're somebody and then they want to be your friend
And there's always someone on hand
It's unbelievable what they'll put you through
The memories that you select
Now I'm dealing with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian
Whose truth is your truth
You and I are like when fire and the ocean floor collide
But I can't help what I feel
I'm being dragged down, for how long I don't know
Once upon a time, there was this group of dusty ass motherfuckers
With the help of the president 
I'm a kid with a vision runnin' a label
But they got me if they need me then it's on G
In each stranger's face
No bodies felt like you
They press auto, and you kill it with an automatic
So I surrender to impulse
And to kill another child of the flag
Everyone is sleeping under one tonight
I don't trust you
I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
Someone to understand this misery
Everything around you turned to silence
Your surlyass uncle, counting dirty cash
Wolf Gang Fuck everybody else nigga
The empty movements
I gotta know the truth
Blow a motherfucker to smithereens
And told him to kill that man
The hammer and sickle
As the shells just kept on falling
And don't be sensitive and angry at the shit that I wrote
Ain't a god damn thing
With the clouds that fall with poison
If that's what you wanted to hear
I fuck yo ass up fuck him up
Oh shame, shame on me
I know that it never goes away
Why do you say we're night and day
Why are you falling falling
What's the matter if they're crazy till you hear what I've said
What I want from you, is empty your head
For the last living rock king
Ladies know how it feels All my ladies know how it feels
But it's ok we've got old blood and our hair is woven to the same hotel again
I'll hittem with tha bum rush
My mother ain't have a job, poppy was on his grind
Ah, this thing's run amok, this luck
Honey from the movies, south notch cutie
Brothers from the bayou, so why you wanna trip
And there I stand in the middle, and I was
Can there be another outlet
Our lives run different ways
You can hang out with your friends, that is if you had any friends
You, you, you oughta know
So doctor won't you pull the fucking plug Won't you cut the cord
I was half the naked distance between hell and heaven's ceiling
And more music for the people
Je ne prononcerai
Jesus fucking fucking Christ
On a grey morning to the south of here
Wanna take your calls in the other room
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Screamin fucking bloody mess
Stole a car, shot a cop
Can't stop
Vicious mindless violence that offers nothing new
Little punk is the product of an inflated market
You son of a bitch you're gonna get some
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more
And says, "I got mine but I want more"
Karma killer
I wonder how much pain it would take
Pulses through my veins
Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody that, I'm actually gonna do it, or that I believe in it
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
Pass the eight, sack of shake
We are advertisements for agony and pain
We had a chance to change our mind
I was PI to the motherfucking MP WHAT
Tell all your lies while I bleed right through
Now she's gonna make it out ok, but she's shaking like a revolution
And I feel your warm sun on my face
But I can cry as long as money's seen
Lick my legs I'm on fire
She run, run, run, run
We've always been like worlds apart now you're seeing two nightmares collide"
We can drown in mediocrity, it feels sublime
Look ahead now
Disrespect me  my potency is deadly
The crosshair in my eye, a vessel to god
To scrutinize what we call fate
They know I'm tight but I be conceited if I admit it
Eat what you are while you're falling apart
Come on, come on now don't you
Dear Lord, lead us back into the Valley of the Shadow of Death,
That I would even show up to this fake shit
"Folks I know you're all dying to know how long
And four, four, four for my headaches
Swallowed by the river
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Well, they wanted my brandnew phone with all the pictures of the kids and the wife
All the king's men fell down on their knees
I will not say I'm all right for you
It's the end, exgirlfriend
Oh gonna pay for mine
I'm holding this world
Great white death
Over the heartache that they say
City in ashes City of Baghdad
They cannot take my rights
Why can't we sleep always
From guns given to my people from my own kind P Dog
But to understand
This ancient operation, extracting part of the brain
Can you take this life
Baby no half stepping no baby
Try to blow her right out of my head
Bullet the blue sky
When I looked into her eyes I cared enough to wonder why
You said you didn't like my voice so I kept my jaw steeled
Guess I didn't cut you deep enough, to bleed, to bleed, to bleed, oh I see
And I'm twisted brown from all of the bullshit that I've been through
I am a ghost, you are my host
And he's leaning against your front door
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your grace inside
It's a long way it, it takes all day"
After losin' every battle
Just wanna take something, something
Can you remember how it felt to be alive
And you know we're right
Can't get it back, wish I was dead instead
And I can't feel it
Keep putting on the play
Was it holy as you hoped, at heart, at the core
Different in so many ways
*Laughing* "I understand that time is running out"
All my problems are for me
Sell out whitey liberals who hang with blackie sinners
Do not give them the best of you
You could have stopped it
Start out playing with yourself 
Obnoxious until they shoot me on the day I retire
So honey gotta help me please
I place myself in your hands to fall
So please make up your mind
So I run into the hall
You fucking pig, now you die
Thrown out the temple, noncalodic wit the father
All the little things that make me run away
If ya know me then you know we pop away
I wanna taste the breeze of every great city
 Stupid black owners are foreigners to affairs of the heart
Looks like the city's done it to us again
I've got to get out of my skin
Look at me while you still have those beautiful eyes
When chickens get a taste of your meat, girl
I'd like to break his neck, if I may
See me in C town and roll with the V east six east town
dizendo que tudo vai acabar
A bullet in the head
To bring the dark upon the light
Without a reason to believe in something,
On the wrong side of bed
What's perfect for you is like a hell for me
It's brainfog
I know it's your child I'm carryin' in me,
And spent night after hammered night getting back my mind
This is how a heart breaks Can't take it no more ooh
So tell me who do you think you're defeating
He's a hipshooting exoil king
But the whole fucking system is twisted
Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet
You Hippocratic, messianic
Beat that my heart skipped when we first met
Who will taste you when I'm gone
These precious things
If it wadn't for me where the fuck you'd be
I'm wishing I was back in utero
Answer me where I stand
Motherfuck a war, that's how I feel
I'm comin' home and I'm gon' be kinda pissed
And club owners yeah
Gnash your teeth Like a flamingo swarm
The whole world hates you
There's no truth left in your voice
Sayin' such a shame
'Cause your beef is mine and we're one and the same
Click your fucking heels, there's no place like home
I rubbed it out and loved the spot where it were missing
I would have made us a killer movie
In places that you sleep
But she don't do it that wayay, no
"You been screwin' the milkman," he says
Not making a sound
And outside my city is bracing
Never is enough for you
Girl I wana know why your bailin'
Grease back their manes, for our own sake
I know that you got it in you
Just break me shake me hate me take me over 
You and Me, I'm that same bitch
And ah, the awkward way
My mind comes beaming like an early sunray
I've been falling out of time, but I want you to hear
I was determined in Chicago
Where you stop and I begin, and I'll
Life is for the living, love is for the giving
Don't want a thing from you
And with all I've seen, I've finally made up my mind
No, it doesn't really matter anymore
Come on, come on baby let me shout shout let me shout
One�day�I�will�fuck�your�parents
No holding back now
The red gash runs through this land
In my pocket like a thief and there ain't no honor
Daaaaamn homie, in high school I beat the shit out of you and your man homie
Face the truth 
For the wise men and the fools
'Cause I'm out on motherfuckin' bail
The tragedy of infant hearts
I heard something peculiar said
You'll always need me much more than I need you
Oh my eyes, it cannot be ; He said no, it cannot be
And all my friends are gone
The clergy they come in stand up now, stand up now
But now it's time you take a look
I don't believe in TV
Now I'm flirtin' with death but never been more alive
Use and abuse you like she's always used to
I've been taken to looking back
So, you ask me why no one stays together anymore
The more I want to punch your face
Seven sweet disguises, seven ways of serving Thee
He's a heap of junk that pours from his top drawer
And as a land we clean our minds, reap our belongings
I follow my heart, it leads me far from you
But you won't have nothin' you'll see
Oh Oh Oh did I tell you you're divine
You say I'm going to die when you tell me
Its only life support is an idle screen
The death of millions is just a statistic
Somebody better save my soul
Still walk these hollow grounds, bein' lost but never found
Crawling in my skin
It's that I recognize your offwhite lies,
She says on her way out the door
It'd be the last day I was happy
"He's been shot" "The president is dead"
I find it such a shame
It's funny how a morning turns a love to shame
They say that everythings free
And you know what the truth is
Tha masked screaming land or death
I need the buzz of a sub
This hotel room feels more like a tomb
Now there's nothing left for me to do except die
Let me die inside
I can't sleep
If you're here cause you want to be entertained
Dirty enough, I got me a love
What ever poison's in this bottle will leave me broken, sore and stiff
Fourth day, five day marathon
It's like all of Franklin Avenue now sleeps upon my chestmy chest
What the fuck I look like, saying I'm sorry
And I've been thinking about moving away
Toss your bear a goldfish
With a bullet in your gut
So all you intellectuals
Ein wilder, starker Tiger,
I couldn't find what you needed  ooh to be a double
With our arms crossed and our fingers locked
I can't stand the looks on their face
He left me all alone to work the riddle out
Star no Star
All those callous eyes
I am sold by a lie
Waiting for the love that's not delivering
Who cannot pass a sixthgrade reading test
I have no favorite rapper because all you suck
Are memories of me
My eyes 
Profit profit, nigga I got it
You're the ones that kill your babies
That there ain't no more breath in me
And gave it to a bird with nothing in her beak
I'm only killing the only haven
I KNOW For He dwells in me Everybody listen got to tell you something
It breaks my mind
Each day gets more and more like the last day
What about the times you yelled at me
I want to help you, but you've got to say the words
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
It enhances Human metabolism, increases respiration rate and raises blood pressure
How many guys have you let bone you Uh Let me guess, you don't have no clue huh
I'm not the one who caused the problems started long ago
You promised me another life
An animal
See this game that we playing, y'all playing to lose
All lies
Something happened to change your mind
But there's no one buyin' and there's all this doubt
The time in the world
Your reaction's kind of odd for a kid who loves to nod
Selfishly walking through killing the angles
Eternity putting innocence to the test
Smiled so much they failed to take a breath
For the bible tells me so
That's my headache brother, don't you worry 'bout me
I don't wanna be dead
Never take your call when you're nobody at all
These words fall short of our last goodbye
Taking some notes and then I write the song
These, these precious things
Now highways turn to tidal waves
If the wife and me is fussin', mister that's our right
Mike G, crusty ass
So make a fuckin' difference in these apathetic names
The dead are rolling over
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
Indent your forehead with hot lead
Taking you on a ride to the other side, check it
You are a liar
In the tired veins forming From the Tigris and Euphrates
We will show you your future and choke the air from your world Choke, choke, choke
Without the threat of death
Come on, try to shut me up
For reasons I don't know why
To silence the dissident hiding in us all
The answer already known
Conquering new ground at last
Chanting in the darkness for just one taste
I am a clenched fist
As one quits another nitwit hits
'Cause by the time they find a lead release, your shit is ancient
I'm gonna make you my bitch, but now I understand this
'Fuck you, man'
Your deceptive games
Your faded face is so irate
Women and kids of all ages, 
I have died
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
The ticking hands of time
Uhhuh big time hustler, snake mothafucka
What does it matter
Who can make me feel like shit
And like you think about who I am 'n' shit
What my niggaz want blood we stay callin niggaz bluff
I grab the mic and bag your wife
Did I fuck up
Don't sit upon a pedestal and raise your voice
Dr Dre Hello perculatin keep 'em waitin
In your bedroom eyes
It's just another scary story to me
Till you eat out your heart still beating
Am I not everything you need
There would be no light
Like it's all real, when it's a lie
Is so fucked and wrong with our generation
At least when you cry now
But I got a plan I got a plan
And he looked at me out the corner of his head and he spoke
Ah yeah, what Ah yeah
Yeah, I don't want you to be alone down there
Something to believe in
They want in
And as the knife undoes the slice it closes back up
And I wouldn't work for you
No need
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world
Make it big by showin some ass
Knowing that I feel sick
Find another place to start this over
How I've waited for today
That the day might come where I'd forgive what you've done
Line the roadway north of town
Giving birth to maggots without the sense to become flies
You have no idea how right my head is screwed on
And God himself will reach his fucking arm through
I want the world,
There was a chance you'd surprise me
Love that perfect frown, honest eyes
Wem gehört die Frauenstimme
Child abusingturnedsatanic
Scream a little bit louder for me baby 
The swarm is flocking to the wound
You know it's me
I move inside my vein 
Since you're in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck
Many ways
I don't need your sympathy or apologies
Of the day of doom, baby
You're a star now, I am fixing people's nails
Not a damn thing
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
Yeah, I'm like Mark David Chapman with a Salinger book
Bam Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
Great future, safe life, money, abundance
And put her in my claw
Shootin' on the run
Nothing left to tell
Do you know what it means to feel like god
Miten susta tulee noin ärsyttävä ääni
Baby's got a problem
Spend one more day backed into a corner
Every other day you probably prayin' when you walk to the newstand
I'd play the good guy
It's better not to holla back
Seein niggaz havin' a good time, so I'ma ruin it yeah
While you were selling your soul
So here's to our collagen lips and saline tits
And there is no warning, I'm not ignoring
I made up my mind
Now I got you sittin' back with a smirk
You won't have to feel that anymore
I didn't want to be this creep
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
Hey, deceiver  I'm relieved I am
Always the same old taste, just new injury
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
In the state of mind
Clenched to smash power so cancerous
While Bush old ass on TV playin' golf
They puttin' niggas on the front line
It's the bitter root it's twisted inside
I lololove the taste of hops and malted barley and beer
I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
From which side of the barbed wire
It's always been a task with such low impedance
Fuck's wrong with this nigga man
I want to call you names and start a fight
The chirps, I turn them into screams
For you to take your ass and move it to
I've heard you're a man
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Lick my licks of desire,
Kiss it on the face and send it to God
This is not your culture
But you were so young, don't you feel dumb
Never me they will fail to see
Frauen an die Titten fassen,
The picture of what he wants to portrait wants me by Hid Spirit to associate
But stop talking 'bout it
I don't play the same games you play
I'll cry about this
Still hear you screaming
Interconnected Then one day one of the created decided to question the
But you know what I don't I don't think so
But since you've been gone
Get the fuck up out my way when I pass through
Your thoughts and deeds can't be undone
And I reside in the art of many a artist
How they fall to their knees,
When I am queen I'll have my way I'll make it drowning dollie day
Kick rocks
It's not what I stole
Sigh future at hand
Like I said, it's a brand new payback
For pissedoff kids waitin' for desperate shicks
Yeah I won't sit in your misery 'cause the phonecall's gone and no one's comin'
EazyE's wife's life is somewhat now jeopardized
Angels fuck and devils screw
In every look upon your face
Big Yeah yeah
And I am whatever you say I am
And pretend that we're
If I thought y'all niggaz really wanted drama
I'll tell you why, you ain't nothing
I've just about had, just about had, just about had enough
Oh, There's a funny feelin goin on
Fuck 'em and their law
I can't get enough and you know it's righteous stuff
The scenery that she sees in her soul doesn't match with the blur in her brain
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Heart beat just a little bit faster
I really wanna
It feels like insanity
And all the tears that we have cried we'll suck back in our eyes
How come that bitch just paged me you don't know
Now I lay me down to rest
Too many times you suck yourself out of the scene
There's no way to turn it back, you're never gonna be the same
I think you got a low self opinion man
You need to quit swingin'
And when the fan is on it sways, gently side to side
He must be happy in his work 
Don't turn around
So don't be surprised if you mind when you find me
Unwanted children
No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy
I'm the last head you should ever try to fuck with
My brother's blood boils in my arms
But now I'm, now I'm, now I'm just cold inside
Nigga, you couldn't get signed if you talked to deaf people
One love is a crooked lie
Questions I have answered, you are still asking yourself again
Everybody slips and falls
Don't wanna think about the fall elections
For the next killing thing
And it's always something else
She took my eyes and she put 'em on her somehow
I don't give a fuck
You want to keep me held inside your cage
'Cause it's takin' over my head
To remember how it feels when I am with you
When there's nowhere left to run to
I hesitate, only to fail
I smilesmile, tired, I walked a thousand milesmiles
I've always loved you
And how much time do we have left before it's midnight and
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Not like yesterday
Explaining changes nothing
I'll stand right up
Pick up the bones
Fuck fuck fuck
I found out one life just ain't enough
Reeling and stumbling, I've got to bump around a while
I want to shovel all the blame
Three chords in your pocket tonight
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel
Let them get ripe Ripe and take a bite Bite
Does anybody see him
Do you know how they play
Don't try to be someone that you're not
The Day turns to Night
Oh you take what is not yours to take
But corruption has a chance
Pullin' out a silly club so you stand
I know I'll break some time
But here the sun will always shine always shine
And the ride's dark
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
You keep on saying that you want to know me
'Cause all you want is television
What if god is just an idea
Seventeen in the dark outside a party
Because we've got no future
When there's blood on the streets
That sounds like crap to me
So when I found it on the bathroom sink
Love songs always make me cry
We may appear as barking dogs
'Cause I'll push the fuckin' button and get it over wit
You break it
Remix that gona make ya head swell yo
And you will never know I'm gone
You fuckin' biggots, you fakes, you wannabe's
We're at the horse and cherry, your race is blowing these rooties,
To spit in their faces with your dick in the dirt dear
Give them the respect they deserve
Excessive with the heat see how I'm holding the fort, sick
The apple falls far from the tree
So close, too close, not close enough
Heroin is just too trendy
Were rock and roll bands
Yeah I said fuck you yeah yeah
When I tell you twice before
And know where we went wrong
Go home and beat your kids 
These are the things I can do without
My presence is a present, kiss my ass
Like a freaking cycle then what's it gonna be
Niggas like you probably snitch, do a nigga then get rich
I'll give you one chance to answer answer
The projection of your sick disease
It's the thorn in a kiss
To the young youth, ya wanna
You thought me of me, yeah
It will always be
Traces of unseen love rivals
And the pages kept on turning
Surrounded by chalk marks on the ground
There's so little of you left 
And yeah, I know that all I'll lose is you
I should've realized I couldn't change your mind
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh
Or any other motherfuckin' military branch
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
Acte méprisant, regardes un peu, ca devient dangereux 
But all the streets they know your name
I'd have to pack my things and go That's right
"Should there at anytime become a clear and present danger initiated by any radical element threatening the operation of the government of th United States of America, members of this radical element shall be tranported to dentention centers until such time as their threat has been eliminated  code KING ALFRED"
I like the people on TV
And it leaves me with this empty feeling
Not the grandchildren that you will never know
Chandeur peutêtre bien que je vais
You lie so much you think it's true
You can turn off and on more times
Dahmer, Nielson, Yoshinori Ueda Blanche and Pickles, Amin, Manic Street Preachers
Every little bit, every little bit
And now you're one of us
Some niggers don't even know were the ghetto is
Don't need no TV ad
I need your love right now
I never asked her not to run
I never thought that you would leave me this way
From reel to reel you run
Poison, be my guide Prepare me for my proudest work prostitute for my bride Nothing'll heal me but the severed limb, nothing will cure me like the cancer borne Fail me, fail, fail me fail me not, I suffer every eager infection
I need to kiss before I get fucked
Wrong moves and the wrong decisions
At least now I can say that I am trying
How could you tell me that I was wrong
He doesn't like your Madonna nose
We all knew there was no turning back
I just wanna know Marcus, he's a sweet little innocent boy, oh God
Oh tell me why
Back in school they never taught us what we needed to know
'Cause I can't fucking stand it when you're around
Well death is a sick way for attention
See I don't wear those trendyass dunks anymore, or them dumbass Bathing Ape hoodies
As I count the rings around my eyes
His face I could not see it clear
Don't know, not even if sober
This is it yeah yeah this is it ooh
I'm not defined by what you think I am
Crusade in the days of rage
I ignore the private calls
Did you think that this could end in bust
There's no sleeping for me, I'm losing my faith
And what I want to know, man
In this sick society
Clear hearts, grey flowers
She'd attracted my interest
I'm still asleep but I can hear the piano,
Those things I said
When I die 
Rippin' every Chronic poster on your wall off
You live a charmed life
I can tell you I like good night
Lick my legs, I'm on fire
You got a bullet in your head
Try to start again and watch it come down
I'm gonna twist your hand to stay
To inspire or asphyxiate any eyes
The players, disguised as the lovers
You gonna let me play with the pans in the kitchen mama
I'm the lost angel knocking on Satan's door
No need for safe return, is no need for your concern
Who made you the hero, who made you the judge
You get signed You're thinking, "This is great"
There's a black smoke rising, Lord
But your life's affliction is the fiction of Faust
Listen to me take some advice, you wanna look nice, trust me I'm right
Wage war on the street
And don't get offended
I want you to have fun
You think real niggas feeling your shit C'mon son
The thought to keep thinking, man
Is there a soul on this Earth that isn't too frightened to move
It's a nervewreck place to be, it kills real
And I can't forget her lips, so red
So it thick it wants to bleed
And I'll punk the pussy like I'm Ashton Kutcher
Lost by the test of humanity
It ain't hard to see that it's not that way
And you bitches
I was just about to say I'm sorry for being late,
I throw some clothes on in the dark
You say that you cannot leave
So are voices will be heard
Guess you never listened all the times I talked
I played it out, out, out, out
I better let you go man I really hope I didn't catch you in the middle of anything
I was sitting in my room and my mom and my dad came in and they pulled up 
I'm tryin' to do good, but the devil's fuckin' wit me
They smiled so much and waved their flags
I'm not quite as well
Flex the cerebellum, fire
I can now invent my engine for the hard shell truth served
Then when you're singing great
But when you need your weave done, honey read my lips
Jesus loves me, this I know
Yeah, someone left on a burned out world
All I could remember
That's right woman, let your guard down
One thing I know
But that's okay 'cause
In my head I heard the sound
All I wanted was to look real good
Using me up to the bitter end
And I say yeah
Gimme that record
Don't you bring back the reveries
To make me sing
Break me shake me hate me take me over
Unless yo titties and ya ass out
It's not the truth I say
Can't you, can't you feel it,
Y'all know the niggas who steady screaming fuck you
Or a black man after all
There won't be no collisions when they move so slow
I see your two eyes
 o'clock, roll, roll it down
No truth, no pain, no sorrow and no grace
Faut pas s'voiler la face, y 'a toujours cette angoisse 
But they'll fight like hell against raising the minimum wage
And when I'm in a dirty river
But all I want
I could go off right now 
I'll choose me motherfucker you understand
Ain't no one can stop us
Hu, That woulda been something to watch
Think votes count, well I think not
'Cause there's nothing like a midnight run
Disinformation tube fed
Most of the people failed to see
Getting too old for this shit, man, you gotta grow out of it
One, two, look back, this is where it all begins
You fuckin derserve a knife in your neck
I know it's my problem
I'm sick of trendy ass political rappers
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
"Baby you're right, but that's no excuse"
Now your world is way too fast
Real alive no god
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
So hot, so cold, so far so out of control
 tattooed on my head
I have a sex twice as big as her husband's
Ooh, you want me to take my pants off
You know how long I've been on ya
As the knife in silhouette slowly unhacks it from the ear
And that's okay
They say I'm walking on freedom, this is freedom
It's easier to lie
I've missed you about three weeks now
Dear heart, dear friend
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
For humanity, the human blasphemy
And I would walk  miles
'Cause it's die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas, still
That you cannot spend Cause your budget gets recouped
A salty taste in your mouth from blood oozing from cracks and wooly heads
On a bathroom floor
This dark hole, is so deep
Whatever is coming
Me and my mother, all we needed was some love
I should have known, my family they never did pretend
And as the sparrow sings
They'll tear out your heart, throw it neatly in a cart
So I made up my mind
I don't get enough sleep
There's a carnival in the graveyard tonight
I gotta run up the phone bill
To take this shithole by the fucking throat
I'm sick and original
You're the truth that hurts
And you can't tell anyone 'cause no one's here
See the storm  moving in
Just to see who died for the spot
I can't feel it
How does it feel to know you will be destroyed
Cosa ho dentro e fino in fondo
So why the ghetto shit
I'm such a fool I can't believe I let you in my life
I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner
You fill your mind with facts 
I had to pull myself outta this nosedive
And I am sorry
Of such enormous size
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
Where have my standards gone
Before you put my body in the cold ground
You know what
And we've got some battle
Pick your heart up off the floor with good intentions at the door
I find you here on judgement day
I can't tell, I can't tell anymore
Down a black, black river 
Everybody, everybody, everybody fucks
Outside of the lines, we're still screaming
That's come to be the human blasphemy
Stay true to yourself and your friends and never let go
e ti chiamavo la mia stella,
Blind man must have something
I don't mind seeing your face around, but we can never speak again
Always in my scene
It's all you want
DOA as his man made his run for the door
That anyone here will be thinking in modern ways
It feels good to see the disgust in their eyes
You know, curled up naked in the shower biting your knees wishing you were dead kinda happy
From our bloodless lives
Sex, death
It was there he made his bed,
I can't stand you at all
Can't hear you buried in the lies that you've laid
I'm the one closin escrow, with the best flow
In this fire we'll burn
From all the evil I possess It's almost too much
You wait for me
Of the hurt you call your own, you know, you know
Don't do this take no drink
Entranced, we danced toward the ripest display of escape
Maybe I wanna die
I wanna be sure, I wanna be clear
There's a voice in my head
Tell me, how do you sleep at night
And I'll give you an answer
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
Someday when I'm old and tired
Taking back all the words I said you
They told you not forever
It's a wonder that she laughs I guess I'll call her crying,
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews
Who never stood a chance in the world
Da verließ die Mutter den Papa 
How did I end up here
And how it fucks with my head
Dark heart news
It's gas, water, and electricity,
Oh, if only you'd grow taller than a brick wall
You at a stand, still, mannequin
And my heart goes beat, beat, beat to the music of this sad same song
Cause Lench Mob niggaz are the craziest
Hey y'all can't see a nigga like me, never in your life
You couldn't please me if you had his dick
That we have to sacrifice ourselves, the earth
I've watched the youth,
When another girl violates that Hey, oh
My nigga Earl ugly as fuck, let's have a moment of silence for that nigga real quick
I've seen their upward glances in hopes of instant salvation
Now, I'm standing in the kitchen, carvin' up the chicken for dinner,
I won't die, like Chuckie won't die, but I'm not here to socialize
Dread destiny and empty fate,
Drinking Bacardi at AA meetings, smoking an L
'Cause I've been thinking about you and me girl
Yet you know there is no answer fit
How's it feel to be a man
Without a cop harassing me, searching me
The only ugly thing about it is that you're not mine
Hey man, nice shot
I wanna do right by you
You never kissed
Monsters with no free will, just copies, with an urge to kill
And set my sight on a serpent man
He's screaming at the same blank wall
Everyday it feels like I'm stuck in hell
Gazing up to the blackened sky
We seem to end in nosedive
Something is very fucking wrong
I should fuck that nigga up when I see him
No, there was nothing I could
My sharpened knife begs to explore
City, city's
You're always trying to win these selfish games
Undressed and blesses by the lord
All that's left of my decisions be they only white or black
All you want, all you want, all you want
Frère, les faits sont les suivants  la tête endommagée 
Now the flame that burns twice as bright
Suck, suck it, suck
Because I was always taught that boy meets girl
'Cause it's all over now All over now
The juvenile delinquent bit
I sit at home and feel the sun's daze
And never let the mother fuckers tear you away from what you love
Nothin' like pain to make us all the same
I crush all the momentum that you guys build with my eyes sealed
The commanderinchief just flew by
I feel hate, I feel pain
Nobody knows anything at 
Now it's, no it's no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair
Bring in the pain
Fake, fake flowers
Stand for nothing but sit at service
This love turns to hate
And when it's gone I'm left with nothing
 I had my mind on something else
Gotta watch for my sister and my mum as well
Cheating, lying since the day you were born
Ah it stinks, it sucks, it's anthropologically unjust,
Run down and jagged and make it back
My womb is not a football for you
Wind on my skin
Get me another body bag, the body bag's full
Our gas a gas that we pass
It's time for us to take a stand
You little piece of shit
Ooh, a dirty little witch
In the grave
Let's fall deeper into sleep
People tell me what to say
Now you're dead, now you're dead, now you're dead Ah
My idea of fun is killing everyone
Dangerous music greedy greedy greedy
An advance towards the light
You won't believe what you're not told
To weed the world of their disease
"Young man, your transfer's expired Will you please pay full fare"
You mean shit to me, you mean shit
And your odds and ends
For them that think death's honesty
It was open, the door he slammed closed It was open, long ago
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
But I don't feel like dying
A discomforting extreme
Time will tell or tear us apart
Of being loved, of being human
But I'd be a fool if I say you're the one
I hope you hear it, we're in a car right now
And then Mom rushes out to the driveway
Check it, I used to be the goofy man you hounded
And I had this funny feeling
It really lets you know that you're on your own
Wanna talk about this concrete Nigga, I'm a scholar
I wanna blow it before you put it in like a Nintendo cartridge"
We're not the ones whose pollution blackened our skies
As we live and learn
I saw you as you walked across my room
I was sitting, waiting, wishing
But if the answer isn't violence, neither is your silence
I got the game the ladies all want
He's gonna start a war
Left with no TV just a couple brews
I begin to snooze
When I'm lying in bed
Please don't do this baby, please I love you
Niggas said hip hop was dead, but I invoking the spirit
You left me standing there empty handed
And burnt me up
How can you sleep at night
Exposing them as fakes
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it
Of my face
I'mma tie your knot on a Downtown building, let it tow behind me
All she wants is you
And the world is a rotisserie of pain
There slamin in the pit when I'm kickin my shit
It's too true we all have some flaws to admit to
When they said that man could fly
Flew too high and burnt the wing
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah
Like growing up pains or losing a tooth
I turn into a bird
Back in the days of shock and awe
You go where only fools fear to tread
All my life I've been waiting for this moment to come
It's killing season
Someone stop the colony
Why do I feel
Or laugh through a glass eye as they rape our lives
Does it make you happy now
Marco Polo hailed it heaven, Socrates inhaled it, too
All the pretty things that she can do with
You don't know what I need
Now a glass goes whistlin, my rap flow's switchin up
il disprezzo
Stolen land  and there's no going back
And maybe I would believe in a dream I cannot even see
Do you know what they do when you leave the room
Now you're dead, now you're dead, now you're dead
As you fight to get it done
Just try to forget those things
Hey now, all you lovers
Like a man, like a woman like a man, like a, like a man, like a man
And the earth is precious to him
Qu'avonsnous fait de nos histoires 
Kick yo ass like a bitch
But battle without war
Nocturnal television
Two million smiles and running
At pm Central Daylight Time, National Weather Service Doppler Radar detected a severe thunderstorm six miles north of Weatherford moving southeast at  miles an hour Locations in the warning include Bridgeport, Geary, Greenfield, Hinton, Hydro, Lookeba and Weatherford Hail up to three inches in diameter is likely Severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes with no advance warning
And stabbed the backs of fathers, sons of dirt
You show me you're evil inside
Your man will be here, I'll call him on the phone
I'm a God with spoon and syringe Chalk one up and let's pretend
It's gon' be hard to put me back on the course
Every day is my wedding day
Clear hearts and GREY
Motherfucker in after life
And you will feel it, feel it, feel it
I don't give a shit I don't give a shit
Who the fuck could ever
My body a temple falling to pieces
And if you don't like it then don't fucking listen
All the images turn into shadows of myself
Homie I've been good at rapping, now I'm tryna get gooder with it
Mercy, mercy I'm made of heart
Oh it's not hard too
It's painful to see I can't take it anymore
Every man must choose his path
Not now, but soon
Check the heads bow in Vietnow
And running from the ones you know
And let me play among the stars
The day with no emotion
If there's one thing you remember
Atom rocks with thoughts
Do not give them satisfaction
Today's the day our younger son is goin' off to war
Do I sit here and try to stand it
On the wild, blue road
Runs a comb through his black ponytail
A private life
Eat, sleep, fuck and flee; in four words, that's me 
How to work it, jerk it, make you go bizerk it,
Punk You playing me, chump,
'Cause we know
A train wreck maze of dirty pictures
But it's not enough these days to say sorry
The glass can't hide, my wounds will find the salt around the rim
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' Ooh 
Stolen clouds, dark beauty
Watch those little crooks come crawling back on bended knee
'Cause in the end I'm the head case you gotta face
Saber tooth tiger, run the night with the sharp claws
We will have one perfect day
No, no, no, no, I don't care at all for anything
So put another coin in and turn the crank
Call it off, sorry refused
Under darkening skies
No older woman can do it the way they do
'Cause I need you I need you
Don't get mad
If it wasn't for damn hypocrisy, I wouldn't have to sing this song
I fuckin' had enough
I got better things to do with my time
Music seems to help the pain
No bloody, bloody, bloody, MURDER
Don't keep on looking down at me
To stop lettin' my whisperin' heart control me
Because she doesn't believe him
But I can fuck you betta
'Cause I wonder who would ever not believe you
And so full of shit
I know you hate who I become
Hey you the voice of reason
You always sharpen your teeth 'cause you're like that
Oh no, you lowered your score
Cause lord knows I could use a warm kiss
Just rest
Don't you mess
Yeah, and I just made you up to hurt myself
Who would lie, rob, and hurt us
To look not quite as desperate"
Question friendship
And as the wrinkled birdman approached me
You sow this allegory for life
Vengeance is mine 
I'm not afraid of forgiveness
Just turn around and come on down
Steeped in a dream to rend the seams to redeem the rock of right
Snap the axel in half, bust the tierod
Pledged our flesh to be one
The leader of the kingdom
Only fools won't realize, you won't be told
Once it has been, the fifth amends
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name,
My head is filled with disease, my skin is begging you please
Catch me counting all day like a clock on the wall
When your number's up you gotta get up and die
I'm not the only one
You're driven to the one last flaw
But not the evidence
Looking right through the lens
I won't let you come back
I just wanted to get laid
I got nothing, Ma
Don't matter how hard you try you never weaken my strength
Offbeat heartbeats
And trembling in fear
It's about people who use power to trip on
The path chosen, surely assured
Crying out, 'Oh God, I need you
Danny Boy's arrivin' I stand six five and a half,
Hey Erased it but we saw you fake it
Bleeding now One, two, three, four
Jesus Christ is suffering upon his cross tonight
It sucks so much I get blowjobs from it
With the flames on your head dancing higher
From the firefly
Be on you like a house on fire
Just call me doctor, just call me pain
Don't wanna be up or down
The world is flat so they fall off to act on a crucifix nail
Like you love this game
And oftentimes he could be seen returning
You love this ass
So you want to tear me down
If these walls could speak
I can make a perfect picture from a voice
But quickly turns to three or four with stops at every underpass
Baby needed food and you stuck on the roof
Were both to doubt 
That you're a peace loving country and race
Nothing but the smell of the piss stains
I will not pretend
Licking your throat
No rest for cross tops in my mind
We get all different kind of people comin' through
In strange days, the wickedest ways become the norm
But you're about to need a good friend tonight
Ain't no any kind of way
So let it be known
So take all you can from an open hand
Travel on estranged 'cause you don't know your own way
And you expect me to just get over him Pretend he never existed
And I pushed through the screen door
Slaughter the daughter and kill everything
A delicate nearly transparent creation of somebodys
There are things you don't want to remember
No one came to see us so we got the hell out of there, so there
There's a space kept in hell with your name on the seat
Not that bright, not that bright, not that bright, clown
The note of nobility can go on forever
Why are you doing this Shut the fuck up
Or be the backbone of a rebel platoon
You know what time it is, so why ask
But I call it a good oldfashioned tragedy
Woman like a man, like a man, like a man, woman like a man
I fucking hate you
Right now, get down on the cement 
Back in the days of "mission accomplished"
You can't escape from death when it's close at hand
I hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record
Faithless, grungy, pathetic, wretched
Of the mess you left when you went away
I'm feeling cheerful already
The world unfurled at last
Ooh, I remember we could talk about anything
This room is a, a fluorescent tomb it's brazen bulbs mimic death's heina croon
And I am telling you that I am different
And I will tell you,  That everything comes into
This city's like an ocean
And mama told me don't hang with the homies
Faces deformed by hate
And now she puts the kid away
Come on battle
Such a shame how you could easily get trapped in a zone
não me peça para entender
I wanna see it go right in and down
She's a creature so sublime, and already be in line for the gun
The�dark�dark�Sunday,�the�blood�stains
My love  no  my love
Let me through that door
She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off
I understand your problems
As soon as look at you  go to the back of the queue
Your fate is all that you'll see
So never again will I look back in vain
Wrapped you up in masters
Oh my eyes, it cannot be,; He said no, it cannot be
You would look so magnificent crawling on those bloodied knees
I guess not, oh, I guess not
I spit the wine from mouth to cup
They reminded me of yours
Your ass smells like a rose
The curious folk who chanced to stray across this downland way
Kill Yeltsin, who's saying Zhirinovsky, Le Pen Hindley and Brady, Ireland, Allit, Sutcliffe
Well then you might as well gouge out your own fucking eyes
I feel I'm dying
Just comprehend
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it,
Where did our honor go
I'll get my sleep without tearstained sheets
And something flickered for a minute
It's not an animal
You better back off if you know what's good
'Cause I couldn't fly, not to mention
And kiss my ass
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
Stay put man, here comes
We exploit the youth, we tell them to join a gang
When you are suffering know who sold you out
Rule baby, I've been really outta control lately
You're no better or worse than me
She makes me feel like
I'd really love to break shout your heart shout
Would you bury all of my doubt
Je peux trouver des armes pour que je puisse me défendre
And I don't know what you see in him and why you let us go
'Cause every day every day
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
Never had a real good friend 
Tell the wordless message
We always seem to fall with only memories to hold
The whole room was swirling
I only stayed to break your heart
She wants to fuck delilah
You're the respectable members of
And he told me he was single
Just never bends
You're the one I want
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
There's no escape now
Massacre 
In the night they stole it, left you skin and bones  knife in your back
I don't know if I am real without you
But a head start with a little help from a friend
If parted by a river that was running deep and wide,
No, sorry won't wash it all away
carne e cannonicarne e cannonicarne e cannoni
We're passing slow, passing slow Slow, Slow
Alone in the sun for sticking it in too long
L'Etat veut notre peau, espérons qu'on sera aux choses divers 
It's now my turn to drive
A petal, another petal, another petal
Don't wanna leave you
It's all the things you thought you had
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
The sense of hate
When it was nothing but a piece of putty
I hate you more than my job
If you play your cards
You've been out there, and tried to mix with those animals
The man then falls upwards, back on his feet
Why are you such a stupid asshole Would you really like to know Well, remove your clothes and a vet will show you how You went to school where you were taught to fear and to obey Be cheerful Fit in, or someone might think you're weird Life can be perfect People can be trusted Someday I will fall in love in a nice, quiet home of my very own Free from all pain Happy and having fun all the time It never happened, did it
Maybe Tony Touch, Concord needle will scratch this
As if I don't exist, as if I'm not here
In the way and you're driving like a bitch
Take a stand
come un ramo di ciliegio
And there's a father
And tonight, tonight you prove me
Got one in the head plus a nigga's fed 'nuff said
Save my soul eternal
It looks like your kids and they okay
Money buys you 'friends' but it won't buy you fame
And I live to fight
We've gone too far  From pride to shame
Nah, bitch, not even close
Overfired
I understand
Type that in your little away message and set it
I'd probably be just as crazy about you
And ain't a damn thing funny I get money in piles
This is what it feels like "This is what it feels like"
Demande à Mégret, s'il nous voit intégré, c'fils de putain 
Sister has her headphones on, she hears the music blasting
You're still implanted in me
What I want
I know id leave myself inside
You sweep the pavement, shine the buildings, display the maid,
They stand there in the pulpit, doling out their lies,
So you better not come alone
And if my thoughtdreams could be seen
I look straight ahead
The reverend plays on the ugly organ, ohoh
'Cause if you mind your business, you'll stay busy all the time
Suddenly fists turn into brave ears
Some men rob the passersby
I see my heart
Everybody is a let down
Can't get that engine turned over
Pass me the scalpel, pass me the knife
Kansas City, motherfuckface word
And singing birds are starting up
Everyone got behind my back
And we took up weapons, yeah
But now he's tha devils friend
Come a little bit closer
I need you to hurry up now oh 'cause I can't wait much longer oh
It's just a world away from here
You, you brought the art of silent war
Don't want to fight you
In a world I divide what is good and what I do
Everybody says
I hate you fuckin'bitch, We'll kill you bitch
It may not be much
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I been somebody else instead
Sometimes I want to bash in your teeth, Daddy
I'm feelin' Pretty Baby, don't you shout
Peace in the valley of death when I rise
She wanted to go blind
Only to be killed again when I fast forward this shit later
For you to burn
Ya highness, all in ya head, like ya hair stylus
I saw Todd Trainer singing in German
 Only way you can only way you can bring it on, that by is by killing
Change the way I feel about you
'Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
Do you know what they steal
Trumpets sound when I push the program
Like a man
Now here I sit in a staterun asylum
As I move through seven levels
Leave it well enough alone
Because we have been told that if you've been assured
A part of their design An accomplice to this crime
How can you say I'm crazy
By now, I should have been somewhere
Fuck the fame, I'm still stayin' the same, lil' bitch Hello
She will never learn
The world is spinning around and around, out of control again
Taught me how to speak my mind without making it up in time
Now all I had will die with you
But if you talk in the movies
A human flesh feast
This will pass by 
Chipper little girlie at the front desk doesn't mind at all
'Cause I can't stop now Bravehearts
At least no jack and I can't hack it
Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard
Lying bleeding on a grimy street
Dismantle whatever's comin', y'all niggaz sit there and put up hoods
Have you no decency
While you had your eyes closed
She's running out
Pop trash, disgust
Come reap your reward your time has come
Here comes the war
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I will not rhyme over tracks
Love I shall not love, yet I'll still sing about it 
"Chocolates only so much shit, floating out of the snake, to the see"
'Cause I'm fucking up
I'm sick of shruggin' off your petty little ways
I want your body, not your mind,
I am not so upset about my horrible self
Of 'nearlymadeit' s
Someday I'll feel no pain 
Take your time coming back
Dancing through a time warp in your dinosaur trends
You talk about love
Ooh, you make me nervous tonight
Cheap tales of modern love, in bed with strangers
Don't wanna sing about food in Somalia
Just angry at the things that have failed you
There is no love left in your eyes
You're falling, you're falling, falling from your godlike distance
This is mine
I need you to hurry up now 'cause I can't wait much longer
Some jealous punk
But to take on the world at all angles
I don't think there's no excuse for you
Say boom, say, want keep him, keep him on his back, say
And the smell of this hell
I was a wellknown thug and I gotta lotta love
It's such a bore when I'm bringing down that horse
Before I go to sleep
The cold linoleum is talking up my shoes
No rhyme or no reason I fight to feel the feeling
I wanna be a shiny new baby with a spongy brain
If I's a clock I'd be the end of the day
They try to look innocent, but they are always up to sin
She turns to see her brother again but he's already walkin' past
I'm driving drunk like it's the weekend
Now all the things you had, they aren't the same
An eye on the doorway
It ain't on us that your life sucks,
Windows dark
OF will be done for, niggas will be dumb poor
"Jess, I still taste you, and thus reserve my right to hate you
Still I try to reach you through the darkness
While my friends have died
No one's asking to go dancing it's not like that anymore
And you're standing in the shade
Hey here's the mirror see your stupid face
'Cause without no promotion, of course sales drop
So much in fact that my lips smack with a parasite
Now Mary's got a problem and Mary's not a stupid girl
That motherfuckers don't give a damn for you or me
Everybody sees you cryin'
Why are you falling, falling
They say all good things come to an end, I wish this didn't apply
All the kids agree, yeah
Rest on my charred fingertips
Give my regards to all you shady fucks,
You have to spit to see the shine
They say to chill, they say my homey's not available
When you took a fist and knocked me down on my knee
I'm not reading that motherfucking book because a human wrote it
Hurt by a star, fucked by a star
You hear that, nigga That's cult shit right there, nigga
There is no warning, I'm not ignoring
Who ever made up open skies and two of the bluest eyes
Peeking through my fingers
I know you like it both ways
The singer of the heavy metal band from Minas Gerais,
Catch the liberty fires catalog,
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
Night clerk, door closed
Fucked up and spun out in my room
Until the frames cease to move
The fucking bastards that you created
I was turning into somebody else
We've got nothing left to do
Punk motherfuckers beef and rhyme my race
Don't give me your nothin', don't give me your nothin'
You must have learned something in all those years
Then I said I had enough
Is heaven real, is it fake, is it really how I fantasize it
And no this war was not scripted,
I'm making another delivery
I am the blackness, I am the dark 
Got me deep under the beat just it is like I can't see
I'll speak my mind when I am ready
You know, that ugly ass nigga Tyler with his bitch ass
Yo Bush I ain't your damn hoe
You blame me but some of this is still your fault
Joe the lion, yeah yeah
Only one thing comes to mind
There are some things wrong with you
Now that the smoke's gone
Talking sweet about nothing
I don't know if you do or don't exist, it's driving me crazy
When hearts, hearts, still beat the same
Selling you a little life
You're fired
Yeah, this is a song about the way things are
Don't need to waste my time
But now even if you could eat your own words you'd start a hunger strike
I'maread between the lines
Talk to me, come on, talk to me
A motherfuckin' chainsaw
No wait, I was over two years sober
I wanna break shit, run up and take shit
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
I'm out of the fire
Rip this motherfuckin' bullshit life
You just tied me to the mast of the ship of fools
Pretty melodies don't fall out of the air for me
You can't change anything in the end
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I lied to myself right from the start
We all on deck fool so put your heat up
It's easy first I kill it then I throw it on the grill
Just play the sideline kid and wait for me to slip
With your blood
We may not compromise
Or is it all the guilt inside my head
Drag my ass out of bed and stagger off to work
It doesn't matter I'll probably get hit by a car anyway
But he's standing up for what he believes in
But I know her voice When I hear mine
Fight to death
Don't think 'cause you can't see me that I'm not watching
To you it's all one big silly game
How they follow little trends to get they fame
Why don't you want me no more 
Oh, looking to the cracks,
And under my skin there's a place where she resides
I can see, you want this war, there you will find your god
Should I answer a friend's distress call
All the gold and silver couldn't measure up my love for you, it's so immaterial
You gotta get it, there's nothing hotter then it
Hoes want to be seen with me, and I like their big thick titties
That's the admiral taking in his cock
Oh no, tears galore
So just pick your head up, boys and
So our voices will be heard
Just before he died he had a toke
The only place that's perfect is in your mind
And it's a damn sight better than I got from you
Now I deserve to be as mad as hell because
When I wear my Mary Jane's shoes
Are you talking to me hey hey
Don't fuck with me
Peace now fools to trace your muse beyond the failing hand
Innocence stolen
Drown drown drown myself
Must be a clash there's no alternative
Call it response to a negative home
Now I work me the night shift, where I
'Cause I'm doin' the same shit martin luther king did
Devastator, in a negligee, does a strip tease while he sings this song
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
See, No body is interested in learning
When you start talking I hear the Prozac
You want the questions you got your answers down
Standing over your head
Prostituted like the whores of the apocolypse
Burns only half as long
This is life 
On its knees 
Then I'll turn you out for fun
I'm pissed off at the world
Like lies, like lipstick on last look goodbyes
Oh yeah, I was
Little bitch try's to sing and dance
Such a motherfucking bore
Now look into my eyes tell me do you see love
Wild wild wild wild X 
Voices from the earth
Crossing the street you look so fine
Demisomething clyde, clod, faux po'folks, wellreadneck
Damn you for not trying
You thought you could keep me from loving
He don't know how to be tender can't appreciate beauty or gender 
I'm not even legal
Just sheep always telling stories of older guys
Und die Sonne hat so stark gestrahlt, da brannte mein Verstand
For my shotgun
I disconnect the me in me
You drove me crazy with your OCD
My heart rate goes up to the top
I said I have no way of feeding you so leave
Murder murder in black convertibles, I
And I, I was joking
Camoflauge, dodgin the eyes of the hawk
I left them in Cabo,
My mind states, I rate
Nothings right
Everything I am now, but you never worked for it
As of right now
Cut yourself up and down your arms
My frown's upside down
It's really not so bad, you know, once you get past the taste, ass kisser
It wasn't ever my plan
Do my dirty work, do my dirty work
I lie steady
Let's put them in a room
Then there is no way that I can win
You fucking
Happiness inside my pain
About thinking about thinking
Piece to the strong hold, EO dub
We're smashing now, a flaming wreck
Whatever my niggaz want from me, is what my niggaz gonna get from me
The decision of a lifetime I'm having second thoughts about you for the last time
You'll look all classy with your brand new colombian necktie
And I've been told that my sinful life is an addiction
Where you think you can run, or you can hide
He's a grown man
And a desperate cry
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
Don't tell me what you're gonna do or what you wanna do
As we ask for rest
Helicopters doing flybys to take a couple of shots
I set you free, on an island of flesh
Top Fuel buck  with a finger on the trigger
The less you know the better off you are
And I don't know where the bathroom is
Verzehrende Leidenschaft  autistisches Vergnügen
Teeth in the necks of everyone you know
Look at me, I'll never own land that I work on
If she's so willing, little one, there was no chance there
Is it beautiful enough to keep you begging for more
You know you are high fivin', talkin' shit, but you're going home alone aren't cha
I'm not crazy being institutionalized
We can't go on like this no
When you're great it's not murder it's assinate
Kill them during sex, kill them during talk
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the hatred we feel
Take revenge on the world and declare your fucking war
Nigel's whole future is as good as sealed 
Blaze up on y'all one time real fast Do the mix and all that shit
And all the bitches who forget about me want to ride my dick
Bottoms up you fuckers
That's what liers always try to do, it wasn't me, 
Talk revolution
I met a man who was once on my side
There'd be no need for law
Throw in the brittle skeleton fake tomb
Yeah yeah
The truth of it all it's only face
If there were no darkness
Controller
Another asshole lights the flame
There's a little pile of ashes where my old life used to be
Put on a romantic vinyl
But you'll never see that, not without promotion
I think our moments come and if you'd feel this love
You think they're working your album You're mistaken
Keep your bullshit lies 'cause I'm
I'll never have faith in you
Watch me while I drown
I saw them fall
I never be the student ahead of the class who gets an A in his report card
I don't wanna feel a thing
Turn it on turn on the news
And get to work
You niggas a bunch of squares, Madison
I just wanna lie
I left with shaking hands, looking for danger
Girl I love you and I no you love me
When chickens get a taste of your meat girl
I know you want to jump around, but try to contain yourself
I wanna watch it go right in
My lips may promise
Get a plate in your head, lose a leg, you might get a check
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
The trusted misleader,
Madman 
And you're crawling back baby that's a given
I feel like I'm on the edge
Woman shriek
Don't know what my aim is
Bind, torture and kill
"Hey, can you open up the back door"
Behind my back, I can see them stare
I grip my mind around an existence of liquid
Alongside our people we're gonna struggle with love
While Devastator sips from the crystal chalice
Starfucker, just like my Daddy, yes
Baby what do you want from me
Even the dirty ones, you say they annoy you, they want to destroy you
And I am bone and you are glass
No doors in the building between this side and that side
Night and day I breathe
Shedding skin succumb defeat
Bless the martyrs and kiss the kids for knowing better
I've got hate running through my veins
Steal my tongue
I feel like they've been brainwashing us with a lot
Sorry That I'm taken aback
Clancy said I'm late for my flight, well he better hold on
Who gouged the notches from the family tree 
And jumped
I hope you feel better, I don't, I will not not recover
They don't see the world the way you do
Clear without fears and it knows only your name
To our family and friends and the music stores for giving us gear when we couldn't pay
Hey yeah, It's alone in my head
Feel like I've been sleeping in a
I lost my ignorance, security and pride
I've got my own eyes now and I want you to see
Second one today
So break me shake me hate me take me over 
Only someone else can show you nothing
Though I like your pretty eyes better blackened
But you only wanted undressed and defenseless
Are you clear right out of your head
Why did you leave me when I had need of your love
All the guests that's in the church, all decided to disperse
I'm not living without you
This is how a heart breaks ooh ah yeah ooh
How many times
Just a pain, pain junkie
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
Let them bleed, let them wash away
I'm not afraid of you anymore
Saturday night and the vibes right
But not hearing anymore
Every girl I meet, always talking bout "I don't even wanna know Hopsin, ewe
You're just screeching out to fate
Just 'cause I'm lonely, yeah, yeah
So we're, yeah, we're on the road 
I wait patiently
All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me
So my idea of fun
Amphetamines for boys
Gone another memory
And every key works differently
"Go fuck yourself
See how this wears me out How close am I now to another dull mystery are we the graveyard or the ghost I have a motive My motivations are a matter of faultall your fault
Another day, another knife in the back
 a yes a no and I can't think of a better way to end the day
I take music pretty seriously You see that scar on my wrist You see that Hmm You know where that's from Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm I heard the Bee Gees were getting back together again I couldn't take it, okay That was the only good thing about the 's We got rid of one of the Bee Gees One down, three to go, that's what I say, folks Yeahhere's ten bucks, bring me the head of Barry Manilow, all right I wanna drink beer out of his empty head I wanna have a Barry Manilow skullkeg party at my apartment, okay You write the songs, we'll drink the beer out of your head
Peeling furniture days
It's the emptiness that's all you have left
Scrutinizin' ev'ry li'l bit of dirt
Duplicity isn't new
We want it all
And I'm aware
No one knows, no one knows
How could you mean that she said, oh you turn my eyes so full of red
With all that money I made last year
Before I fall in too
They got no ideas in their heads
I'll make you lick my injuries,
Your life is an apology
I leave you bring up discussions on who I'm fucking
Wrapped up warm in daddy's coat
I'm breaking down
Jet black  the ink that spells your name
When fame is your game
But when they shoot you up with thorizene on crystal smoke
Keep your glass eye glued on the end of the highway up ahead of us
We demand a simple right to question y'all,
I'll sing in the forest, tear down the trees
You can watch Good Will Hunting by yourself till your eyes fall out
Fix me please
A nation army couldn't hold me back
Bladefucked
To wrestle with obstruction
I'll bring back even what's unspoken
When you stab me in the back
It always runs slow
Sex, pain, fear, freedom love, young guns be shootin
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Betcha didn't know
The shell seems so empty
In this life nothing can last forever
Don't wanna sing about no carriage horses
You got problems in your life of love
Limitless, friendless but much more together
Yeah, hook it up, make it a record, get down yo
The little young nastees, no doubt
Are back together, sleeping all alone
I'm gonna make her cry
I am a looked door looking
There is no god that I have seen
Tryin' to keep me underground, underground
'Cause I'm dishin'
Look, I'm not responsible for the lessons children learn
If you wanna make your number one your number two now
It's over it's nothing it's now
Bloodworm, bloodworm
Drunk again and all the lights are down
I keep playing your part
 I said, I said, "stop"
I'm always watching the way his wife looks me over
Everybody lights out like a Nyquil score
Don't you make me burn
Till the end of time
You spin around and disappear
I don't need to make another album, bitch, I don't gotta do shit
A bit of this stuff but not it, it moves anybody
But I know that it's not real
Karma killer
Things ain't always
Come my love with your desire
It was just the two hits and I remember nothing more
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
As I choke you
But nine, nine, nine for the lost gods
And everything else I'm burning
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
It's over, it's nothing, it's now
One drink of water and I'm
You hear no, see no, speak no no no no 
On the palm trees in the dirt
Will you fly with me tonight
I don't know what it means
All I know is the cops and my  gauge
I need another soul to feed on
We swam like rats on fire
They keep on kicking me down, kicking me down
Time is worth taking, love is worth making
I'm doing dirt like earthworms
Turn on the radio, nah fuck it
Fire fills my veins as I proclaim my resistance
I'm alone in the fight
Roots within our mother's skin
Before it turns to stone
I got some militant thoughts and you ain't killin' em'
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
Fall in your orders 'cause you don't know how to act
Of the past we don't need to follow
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
Do what you want as long as you don't come back
'Cause we can not give back those lives
Somebody gotta save my soul
Some things just aren't meant to be
Yes, your ass did look fat in those jeans, your mom's a MILF
Your beaming eyes don't seem so bright
But nothing's endless
Tangerine tangerine
So when the beat starts
Won't hear the answers
The gates of Hell stared in our face
Lean back and relax, we tell 'em
You niggas are making it so simple
From this bed I hit the floor
'Cause everything is poison
And if you knew what you were saying, I might even have respect
Breaking through your window
tu mi dici sorridendo
Throw a brick through your shit, come cut the alarm off
We put the walls up, we put the walls up again
Two sides working together
Can't make up his god given mind, no
Listen to talk back radio, watch Neighbours
Breaking myself
You say you're sorry now
Maligning my name will holy ark up your squad's face
Like Julius Caesar seizing control of the Praetorium
Performing in front of millions, nigga every race
Ain't it wild
Some folks work so hard
I got shot so I dropped
Shove a million dollars in my pocket, but there ain't no pacifying me
Here's to "Gimme your cash or your brains is gettin' splattered"
So I will flee the factory, and pray you to dismantle me
When my mind would say 'hey are you afraid'
I've been asking you this whole time
I just wanna be free, is there a possibility
People are being forced to live like animals
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
And please if you got a minute, 
Fat mama cass it was hip automatically
But my thoughts have changed now, I've opened my eyes and now I'm through
Disloyalty will have me kill my brother, sheddin a tear
And try to find a familiar mind
You are such a hypocrite, so I'm leavin' for a bit
Have you ever had a girl to call up your man
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do to me
And yeah, you seen me down
Ya baby daddy passed we share the same losses
A friend of mine Roberta she got a job at the post office
And I'm still ripped off and passed out
I feel a bloodrush come right over me
The stinkin' troopers them, they think that we are fooling around
With its hands stretched towards the calendar hanging itself
In you there's always a someday,
This is not the man I wanna be
Neglect becomes rejection the silent sounds retreat
Violence and civil unrest
And I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
Producto back rap rush, you'll notice the lad crush
Monkey to Man monkey to man
Morgue stuffed into a body bag
No idea how it feels to be on your own
But it's easy to hate what you just can't be
The line you found within your mind
You're a fool, you're a fool
Low twos to you my, my fickle friend, yeah
You raise a flower of fire
There's no need to wait
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
She doesn't need it
There is no way I could not remember
Oh my god my god won't forsake again
I am life I am death
They knock you out at the drop of the dime
Shut up, its how hard ya work and how good you flow
It's time to show some true humanity,
Right through her chest
'Cause nothing is promised
Such a lack of taste lack of taste
Mama I don't know if I'm a ever be home
I take y'all niggas straight, +Beneath the Surface+
Because I believe that it will determine the amount of sex I will have in the future
I said it I meant it, that's the way I deal with enemies
Take away my body
Where I have harbored great things that I will never confess
Member when your pussy Second husband tried to beat ya
But you must've been aware;
I'm older now
All the children run away from me
The sunrise or the sunset, hold your sadness like a puppet
One year, twenty years, forty years, fifty years down the road in your life
If you thought that I was afraid, well have no doubts The trouble is, you cannot figure me out And you've too many reasonsyou want to know my disease, huh Well, that's just the nature of fools that is the prize for the rules get me to report, but never recognize
And only time will tell
Make a mess
Do you wave the flag, can you support a man
Some things around just really stink
Speed toward hell
I'll play X, you can be the O
Are you clear in your mind and sight
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
Now if sex is old fashioned and you're not selling out
You wanna be fooled
Take it pull my hair back Oh no
So when will it end, when will it end
Can't shake this blood from my eyes
And you want to believe
You almost turned away 
Y'all really on one, beat it, you're gone, done
Call it off, sorry refused 
Somebody threw that brick
Well, you'd never believe how much effort goes into
Overalls he spat and swaggered, lord he was a Boston Jew
Even this laugh'll pass
Niggas for life, fuckin' your wife, these niggaz wild Hello
'Cause I just want to know, I need just a little
Your nose is bleeding
She said, "I'm not your minor girl"
I hate to leave my children crying
All guns are loaded and have gone off now
And feed 'em from the table that held the Corleone's food,
Domination won't win friends
'Cause I'm on fire too hot to touch
Yeah, oh yeah
And you'll grab that piece of gold
And you could bury me where I lie
Aww, mothafucka wanna see you shine and I got my gold on
Now I'm realisin' we're fightin' to heighten
I still believe
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act
I need someone to hold on to
He says he's sorry and so she wants
A world full of hate is my alignment
What about the times you hit my face
Making me a burning specimen 
She wants to be a messiah
With the fucking phone
You know what I mean
When I am queen sweet girlscout's face and not a one will fall from grace
And the silence embraces all my weeps
Through the whole fucking town
I'm a wall, I'm a fence, I'm a dotted line
Because in , blind faith in your leaders, or in anything, will get you killed
The problem is my frown
If all they lost was selfrespect
Oh yeah, you're raking up
How can we still succeed, taking what we don't need
I'm a storm, I'm a sign, I'm a bleeding heart
ThugLife will never fail You know, Out on bail
All you niggas is faker than Lupe Fiasco claimin he
The force of law becomes a farce
Heart you break
The passin' of everyday human events
My fist
Voodoo pinning, devil jealous
Change on Monday
Sheila is a messo
Is a master whom disasters
I got a fresh opinion now
And I forget just why I taste
When I know I'm wrong
In these days they don't throw the stone
You're not allowed to change your mind
I torti restano, fra', questo so
But I'm drowning in the rain
Destruction lies uncovered
Things that need to be said
Doin' the cockroach, yeah
I know your full of shit x
Till my dad returns to tell me what the other side is like
Shapeshifter, guest lister, big faker
I ignored the sheep and shepherds on my way
Kneel 'n' cry
I see no reason why I've placed such a value on you,
This is what you want from me
I don't need your eyes to see
You can be my black Kate Moss tonight
Miami bitches you know how we go
I've got seven ways of going, seven where's to be,
Belligerent authority, bloodied by the right to be
Like passing through a sculpture gallery
They were few and far between, no it wasn't meant to be from then
To the game
They have always run this town
You fucked up By Ween
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
You don't know what your power has done to me
So put me down, punk
Cause everybody loves an accident
But there's nothing better than watching him go down
But the world moves on and leaves you far behind
Could never end
I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned
Let them bleed now, let them wash away
So I may continue to find why this childproof's so wild
Undercover lover, that's my heart now
But they'll go down on your sister
Ignorance, intolerance abounding
The origin of junk food, rutting through garbage
The neon forest is my home
You'll understand when I'm dead
And for this gift I feel blessed
All I want
And we are broken, we lie misconstrued
I'll make my stand against supremacy
All my blisters now revealed
Eclipses both the sun and moon
I swear this bitch is Shady that's what I know
I smell the bullshit
Of anyone who'll take no more  of the lying bastards roar 
They broke in my house, planted bugs in ma lamps and my couch
Took this game to its threshold
Doch eigentlich ganz normal
Eternal kiss, touched my face
Disrespected, niggaz don't "show no love"
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light,
Don't stop to
You're drunk, you're never gonna get away with this
Where heaven is waiting for
Can't get to sleep
Somethin' gotta come down gotta change now
The bitch who blushed and smoked blunts wit us
In the darkness
I take a look around me and I wonder how things change so much
Wanna be clowns, the fail ones
The life inside has lost human rights
I'm leaving today
Jump back, get your self respect
Who you fucking now
Sixes, money foldin
I'm living the future so the present is my past
A trail of people I had hurt
Please stop crying
Voting doesn't work why
Break the fist that abuses
Your fingers are whispers
And smother me
But I mean no harm nor put fault
And run away in disbelief
And take away my pain
Even if I can't fight beside you
It was a slap in the face, how quickly I was replaced
Cause bein with you was like a hangman's noose
Like a second skin
Selfdestructive line in pain
Why talking a lie
Go now please and 
So this business is what I left you for
He wants too turn his back on your sorry face, and run away with someone else's reflection
Spend it on the enemy
'Cause to talk to you is harder work 
Intro Tupac Talking
I think I'm falling off
I don't wanna take a walk
But it doesn't matter what you do or how hard you try
Deli Joe he ought to know
It's a crazy world to live alone
She crept into your lifelife
How would you feel if she held you down and raped you
Without the fire
I've got a little bit of thunder
Two falls or one submission
Oh what do you need
But it don't have a face
"You'll die trying to live this down you might as well forget it"
Self doubt is an industry
I even slap hoes bitch
And stop taking all these pills
If taking's a waste of our time
'Cause you need to censor your dreams
Who shook all tha world bankers who think they can rhyme
Enough to drive you nuts
Maledetto me che stò cedendo
We outrun a river colour brick red mud
My skin cold as ice
You're livin' your life without a care in the world
Dipshit
You've lost your head
And songs that recognize our sick obsessions
Sie verdient einen besonderen Schutz
Fantasies of the master race
I am down on the ground,
Someday you're gonna be alone
Hear the dogs, hear the beat, in the dog pound
The mothers will cry their tears
Be silent now and take your beating
You'll always need me much more
And now I finally see that the further we go
In darkness, and seclusion
She's not me
And burned it down the same night
But I choose to speak, sing, scream
You know who we're talking about, no doubt
But don't lose me now, don't lose me now
Steals the soul; machine forever turning
There's no point in charades any more
But my mind stays the same
What do I do to ignore them behind me
To pass the time, pass the information
Eye of the tiger, I know these cats are sick of this
I trusted in you
I wonder how you'll justify the lies, the lies, the lies
I try to be polite, but I feel like I'm stuck for life
So clear Hear weeping voices,
Struggle war whole drug fiends, the white house burn
Then asking my identity
All that you want
For the world,
The slow death of light
But you better shut her down before it's to late now Come on
What do I know
Empty heads and cancelled eyes
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
See ideals and my visions all burn up
And there's so little of it left 
Throws up silhouette skyline in brown
And everything changed on a new year's day, come on
Every day everything gets harder
The daybreak and sunset
He denies he's descended from the dinosaurs
I could make it any day
Right off of his face
Why can no one ever feel a fire spirit
Close your eyes
When I close my eyes I'm in a crosstown cab
One on one, beat you down and then hug you
To money and fame, I changed my name
I know you'd fool me again
You're holding me back, confined by doubt
That's some nasty shit, I you wonder why I'm sick when I see this shit
And I feel sick, sick, sick
What you gonna do when your trip turns blue
Been there, done that, learnt the worst of lessons
Leaving blood and shattered bones
'Cause you know it hurts to see the light of day
Then piece me back together like a star
Adrenaline is fire to fuel
Pick up the phone, I'm always home
We're just two people trying to love,
Flat tire, homemade cross
They never thought that I'd be 
When I chased you with a burning cross, my mother she wanted you dead
Say my brain's goin' bad
But luckily had a couple of guns with me
She stole my skin,
I can't help it all I hear when you're crying is laughs
And I don't think you care to doubt it
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
By a man in a bulletproof vest
And I don't know what the fuck to do
I feel all right, uptight
Crazy Town rocks so hard, you'll go berserk
They tend to regret ever sendin' me threats
How many, many times the worm had turned
Boardwalks and breaking waves
And when the runway rovers
I don't know how
She's probably not the easiest one to live with either
And he sat down and watched me take off down the road
And I heard a sound 
You wanna get turned
The air is full of harmonies but is anyone even sleeping right
The space between the city and the suburb
It peels the flesh
Hollywood ass rappers
What you think is love is truly not
I have cleansed my life now of the people who pry
Nice fuckin' accents
Tha same devil that run around Managua with a sword
Let me hold you high
It just ain't enough to leave my happy home
So why do I feel desperate now
Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
You always victimize
Where I gotta come and save the day
Kind people should never be treated like
Where every single thing hurts
You'll eulogize my big ol' body
Only if you wanted to
No razor blades but you can get knife
So please, be honest
Have you ever been kicked to the curb
Ain't got time to make no apology
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous
Their handjob lives were just too cruel
Take yo money like a Bitch
I believe in a changing of the guard
Oh God I'm a sinner and I think I wanna sing along
'Cause there is nothing wrong
This feeling haunts me
Why must I repeat myself
So I update this almost every single day for you
I got so fucked up
Not until you've listen to Rakim on a rocky mountain top
Are you waiting
I just wanna change
I'd like to go back to the way that things were before
Just like you always do
And then you said to me that I was cold and stern
We talk the same
'Cause I'm gonna cry
The only purpose you serve is to bring us our food
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
Every lie you've ever told
Terrified, blind, and wait to die, 
Your thirdclass communication,
Singing our songs of yesterday Nothing's got all the point to blame
One of the oldest, most ancientest of things
Hate is running through my veins
Hush my baby I'll make you bleed
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind
I'm bleeding to death, everything's fine
I can't remember worse times
It is not something you could purposely do
I don't need you crowding up my space
While crossword people look for clues
I'ma choke who I wanna choke fuck that
I'm gonna flashback
Everywhere I go I see your face
Why you always waste my time, I don't know
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Nobody knows but it always shows
Like a man, like a man, like a man, like a man
Crazy with power, blinded by vision
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Le nottile bottele stelle com'erano belle
I'mma eat a gun
Part IV Rock 'n' Roll Girlfriend
Commanding the mic  striking up a verbfest
Meanwhile in his hood, his niggaz is suiting up and Timbed, looted up
Ici y'a pas de fake y'a pas de faux y'a qui ont est
Lock up your doubt
Inside the passing lane
I've got a boyfriend, I've got a feeling that he's seeing someone else
Noriega had back
Hey yeah, because I'm alive and
Like nothing that you've ever seen
We hope and we pray everyday it works out
Matt big ass, big ass nigga with some small ass earrings, bald
Scratching my nuts right at god
Go find a man to fit my shoes
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
'Cause it's all you ever wanted
Because I'm not yours
The power of their source
He didn't see me watching from the aeroplane
That sirens I hear Guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
I'm perfectly content with being crazy Hell yeah
And tell everyone here
You know You know
So Bill just chops 'em down, watch 'em fall
It was sweet like lead paint is sweet but the aftereffects left me paralyzed
I am just giving up and shutting down
I murder everything I touch, buddy, move back
You're miles and miles and miles away
But why am I still losin' I can't take the pain
Feeling like a knife's being twisted in the hole of how it is
In taking hold to waste within
Big fucking ditches in the middle of the road
When the evil seeds were sown
Those most deserving will end up with the most
You talk to me like I am something more
Each day when I wake up and I set my best foot forward
Feel water in your hands 
I don't have all the answers
How many times say that I love you till it doesn't mean a thing
Why should I watch Matt Damon cry without her at my side
And your room smells
She likes the dark
Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard 
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
I need, need
I'm unchained
Yeah see you coming in your entrance is not clear you should try moving corret and touch the whole atmosphere
It's an obituary
As I was being led by the hand
The receiving end, I've never been
Nothing that you do or say can change the way I feel about it
Cause it gives 'em a hint not to step in my path
Give me some more whiskey not that Colenmorangie
Therefore we black out together
I want to be pretty
I will never tell a lie, no, no
Yeah, you will be the father of something terrible
And if I fall, you are not the one that has to cope and deal
Passed the point of delirium
Food and drink and handshake drugs
If I'm gonna drive, girl it's gonna be one hell of a ride
And you're too busy with the lies they sold you
Time to spend
Afterwards I hate them and their lies
Way too detached to fight the waves
True green lie in botany,
You promised me another lie
I need some pleasin' so help me I'm wheezin'
'Cause I can't believe the state I'm in
My teeth bit my mouth oh like sexy housin
And I promise you it'll end someday, I hope
Do you feel good
Shout loud in the crowd "Watch them beat us all down"
We spray pain on the walls
Where tribes of wanton peacocks strut
Walked up to a whore
Yeah I know that no one is
Fortysix years old, middle of his life
It sucks to lose
There must be black unity, there must be black unity
How could words slit my wrists and doors close
Breathing's a tug of war
I'm so sadistic
You call me a whore, but you always come back for more
Where do I put this fire
That deals with AIDS and race and gays and
Body, body, body, body, body
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now
Wake from the grip of the tongue
There is none
I'll write my masterpiece some other day
An heavy sleeping beast
Y'all niggas wanna bang who
Beach front punks, they insist I'm the raddest
Sie war kaum zu überseh'n doch ich wollte nicht versteh'n
Bitch play the skills
I'll have a devil in my infrared scope, WOY
But I think I've got the answer
She's a snake that can fly she's just food for the fleas
Plan your attack and I am still waiting
Someday I'll be born
And gold digger,
Check you attitudes those narrow views are bound to be the death of you
That's why you, you wanna break my heart
'Cause I've had enough of bredders acting tough
I rub my thumb across her palm
We may appear sidetracked by violence
Fools, you fools, you fools, you fools
Disturb So you want inside of me
And I don't think I can stop
Every single word you say
Everyone's screaming
African genocide
But no matter what it's been, niggaz never got a win
I be illin, parental discretion is advised still
I ask you how many fucking times
You see the Wu W raised in black fists
I hate you so much
I hate the things you do;
They all thought the queen was charming
I see a black man, see a coloured man in a cage,
Fill your hole inside with dirt
And you got away with a lot, but I'm not
Each day a new tomorrow
They think they crazy but they ain't crazy
In the back of the neck right between the eyes" 
And lately the word is I live in a suburb and I don't fuck with birds
And his best friends say man where you been
I cannot breath
Our, our hearts yeah, littering the topsoil
'Cause I've been talking to the people that you call your friends
Fünf Uhr, Feierabend, zum Bus rennen, n'Abend Alter, n'Abend Alte,
It balls my fingers into fists
Shout, shout
Here's to the "Rattatntat" of gun shots, and your life is shattered
Coppers try to kill me
I cockblock wack shit, now get ready for Knock Madness
I just cannot explain why these girlies always hit me like an atrain
I used to think cupid was an asshole
The revolution wont have any distribution
I spit and scream "what's done is done
If blood is what you want embrace the demon glow
Willing me to fail
When it's completed he moves on
And now I've moved on by myself
But only in the street man
And holding back our tears
And I don't know why
You're bleeding repeat x
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you
And now we're alright, we're all calm
There's no mission accomplished here
So get it understood boy I am from the hood boy came up from the dirt selfmade hustler I'm a beast I'm a beast
The transmission wippin' our backs
You know I'm here if you need a girl
When whack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage
And then your socks and then the door
Disturbia, disturbia, disturbia
Gonna get her wig knocked way back
If I say any more they might be at my door
War Ooh, oh yeah
And I won't cry
They say you're nobody till somebody kills you
It's a mundane experience living with Mother and I
Looking for an antibody, toxin a miracle drug
They're all thinking they're fat
You've done enough for me to hate you
Muthafuckas will war but not many survive
They wanna make you hot, no doubt
Does the man who makes the shoes own you, clown
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
I hurt where I can't feel, I feel where I can't hurt
No no no
And unscreams the scream from the first initial cut
Only made me
Murder Inc is my blood
Then walk a mile in the skin
Pain not penance, forget martyrs, remember victims
Tears will come and I will end
Rattle and shake the foundation of the world order
Like "what's going on baby boy" Shots in that Mercedes door
As I'm watching your decay
No spare time no sanity
You want a zoom zoom
Everybody loves to knock down straw men
Wishing I had not been born
As if it happening wasn't enough
Pantsed at the wind for a joke
Look me in the face
Be my date tonight
But nothing seems right to you
I never saw my friend alive again"
Well he might have been the richest now fear is in his eyes
Cuntured up by the bubbling stinch of unwash bodies and unsanitary quarters
As you're driving down the street of gold
If it wasn't for death, I know I'd never feel this alive
You gave me a chance to prove I'm more than just an also ran
The truth scares the shit out of me
And all this tension we ignore
I once believed
Fuck what I need
I raise my game as the stakes stack higher, higher
I think it would take away the pain 
Have you ever loved something that never seemed to have a face at all
WHAT You are not your own Everybody listen got to tell you something
Messiahs need people dying in their name
My life had barely started since you jumped all on my heart
Little to big o' brother, you leave me like blood from my veins
I can't tell you how to make it Go
And for the last four years of my life I've thought about you pretty much
Heaven help me, my head's spinnin' round
Though he couldn't move
My mind can't shake one sound
While it can seem so hard now
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me
Yeah, when you fall for the garbage man
I wanna give the violet more violence
Do as You please, and I'll just do me
I'll uproot all of humanity
And have to go to war with FAKE niggaz standin alone
No more please
I won't back down
Just not built for
Can't you see I'm not listening
That only half of a girl
I've been watching in bars
Yeah, he got some skills but every time he put them eyes in it look like he popped some pills
Who them niggaz that you love to get us
Down where the crickets learn to sing and play
That he was painting but it was obvious in all the photos
Just gives rise to hostile trends
My life I've been waiting for this moment
It's okay
Of the girl who taught me there was so much in this world worth living
You betrayed all the trust I gave you
Your way's making me mental
Shelters body from cold reigns of reality
Everything that a man could need
You don't know shit, about a dead man's perspective
'Cause I'ma nigga  life, so I'ma motherfuckin nigga till I dizie
Certain things I love, Spend my time
My pretty life depended on it
To make it to the door
They take great pride in working,
Don't treat me like a god
Always the third wheel
You don't expect me to put up a fight
I thought of someone I could save 
I've got a thoughtless mind
Hoeveel vriendjes je wel had
You gotta look at reality, understand that shit so you don't get caught
I'm always finding a way just to touch your body
The world you perceive to be so normal
Well in a back room in Harehills, I got my souvenir
Did he stop No, he had a couple seats
And when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors to murder the medium that shot 'em  years before they said
Hey, forget you man Anyway, you got a cigarette
But maybe I'd be better off if I just answer quickly
That I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna let you
Clapped under our hands
Somebody saw him there
The philanthropic minds to speak up now
Luxury youth and eternity that's the dream
So take your sorry ass
Go fuck yourself you ain't one we can trust,
But it's just the empire of a new master race
I'm not an animal
'Cause a nigga like me is goin' insane
You niggas is featherweight, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
And a sky that's filled with vultures
Your blind faith passed to your seeds,
Remember how you gave me shit
How come it's always up to me and you
Well, I'll give you a thousand reasons that tonight 
I've seen the scars
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
Just to let you know that I hate your guts
To curious strangers who throw dollars at my feet
Lights touched my eyes and petrified my tears
When I'm the nigga sold  mil out the gate and numbers do not lie
Your grimace widens and your lips part
I'm grinning at the breaking
Unless this kills us all
Don't startmeup, 'cause I'm not the Rolling Stones
Thousands of bodies in the ground
Do you give a god damn
We love these days
'Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
Like the prison stench of the huddled traitors evaporates from the room
Break 'em all, pull over and jump out
By the way, I got sixty fucking Wolves that'll guard me
Remember when we used to sing
Ramadan, orange alert
Shh Who the fuck is that staring in my window
With the giblick, then I passed around back to B BReal again
And dedicated to the people advancing the game
No, thank you, no
My god it's slipping away
We embryonic satellites need our freedom to fly
Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin'
But now
And if we seem to rough it up a bit
Your last caress that I've been waiting
Don't take it away from me, I need you to hold on to
Takes the snail he stepped on, back from its creator
All in search of our personal gods
Constantly noble, constant noble, portrait of persona,
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
I'm sick and tired of the smile that you give
This is how a heart breaks
You better run like I'm booger flicking
And they come and they call and they fall on the floor
Alright, motherfuckers It's time to go old school
Flat blues in the headlights
Arabe ou noir, ils aimeraient tous nous foutent dehors 
Pain you know you can't ignore
A taste I can only describe as a dream I once had,
And when you cry for help they don't hear
As I redefine love for this century of loneliness
Blood Roses, blood roses
Bitch ass females
More life for the people
Even if he wanted to
Where is my shrink and my mind eraser
And I don't want no more
And it's fucked up, but at the same time it just made me want you even worse
This keeps repeating in my head
All my life I relied on one thing and that one thing fucked me up even more
Those kids suck, yeah those kids suck
Through sacred alleys, the living wrecks, yeah, wreak their havoc upon this world
All my pictures on display here
From the scales on your skin
So I'll start a war
Do my dirty work, do my dirty work Oh
We sing the death song kids
When I feel the there's something crawling out of me
All drunk
One month of sucking it in
Phenphened to no end
Punks roll when I put in work
So I don't have to use this gun
Tell me straightfaced 
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
They say I killed the brother
Your sex and your dope is all that we're fed
The only thing you done was Yesterday
Let the world turn, Let the curbs up, Cats Van Bags Yo
You were once someone I called my friend but that's all now changed and I don't know why
When you're feeling broken
Don't nod, don't laugh all nicely
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
The light is red like a fire,
Black hearted
Maybe I'll get a shotgun and
You made me throw it all away
I find it hard to concentrate with all my past mistakes
I can't remember my own name
'Cause I don't think you care to know
That I'll try today
Now this big Jewman uptown
Your pretty little face
I'll tell a tale for you
I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
I am living
Problem is today they've got an answer for everything
When the hook sets in and this all ends
To be in your body
He's on my bed wasted every night when I come home
Yeah, they do it all the time yeah, yeah
What I really am is really not so clear
Getten drunk thrown' up
Two  year olds had let a kiss go to far
Turn it up loud and feel the ambiance
I want to rape and fuck you
It's so hard to manage, the ups and downs of your life
So tired of the heartache and the nights I lie awake
Unohtanut olen, en voi kahta palvella
I don't care much for parasitic lifeforms anyway 
And no zen guide to men will help you fend off the brethren
Why can no one ever hold a fire spirit
To a different beat
I'm not a pimp runnin' a stable
Your black soul, you know you're
It's always this and it's aways that
And I'll tell you something else right now I have the solution to the drug problem in this country Nobody wants to hear it, but I have it Not less drugs more drugs Get more drugs, and give 'em to the right fucking people Mmm mm, 'cause every time you hear about some famous guy overdosing on drugs, it's always some really talented guy It's always like Len Bias, or Janis Joplin, or Jimi Hendrix, or John Belushi You know what I mean The people you wanna have overdose on drugs never would Like Motley Crue would never fucking overdose man, never You could put them in a room with two tons of crack They come out a half an hour later, "Rock on, man" "Shit, they're still alive Fuck They're probably gonna make a double live album now, goddamn it"
They playin' Nintendo and he's got tha high score
I I you we're not thinking my stromata
And I'm running but you're getting away
Through their socket pride
My bad, should I step out my shoes
Shit and I be trying, I even text you, but you not replying
And all our sins come back to haunt us in the end
Fucking you is a total stranger
You'll be left alone, and broken bleeding
Everyone and every thing you see makes you fucking sick
If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
Fool me please just one more time again
Grunt fuck
I hear the lift descending
All being controlled by evil tyrants
Verse   Sadistik
I look to the left and the right
Don't move, I'll shut the door and kill the lights
I ain't never comin' back no more
Limited in sex, they dare
Confused You'll know when you're ripe
And so bitter
Just let me die here next to you
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"
All that is sacred is now declined
I move on, move on
Es kann nur noch wenig, sehr wenig Leben in dir sein
They won't change nothing with their fashionable talk,
The end
I won't ever have rough sex with Molly Connelly again
Featuring Jessicka of Jack Off Jill
I said to take me to the god eyes
All the things we hear
And everything can change on a new year's day, yeah
Stand over by the wall
Throw them meat and the dogs want more
I ruined all your plans so
Well see the flesh falling everywhere
Stop talking Stop botherin' me
Just a little something you should keep in mind
Of all things in time, all things one place
Alone on the bathroom floor
We're empty playin'
She says, shhh, I know, it's only in my head
I need such amazing grace
But it's under the skin of everyone
Got me feelin' miserable I'm miserable
On roule en caisse les roues chromées, ici tout le monde nous reconnaît
It's all about the LENCH y'all know the rest
He was playing hopscotch with Betty Carter
They'll not try to hurt you
Turn your fucking cheek
Watching the flags of freedom flyin'
We've chosen the path of disgrace
Burning in a sea that sings out in D
They shot an arrow at your head
And fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing
Of the ones designated to be the queens, kings, and aces
The system like a disease and bring it right to its knees
Insomnia sleeps with you nights
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh
Blood stained with no way to be saved
Fuck a rap career, I'm waiting to smash it
And everybody seems to think I have a sinister plot, I do
And It'll take over your mind
No sense in signing up
Crippled with desire
I am the dirty and you are the clean 
Let me tell you a little story about the slave master
I wanna see what you're insides look like
Art may imitate life
Ah, the spirit's gonna close in on you tonight
Is it all in my head like she said
We never stand too close
Every ounce of pain, what else is there to blame
It's something I'm not missing
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
It comes knocking back again to
You know how people have these little habits that get you down
Long time tellin' you
But you don't understand
Thuglife niggaz I'm going straight to , BIATCH
With it ever end Well I don't I
Punk was once an answer to years of crap,
Oh, you don't even care no more
If you failed to speak your mind
And her voice was like a bell
I stab, I stab, I stab but I can't puncture
Upturning usurping
Pour s'endormir avec lui 
And I'm free and I could dig into eternity
To watch it function and bubble out your lunch
Black is death at midnight
I thought you were some perfect readout
And run in little circles till circles are
Fuck my ass
Our government has a firm policy not to capitulate to terrorist demands That noconcessions policy remains in force, despite the wildly speculative and false stories about arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments, we did not, repeat, did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages, nor will we
You threw it back
Massive plutonium radiation
G'ed up C'ed up motherfucker blaze the weed up
I know you made one mistake
It tastes so good
I bet you're not fuckin' pretty on the inside
It's hell when you're around
'Cause if I honestly react, nothing's ever gonna work
It's enough to kill me but it's never enough
Seems so very clearly now 
I'm hiking it around this waste of laughter
Plowing through minds and paranoia 
In photos the size of a kiss
I swore I'd tell you
I've whored myself for less than this
Future, past, all is fading, warped reality
Aww, look at daddy's baby girl
I'm makin' collect calls to my old bitches
Yo you can run but you cannot hide
Man mother fuck a war
War has shattered many young men's dreams
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
When I go out, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
Just want it all to go away
When all I wanted was to be good
I was always taught that boy meets girl
Made a mistake, made a mistake
Get a load of this fuck, he's the dead guy
Brings all things to the light
Sparing you is not my aim
Nowadays every godd damn little disaster
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
Know one knows what I've done
My sacrifice �what if my afterlife �what if
You can't appreciate it and I need to feel whole
We camouflaged stone cold
Walk with an army on me, stalked by the harm and armor posse
Now I'm afraid that I am not so sure
Who left Murph the Surf On my ceiling
I find it so upsetting that
No you ain't gonna need no little boat
But maybe I'd be better off if I just end this quickly
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life You can't blame me
Try to make me move, but only half an inch
You get disconnected over methods you choose
I'm just calling to say hello
I am the truth of it, you are the hypocrite 
On the game again
But I am always gonna be here
And that reminds me man hey ya gotta call
Held up its arms To the sky
With all your cheap words about hearts and accidents
It was a murder but not a crime Pop, six, squish
It might rain, it might snow
Turning me on with my lightsabre cocksucking blues
In fact to the gritty ain't none of us wack
Take your mind back, I don't know when
While you were looking the other way
But to shiver and shake and make shit in their shorts
My heart is beating from me, I am standing all alone
Lose yourself, you'll fall away fast
You're a respectable member of society
I'm not afraid of lying but I am afraid of DYING
He didn't know that every dog had his day
And when I feel I'm in hell, my ideas are what get me through pain
When those walls close in around you
And you get poisoned fruit from a poisoned tree
The Space between our hearts
Holy man
I ain't got no time for the bull shhh Come on
Swallow your pride for
And you can tell 'em It's my son he's hurtin' me
She finished the move, presenting blue waves of doubt
Don't care no more
When you're shaking your good frame
Than thou hide my head in my hands 
I want it, want it, need it done
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
Can't even do one thing, assassinate 'em
In a beautiful world
Where I know the roads like the back of my hand
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
If you were my own man
You wanted nothing less then
Crosses and kerosine
Für was kann man ein Kind gebrauchen
Eye trained, on scope, blessin'  proof
The liquid light is descending
The animals scratch at my skin
Desecrate your soul
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
To try to kill the major
From walking over me
Or the patience or the courage or the strength to withstand god damn
With thoughts of failure sinking
Hook Kendrick Lamar
And all this time still hanging on into such codependence
This is why my mouth is always coming out with raw shit
Pain  and tears
Yeah, I lie, I lie, I lie, oh, I lie, oh, I lie, I lie, yeah
Rapists, racists, all fucking scum
One time can't hold me back
But don't look so offended
And life is a sleazy stranger
I know line and walk tall, soft, and punch a clockAin't done
Someday this will go away
My heart bleeds from the pleasure of the pain
I don't wanna wait for you yeah
But I don't wanna be just another girl
These times I'm living in just make no sense
Send'em a wire, give'em my best
Won't need no shadow man
That this puffed up face is safe in well worn places
So fuck you anyway
Everybody look who's going down
And now I've got nothing to show
It's always the same, say the "F" word maybe that'll help
Backstabber, hope grabber, greedy little fit haver God, I feel for you, fool
Oh, foolish worker bee 
Drag another cliche
It's an awkward form of payback,
There is not a wonderwall to climb
It blows their minds most bitterly
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
So we can't find out guns
She said, "I am not a feminist"
Makes you feel much better
To build a life worthin living, if you're
Now I understand all of the lies you hide and you're gonna make me flip this switch
I'm coming over but it never was enough
My needs are artificial
I fired several rounds,
New plan Stan
That don't change my feelin's in the slightest degree,
Don't need no terror squad
When the people sit in their brokendown homes
And I'm sorry but it's not a mistake
I teetered on the edge of doom
Life was lame, I had to pay money to fuck a whore
Learn from my mistakes
Step towards the line how close can you before you fall right in the show me something something new and original I can't help feeling that I'm holding on with one hand show me difference something new I can't help it if you're building something I can't help it if I'm feeling nothing I can't help it if you're building something I can't help it if I've seen it all before show me something something new and original I'm holding on with one hand give me something something to live for countdown starts from ten when you hit four it all starts again reset the ride show me something something new and original I'm holding on with one hand something to live for something to die for and it's not a game
You'll never know the real story
Why did this man seem so alone
Mirror minor static 
I don't want to fade away
His shit attitude
And I don't give a fuck about the things they say
Behind the hospital little baby,
Motherfucker, you not dope
I shed tears fo this shit
When you take her to Chateau Marmont
There's no need to be nervous
We exist in a world
All I ever wanted was a nine to five
I have a problem with reality
I'm digging my nails into gravity's ladder, ripping your mind and matter
The way you nullify what's in my head
After all, it's you, my pride and me
PO, you know the dirty one disturbing categories
And there's so little of you left
My royal garden needs a hired man
I'm your god machine
I know she's right, know she's right, God I'm drifting
My walls are closing in
To be sure you known what I'm saying
But everyone goes through these trials of selftruth and selfabuse
For a punk mother fucker with a badge and a gun
Turn on turn on, turn it on turn on
Are you gonna tell
And we're all going straight to hell
For in the end unity will be thrust upon us and we upon it and each other
Long beat, long beach and it feels so fine
I can not scream in pain from down here on my knees
But I like the way you play
All I want is a little respect
You take a hit now you feel it break down
My parents can pay for the abortion, you know
If you haven't had enough of me, well get in line
We meet after everyone has fallen asleep
And even if I had all the bread in the world
A foreign sound to your ear
And still be sinking, submerging in the parks
Don't wanna leave you now or never
You speak with false intentions but I know what you really want from me
I enter the building through the side door, not like an eyesore
Same questions we keep asking
And say that TV looks like your life
Burned by your kind too many times
My whole world is disconnected
Everyone talks about justice but truth is forgotten
Crying for a love when you know you never learned how
I don't know why, all I need is someone to save me, I believe
I think you shouldn't have glorified, now you're wrong
And fucking just remember this
Half human, half machine
This will be your last night on earth
Night is falling to the ground
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
It's a bird it's a plane it's a one night stand
Walking on fire, you rather than me
You sing with me
So sorry that, I'm taken aback
And you make it so real, I don't need your love to disconnect
You burn so hard
Expect me to adhere to your bullshit code of silence
To face no good fakes,
But somebody must've already broken my wings
I need you 
Yo, I've seen souls get sold so coldly
To scream all day
Don't get mad when you get played by me I'm a keep it real till the day I DIE
Lets run away to accept that we all are different
No, don't get upset, cause you never played fair
Come on you disheartenin' dobbins
I'm singing it loud and I don't care
I can never shut it up
But I've worked with less
For days and days and days and days and years
Well you spin around and bite your nails, now let me tell you son,
To leave me oh no no no no, oh rha
Come back here
They think that your early ending was all wrong
There's too much anger inside me
Must I rerun this pace
I will try to scream in pain a little nicer next time
One more chance to be yourself to prove yourself again
Don't go to bed mad baby
It's just too late now
It's not making sense to you right now but
None of us wonder what weather you're under, you're making it perfectly clear
What it is I need
This is the most important day of your life
So many formats so little time
I Feed the mouth that bites me
Well, you get stuck with the wrong man
You thought you'd leave me falling forever
You left our family in shambles
But I'm not coming
Rapalot greedy as fuck
A friend in need is a friend that bleeds
Cold summer, cold summer
It's your mother birthday, you don't give her a call
You find all your doors closed
Too many bugs in the shower
And fret for your lawsuit
And get the hell out of the house
No, no, no, no, I don't care
Through the barrel of a gun
 times the pain, I could never be like you
I think I love you now
Am I living wrong
Looking back into my diary
Oh, man Chris, what's going on, man How you been
Continuous drift to depend and dismiss
You broke them now, you'll haven't tamed me
You and me now
Move Forth Towards The Break
Both sides because the world is round
Encircled within our minds
I buried my friend the other day
Get the picture nigga, I'm the best of both worlds
While Brittania's huns with their long range guns
We americans don't write
I want to give a shit again
I will kill ya if you move in next to me,
You feel deeply misplaced
The end of law
Fuck all that waitin' and procrastinatin'
When I let loose wit this uzi and just shoot through your isuzu
You and me Far beyond control
One foot in heaven
Work, money, bills, reality,
They tell me the improbable arithmetic of closing my eyes and counting the cards keep 'em busy by counting the cards
Yeah, I'd have shot you down
The sky fell over cheap Korean monstermovie scenery
Maybe you need me 'cause you're lonely, maybe you don't
This time the bullet cold rocked ya
As those batons fall, turn a blind eye
All I want is inner peace
You're nothing to me, stop fucking with me
It's a shame what your father did to your brothers head
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
What I want from us, is empty our minds
Then trace them with razorblades
Trapped in a world that you never made
Stand me up and push me forward
I've left the girl I was supposed to be and
If you care to take a closer look at the way things really stand,
In other words, darling kiss me
Your skin makes me cry
You promised me another time
Then you get your planes and with napalm you bomb it
Bravo, nessuno
"You can try to stop it, but it keeps on coming
It's like I need time to figure these things out
And pulled me from the grass
You're the ones that fuck your kids
That is just because I can't stop thinking
I'm an asshole and I'm ashamed
You're the fan that won't work
You lie alone, I try to join
Are cold
When you look at me I just can't lie
But who's version of god should I trust
Unbreakable, unbreakable, unbreakable
How dare you niggas criticize, the way that I spit
On a sentimental noose
Making the bombs, Making the bombs
And no, we can't get in touch with who we're hating
When push comes to shove, whatever love we had take it witchu
At night when you're asleep
Words discoloured, bow to the bland 
Your wife can't smile 'cause ya knocked her teeth out
I'll do more than wishing someday
You're not the only unfortunate one
I can learn to live with this
Because it is you that I remember in their bedroom
I've nothing left to give
I can't believe that I'm drowning
I can see the lines open shutters
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
All my friends are microscopic
I was born on the dark cusp of twilight
Telling me what I need
The things that were said make all the sense in the world
Class is in a session of regression
Been a bumrush dreamer while taking her stroll
The paychecks grow but respect dies faster
Shoulders pressed to the door
I will not drowned by your thoughtless scheming
Things ain't always what they seem so wake up
And six cars that are paid fo', suck my dick Hello
He's always staying with you behind
Well can't you, can't you feel it
I know how I ended up here
I am the white man, I paint you black 
He ain't no trill he just quacking 'bout a knife
So don't waste my fucking time
You are a vacuous soldier of the thrift store Gestapo
When I said I needed you,
I'm gonna change my immediate circle of friends
Just keep walking
The keys to the castle are right where I left them
It's time to rip the chain from your neck
Shrunken head, I love to adore
Oh oh oh, I need you
Till we get 'em carsick
I just don't want to know
My head's feeling heavy my head's feeling heavy
Send mo' pictures and make me some more riches
Where's my head
We get the blind man's ticket
Corporations turn revolutions
It always stares back through the same new cracks
But we still got heart
I don't need nobody, not anybody
I'm a bad ass bboy, two triple O
Want you want from me, huh
Give me my money back
I never think of looking back
To stand up for us
We try and compensate through our troubled faith
One thing we know that the white man will
Got my friend zipped up in the bag, it's all bad
Progressing like a constant war
And everyday I'm just testing my fate
And the people we've become, well
I'm tired of feeling hateful
Push her in the snow fuck
Because I remember a lot of my friends when they we were  or 
She ain't made of West Coast plastic
Oh yeah, yeah
I remember you and me used to spend
Belligerent authority, bloodied by the right to be me
It's disappointing that you fell off well not fell off
I remember how it worked, back when we were both in love again, madeup memories
Well, the cities are teeming with people
But you don't even wanna talk
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like
There's a law man and
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
And some say the end is near
I don't care for the ozone layer, the way people wear their hair
Infinite voices why they drown me here
And you're feeling awkward
Then my head fell apart and where were you
I'll take a piss on a development deal from Sony, or Def Jam
Lately, I've been killing all my time
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your mercy inside
And turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me
Now you're the wolf in secondhand clothing
I pull up a flag  A white flag
Can't face facts needs a way back
Alright, not bad, not bad at all
Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
Oi oi, I'll rugbykick the shit out your groin, boy
And you're singing
Heaven is a joke and hell is a lie, pay attention son 'cause these are words to live by
I know that you won't
To a diary entry's end
Sometimes taking off can open up your eyes
And I won't bend, you will understand
People sleeping in their shoes
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirtyeights
Let them break, let them wash away
So sure is peachy to torture and shoot
To just make somebody come a little closer so you can push them away
But the beaches are always open
Don't wanna hear your voice
You won't have no time to run
Just to say what you don't want to hear
We've seen how the walls come down
Rappers just battle me for the glory
I'm not takin' no chance tonight
God doesn't exist, I'd rather have faith in pain
This is a sinking anchor that we hold so dear
So I've kicked the bitch to the curb
I'm not really mad
Look me in the face 
And things to be found
Like swimming, like sex
Who you fuckin' with
What's life like in a candy swirl
Face full of war paint, strapped ready for action
Because you, always right, gotta fight, always wanna know whoa, whoawhoa
Despite conclusions I drew
I don't hate you
So I left it beside the road
We americans is stupid
Learning loving somebody
Worm teeth grinding feverishly below,
The rules have changed, the lines begin to blur
You look so seamless now
Damn right, I'm a maniac
I've been hanging at the end of her rope a bitch called hope
Now y'all sayin' that's a clever nigga
Prepare myself fro drowning
This must be the place, I can tell by your glare
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Actions of a natural man
To feel like busting up a Starbucks
We'll attend to the terrified first class
'Cause you will never get on top of this
Who don't need it
Because it's cold down, gold down there, crow
I don't want to see the plan succeed
A couple box loads see all the money we spending
Stare at each other, wait till we die
My heart and my soul they feel like I'm seven
While my life drifts away
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me
Beyond that man, he brings a world of pain 
But I hope that you're okay
Through the pain I see things as they are
Can you put the bite back into the beast you've broke, and tied and tamed
So you can help
You know who'll get the blame
Believed you cared
Some kinda simple sucker
Each sent a man with a torch to the borderline to boast
Abyssinian, he had a Spanish wife
You're slack and sorry, such an arrogant brood
You know that I don't care
I know you can't take it
Hung they out a flag of war
All the world are fools
And join the line to march in time right back with your flock
Each one a fart in the face of your idea of success
And now these two lay together in a drunken stupor
You're the one who slammed the door
In the days I drew praise for the way that I slayed facts
I'll be the biggest scar in your back
Takes a special hustle to make a roll
Make room to forgive you
I can't fight the world, I can't change it
I just had to spit you out
Are you gonna sit and watch me
Now you got a reason to be here and see it before you even die
Cube Drop a old school beat
I dug my hands through his blood and wiped it on my face
Doctors finding out about disease
Make me feel good
And that is why I hate mankind
Don't wanna hear your words
I'll bleed you dry, I'll even fuck your soul
Don't stop cause your songs on
They came back to the world that they fought for
I remember, I remember, I remember
This is my specialty, extracting part of the brain
Sped away  miles
Oh no, I don't think so, no
Soaring highs and drowning lows,
Deal with these niggaz, let's put them where they properly go
With her hand in your head
Does she talk nice
Called you whore right to your face
Take it up to the hilt to cover up your own fuckin' guilt
How many niggaz wanna be involved
Say boom, say, me want to take off her dress, huh
You love this ass, I'll copyright it
That we know our kind
Now press rewind nigga
Who run into the arms
I wonder who you think you are You damn well think you're God or something
And the head on backwards
"You should have known this from the start"
You may not treat me like you do
I love to fuckin' drink
The club is all their law, stand up now stand up now
Alles was du sagtest war Das ist mein Leben
Rebellion and defiance makes my muthafuckin' cock hard
I can feel the breath on my neck 
My hands
If you thought things had changed,
Cheat death again
Er war ein Einzelgänger
Inside your head, yeah
'Cause I found what I needed 
I never jumped in and rescued you
Out of the old and thin and control we spin
Bathing in the blood
Spoken I feed my anger with the fucking bullshit that you preach
Many faces down the line
Next you know, you'll be bawlin' and shit
My hands will bleed my hands will bleed
Again watch the rain
And try to break me
Who can stand against me
I'm callin' 'em out, anyone who fuck wit my fam'
The sugar never helps
Stop holding back 
It bubbles, blisters, burns my palms
But hey, you didn't want to make it
Who cares if you hate my dog
You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
With the S on my chest
And it's talking and talking
Doesn't mean a thing, we're just here for the taking
Watch all the blood
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest
Son disposto a dimostrare
Come back to haunt me again
I say sir, get your nose out of the paper
Gutters drain west, mud made a mess of us
Sent you packin', look who's laughin' now
Of my head case mental being
Just let me bleed one more just one more
It'd break my heart but who's to say
What we don't know yet we'll never find in our books So let's spread our legs and all take a look at truth for once where wants are wound by how we're pound for pound bound to like to fuck I believe in what the conscience has ruled credulous a must, allow my heart be fooled Just as well, I'll be stuck to sell my delight in licking sweat to swallow hell, oh well I'm born, again, I'll build a life fucking friends and friends won't give a fuck for fucking is the latest trend I'll give my statue a shell, trust my unconscious is well and controlled by my hand, here it is, here we am
Not to notice
So niggas wanna go and get they man 'cause they can't do this shit
Surprised to see me Cat got your tongue
Addicted to all that shit
Gracefully curved
I've got this fever burnin' fist
Now that we've had this talk, I definitely may
But you don't know who you're dealin' with
This is my world
Baby I'm wicked, crazy and sick and with the face of a nimwit
You're sour, now you are alone
'Hey, fuck you, man'
There's a force there's a voice, in my head
So fucking straightedge getting high off of selfrighteousness
This is the best way to die
Where the faces full of grief
Tampering with our spirits
Whistling the old melodies
I am your end
Tell 'em we're brats and the press twist our fist  get me out of this mist
It's all the same game
Told you once lil nigga
God, where the hell did we go wrong
I'm just driving till it dies
Erupting from the mouth of god Rising from the ashes like
So the rest of you can stick it up your nose
They tell me to hold on
On a freight train to nowhere
I won't try to explain what I cannot understand
Nothing heard, nothing said, can't even speak about it
I'm not gonna play that role
Them cowards fucked wit the wrong building
That cleaves apart hills soil rich as blood
Those walls I faced alone
You've got to grit your teeth and try to keep them too
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I'll let these people know
Than no show at all
Of man's effect upon the planet
They got families and kids and it's all good
We made a promise
Looking for a decent cup of coffee,
To feel nothing at all
Writin rhymes, all day every night
Girl to girl sincerity remains
How many times can it escalate
Nur ein Blick von dir und ich wusste genau
All is fair in love and war, and love thy neighbour as thyself
The opener of your minds
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
My life's alone, x, I'm not living without you
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
It doesn't cry like me
Promise you won't ever see me cry 
Made a mistake, I made a mistake
I want you to trip like I do
We are the nobodies Na, na, na, na, na
Why don't you bow down, get on the ground, walk this fucking plank
My father's arms
I cock back the sling to stone a settler
Take yo' notebook, yo' bitch and yo' glock
This is a sin fix
Or do you want more from me
You design erect lines, who am I to just lie
My thoughts just keep picking shit apart all day
I laid a beating on the sleet and snow with my frostbitten toes
You're gonna let me hear the lost chord tonight
Now I can't feel a thing
They say they're building a new free world,
So they went and stuffed god
That the tears you shed will make you feel better
As the leaders that they decry
I'm platinum bitch and I didn't have to sell out
For your bedroom eyes
bleed bitch, bleed
Now is the last time you are walking out on me
I am your mangy little whore
Know I tried to warn you
I'm gonna end up dead
In back of that crime
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
Resign myself to hating it, I hate it all 
Underneath the ground
Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you
I was not honest
I'm wandering around confused, wondering why I try
But now she's gone, gone, gone
I got wood legs and bow legs, and no legs at all
And can you remember how I kiss you
And we were strangers when you left
I demand I know my rights
And ran her hands right through her hair
To the memories of a scream
I thought you should be warned
The far aways
Cannot ruin things
I tried an idea for no reason 
I'm still not I'm exhalin'
Red blood flowing like a flood
Stalking the land, gnashing dull teeth, tapping our feet, 
All we wanted was to be respected
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse
Wollowing in the echoes of Mlcolm's words
My brother's blood on a cherry tree
Never been Where does it lie
There is nothing there
Wakin' up the devil
But never to your face
Or I'll call, some black midnight, fuck up his new life where they don't know what he did
You're the one with all the pride
And I knew I was in trouble but I thought I was in hell
A bullet ensuring the right to life
I know you really care X
Lick my licks I'm on fire,
But you'd rather hold your grudge
We all know what's in your brain
I'd like to wrap my arms around you like a flesh canopy
Just a little more flesh just a little more blood
 I'm not involved,
If only things were that simple here
Even Rocky trainer and his wife said you can't win
Always miss it 'cause he does it
Kicking like a little bitch in one of Dibbs's mosh pits
Should I black your eyes again
And even if we try and not become so overwhelmed
A a a so get understood bot I am from the hood boy came up from the dirt selfmade hustler I'm a beast I'm a beast
I'm divorcing every motherfuckin' thing
Filled with magazines, full clips, and heavy metal
When we're dead they'll know just who we are Na, na, na, na, na
Shout shout, let it all out come on, let me shout, shout let it all out, these are things I can do without
I am every fucking thing and just a little more
Around the world each day
In a room that holds you
Whoa I should hate you 
Have been known to ride the rails
It's the reverend from the church sultan of swish and swat
The skin around every city looks the same
The drinks have faded along with her good words
Hope he never comes back,
As she stabbed her  times
Wel it's living in a palace having tea with the queen
We don't need to change that, really
Waited so long for this day
And I'm thrown around the room like party confetti now
How can you tell me
I fired my weapon
I keep my smile warm in case they turn the camera on
If God created man in his own image then FUCK YOU
Hot enough to melt the ice cream that's on Gucci's face
Some say a comet will fall from the sky
And do you know that you are saving me
Giving up control and buying into fear
Then I'll turn and walk away
We'll give it a big kiss
Too much for hotel rooms
That's me with the holy ghost
You'll just love the way I move when I dance
Oh no
Forget the black man, neglect his baby, ignore his hell,
When all of your friends refuse to be alibis
Don't pin me up Don't you know my cross you'll never carry
I kick you back can't say that I'm able
And there's no future for England's son
It was you, you're the fool
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you
But every time I come, only a few could understand it
But it's not
You wanna act funny
Cheating little boys, yeah
What left to do but complain 
Get something for my head
Man can kill and man can drink and man can take a whore
We americans is dirty
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
And I'm nothing at all like you
How familiar
I'll idealize and realize
Man I work hard do you really think its lucky
Lookin' back at my short life, the few pleasures that I've found,
But I'm not looking back
Bent out of shape from society�s pliers
I have been working all of my life
So go ahead, go nuts, go ape shit
My sneakers in his hand
Just death to thousands
They continually blow my mind
In these days I don't know what to do
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life, you can't blame me
This is the break up song
I wrote your name in my shit across the town to warn the kids of your bloodshed
And havin' lunch and brunch with the motherfuckin' enemy
Stolen land  and we're not through yet
So I won't have to feel like I do
Time it just passed and we had some laughs
And now you got to deal with the niggaz that I feed, greed
Vielä tästä nousen
Where you think you can run, or you can hide
Send 'em to the seventh level
Quitteront la banlieue pour Paris 
And I don't want to play no more
But you know, but you know
'Cause everybody loves you
And my brother, all he needed was his drugs
Comatose dead on 'er feet needin release
I've kissed up to God two years
There's a way to live the values your forefathers gave you
My shoes have been stuck with glue
But brains and wearing all black
The only reason I'm being aggressive is 'cause we need hope
You just tore all our kisses right in half
The pressure on humanity
The sky went offwhite, it snowed for fourteen years the sunlight splintered into all our darkest fears
No more fear
But though the masters make the rules
So fucking sick of your politics
Oh, now baby, please
Our boys need something to rape, I want to taste you today, like kids kissing
When I wear my Mary Jane's shoes,
So I raise my voice before I lose my soul
Try to remember how it felt
If you lie you don't deserve to have friends
You close your eyes
Ufo's and locusts sing the same old song while the weathermen get retarded as the day is long
We need a little hope
Ten million opinions in your skin color face
Lying limp in your own hands
He set up a man of straw with an authoritarian aura 
So you pretend to reason
You love this ass, so just take it
Little droplets of oil for bracelets Little jewels
Be a soldier, what for
Prepare for the final plan
I don't get it You know, I just don't get it I missed the fucking point some place The boat left and I wasn't on the boat Explain it to me Heavy metal bands on trial because kids commit suicide What is that about Judas Priest on trial "because my kid bought the record, and listened to the lyrics, and he got into Satan" Well, that's great That sets a legal precedent Does that mean I can sue Dan Fogelberg for making me into a pussy in the mid's Is that possible, huh Huh "Your Honor, between him and James Taylor, I didn't get a blow job till I was twentyseven years old I was in Colorado wearing hiking boots, eating granola I want some fucking money right now"
 'Cause we want to live not like a fucking dead fucker
We're back in the barrio and to you and me that's Jingletown
Hey God, I believed the promises, the promises and lies
Evil siren sings
And if ya didn't know
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
And sunk her teeth into breakfast
But that wind that blows across your room
Before the smile starts to blend into one big bullet hole
>From a nogood man like you
Cypress Hill, breaking you off a pedazo
You can have him, I don't want
Please nigger find me a glass, no
Home's only home till you're sick
That's what you get for fucking with us
Looking at the ocean  sail reflected in black eye 
She'd want a cloud that's *floating around*
And I fell into the beauty of another
You chuckle to yourself patting yourself on the back as you scoff
I'm looking for love
I cannot answer that now We're gonna have to remain as technicians come over
With lips and hands that will never meet again
You'll beat me with your bitter lies
We've got nothing left
You used to be someone I could trust
You'll return
Start bleeding, stop breathing
With a bullet in his head 
This is how it has to end
Ha ha ha, I love this shit
Do you want more
So where's he at I just might wait for
Tired of giving, lend the tools to rebuild my life
Is just the time that I'm bleeding you
A cutter in a forest of industry
And you can't trust a word that she says any more
I know you're faking it
Take your rapture blister burns
Tongues touch, feels like a gun bust
And I don't know, and I don't want to know, if she floats or drowns, if she floats or drowns
Than I need you
Someone's gun is laughing
Home grown vision compliments the senses, opens up my mind
I have seen to the future, and the future is here,
I drown the fields
Fudge along, a ticking bomb
Everyday  I hate it
I'm a living shadow in doubt of shape or size
U talkin' like a bitch
Now I'm with all of my loyal niggaz, breakin the bread
When there ain't nothin' left
Can you say "brainwashing" bbbbbrainwashing
But you don't show compassion all I see is a killer
For knowing this
All my friends ain't got no voice
Oh Baby You just want me empty
Them niggas psycho how they ball
To laugh or cry
He'd go to work, he'd come home,
New love is tasteless
Away from all this violence, live inside each other's head repeating
I'm sleepin' in empty pools and vacant alleyways
Your real life suicide blonde
I'm at the mall, buyin shit, like hot dog on a stick
Quand j'vois le score du FN, j'me dis qu'on peut contrer ça 
Your episodic aphorisms plague me like the poor decision to play the disinterested listener I'm like the old child that's grown an earachefull of manipulated tones, tired pragmatics that practice spitting verbs at their perfect prisoner And you navigate that skill with an aristocratic arm, yeah, you brew your toxic fantasy with predatory charm, you are an atheatric amateur who drools over every word but can't memorize one single part And you'll get what can't be got, ain't gonna never be received If you turn your back, boy, then you'll never leave
Not now
Concrete and bobbedwire, babies screaming
I got a rock and roll life
I don't want to follow you down
Another empty promise
And a broken world gone wrong
It didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it
No hope or faith
Give you the best that you've had, yeah
No, I want to be more than a pretty girl
As far back as I can tell, I think maybe it's because
If this is today  well, what the fuck's tomorrow
You know what you know what
Just one fucking thing
Tell me when did the light die
The failure which brands
I am always in reserve"
Erst wenn i woass
Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
A sample of the battle we waged against an animal
Your shit's like chocolate cake and 
It's like I concentrate on it real hard and it just doesn't work out
No, not chewin' poppin'
I work my fingers right down to the bone
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
And say that death was on sale today
We end up right here my friend
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin'
Will I burn at the stake
And I know it's hard sometimes, 
The feelings, the question, the price is too human for fucking sake, this is
Home on a Saturday night
It's time that we rocked three daunting nouns
And leave in the morning
I'm talking cool, calm, dominant phenomenal, monitor face to the wall opposite
Walkin' barefoot cross the floorboards
A mother fucker like me don't give a fuck to say
Oh, She'd just shut up and do what she does best
But I can't replace you in my heart 
I'm so relendless
Will you need us to fucking show you that we're harder than finding a fucking snickers bar in whole foods
With their buttersoft skin and their curly hair
Hey man what's happenin' with you
And as the final sounds of battle disappear, I had to say,
"Took her from heaven and gave her to me"
If they ain't never heard of it, ain't nobody trying it
I nailed my faith to the sticking pole
'Cause you know about that, aw aw aw
And the whole world sucks
A light that burns to reconnect my heart for what it's meant to give
Sink her to the level of the rest of us that inhabit the earth
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Jerking off with god trying to run peoples lives
Spit sisters, egotism
Hello sun, hello blue sky 
Not a single soul is breathing 'cause the Serengeti's bleeding
I need money,
That you're the selfish shit
Neon black flames cook the calm air
You try and seize the day but your infected,
Love makes me want to melt down
And not two hours later there's a song up on your website
Don't make me wake this baby, she don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do
So before you put that Red rag in your pocket I wanna see your fckin resume
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning,
And watch it break
Put my hopes beside the river, lay them down, let the water hold them under
How many ways can you polish up a turd
Were living in a boring world
Tell your grandmother to stop bitching, load your bong up, take a fatass hit right now
You're just a baby in the back seat 
A lover, a fighter, a saint, a sinner
It's us, find power
Into the sink of your faith
Say, "Fuck you I don't need you  get out right now"
Woman like a man, woman like a man, like a woman like a man, like a man
My flow is too fast, you can't contend with me there
Show me that I'm not the bad seed
Everybody put on your gas mask
I consider her my blood and it ain't come no thicka
You need a little less than what you take for granted
'Cause I need you
Ooh, I really hate your ass right now
Blood and disgrace
She told me she was pregnant and I pray to the god
You better watch how to talk when you talk about me
It's just life's anatomy
Got get a taste, I'll hold you down for thirty, she must be purty or open
No matter what you did or who fucked
I give it all back to you, yeah
Devastator violates with dirty fingers
Didn't turn out just like they thought
Will you fight or will you run
Mmh, 'cause everybody needs some company
Comatose dead on er feet needin release
Sculpture of man
I'm kinda mad and I don't wanna pile up the anger
Uhha I got my mindset,
Something spreading in my veins
As soon as you're born they make you feel small
Don't ask me what I want from you
Don't smother me 
How could I let you play me, I don't even know
Dependent deep ended friendship
Soldiers are cutting us down
My girl's knocked up we're in love
To the same old pain
Found a way to pawn the soul
When angels fuck and devils kiss, I'm sure
The glow reflects off the street
That day you said to me, 
I'll remember it
You're the new disease of today
Do it now, I told you do it now lets go
Oh, that's bullshit, baby, you just want rid of me
I've got music pounding in my head
I'll hit her with the mother fucking branch
Oh man, I hurt,
There's no blue left in your eyes
Raised their arms to the leader outside
Empirical humble Center of the world
You thought I'd be crawling
I'm trying not to hear your lies or see your makebelieve 
Tar and feathers hide your feelings
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Even if I'm not serious
The thought of slavery far behind
Ask the angels if they're startin' to move 
A burning heart deceived me and you really put me on,
Choices made
Even though the car is cold I feel your body heat setting me on fire
Oh, do me a favour, don't put me in the dark
And you're all I'm thinking of
Sign your name, I won't tell anyone
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the despair we feel
Talkin' 'bout the Moron Bros, tattooed fingers tattooed toes
INC niggas what's fucking with me
Is love an infection or a sick addiction
It's just because my frown
But you're still spitting fire
There's way too many different religions with vivid descriptions
Sighing and humming and watching the clock
What you see is not our sight
'Cause what I got to make a knot, is very hot
But when I'm in my car, don't give me no crap
Griff is back got  on it black
What about those times you left me alone in the bed, well I didn't mean it
The longest kiss
See me coming through your party hard without no bodyguard
So urban, so infantile, so angry, so young, and so poor
Your turn now
The root of the problem has been isolated 
In Vietnam a lot of niggas died young
On peut pas nous l'reprocher, quoi qu'on dise ou qu'on fasse 
Just keep your hands inside
Cut out your tongue, effigies are sold 
I've got to burn your eyes
And Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran
No more cheat n' lie
I believe in love, I'm married to my work
I need clothes
I'm killing everything you know
Is one to put me to sleep in such a way that
Pasty, dirty, sweaty, faithless
Transcendental illusion
The incredible, heterosexual, credible
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Lets see just how imposing you can be to me
I've never killed nobody
Or get the fuck out this bitch
What we're dealing with here is a total lack of respect for the law 
The sound, what a cheap trick
Sixty six kisses to
Well, your kids use drugs, same difference 
Now I know it
I've gotta have my voice be heard
For no cause, no cause at all
Counting out my sins on rosary beads
Laughing aloud at your expense, fed themselves on innocence  knife in your back
Always tellin' me I go with other men,
Even restored Man is cattle
Confusing what is real
Our cities, our farms, our factories
The end
At the thought of being stuffed in my home
Missed the bus I'm pissed as fuck need fifty bucks got lots to find
I remember when we used to want to hang out
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
And you're still inside my head
We accepted as truth
And hath blinded both their eyes
And the blood poured off the pulpit
Told you not to hang around
The rebound, the future
Hottest masturbatin' off the back of the neck of my soldiers' rhyme and
Hey God I really don't know what you mean
Speak your mind and tell me something
So if you're gonna lie
Which make this mother fall apart
Pain Veterans, crippling souls
Then amidst the noise of a thousand people's talk
We got the mother and her kids
Won't you say goodbye now
k for a verse, no album out
Why do I feel let down
I made my own world
Souls burn bright
I wasted half my life on the thought that I'd live forever
You've got to break out, you've got to prove you're alive
muera la ciudad y su contaminación
I'm the ghost that grew from the ground, 
All I ever wanted was to be like you
And proses what the world composes
Am I the only one, or is somebody else getting at you
And I scream as loud as anyone,
No telling when the reaper fed a post and snatch a fan
Before you sit back down
Asking can't you see 
Illegal business control America
Don't give a fuck if she lived
It's fair to say, could not believe my eyes
You lie to yourself 
And I believe what I do'll come back one day
I'ma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit
It's not the first time I've tasted pain
Que la chance se fait rare
Stop this torture
Blackout, it's gettin' dark in here
And I open my eyes to look around
The subconscious is burning
What would you feel
There armed lines of marching men
As the crowd shouted, "off with his head"
I can't stop thinkin' bout what she did wrong to me
Now that I'm getting closer and closer I know that you feel it
Lke if he had a shotgun
As the new master twists the nuclear screw,
Slum teasing
You're my ball and chain
And no one promised you
Hold back the day
I've always said after we tear it down, burn it to the ground
While preachers preach of evil fates
Je weet dat ik dat liever niet wil horen
You don't even know of the shit that drivin' me
Cyanide in bullets, so I should follow my stats
But my heart is a whore
Deceiving the honest man
The wasteland to maintain sing cavaliers by name
On the Island far away in a place where NOBODY know
God gave you life
Now I know what a fool I've been
Across this big wide world
A life of guilt and pain, of holy misery
Why they love you when I hate you when they hate the way I love you, solar 
Shapeshifter, guest lister, big faker,
Lost my faith in everything
A massive offensive you seem to me obsessive
Die little baby screaming
It makes me mad
It's neither sweet nor bright
Im Badezimmer rauscht die Dusche
Your metal heart
Does it scare you that we don't need you
No pipe did hum, no battle drum did sound its loud tattoo
Killing friend or foe
Project war, spill the one verse four
If it sounds like I did you wrong
Your enemies and your choices, son
Just wait and see
Well, I don't mind dying
We have shot them down from the skies above
I complained for a day to the House of Representatives
Mary's got some deep shit, Mary does not forget
Side cobra clutch, Only truth can sober us
Take a look around the city is lit tonight
Hey God, can this world really be as sad as it seems
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
'Cause I'd have left otherwise
My emotions more fear than rebellion
Don't tear it away from me, I need you to hold on to
As minutes pass we keep on dancing on our graves
This is how a heart breaks
Does that mean I'm burnt
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
And you didn't see the rain you didn't feel my pain I was left inside with no complaints and with lies you feed these fuckin' guys though you know she's everything you'd like
In the end, makes you better, yeah
And you're telling me 
You say you're feeling lonely
Vague is the flame that used to burn in your eyes
You would leave us only the more upset
I'll shut you up
They say the lion eats tonight 
I guess not and you don't deserve it
Fighting back the tears
Hush my baby go to sleep
Worthless denial across your face,
Ten seconds left
And I'm feeling bored 
Just burnnn it down
Yellow sky
I don't believe you'll change
You're not welcome here
Another cheap shotgun in your Benz
Now I'm on the run, I'd do it all again
Pretend you're the daughter of elvis and you're married to
I cannot tolerate you
Turning you on to a world full of shit
You don't have a soul
And I'm wild
Think I'll drink the sea
And now I see that I don't need friends
We sit her and hope that it passes by
But it's the little things
I think I sealed my fate
But straight away you just moved into position again 
What kind of love from a nigga would black your eye
Fear and a snare hell has eyes
Now say you hate homos again
Tell me where we stand
We'd hate to see 
Until they run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
Till working it out
dimenticata in qualche oceano
Can't forget the war mode
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
Fools think they killas, they own a
My rage burns deep inside me
But they're helpless here as babies 'cause they're only here on holiday
You'd have to be damn near dead to see the nights I been through
Her tongue was like a scythe
I wonder how much shit you'd talk
"Next time," she said "I'll let those people choke"
Everybody wanna be some fat tycoon
You have soul machine
Excuse me, Mother, while I scream and shout
Is passed over looked over 
And my lust returns
They knew the world wasn't flat
Now it's fucking gone 
There's no god
For as it was written my friend
I wanna hear you say that
Push me over the edge
And said it like you meant I wasn't a woman
'Cause I ain't dyin' in the middle of nowhere
And you know
Many miles away
As the world hurls towards seven billion more listeners
Oh look, they're trying to bite the helping hand that feeds them
Now it's on, pow, what you to do I'm askin' you
Another load of shit about how it's never been
Grew up to be and do all those sick things you said I'd do
I'll stop worrying 'bout what you're doin' doin'
'Cause you'll learn the difference if you Dog the Nine
We want to, have to, need to 
We know you got 'em, we know you got 'em
Another suburban family morning
Can't recall my crime
Because I'll finally touch what lies behind your walls, I'll make them fall
I can't remember how I got my last scar
You drive like you're in a tank
Opens up  all you can see  knowledge to be
I'm sorry for the time
Just you wait till everyone is hooked
I'm not buying what you've sold
My quija board told me I should go back to bed
Me and that sweet woman got a license to fight
And waste my cyclops time and mess up my cyclops mind
A break like this is hard to find kid
Of the bouncer and I trust my guitar
All through the day and all through the night
Close your ears if you don't want to hear
Never say no
He came to give life give it abundantly
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against
It is you I set my standards to to every walk of life
I want you
Ten years from now I'll be paying still
But them things wasn't worth none of the pain that he'd bring
The people that you know are the ones you hate, the ones you hate
Get ya drink on, we build the bombs, spit in ya face
Every time that man struggles and fails
That lines can and should be drawn
That I'll never end transcend transcend
Good sister, bad sister
That forest burned The radio
I don't know how you call that love
But the rolling papers for your grass 
You promised me another dream, another day
Your lonely ache, I can make, disappear
Dictatorship kill off inside
"Now I can taste the war that I've been fighting
Right now, somebody else has that number
We need help, we really need help
That we can really enforce our will, on humanity
Y'all be killin' me
Inspired by the monsters, the files of life full of stars and stripes
Fuck this I won't bow to you leave your chains to me
When I'm standing top the bright lit city
I don't really want to be a pretty girl
Where she gets the habit
Where is the courage that
Since the stars predicted something new would reconnect our worlds
What the fuck you think you're doing to me
I think it's time we let this story end
Sayin' we left the hood
Ooh I played it out, out, out, out
So back out bitch, see how we knocking the most hard
What the fuck do you got that'll impress me so I can feel half of the magic
Where everything that I say could just kill it all
The beatings will continue
Turn your anger into lust
I guess there's no one to blame
And pull the ground right over you
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
And if you ever said you missed me then don't say you never lied
Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
It's all in my head
With this hungry girl 
You're not dropping me loose without a fight to hold on for my own life
They'd have you believe, everyday was halloween
Annihilated a people And you come to us
I'm in the same old mess again
I could've saved some face
See it all makes sense, doesn't it
I'm the man, and you're the man, and he's the man as well
It's the truth, my child
Woman like a man, like a man, like a woman like a man, like a man
And gold lines no lead streets
All its innocence
I haven't drank or smoked nothing in over twentytwo days
And every where you go you almost always get this beef
And your mother got scared and locked the door
Of an SS whore
Everyone ignores you
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
Of refugees and lonely people
Oh, big grey mother, I love you forever
The one who's bed you sleep in
When I rolled your fat ass over you were nervous and scared
Super demon seed running wild and below
I want to make you bleed 
Damn another alamo
Are ya living alone or with your family
Is a land where the sand's made up of crushed up wax
She'll turn around  you'll trash her
A sister, a daughter, old school, a beginner
Saw heaven and hell were lies
Causing head spasms
We can hear the black out orchestra singing
To pack up all my things
Repeat  till end
There was an element of grace
If I did it fast you know that's an act of kindness
Burn the world and let her soul be free and ignite
To lemon scent the sky
But now I see you
You know, you know
Goin' fo' a nigga neck
As the songs scream to fill her quiet evening
Take it pull my hair back My hair back
Take everything left from me
Been traveling on the road to nowhere
I am tied to the ground
Do you expect me to wait here
Doing�meaningless�shit�over�and�over
Chico Science talking about a folktale from northern Brasil
I want to know if I'll heal inside
Break your fuckin' face tonight
How much more for power Hands tick towards devastation
Madman
You one I know you won't go very far
Ever since we said it
With this blade turned in on me
All those purple track suits make me sick
It may be dark but I wanna talk
You give me yours, I'll give you mine
You're not a movement
I paid dues, nothin' to lose, Steady bustin' off weapons In 's
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
Come on, motherfucker 
Got niggas wondering like "What the fuck did I do"
It's hard to push for the truth
I thought if I acted like someone else
Until our deathbed
Would do you no harm
Feel the burn
Boy, she makes me sing bambalam
As hot as the moon on the tenth day of June
God Tell me what you believe God
We're not the ones who leave the homeless in the streets at night
How's it feel to be the prey
All the time indulging in his base desires
All good clean fun, have another stick of gum
Been gone more days this year than I have been home
The wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
But the birds will sing a sweet melody
You end up right here my friend
The promise that you made
Now I'm fucking ruined 
One day, maybe next week
Don't need your kiss goodnight
Hardness of the heart reprobate mind
Nothings hurts
Unless you kill a murderer with a lethal syringe
And fuck you motherfuckers in the jury box fuck you
And left, right
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody needs to know
Well I knew there'd come a day
I thought you talked to God
Though you found you need more than me
A respected occupation
We cause tragedy, erratically
Sedan delivery is a job I know I'll keep
Here's some mud made of blood
Get drunk, get drunk, get drunk
The best friend
Prying up So you want to tear me down
Malignant intentions bingeing on the lie
Some people get by
And disgranite me so you can take advantage yeah
Bad ass at bat, man, forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win
Deep in the sky a storm he'd seen
A phase I suppose, it's just one of those days,
So, so, so sick of this life
Hoes make the world harder than it have to be
'Cause you're drivin' me mad
It's murda murda, you know it's murda murda
Forgive me as, I burn into the evening
In broad daylight
"You shot the s out her Lent I'm proud of you Go home"
Speak it truthfully or speak it never
I'd like to take your head, place it
I can't feel
Trust my soul, it's easy
When reason dies behind closed doors
Swarm of the pure blood like malicious piranhas
For the taking
Didn't stop until she hit New Orleans
The game is lost, eternal love united with the eternal hope
Become frail and fall to the ground
I was born to pay for my previous sins
But you know I ain't no clown
Walk the coolest walk you know
The crumbled cities stand as known
All women wanna lay
A perfect kill 
I'm a knife, I'm a rope, I'm a bitter pill
Did I truly do the things that you've described
Send me on my way with a question to ask myself
The clergy they come in and say it is a sin 
Oh you got to go nege wanbyeokhan sarang chaja garago
The white boy's plan is being readied night and day, night and day
Some people can't be told you know they have to learn the hard way
To shut down the devil sound
Dead girls dance they burn and twirl
Burn your eyes
Blood on her skin
Always remember
Uniform man got a nervous partner
Full of device, not devotion
Your weak eyes cry tears of the meek
Just shadows on the ground
Never been hated
In letting go, I am so proud of what I've done, yeah
Kill beasts like heart disease
Pleasure knowing you I wish you all the best of luck
And when you blamed it all on me I should have known
Took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us
I'm fighting for gun rights to shoot a nigga in his dome
All filled with sound
Chandeur peutêtre que je devrais
Crawling in my skin Crawling in my skin
At those lies that night or empty promises
You break me up 
Eye on metronome, watching the way you write her name
You said"run run run as fast as you can but you can't run run from the childcatchers hands"
Don't move, the mornin's not a pretty sight
No forgiveness you're no martyr
'Cause I browsed down, his fingers curled
The engines idled in the tanks that day 
Because someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Don't you understand
Where is the god of men and children
Is it tough to watch
Out of my life
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
And played a different game
Of my dick that cums lead
The rebels fell, embedded in brick
I can't do nothing
I believe in defending
You serve no purpose
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
I've had enough of feelin' sick
Off with her head, all dressed in white
He said "Don't ever mention my name there or talk of all the nights you cried
It's a fault I have, I know
The limit of your mind is what they're counting on all ends
You're skin and bones, I'm a nervous wreck
Promise you won't ever see me cry
I won't be there no more
So it seems our people starve from lack of understanding
It ain't no secret we be headin' for a bust
I know, now, that I'm forever dirt
They'll tell you that it's not going to hurt
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
And leather whatever, however, I'm still rockin'
The lying truth, the virgin whore, the quiet storm
All these noflow, gimmicky ass fired up behaviors
Y'all gotta feel us
Don't give me give me give me your misguided help
The whole world hates your song
In your regret that sounds absurd
Life's cold
All the streets
See, they're not mine, so you gotta let 'em go
The horsemen are crashing through the gates
Here's a product that promises to do nothing
With all of your gold stories all told
 miles later the sky has changed
Knock, knock, baby answer the door
I am the assassin, providing your nemesis 
Makin' niggas clear the room, like a dyke flee a dick
War tactics, they make me sick
I want your everything and I want you dead
This night will not be forgotten 
Close up hands to silhouette, crow
Blacking out your eyes
This house knows all I have done
There's a warning sign on the road ahead
You couldn't leave well enough alone
And as I lie awake now crying and bereaving
When all I want is near
Inbreeding scars to innocence
Something too massive to hide
Trying to keep you, trying to please you
Yo, roll the dro and spark, a bunch of animals like Noah's Ark
A day we'll never face, we're only
I can watch my world evolve
Or like a statue of Stalin after the fall of the Soviet Union
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
I know if I know another way
I keep that on stock for all hard rocks
Black clouds, sky falling
You know I've got so much to say
There's a fire in the peach pit x
So you start with your powertrip
Procrastinated measrues decreases our chance to save
They can never tell
And since you've gone, you're just Another Day
Make sure that you're watching
I bet you'd only run
Whatever
So you're somebody who brags about their innocence
Fuck 'em and their law 
Live my life in a prison cell
These girlfriend lips
All she could say as she felt those tear drops falls was
I studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb as opposed to the loaded nose who pray armageddon is numb and that's unevenly rendered to those who grew up thinking faith was the surrender of reason but not a reason to surrender
It's a thin line between paper and hate
So let fall the rain
Ruled by greed and by pocrisy and the superficial mind fuck again
Yeah, I know
The world is my oyster
'Cause I'm a liar, yeah, I'm a liar
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
Strain the limit of compassion
One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
So, die young and stay pretty
Ought to be Sunday best
Pull down the wires, set you on fire  I'm getting too tired to resist,
And I'm fearful I'm fearful I'm fearful of flying
And the stains coming from my blood
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around
Your back door man, hey
It's in your head x
And walk in our shoes
Taking hiphop to a whole new level
'Cause I remember all the times I tried so hard
It's bang bully bust rhymes, I'm coming to squash shit
Than be a happy idiot in your happy little world
My soul to the dead to achieve
Until one day he just appeared
It's time for me to face the music
Fucking destruction, fucking destruction
Haven't you noticed me fillin' the fridge
'Cause you should've known better
Don't fight back
I see you, I see you, trying to break free
"We've really got those suckers fooled,
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,
The warmth has just been choking me
I hope you know
You know anklebiters gave you a false perception
All your misconceptions pummel me into the ground
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame
I never had faith in you
Look deep in the mirror but try not to see 
I opened doors that would have blocked Their way
To have swift right hand
Freethinking renegade social
A system of gods from each of the brawling tribes
There's no room
Believe relieve
And we hold on
So much to discover
You'll probaably only get to see a dollar in the end,
The trust you took advantage of
Laughing as these lies unfold
Drown your fears in alcohol
Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me
I feel free
In an ideal world
They're looking for a motive 'cause they don't know why he done it
Lets go to war
Rat race
Why you trying to be hardcore, you fucking homo thug
I wanna hear you say that you were wrong again
My, my the cruelest lies are often told without a word
Go away and close the door
You'll never know
Then there's a hole in my head pump up the volume you said
Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby
Sucking your anus
I woke up this morning
I sit observing in disgust
That I was right in the end
Not leaving, not talking
Drink fast and enjoy your buzz, take back streets to avoid the fuzz
Just go up in that motherfucker, get the motherfuckin' money and get the fuck up outta there Aight
Everyone wants to be a murderous fantasy
Me and amount of people that's feeling me is a hot percentage
Ich hab die ganze Scheiße satt
And I'll leave this body behind me
Ask my mom, "What's the problem, why am I feelin' this way"
Punk, 'cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck wit
 When I write  thrice divine with this goddess sight
So run nigga run
And you sat on the corner of my bed 
Suddenly that joe kicks hard in my veins, I cool down
Who shot four puppets in a line
Get the bird, bring her down to the ground from out the air
All the things you knew Science, mathematics, thought
You know its comin'
I am the power of a woman
Don't you hesitate now,
These beads of sweat I'll dry, out of my eyes
E' un amico che non vale
A lot of you drink and smoke, suck a lot of dick on the low and probably got HIV
I recall a friend of mine
I will keep you safe and sound
I've had enough
Oh, Does he know that place below your neck
Do you sleep anymore
Until the crystal cracked
Airplanes falling out of the sky
Somewhere someone's gun
"We had a friend, a talking man
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
Justice is sinking to the bottom of the sea
So don't try to hug me, please and thank you,
Will you die in the perfect war
Die Verkäufer und die Käufer deiner Waren, sieh sie dir an
She was a bloody disgrace
I follow you across the county lines
One day you'll kiss your rabbits nose, pick up the phone
Only stands as proof of man's insanity
You might as well be talking to yourself
Constantly harassed, And brain washed into believeing
Forgive me for my sins and all the shit that I did
Shots heard underground round the rapture
I assure you
I've learned to live with the lies
Pushing So you want to tear me down
No bodies
If there were no rain
My mind has settled
Hey, yo I don't even know you and I hate you
Down on the ground
A life unwed
I live for You now
'Cause I can't stop now Simple as that
'Cause I feel it too, we all love to hate
Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha
I used to want to make you mine
It feels good to see freedom embraced
All that time, it cannot be ; Oh my eyes, it cannot be
Cause no one is around
I step into the great unknown
Feel the might of his evil wrath
Hark the angels sing
I'd give it all up for one shot at
Do you fall gracefully into bed anymore
Wake up man, you're in my dreams
I'm told the case is now closed
I feel like a monster, oh
One chance to make it right
Mentre le ideologie si estinguono
Fall Our weakened hands
Silence overwhelms my mind
Ain't nobody say that it would be smooth sailin'
I didn't come here lookin' for a fight
What will people do
What more can my friend do
BomBom the truth shall come
Things that I wish you could comprehend yeah, comprehend
God bless the fucked up usa
Those nails did lay rest another chaste and serpentine lunar sacrifice on the eighth or ninth
Stand in lines Rape you 
He said "You don't understand"
I'll make this week disappear
Bleed motherfucker, bleed
If you ever want to see it again
She likes the sound
Bought some smack tried to break the heroin ringring
You play with your 'top'  till your eyes start to spin
To the stains on your clothes
Your left in the past
This is who I crown, now without me
He's got the bad boy snot
Mummy, Mummy, Mummy I'm not an abortion
Why can't I get my girl back
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
When we find you we will skin you alive, we'll pluck out your eyes
You love this ass, more than her pussy
Well you ain't shit and you ain't nothin'
A black out 
se vendió al aplauso de los cursis conscientes
Still, ling'ring on, the disconnect
We the clearest, you can fear us
To give birth to a mighty assassin
Like it was me that put that switch in his hand
I've lost all sympathy, only living for me, preservation
I just want you here with me
Walking on fire, now the world will keep its distance
﻿Too many faces are glowing with pride and assurance
And understanding eyes
Sole defenders of the longest night new york had never slept,
See, they're missing the new album, I'm missing my only friend
Fuck all you Motherfuckers
And there's a changing constellation of balls as we are playing
And if I get drunk, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
Don't get what you say about the pans in the kitchen mama
Through the doors of a clinic
Stop searching and find Me
Look at your husband now No, I said look at him
You want it bad
Snakes get fat while the good rats die
I'm not a friend at all, oh, please let me go
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it Forget it
We have to change this world
Seething, blinding, screaming
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you 
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
You're full of shit
Assassinated fast if they catch you talking trash
In these words, tearing me and make me bleed
That could hold me down
But I'm tellin' you what they do
Lemme know where to put your rosary at
I tried, we'll drown ourselves in misery tonight
You there on the fault line
So now you're scared of love
Now that we have sieged you and pleased you
I'll always be your shadow,
I'll rock with it with no competition on this shh
To miss such a beat would have been outrageous
Expect nothing less
Peace I hate the word
How can you choose when you don't have a voice
We nearly signed it with our blood
A sink full of dishes and some aqua lube
To watch the things you gave your life to broken
Your mind I know you like the fact I'm so bad when I spit up on the track
Too many happy faces
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Ever since
He'll always come in last
Super size our tragedies You can't define me or justify greed
She ain't gonna wanna share
The drugs are late
From the topFrom the topFrom the top
Then they fall apart and blame it on cheddar
Woman oh my god
While you sittin' here hatin', yo' bitch is hyperventilatin'
So you look around the tiny room and you wonder where the hell you are
I thought that you, you were the one
Do ya wanna getcha teeth
And hey if you want me to 
And you are a liar
But I'm not quitting no
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
It's been headed this way since the world began
Bediademed, souled
Let's keep it friendly
He wouldn't stand for how you act like a bitch
There is something comical, to the idea
This message is for anyone who dares to hear a fool
Destroy your customs, you'll have no say
I say my head is hurting
I swear I have nothing to prove
And my arms get sore
Ignore the sun, covers over my head
How many others are out there
Sitting on a fence is a man who looks up to his guardian
Just don't know
Buddy, we need to talk to you
Stop this murder
She holds me close
It's no surprise that a brother's got wise
Their land deeds, their hired guns
And I ain't seen no fucking talking snake unravel from trees
Get me out just to dry my tears
Drooling polished jackboot monsters, tracking the scent of a sleeping child
You own everything in your sight in your sight now
I'm gonna spit every word
Lock the door, burn the disc now everybody hit the mutha fuckin' floor
Fuck fuck fuck a war
It's a bullshit three ring circus sideshow of
You wanna sleep on me Overnight
I'm not a throbbing squirm
So I can come to my senses
Causing more than war slaying rappers, commercial or horrorcore
It never looks like making any difference
You are a liar and you are a lie
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
I am a fool I know, I know, I know
If life is to grow
I'm gonna kick it all in
And I think you know that
While other MC's are talkin' bout up with hope down with dope
That binds moment of thought
The number of my moves
No, I don't wanna
I can't take it, I can't take it, I can't take it, oh no
To your girl's life like the Daily Soaps
 dispatch what is your emergency
Oh oh oh oh, If looks could kill then death would be my name my name
Flushed in their list of crimes
Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt
Mom works hard, still working on her masters
A tragic poem that forever burns on my brain
Shivering in static for us in this place of angry tears
What if there's no time to lose
More love for the people
You better tell that girl to step
The more I feel my back's increasingly compelled
Somebody keep my balance
I can't breathe 'cause I don't want to breathe no more
You move your mouth, you shake your tongue, you vibrate my eardrums
I feel so sick and lonely, I want a real girl that will get to know me
And you know what Thank God
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
It's four o' clock in the fucking morning
Unsheathe the blade within the voice
You're so in love, you hope she wants
Aaaaall you lil' faggots can suck it
But how the fuck you s'posed to grow up when you weren't raised
Round here, we always stand up straight
I just wish you'd tell me something 
Go on and drop your fucking names
Attack medic stretcher call cracked crazy header fall
BC hailed it heaven, I inhaled it, too
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
It makes you a liar
Handle whatever's comin' when I get there, but I'm good what
Me and your mom we've been noticing lately that you've been having a lot of 
Watch your step to Hell it's a long fall
You want to feel it
I will fall completely
You should be honored by my lateness
I never liked working at Mickey D's
And cursed pride
I said I'm under the gun, round here
You were never shit,
To bleed for the 
Get down  back where you started
Development wants
Cleansing yourself of the past
Baby, you're mine
Wealth and power crashing in
Not a single soul is breathing 'cause the Serengeti's bleeding
Ice that I wear, clothes that I dry
I'm so glad I got the fuck out of our hometown
Sometime when it always seemed to be just us and them
Ieeieei and I cry every waking day
So come at me with your moon and burn me in the stars 
I just can't stand the bullshit I wish I was so far away from it
And I don't know how much more I can take
But you turn your back when I walk up
You've got nothing to believe in
wünsch mir ein großes Schneckenhaus
Jacob wrestled the angel
I am made of shamrocks, I am made of stern stuff
Honor lies in an unmarked grave
And I'm still here singin', thinkin' 'bout the government
Better, better, better, better not tell
I never told you, but I feel you must know
Rails until the city sun 
So step aside and I'll take control
The things that we hold dear
"I'ma let y'all know one thing man"
Come take a look in my eyes
When you know it all
It's not for love but I'll gladly take your money
I should've known better when you started to act weird
I'm still standing here on my feet, God won't you just knock me to my knees, please
My enemies, I let 'em get a load of me gat
And let's just say that things look different now
One good turn deserves another 
The day that I was born
Chi scorre così Nessuno
Get it, abuse it, and what I'm left with is useless
As if it matters now
Pretend it works a while, it's transmitted live
I want to tell you
You thinking with your one brain, watch you decapitate
Virtuoso is an unidentified flying object to make your space shuttle 
A generation with no place
Here's a new chicken shit angel eyed boy
Walking like each others ghosts
I know you won't
They'll brainwash you until you see their way
But the prince got colon cancer fate takes a dump
Well you know that the world
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of my boxcar door
When the cops show up, they're gonna get the finger
I need
Drunken pussies, what I'm thinking
Venomous verbs of ruthless candour plagiarise assassins fervour 
But when you come to my house with that draft shit
It's some other man in the hand in hand
Turning your backs on the problems that surface
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me  look bitch
My mental state is fucking me up and I cried a pond
You can hear what's on my lips but you don't know
Just another face in the crowd
Break me, tell me as I die for you, for you 
I do ghetto shit
Mais toi dismoi
That I can beat, I can beat myself up with
Bend me, break me, any way you need me
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter
But it slipped through our hands
No way, no way, no way you're gonna stop me
When this plane Crashes down there goes all our luck
I hope you get the fuck out of our hometown
I need a piss
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
For another unknown soldier
You've got commercial sex appeal
Sharpened tongue
But bearing the taste that moves either one of you
Lost your rhythm and your stealing' fire breather bringing smoke
Backstabber greedy fucking fit haver 
My own bright eyes 
I'm the invisible man
'Cause it's the little things
The pain
All alone in my thoughts and fears
You liar
Mistic, With the mischief you bring you senseless bitch you out of
You know why
Choked back years of memories
I gave your friends all a chance
You feel like you and that's just beautiful, that's beautiful
Oh no, I don't understand
Would you save my life is I got sick
And firetrucks
 miles of separation, you're still real to me
All your sins will be forgiven
Yeah what's the good of forgiveness if the sinners go free
Always darkest before the dawn
You say I'm not your kind of girl
There's a door in the house
And when you get to tha end, you'll find a chair
As the skycrape imge cies, in neon lights it peaks itself
There's too much doubt in my mom's words
They sniffin' yeyo, I don't know what to say, yo
So you want inside of me
You know
Aim for the face lift
Aw it's the little things
But wait You never knew what was at stake
You are the scum of the earth
You gotta get it all out now
There is no fucking you, there is only me
And you swore that there was no one else with you
That he not busy being born is busy dying
Bury them bones
Love stirred up a storm inside me
You're dancing in your sleep
"Death campaigns are a fucking gold mine"
Push pause on the game What the fuck's your name
Everybody's got a little something to hide, but me
The morning after
But I don't know when it comes and it goes
Put my eyes away, and I had to get away
Dead ringer in my head
To my everlasting shame
Someday I won't listen to you bitch 
Show me respect
They just swallow me whole
We might as well just stay all day in bed
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
But a forty mile walk would do us both a world of good
Spread your legs shut your mouth
Two tickets to a film I don't remember
I swear, I shall not deceive thee Yeah
If anything happens, don't fuckin' blame me, white America, fuck Bill O'Reilly
Let me hear it tonight
And it's hard to believe it could come down to this
But that's no excuse for it
I had myself fooled into meeting you
Oh yeah Oh yeah Let me tell you, I got it up here see
Then I gotta open up another can of asswhippin
I don't need to take revenge 'cause they're coming to get you
You must understand me, the end is surely coming
Gallons of crap that nobody really needs,
Bark out abuses to the weakest at the back of the line
And the gun's in my hand and I know it looks bad 
Counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums
And across the kitchen table
Unstable situation
We'll make a joyful noise
Became a monster, atop of the world
Buss it free fall
I'm not like you 
And you're mine
This song goes out to my good friends
Don't feel right
In the few short years since I was a young boy
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
Oh no, I don't think so
I'm a selffulfilling porno queen, yeah
You had a chance but now there's nothing
Ignore it
Did the job but it up and died
I want to kill this killing wish
Don't go knock on my door
Kerosene around, now what do we do
I'm not here to let you down
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
So now I've got you wonderin' if I've got it in for you
I'm a sister and I'm a motherfuck
Pay in blood
Won't be my fault when you're painted in the corner of a nogood life, this is
Behind my back
All the shit that you ever wanted in one MC, Hop has it
When you crawled into my bed
I want to live
Choking on beauty
And I'm wild
To strip tender flesh from these swine
Don't let it fuck with you
Symbolisms, socialism's live life lead, learn
Of things said to thing heard
I'll make you feel LIKE A NATURAL WOMAN
And a bleeding hand
I got the boat so we don't drown
I was hoping that you'd know better than that
Lives no more
Let me burn your eyes
Within the rhythm of my fucking feet
I like the things that you said
If there's anyone throwing dirt at my name then you know he be toast
I then rolled wit the traffickers worked in the Maximas
I bet you muthafuckas will too
When another girl violates that
How many times until it strips me and my big mouth strikes again
Hiding behind flags of immunity
And it feels like that you're with me
Living in a rat race
Am I to believe that you hold the key
And his her power all in her club sandwich
On a ticket back to London
There's nothing here but a shadow, nothing here
You can never touch me now
Don't tell me what your name is
They had our brothers beating us Called us createns plus monkeys
It's not cause for a repression
Now is the season for war with no reason
You know I feel like a preacher waving a gun around
I feel for your lies no more
And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise, sounds like a fucking poltergeist
Not on your life
'Cause I'll see your face in hell, my friend
Gun Control, the sound of soul
She lost all her innocence
Look at the tiger jumping out of her mouth
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic
To feel like I'm alive
Sitting here tryin' to get that old thing back thing back oh
Not from me its no no
Black women you are not a bitch you're a Goddess
And I don't need to be rescued
Oh, I see you in my mind
Welcome to the death of a century 
Smoke the sky
That's why I give props to niggaz who is independent
Lookin' for somebody
Everybody wants somewhere
Eradicate my knowledge of my history
There ain't no scapegoats left to blame
You promised me another wish, another way
When I come home, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
I promise that there's no crashing until I see this through
How many people die
I can't take this now
Boy you don't wanna fuck wit me Don't wanna fuck wit me
All our pain
I want, it want it, need it done
No one no one
Has been eating my belief away
And I couldn't care less about what you want to say
I need to know
Voting doesn't work, 
A morning dog howl in the street
Who the hell are you to tell me
It's that famous shit, you know
The world will turn with no one left to live
In the door
Walkin' among our people
Amy Moore blew her top
Man, I been waitin' all night now, that's how long I've been on ya
Tyler you obviously have some fucking problems
Is there any way to stop this merry go round
Would you expect any less from the people at the top
Pra seu governo, o meu estado
Like a walk in the park, like a hole in your head
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Where only kids are still alive
Dope thoughts come when I hear a kick drum
They were just looking for what they wanted to see
Like I don't owe nobody nothing
And so a third of my life is gone with nothing to show
You'll feel a lot better
Intend to deny, but when it comes back around
I know you're not bashful
Do what you feel
And I think you need some help
In a face a view, through eyes this world collides
Postin my head from myself to get back to me
I'm stuck here and I know it
Nothing's real and nothing lasts
And pray the machine falls to sleep
So here's a present to let you know I still exist
Let me tell you something We need a twoandahalf hour movie about the Doors, folks No, we don't I can sum it up for you in five seconds, okay "I'm drunk, I'm nobody I'm drunk, I'm famous I'm drunk, I'm fucking dead" There's the whole movie, okay Big Fat Dead Buy in a Bath Tub, there's your title for you
On the warpath, unrelenting
The question's asked, do you still believe it
Well the man tells me my future, is not so far away
You were the one who believed
In these days you can get no rice
Close your eyes, picture me rollin',
Take a chance and follow my reason
And I'm still waiting
Fourteen years ago tonight
Lately you've found I break between white walls that burn the nerves
Und warum
Hey rabbit, I came to win
 Sameh Zoonoobee Allah 
My optimism is masking my failure
Real thug shit
Throats choking on a kiss,
You drew the sparkle back into my eyes
They will drown in their greed
Good grades on the wall, niggas hate to see me do it major
Where's the fuck you
Life's not meant to be disposable
I shot Reagan with the help of the secret service
I, I know what you need
And I know that I'm better
I might as well use a gun
You know, I'm beginning to think
You try to get me back
You assume just because I'm a rapper, you can approach me in a hoish way and get something out of it
And the mighty of Earth will have no other recourse
Fall in chains
Ici on prend des risques on mise gros
I'll bathe in red, I'll break his every bone
And then the blood from severely severed ear
I've lost my mind in wanderlust
And even if her plane crashes tonight she'll find some way to disappoint me
Wrap your arms 'round this everlasting kiss
And I'd have no time to grieve
I knew my enemy was near
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hiphop
I'm staggering in last night's clothes and it's starting to rain
We don't need you, we don't need you
I don't care if you're ready or not, the sentiment tears my hold
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
Think before you sink to the bottom
So, go on and make your families proud
Paranoid of my retaliation, living in fear
At the heart of the sun
You don't know what's right or in your mind
Now that we have seized you and pleased you
Are you still around, why haven't you managed to die yet
And you know, you know, you know it all went wrong
You just got burnt
So easy to control, bring to harm
"I can not seem to say what I want to relate, but by His power I will say
There is no going back, this wasn't meant to last
With hardened mind I traveled, with hardened mind I conquered 
He thinks I've got no time
No, not chew pop
I see the world and it all looks blue
My rap skills will thrash you
Get served that riddle that kills your character
Does it hurt now
There's a lady who knows
In the darkness where the angels cry
And as we gaze down from this midnight's sky,
Schizophrenic nightmares sending shivers down my spine
Bloodsport, anymore heads face the blade
Pretend I died Into the hell I call my head,
And it is no fun
Till all the eyes that look at me
It was said and done but I needed some more, 
So you can fuck yourself
I'm not ready for sincerity
And angels lie when stars cry
A man dies like a butterfly
Disputed I will not be locked down
From Apartheid days, now caught up with AIDS
You can buy god it's Monday
I'm not the one who made the world what it is today
It's not what I took from you
Control your thoughts,
Choosing left from right
In the crowd of pain
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
Make a move, I saw you winking
The flesh summons pain and I do the same
Or a homosex, hermaph or a transaves
Wanna be a member, wanna have some fame
If you flip me off, I'll get in your face
One to myself, another to the multitude
Survivors There are an uncounted number of the dead tonight
I don't know why
The sweat of miners digging diamonds,
Where the poor have now become the enemy
And I know it got you reelin' 
This Parisian sex flick
You give me dirty looks because I been what you want
'Cause I can sex your brainain
Peace of mind's so hard to find
Syd gay ass, puttin' her clit on other bitches nipples and shit whatnot
My heart is signing offdirect from AOL
You want so bad to be the victim
Bert, fuck my ass
Because their hair gel that they use isn't tested on animals
War, war, war
'Til come the day when the last fight's won
Return my love x
If ignorance is bliss
Thorn in my fucking side
I'ma come back for my clothes
There's still songs about bitches from  witnesses ha ha
I've seen alotta women from all around the world
Mmmmmmm Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
The road you cross, isn't quite a crossroad
You wanna be kitch
I'm channeling seventeen dead revolutions
Kill television kill television kill television difficult, isn't it
Für was kann man ein Kind missbrauchen
That day is not today
Shot and shot again 
And it's not what I wanted ti to be
Make it stop, oh, I can't make it stop, it's on again
And they would take our drugs and money, as they pick our pockets
There's no cure
And let that fever play
A man has gun
And coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouth
When the hook sets in and when this all ends
Time passed, my oppression got you living with drama
Oh I wish, I wish, I wish I was born a man
Have you turned yourself from me
Facilitated, manipulated, it's so indicative
Running 'round in circles, kids come out to play
I'll be the biggest dick that you ever had
And your aphasia strikes a bargain with the barter yardie
With enough effort and knowledge
"I am not your savior
You're gonna wait a while
Looking at me lying
You're somebody's king
And it turned out to be a scab
Ain't no fuckin' marble memorial
Hope one day that you realize
The reek of your lies draws flies
Witch cunt burn this girl
And she thought it really funny
 dispatch ma'am where inside the house are you
Oh my God all the people in the street
It's not the last time we'll fuck it up
As she sent her straight to hell
pero nunca quedas mal con nadie
Let the pass be the pass sugar
Try to take our souls from us, while the state patrolling us
I love you Oh God, my brain is racing
I was still a child when you caught me and tied me to your bed
Oh my heart
And still get called their friend
It's out of key and foolish
Get off my back
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party
The state of The State, it makes you feel sick,
Can I just be another risk you're running now
Just like a rat race
Now I know I'm taking the biggest piece
I see bitch in your eyes
Mr PIG, could I fuckin' see
Holding us back
Intelligangsta fin dal giorno uno
And when the fad dies out
Some guy refuses to fight, and we call that the sin
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun
I don't recognize the world
That no one ever knew was love
But this is my chance and I'm going to take it
Who cares if you die
'Cause I'm a liar, a liar, liar, liar, liar, liar
Milling about, spilling there feelings in the air
And my people building monuments to weather the flood,
I need you right now Me likey
And threaten place always in my face
Er war von Träumen irritiert 
On English land the people dance
I didn't disagree the world is too gruesome
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
They're your arms, it's none of my business, it's
You stupid motherf*****
With a tender killing
I don't live for love, you sticky bitch
Ladies know how it feels Oh, oh
Then that would make you the devil 
And let anklebiters chew up, spit out someone else
To any human being
The guy goes back the exact spot where they found him
Stuttering the ways
Because I am blessed with soul, something you would never know
Wild because there isn't anybody else around
La différence entre le eux et nous 
I like the way we play games
If hospitals cure then prisons must bring their pain
I know the self doubt that treats you so unkind
It's like a storm inside
How could you beat the motha of your kids
You know they said it all
Don't rap if you do not practice
Wave by at you with my broken hands
Slamming down the phone right in your face
I feel you coming, I see you red velvet loveliness
And sleepin' in real late
Holidays are dirtcheap in the Costa del Malvinas
See the light  breaking fast
But where the hell were you back in the day
Stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk
 AM, day after Christmas
Would you They got you living like a shrew
Over and over again in my head
A gathering of fools unjustified, on a mountain
And turn it into something you would miss if
Your mind is hollow
But I can't get it out of my head
Glad that that's all through, got better friends than you
You know, give it a run, you know
They claw like golden souls
I retain no tact and spit the pure fact
And I went back to bed again
When you're livin in your mind
Nobody gets nuthin', na, no time for kisses
 years of hell
We storm the very gates of hell
You're always at my house because you love this ass
I've been strung from Hell, give me birth again
TV got 'em bigger than life
Well you can't trust anybody if you can't trust number one
See the face of fear
Cupid shot me in the eye so they say that love is blind
Let her know you're swapping spit
niin kaikki on helpompaa
Don't you think that I can't shame them
Wait for me to take a fall
Scar Can you feel my power
I miss the days when this was fun but now it turned into work
I don't want to fall behind
Well, that's all over now All over now
Get out your money  peel a slab
Mais dis moi qu'est ce tu croyais kpone inc
The only problem that I have is that I think too much, pussy
As we move toward a new world order
Is it my fault
'Cause to them, you're not an artist You're just another file
I've learned that this life's not just a game
Your houses they pull down stand up now, stand up now
I mimic out your ever' fuckin' fantasy yeah, yeah
I wouldn't be without my TV for a day or even a minute
Losing a whole year
Give me my money back, you bitch
I believe I don't know why all I need is someone to save me
It ain't worth a shot
Starin' back in those eyes
You are the slave of a clone of a petrified fool on a throne 
How many times can you race around
Give me justice and I want you dead
Häikäseekö, hei, orpo pirun pakana
Pissing in my head 
So I came home this one day and I am really irritated
Somewhere in the darkness
Someone to blame for the way I've been feeling
So here it is, motherfucker 
If I only we could ride far enough
I needed to feel it so much 
Get on the airplane
All us brown rice jack rabbits and lab rats, fattened up
Open your eyes, live what you see
There's no forgiveness for you, you sick fuck
Heaven doesn't want me 
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
Backstabber
These look like the arms of father so strong
There's a place in space where violence and love
It's not a dream
I don't need her I gave her a smack
With the sickest stilo I spark fear like pigs in the park
Just checking in
Feel me coming feel me coming feel me coming
Go ahead and rise above, see how far you get on top
This is my day
Is the sound of the bell at the side of the ring
Do the crime and never pay
See I don't care but I know
And they don't give a fuck anyway
"Give me one more day,
You'll be singled out and tried
But it's not free baby, you'll have to pay"
Too bad that you don't understand why
Along the way I may have lost my mind
I Believe in the State of Love
But someday someone's gonna bring you down
Why my cash flow missin'
And I won't know what to do And I won't know what to say
Will save you now
Probably learn to die in this town
Should the top soil feel heavy
You should know that I'm the man
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things,
Through the back alleys
And with a  like this my nigga don't sleep,
Don't anybody speak English in the grave
This nigga bought braids for the bitch
Oh God, I need your help
Squeal like a pig when you beg forgive pig fucking ape
Juliet is up in heaven
She would never tell,
Beat yo ass in this Bitch
What's truth
I was reading an interview with Keith Richards in a magazine and in the interview Keith Richards intimated that kids should not do drugs Keith Richards says that kids should not do drugs Keith, we can't do any more drugs because you already fucking did them all, all right There's none left We have to wait till you die and smoke your ashes Jesus Christ Talk about the pot and the fuckin' kettle
Feels so good you could cry
You ain't heard; where you been man
Voting for the law
Wipe your spit from my face
And you'll believe me
But do you fear me when I say I feel pain everyday
This is not what anyone deserves
Don't you tell me not to hide
Drunk on the Amtrak, please shut up
You keep calling my phone nonstop
Answer me  answer me 
I'm not an animal 
Just rear your ugly fucking head 
Hard to believe cause I was seeking and you never loved me
How you be floodin the streets with propaganda
I could be your flower, rise up in the dirt,
I don't want  blend in
All the lies they told to me
You're too busy with the lies they sold you
Before you fuck wit' Willie D, 'cause what I got for
Have all been filled with "You're nothing", I finally want to take them back for me
Cutting through to my disgrace
And now we're crying
Well, why haven't you left me
And don't be chicken if you call me out if you got a problem with it
And now I think I'm dying
It's too late to turn back now
I raise a toast and I salute the end
Well if you're gonna lie
Stronger feelings
He always had a thing for you as well
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Do a motherfuckin job in a motherfuckin squad
I'm not alone because the TV's on, yeah
And we want to believe
I'd say nice shot
Then left me for dead 
Nobody's evil, nobody's evil
But I know
Now I'm gonna sell me some sacks tonight
I won't fall into your predetermined plan
Well now I've got some advice for you, little buddy
Well, now go on and break your word and it'll break me down
I'm not a Catholic geek
Your friends, they're just figments of your imagination
Yeah man, it sucks the world is a war
Make me close my eyes
And now we're rollin'
If I make it, baby, you can drive my hearse
And you want a little company tonight
So what if you turn back
Wanted in me wanted to be
I said get out bitch Let go of my hair
Trying to touch my ass
They must hate me, every single one
But nobody will know
Wolf Gang in this bitch, nigga, we six feet deep
You'll get bladefucked
I tell her ha don't eat pork she takes it straight to the heart
You've already mastered
Mr love man, you ain't shit
And I know it's hard sometimes 
Ha  yeah
Heaven's not so far away
I'm a liar, oh, I am a liar
How dare you niggas pop fly
Just trust in us, we know what's best
For all those things you said that were mean,
Needin too much to drink
What did you do before the war
So while my wallet's piling with symbolic colored paper
Well but honey I had no choice, so
Because I warned you
But now the tables turnedI won't be hurt again
I want the stars
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
My father was dark, my mother was light
The streets
Yeah I am are the good little holier 
Killers view themselves like they view the world, they pick at the holes
You better get your homies to suck your own dick
She says OH Sweet Jesus don't need no Holy Oil
Throw my hands up and shout
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes
But you did nothing
Mom just give me a Pepsi please
And I've got no mother and I've got no dad
And the night in your soul turns to day
This house is full of mmmistakes
Today was gonna be the day
I divorce control I divorce the faith
Now I know that I had to borrow, ha
I could crush him in my fist
You make them niggas want to say
I remain nonchalant when the drama get thick
All that glitter is not gold
'Cause you've always got something else in mind why
Shoot, shoot, shoot, motherfucker
And you, you make it so I need to disconnect
And you wonder all the time why can't you cry
I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke fuck that
The needle now descends
I thought we worked, pushed toward the same ends
Shit, you'd be lucky if you walk away with an autograph bitch
You see, they're always there with funny hair,
Shot an arrow in your head
On the half of couch
Just as it clicked in
You haven't got a clue and you don't know what to do
Why wont you stop
'Cause I hate her
The pain
While shining drop your guns and move your tongues
The smallest matter
Jerking off with the sheets, when I stay at hotels
Who ain't fuckin' with the pay for play, that shit is gay
Du woaßt wos bassiert is
Tell them so right to their face
Don't get dizzy, do not fall now,
Looking at me
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
From earliest human existence there proved to be two fundamental ways of thinking
And to go blind leaves you senseless
Unknown door
These black eyes and these bruises
And how things could get so out of hand
Turn it on turn on on the news
And try to control my hissy fits with pride
Mom, please flush it all away
Up against the man
Throw her down on the bed and tie her up wit' ropes
In the back of the neck right between the eyes" Italicised lies, headlines, bold 
I still can't believe all your plastic surgery
Don't push me nigga, 'cause I'm close to the edge
And right now I feel worthless
Wouldn't stand for anybody who a rat or a snitch
He held my hands in his
Got a body like a battle axe
I got creative Oh no
Politician passin' a bill paid in full
If I can't have you no one will
Yeah, I'm working
Even though they say it doesn't matter
Enough to know we can't play god with others' lives at stake
You make me so sick I'm
Every feeling that we ever had for each other
I know you must have heard it all
I was so offended as I sat for three hours
Seein' me is def not repeated or done twice
I know I was to blame
From body, from soul
Can't you see that I need you I need you
Hop on the side of the free world grave diggers
On second thought
Backstabber
You better watch your back
Lets face it
I take it all to heart
But I always come around
And on this Sunday night you'll be making love to him, I know because you told me I'm never going to win
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at
To the women of the world
Yeah, if I could change your mind
I been told you niggas, "I'm real "
But I don't know where to begin
I guess the honeymoon is over
You wasn't born in a cave so you better not behave so
My heart IS SICK
I thought about how a couple dollars in my pocket
Please, just remember me when I am not around for the taking
Just to make it die
As I squirmed inside my shoes
It'll swallow us whole 
She wants to be the prophet
Consists of hard drive bits written underground
They would burn you
'Til the power's cut
Now I'm just here to criticize the lies, the lies, the lies
So open your mouth and the smoke pours in, tastes so lonely
And I'll take their fate, and I bet no one will care
Assassing, assassing, assassing, assassing
Ten years of discontent never given a chance
Lest you vanish in the city And be but a trace
How the hell did we get so stupid
To keep walking
They were asking of me
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
She claimin' that your man is her man
If you were a woman and I was a man
This one's a doctor, this one's a lawyer
Turn, God, strange make a move
Who is humane
Stick your fingers in your book
Never break any rules
I kind of get the feeling like I'm being used
No jobs and we want no pope
Hit the ground
We went with what we knew and now we can't go back
And set them on fire
Who you pray to, my God the black God
I'm a man without a soul Honey, yeah
'Cause it's a breakdown, a breakdown
I'm feeling twice my age and treated half the same
And then he ran into my knife
When you don't wanna wake up
Wake the fuck up to Hollywood, whore
I want justice I want justice
My life overturned, unfair, the despair
I'm not afraid of speaking my mind
If it wasn't for hate, baby, I would have lost out today
Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
I've always listened to what they told me, never gave in with a fight
I want to touch you, want to breathe you,
Covering your eyes, I'll make you pay
Baby no half stepping no half stepping
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
I just wanna lie here
Driven by restrained desire
Why'd ya do it, she screamed, after all we've said
Cold shatters the sky
Oh, I thought so
You're not the kind who would be waiting there for anybody
America cannot see anything
My heart is empty and my head is wild
No when it's my man yawl
Like you fucking know me
Or smothering
How bad do you want it
Success is a virtue to share with the world
This is what you wanted
You should learn how to say no
I need results, I need straight answers
You got to turn it on, got it turn it on
Now what are you waiting for
His monstrous ego, whipped and driven
'Cause I thought you'd know
Cloaked by the blood spattered banner
When you look into the eyes of your children
Hello, hello, how low, how low
My mother, in a fit of rage, chases me from our home
I just wanna say something, something
Cried on the streets of San Francisco
If I could have a second skin
All of your hate and all of your lies
Concrete shoes, cyanide, TNT
I know a girl
I hear gunfire, see the blood run, feel the rage,
Don't know what you did it for 
Still instillin' hatred, laced with manifesto modes
You're so crazy x
It is tearing up my mind
If you need my shame to reclaim your pride
Uhhuh shit hurts, but it works bitch
They don't know that it exists
And the things we're doing to each other
You know that's no lie bambalam
Denn die Menschen verstehn ihre Worte nicht mehr
My eyes quality
Someone please
A couple of drinks on the house an' he was
Anger steaming up your glasses, you've been holding parties all your life
You kept still until the long drive home
Rip away the disguise and you will realize that you find
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
That one inhuman, illegal, single woman
Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
No fear, no saint, no Jesus Christ
Most don't know were heaven is
I'll not be bothered by you until 
There's something on your mind that I couldn't see
I want a perfect body
That they just wanna get your ass under the sheets fuck you then leave I don't what bumped you to be
I feel no remorse
I am the darkness and you are the light 
That doesn't make your lying tongue all right
Got a new kind of fear
And I'm fearful I'm fearful I'm fearful of flying 
Et j'attends et j'attends
Your freedom to uphold sing cavaliers are bold
And if I do, I'll probably be shell shocked
Ladies know how it feels Hey
The radio is filled with garbage over techno beats
Cracked paint, faded signs, she said "I'm done
The money's gone and your crowd is too
They told me, "Son, it's time to tell the truth"
Reach for tha lessons tha masked pass on
Fucking beautiful screamer walks in with that look on his face that says
You left open the window to the morning and the winter walked in
This money is me this money is everything I do and see
I'm on your mind for reaching things that you can't
Fall on your face in those bad shoes
Gotta find new friends to hang out with, because you're all afraid of me
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died
Bend me over the back of the car seat
Spoken by Eminem, Dr Dre, & Teller
Then we'll set our souls free dancing into rapture
You live with straights who tell you you was king
I fixed him his drink as usual
And when the cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky, no love lost baby the future is so bright
Doctor kindly tell your wife that
You made this little hell I love
Hey You erased it but we saw you fake it
Don't play me like a lepper
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
Moments in grace when you've got to stake your faith
Better make a run cause you know it's gonna go down
'Cause you've changed, yeah you've changed'
It's a legal crime it's an issue of life 
Go find relief in your graves
Won't sit here, never making a sound
To kill a minority
Kiss the first night, it's not that time No hoes hopping inside my ride
Fifty ways to get lost
I'm so happy that I feel this way
We want it all, everyone
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked
Grab two hoes and do some body shots
I'll take you back to '
But all I want is you
Oh, In hell I'll burn in flames
'Cause he ain't worthy of my bitterness or fuckin' pain
We don't like you fuckin' bitch, We'll kill you bitch
And I can play the guitar
Last one out, turn out the lights and let me be
Honey bring it close to my lips
We need apartheid to keep the animal in his cell,
I feel upset, let's do some celebratin'
Another soul is crushed
Had the nerve to show up at her mother's house the next day
When will this story end
No gold chain, it's a dookie rope made of garlic
Oh mercy I want to be taken in
You cut me off at my na na na na neck
I think we finally know
Turn on headlights
When I get my chance
What passion can you buy
Where women of the world and that's for sure
I want to edit metadata
In black and white, they really really ought to know
Kissing 'cause they never fight
But when you learn your lesson
Send your condolences, this is me reaching to You so don't forget
Always knocking on my door
The feeling I get
I just know there's got to be
And when it comes to planning
You only stayed to break my heart
My hoes say I'm amazin but I don't listen  a lady
I'm waiting to go off
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
You are the reason I can't control myself
agora sinto um medo infantil
And I've begun this race,
She says, it's only in my head
So scream louder now
I just can't get, my life straight
Neon black flowers on the mass grave
What can you tell me, nigga
I gave you countless chances
Se io non stessi qua in zona
And pass the chainsaw to a  heart
And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
A you that the singer sings to
I know the self doubt that runs inside your mind
Long lost in your mind
And seven, seven for no tomorrow
And I am not a kitten stuck up a tree somewhere
Because waiting on love
So you hear all the shit we play just for you 
I drink too much just to fall asleep,
To pretend he walks with you
At the end of his belt
Chaos, burning, terror
By my nature I can tell who you are
Can I make it Can I fake it Can I overcome it all
A what a surprise, she thinking I'm the lover of her life, becoming my wife
Legs splayedpenetrated
You better tell that girl to step Say what
I see your front teeth sharpen and I watch your muscles flex
She may be crazy, she maybe not be right
No churly g, not a sequel, not even one love,
Mr Moon a man now
Hey, if she were not scorching the rails with the haste of a bolting ghost there would be no reason to fear the death rattle in the engine's throat
Soul's already black and burnt to a crisp but they wear it right
Take me where you want me all over again
Can you listen to me now
We want to live
To feel the need to feed the need to feel the pain to feel the cut to tear my flesh With a razor blade
"I didn't want to kill her
So lately you answer to sort this out
Yeah, okay, yeah Sweet Well, I've got a couple more people with me man, do you think you could hook it up
Nigga if you fuck with me I fuck with you
Well it's happy ever after as the sheets turn shitbrown
Sundogs flare on windshield glass
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show
I thought we were twins
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Don't wanna be famous
The cause of my problems
And a family of bones
The door he slammed closed
Living from handtomouth
Demand for lies is high
Social clubs in drag disguise
Buy the anecdote but not the cure
And it's not what I wanted it to be
X This is mine
How do you breathe, why don't you cry
Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today
Don't look now, your life is gone
A blackout oath I swore and meant
I still sing 'em ragged for you and Maria
Yeah, I got the note
Then I know I'm going straight to Hell
My brain
Made him feel like a congressman
Kuningas ilman valtikkaa kuin on kuningatarkin
Yeah, I can see clearly from my diamond eyes
Never let them make your face real estate
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
The things I used to love, I have come to reject
I could make you happy you know if you weren't already
Just to satisfy some sick fuck
'Cause I do know what's good for me
All I feel is pain it seems today
The tears still fall
Everybody loves to knock down straw men 
As a child arrested, as a man detested
It's a thin line between love and hate
Grandmother screaming at the wall
Yeah, my ribs have parted ways
From the movie Ghost in the Shell
Can't hold howls and corrals with a key,
'Cause they know when they're hoes, they're about to get jizzed
That's it, we've had enough
Ah, I'm a motherfucking monster
You're the ones that throw each other away, yeah
Not enough for me
You step up to talk and you start to go on
I want what I need
Was it just another lie
All about how there's no justice or peace
Fat children took my life
Why are you so sick why are you falling  falling
Oh, fuck y'all eh, fuck the judge
You want it heavy
They all become makebelieve
To these white kids
It kill you in the end
But I can't speak my heart
We decided when the hit was, run up on him,  in the ribs WHAT
But I know what you're doing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I don't think you understand
So be true to me, my walls are flaming
You ain't never read your bible, tell me why's your vibe all
Traces of life and look what comes between
Deeply within converted to lone liness
And never dine alone, meanwhile back at sea level it was home by home zone for zone,
You better watch where you run your mouth
It's hard to live in a world when you fucking hate it all
I wanna be heard  The TV announcer he talks to the scum
Tap into thoughts
I feel as though you're never gonna let it all out
Have exactly the same fate
Just proved jet blue he's not
We're all waitin' for some kind of sign
My son says, dear father, what did you do when the world turned over
Geunomhante gado joha
You like to think you're never wrong Forfeit the game
You're still a liar
Don't tell me you did it 'cause you love me
Yo I'll fuck ya ass up
I wanna be a tough skinned bitch but I don't know how
Just like a diamond bullet where it's crystal crystal clear
Boom went his head away
The key broke off in the ignition humping if I wandered off through my thoughts wishing
You liar, love to be deceived
And my fists all fucking red
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
One day they'll push too far
I can taste your innocence
Dog with disease
Many miles away
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
I've a hand and a napkin when I'm looking for sex
And all the lines you drew for me to walk
There's too much scarring when I bleed
To satisfy, insure you not to quit
You try so hard to fake it
And show you a picture of yourself now;
Battle motivation in no time lyrics come
U be actin' like a bitch
And if it all goes well and I'm stacked tonight
Welcome to tonight's show
You broke them now, you haven't tamed me
They don't need to know about my brother's blood
Snoop Dogg We tend to bus' on niggaz that get mad at me
Mom's coming 'round to put it back the way it oughta be
On your breath, on your flesh
Why don't you mind your own business
I kiss her number on her arm and lay her on the cot
And gee, who better to talk to than you
If I say my heart is sore 
And he can't see for the shrapnel in his brain
Knocked the FUCK out
Who cares if you die tomorrow
Angel of Death is bloodied now
Here I am, take a chance
Met yo daddy already
I started this gangsta shit
Why go into the outside world at all it's such a fright
Then walks backwards through the bushes where he's disregarding nature
Apologies unacceptable now
Confusing, confusing what is real
Round and round on the rotting ground
I think you should know we've restored our faith
You are disposable means
And sometimes I surprise myself I can stand the metal roof
Right wing left wing sitting on a fence
We are the innocent, we get framed
I wear the circle in my sleep
Not just yet, not just yet
I tell her she's innocent, and she'll show me she's not
I'm from the city where  of the best died
Well I got a bad feeling about this
Hush now whore
It's just you and your hand
At the blood on the money machines
Fighting off the devil's wenches
Remind me
Who you gonna trust
Feel the pain whoa oh
Project nigga all my life, but wouldn't say the hood did it
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
I, I, I don't need control
Passengers with destination to Hell
So I don't know if I can be just your friend
Go away, please go away
Just another incredible scene
You release you, let yourself out of the manure and the cat piss
Just give us war, war, I've been calling you all week
Laid down at the end of my rope
And were better then everybody else
You take it or leave it, it's just my life
esperando o sinal
U ain't fuckin' wit me Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch x
Don't tell me what you could've done or what you should've done
No this is not my name
You never told me from the first time You said you were my friend
And hearts get broken and heartbeats stop
The enemy in the mirror
I throw to you before I throw the rest away
And make no distinction
I hate you, I hate you, I swear to God, I hate you, oh my God, I love you
Leavin' a nigga, fuck ya cash flow
And then I lose my mind
Killers gangs watch your ass
But they're all gonna choke me
I smell oxygen, precious Bareback on your horse
Only the righteous kiss those lips
You always make us wait
You don't want to say his name any more
So I'll be disguised in it
I'll set the world on fire and in the burning light
Of golden dandelions
Give while enough a addon
They've never been the people who we are
There's a frantic effort under way tonight to find
With blood on his face
Since I stopped being a seeker
And the more we tense up, avoiding pain 
So here we are now, face to face
I only see myself reflected in your eyes
I'm peeling off my skin
Redrum the essence of creation from city slums
I believe in peace
Ain't nobody fucking with me
In social gopher tea formals or any scene where brie is normal
Just keep the plane from drifting off course
Not broken Still standing
Come move in another dimension
But now you're gonna have to shut your mouth and fight me
A lullaby for our city A lullaby of Baghdad
Look over yonder to that burying ground
Apathy and a bitter me I will fail to see
There must be some place for these things today
Comin' in to suck 
Let my flag unfurl
Ah life
Shoulder gives way and the ice breaks
Upon which there is no price 
Excuses by the faint of heart
He told me one day
Still be linking, plucked beef when it starts
There is no fucking paradise
Believe, believe, believe, believe
I made my face go red 
They make you king then make you ill
They, they, they, gay, who the fuck is gay
Stupid fucking people think your going to change the world
Lets fuck away morality, you might be independent
The more I want to punch your face I go
Sew up the sore make it fake
To everything that lies in your heart
When I look in your eyes now
I was so afraid, now you're gone away
Midwest love affair, I bend when I am bored
Shoulda sent a thankyou note, you little hoe
I look in your eyes and see
But you've taken out my heart and soul
Can't see no sky
We stand larger than life
Peace and war both pumpin' soul in my heart
Shop wit thug wit get into some thug shit
I got the donuts that I wanted
One, two, fuck you
Stealing money for drugs, Name it I've tried it
And neon drive nazi cars
Oh you say we are friends
Or their ignorance
The people have heard the news
I'm not gonna let you, I'm not gonna let you
To do everything in truth
But you can't blame me if I set dis stage on fire
Bitch I see you, cause you know I know you
First light a fire
I kiss you all, the feeble and the damage done 
In a way, I failed religion
Silence, quiet Need a little peace of mind
Look at them now,
They're too many stars and not enough sky
Yesterday don't mean shit 
We'll throw away what we're looking for
I'm a human, I'll stay in my lane
Listenin' to nobody beats the biz and you ain't never heard hip hop
'Cause my idea of fun
In disastrous times
All I need is a little respect Step, come on
She wants to be a deity and rule us everyday
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw
And again when your head goes through the windshield
But lord knows that I'm not you
Their deep understanding and intelligent looks,
I just want it to be the same
But mostly black boys, but they would call us "niggers"
Or did you cry for someone else
Feast of souls
My poppa didn't give one, that's why I'm like this now
Picked up thrown down used abused and not even missed
Now you know
Just let me bleed one more
I know she won't take the blame
I'm gonna fight 'em all
Fuck you, fuck me, fuck you fuck you fuck me you never loved me
pretendes pelear y solo eres un mierda buena onda
That I'm gonna ignore
 And a reason to be living for, if I don't crap out
Nigga that's how the game goes
Life live, mind power
No harps, no delusions of losing we're sitting prettier than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears,
You got a lot of nerve to come back
Atom'll rip a rhyme, and devastate a mind with  lines
While on the shoreline I stand washed of my pride
Caught up in her own hard liquor world
Really hand it to me
Terminator's back on some ol' fools track
Got your hand up all in my shirt
Say goodbye to all the things you've gotten used to
You scared me with visions of fire
'Cause I can't trust you
I'm not afraid of screaming and I'm not afraid of crying
Because marriage doesn't work in the world today
A whisper from your father couldn't fix it
I feel so fucking sick my life, your life
Leave your fingerprints
She'll rock the boat to bedlam
TV party tonight
There ain't no glory and there ain't no hope
Holding the mass
If I had a dollar for every time I couldn't sleep,
Often make a brother feel like he gotta compete
Talking 'bout process
And when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets I'ma handle this
New gospel, homey, Take Six, and take this, haters
Put your money where your mouth is, Mr KnowAll
i monumenti a cosa servono
Why is the truth of this so hard to unveil
You can dress it all up you can try to pretend
You're neve gonna find a love like mine
Where po's scope the people like Muhammad and Malvo
Soon a dismembered world we'll see
You can't even pry the nameplate off, now can you
I'm gonna drive the knife through
We all know your secret sins
There was a wicked messenger
Took three days to find
Because it's die muthafucka, die muthafucka still, fool
Ich bin der Abgrund, die Entwürdigung, das Chaos
I received the spit from a snake
I love myself today
How I love to hate you
I'm just holding on to let them know
So go choke on your irony 
By giving you no time instead of it all
You think that you can beat them
So tell me something I don't know
Quit acting so friendly 
So you come to me, made of these, urgent unfulfilled
It's not the first time we've fucked it up
Uh I want you to trip like me,
But they are not going to stop until they see you go to sleep in the dirt
Never look back and don't look ahead
And all of the questions with no proper answers
I'm through with the headaches
I need an answer and humans can't provide it
We killin' all gorillin with all that screwfacin
You gon'hate me
Everywhere you carried around your soul
But truth be told you take tradegies and latch on
Run out, ah you better face it
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
When the madness stops, then you will be alone
Its bout ta get real ugly up in yo mothafuckin club fucked up in that bitch
All I need is a little respect
I mean it, fucking whore
I got lost, now I'm so far behind
I'm hypnotized by rituals
Where their eyes used to hide
In this motherfuckin' bullshit life
Still we lie jerking back and forth
Yeah his mamma beat him just like that too
Signals that flash and beat
These are the things I saved to sink you
I'm tellin' you now
Old enough to understand the shit'll change forever
Demolish every hood, disintegrating the mosh pit
When they don't like what we say they stop it in the courts
Been to Vegas lately, any of you 'Cause I was there for a couple of weeks, when we were on tour Yeah, okay You know what I noticed in Vegas I noticed this one little thing we have some fat fucking people in this country It is out of control Have you seen them sitting at the slot machines They're so fat the stool's all the way up their ass, and they just sit there and have food delivered, and they eat and play the slots "AHHMUMFMUMF, CLANG, AHHMUMMFFMUMMFF, CLANG I need money, CLANG, CLANG, CLANG" They fart, the stool flies across the room These people make Elvis look anorexic, you know what I'm talking about Stop eating I am fed up with the little denial phrases they have, too "I'm not fat, I'm husky" Yeah "I'm portly" Ya ya ya ya "I'm stout" Oh, ok ok ok "I'm bigboned" You're bigassed Dinosaurs are bigboned Put the fork down We gotta do something, because we all have fat people in our families You know what, if we don't stop 'em soon, they're just gonna start blowin' up, I swear to God We're gonna have a country full of sumo wrestlers either way
Let them feast upon their own shit
And back through the glen
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit  I just,
I don't wanna say, "diiiie motherfucker"
My world is unaffected
Let's recognize these people for what they are
Ever heard a Glock go 'click' like a camera
What's the point in fighting
No, I don't need to hear your depressing remarks
You better not test me, trust me,
Another level when it's me and Devils gangbanging
Sometimes I feel like shit
His eyes are dull They stole his soul
And I'll know just what to do
And it's not something you know that I could, I could prove
I have learned
Mixed with blood from split tongue
I'm sure you thought I'd be easy
Pull back the covers, read the newspapers
You don't know me
That we had a future
'Cause the harder that I chase, the harder you're running
I want courage
'Cause you've booked the top suite
To the sunrise or the sunset, the master and his servant
Forgive us our trespasses
You're so afraid, so you try to break me, yeah
But I wish that you would let me through that door
And wash my hands of you
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Say a little prayer now
This fucking mind
I just can't accept you not being well off
Depleted of everything that shoots flames and reports
My advice to you, my friend
I like to make you lie
Why do I feel like this
Your mind is SLIME so please resign
You stole all the covers and busted my head
The sound, what a broke head
You want no part of his life any more
Everyday now, for what seems forever
You wanna graduate but not in his bed
Her lips were put on this earth for dispersing wisdom
We let him use his powers
I need your wars body in my arms
Where was love when I felt like hate
Even you can not resist her
Neon black dirt in the garden
I'll turn you into me, I'll turn you into me
No no no more talking
I'd rather die alone in misery
The body and face and soul of you is gone down that deep black hole
Ya no confías en nadie 
Goddman, Joe
Just to hold you down
Hot enough to pull up to your show and steal your groupie date
Graduation, was yesterday
I'll hold what you have to give me
Need some blood in the cut
Caged in we break barriers, change to new areas
Hittin' the AM playlist, paid to say this
When the first shots were fired
Your life is over, over, over, 
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
Go ahead, yeah, fuck it up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
Was du denkst was du fühlst  diese große Vertrauen unter Frauen
Oh yeah Oh yeah Well I got it all up here, see
Is my voodoo working X
Everything that I say could kill it all
You broke my heart
In some big hotel bed
'Cause those days are dead Forgive me
Well, you can tell ev'ryone I'm a down disgrace
All the men came back from six years' fighting
His motherfucking ass on a rooftop next tour
Call it off any day anyway 
I don't need you
What do the old people teach us but how to die die die die 
Throat fuck your lucky day, the flight of a torn kite
Thick eyes but she full of surprises
While river rats fall off the raft and sink
Plastic faces suck me dry 
Try to focus, can't discern anything but the motion
And if I grow old, well, I know I'm gonna be
Asleep when the storm troopers come
Somebody gotta shell 'em
I came to do battle
Noise control, I've sunken out
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
And blur the questions that no one could ever answer
Kicking me, pushing me, biting me, bruising me,
And I try but I can't and I want to so bad
Ou je reste ici, ou je meurs
Around his neck is where my rope was tied
Kickin the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin' to like
And I try to find comfort in the darkness
Bitch he made me moan
You got to make her know how it feels to miss you
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
Behind the fake family image
But then I accused you in a way that you've never known
Filthify and punish your mind
I am before before before death is eternity after death is eternity
And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists
How fucking romantic
All I want is a Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me
Look this head is all dead
I'm the law and you can't beat the law       
And you can preen and dream and scream and shot
That a door slam sends crying into the world 
Keep spinning, keep spinning, send us off to sleep
Why'd you do it, she said, ain't nothing to laugh
Who took you for a working whore
I just don't wanna give my life to the fans
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons 
The disease
'Til there are none left and another
I've got nothing to do but
I've been sleeping
Watch me fly I'm Superman
Listen to the general every goddamn word
What you intend to ignore, but when it cuts back round,
Feeding on an open wound kills the pain but I like it yeah I like it
You bloody mother fucking asshole
And Beenie lost the sunset but that's okay
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Your life is over
, pops died, middle of the night
The way you turn your back and then you walk away
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
I keep the things you taught trapped in mind
They cannot control me
Like she needs to know
And for not getting pissed when I humped your girlfriend
I'm proud I'm Australian, whatever that means,
Jammin up the border to this game stop
But I won't be your man
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions fuckin' questions
A faded star of yesterday now toothless and jaded
Up lord
Die bitches, bastards brats pests
'Cause I'm a liar, a liar, a liar, a liar
Wait a minute my TV set doesn't work
You're saving your face
Rip me open, it'sa free, yeah
Trapped in a psycho disguise
He's selling poison by the ton
I hate everyone I fucking hate them all
My faith is lost again I'd say
She came with a warning
Nostalgia, well you're using it like a whore
You are a faker admit it
Cast Her dispersions
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
She's hotter than I am handsome
The artist with heart darkness
I'm not a discharge
It's destination unknown, so dive in,
Poison my body and my mind will fail
Since I stopped being a seeker
So you got so many diamonds hey pussy lay pussy
Ooh, child, the fear I have
Pick and peel it off, this dried up skin
'Cause these damned bluecollared tweekers
I can't stand this anymore
Grazing like hungry cows across the stage or page
I think I sealed my fate
But there ain't nothin' that you can do
I'll shit on that ho
You wanna bite it
There's no reason to change
I won't submit to your self destructive lifestyle
To know that the flame will always burn
You kept running
I never close my eyes
How does it feel to be so high
This is a message from occupied England
But you won't hear a single word I say
Don't tell me what price salvation
I know you think it's all right
Come on honey, don't hesitate now
No doubt girls all out of whack
Sweat, tear, and feed 'cause I don't bleed when I cut no more
Just can't remember where I left them
I've got to take my life back
One time we believed but now we don't even try
Play with me, play with
Guess this ain't your lucky day
But the girl on the car in the parking lot
 No no no no
Makes me sick when I hear all the shit that you say
You have to act like you're someone Forfeit the game
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
To drive me mad
New excuse, ain't thought of mine
God it's good to be alive and I'm still here waiting for you
Straining my bowels, fucking hungry hippopotamus
Can't you fuckin' see
You promised to give your family a break
And publicly disgraced
Then wanna ride who
Here I'll scream with you, "Ah, somebody help"
I could be the million that you never made
You wore that cross so well
How can you run when you know
I don't deserve this broken heart
What I feel when I'm playing guitar
I can't accept my fate
Ok, no more questions, no worries,
You want so badly to get through
Little punk wanna get real far
To take what's mine
It wouldn't be me if I didn't tell all
Because you stole all my friends
Hah hah hah  hello
Where is god 
I knew I shoulda chose a life of crime
The face card, mimic of an actionfigure
You wanna get fucked inside out
Achin' head
We thought that everything
And if I don't fit your plan then set me free
I tried to tell my mama but she told me, �This is one for your dad
I'm the worst of the best, but I'm in this race
It's a blessing and a curse
Start a roit in this Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch x
I know, but you know, why let the feeling  show it son
I start to sink where I stand,
Take this I control it
I can't stop
It's THE SOUL EATER  mic bleeder with the voice of chaos
So don't tell me what to write, and don't tell me that I'm wrong
To keep from noticing my mind going blank
Than I ever thought that I could be, baby
I've been working in the fields
And so remains these twisted days
This song is also dedicated to all the kids living in this society
And your parents hate me 'cause I love you
I can sleep at night
Police I'm sayin' fuck you punk
Darling, I fell like a god
You weren't supposed to open the door
They're right on the money
Oh my God all the noise inside my head
Feel my with for I am the dark
Have you seen the flags of freedom
For I've been living far too long
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
Baby no half stepping
How the fuck could you do this to me I'm sorry
We learned to see all the corruption and greed
The weight of the world is on my shoulders
No matter what I do, how hard I Try
'Cause these damned bluecollar tweekers
Now I'm done but before I go I want you to know 
Still in love with all your sins
mieluummin kun olisin ollut massamurhaaja
The conference hall rings to the standing ovation
A couple of drinks on the house an' he said
To the grave from the cradle we don't rock anymore
It ends with me
I want to take you in my arms so I can give you my heart
Well if you'll be my enemy
Writing in the grave of the polls
Ich werde nicht fragen
Innocent and never suspectable
My eyes never forget, you see
To put an end to their lives
Nothing matters anymore
Take my fucking conscience from me 
She failed me over and over again no surprise there she was never a friend
But I was innocent to what they done to me
No I can't believe it's coming true
If you close the door when you leave
I lived a life with no regrets till you came around
Your adapted world views
With tears that flooded your heart
Look at these niggae with attitudes
Creates another fiend
There is no tie
If I'm lovin' only one thing the five second heaven
Wake up cold
Can't wait to see where it goes
The bird, the melodies she play
So you know I'll be waiting in the dark
They're the crime
One way or another
Around me, hypocrites, and I know them
I'm runnin' out of room
But I got all the time in the world
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Ya running the race again
The end is growing near
Explosive Geschichten hört man aus der Nachbarschaft
My heart bleeds believe in every dying breath
Far from the places we used to talk about
It's just the way it's always been
Destroying my body and my mind will fail
Yeah yeah yeah yeah let it breathe yeah
Yeah my people building monuments to weather the flood,
And I know your coming backwards
We got highschool kids running 'round in Calvin Klein and Guess
And I won't stop 'til I fix your misleading
That's why I wanna break free 
I am not the one to be played with
Just another particular deal
They boots was on our head, they dogs was on our crotches
Follow me through a city of frost covered angels
It's got me fiending for the fire
Choking on regret
Now you know "Now you know"
Look in my eyes
Love and sex and loneliness
'Cept the planet that we own and its playing nd fiddle
Music has another dimension
Nothing says charm like an armored car taking the clonefarm 'tards to the arms bazaar,
In my glass coffin, I'm waiting
Listening to Bob Dylan singin' in 
An ounze of that shit sittin' in your motherfuckin' lac
I will never break don't lie, x
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you see a devil down
Then me and my friends
Draining your pathetic body for energy
That it was her life and stay the fuck out of it
Go away always in my fucking space
Try to figure why you always seem to
And it's colder
Feel the pain
A bullet in your head
Wild wild wild wild X
And the other kids hated me
Then I wait from a nine
I don't know, it's just the way I am
Bitches  all in the back, they knees waitin' to buckle
Status malus, vana salus, semper dissolubilis
I keep calling but nobody listens
She had a broken bottle in the other hand
It's just one of those days
The  I put in to stop the brown bag smelling smelling
Looking for a wall to kiss
Penetrate the clouds, loud, and obnoxious
When all you're going to do is just pretend
Credit cards and memories all dumped into the sea
I will drive past your house
Up in the sky
And I think you suck
Hoping to hell someone's forgiven his crimes
In da back of a cell
Just my luck, the bitch got us both touched, it's like a rush
Sono andate, sparite 
This bitter drink
Tha world's eye captured at last in a Mexican pasture
It won't kill me
I've never felt your grace, understand
And it hurts to keep learning the same lessons in pain
I lay on my back taking shit from you
No hot water, no toilets, no lights
He sees the family home now, looming in his headlights
I know exactly how this works
Mean it, or seen it, to feel the reason in your mind
Versace on your back sideways and il
I'm sorry I really need to take this Hello
Throw you in a choke  gun smoke, gun smoke
The gunshots in the class
I don't know who told you that but it's a lie
What I need is to open up again
And there's just one more thing that, I have just got to sing ya
So amazing how many times you plot and you scheme
That blows up spots like Supernova
Men with stamina or money on the plate
But keep gettin' money
ne sanoi lapsi on sekaisin
You woulda jumped him too
Future of a gerbil up ass of masochist, that's my word up
Taught not to bite the hand that feeds
Out beyond the edges in the depths of spirit land
I master the rhythm like heartless ambition
Would you help me to get out
Where the future is free, the dope is clean
I'd disappear under a bush
Scriptures on the wall
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide
Were not afraid
A life of regret in a rock and roll band
Looking back at the words you said
Unable to express the pain of your distress
I severe the weakest niggas who not on my pedigree
Make it feel like there's something
You're not doing what you're told
I could be a baseball player
Instead I'm feeling sorry for myself
You know I'm here for you,
Open any door
From one another, another one should come to one another
It comes as no surprise he's taken by surprise
Demand a recount, you poor folks
But everybody's wrong
Makin' hoes, take these clothes, from these sto's
Was losing all my friends
No tender scar no twist of fate
Yeah, gather 'round the sound
Is killing everyone
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
See I laid down beside her in the hospital bed
I was hoping you'd be waiting there for me lately 
Everything had a shot
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
Sex, violence, money and dope 
And the void you learned from me
The color of your eyes, just the shape of your dress
A taste I can only describe as a dream I once had
More homes for the people
I have a reasonable doubt I think I'll just spell it out
Now every time you make your friend the reason
Makes you believe I'm
Let me be free if the strain on your conscience gets under your skin
Dos not cuatro word to Kool Keith, "I'ma break up your teeth"
You're just a semiautomatic hate machine 
You're living proof that there's healing within
"You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God"
You know anklebiters ate up your personality
There's no such thing as passions or wants or desires
Shut the fuck up, take the pain
"I tried to tell the others, but they wouldn't believe me You're all doomed, you're all
Défigurée que j'ai gravé mon nom sur leur mur avec mon sang 
My idea of fun
I like how all that good shit sounds
You liar, you liar, all your words are just dust in moonshine
Bend them over you get a taste of lollirot
The billions of people to sick to believe
Your love of this lifetime
Niggaz love to scream peace after they start some shit  pay attention
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind
And We can force you to believe"
I never said that I would wait for you
If we fall into ourselves we will become free
You're killing me in cold blood
When Hollywood passed I nearly lost my mind
We'll float away from this mother fucking human world
"What are you doing, man"
In a photo the size of a kiss
Genocide
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
I got the nectar of the gods flowing from my mental pod
I move in another dimension oh oh oh
Throw your hands up in the
When they say all of this is approaching its end
You're not the only one who runs on instincts
You've made me what I am today
How does it feel to know that I'm a part of it
You're not living, we are
But I never understood who even made the rules
Evacuating pain, fear
You think I'll wan't you for evermore
This rap is the kick back from toes you tread on
I can't say what I want to
You can just apologize back
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
Hate mail is not read, in jail instead
Hey good, that really makes you an empowered individual, no wait, did I say empowered individual I meant twocent gutter slut
Graue Leute suchen Wege für die Ewigkeit
The world will sing like a happy bug
I hate the way you talk
Terror at gunpoint
The boss is feeding on living corpses
And life is bittersweet
Hey God I believed your promises, your promises and lies
We can't control our accessies spreading
But you sit there silent, folded arms
Like a malingering ghost
Striking with impunity
How could you tell us How could you tell us
As though you had no choice
And I know I can be self righteous
One drop for breath and one for skin
Ohno ohno ohno
Everything but then again I was thinking about nothing
Oh, no, no
I gotta feel you right now
Where was hate when I felt like love
Into the abyss will I run
Picking fossils in the sand
It makes sense to me
Strip your ass butt naked
Some of them are cryin' 'cause the soldiers look so brave
After I've stopped waiting for an ambulance to come and get me
On my swollen tongue
Infiltrated business cesspools
The doctor says I need to take
Stand there with your ball and chain
You know I'll just work it out myself
I've burned
Said "I don't wanna feel a thing, I don't want to feel a thing"
And I want to do this song tonight for all the young people out there
This is all mine
Everyne I trust
I'd be a damn good one
And I'll kick that hoe, punt
The games that politicians start
Now I'm in your room
You're kinda breaking up
It doesn't bother you you're someone else's wife
Angels in my heart tonight
This time you drowned us in misery, that's why you forced me to say
Her fingernails longer than her dress is
We burn and coil like cigarettes
In a scatlike gibberish for not saying 'butterfingers'
Pedisinister girl next door
Still not true
And we'll go at it punk and I'm gonna fuck you up
And every sound I hear
Niemand hätte das gedacht
And the grinding of the teeth
The next five days, no help ensued
Your lipstick at home
I'm no joker Play me as a
It's fucking righteous baby, baby
When you're selfless you're so hard not to adore
II can't believe I'm letting you do this to me
Always in my sight
On my father's gun
All you do is talk about you
Rat poison for dinner, 
And I'd listen to you cry
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
You should fall in love with yourself, oh again
And never to their own fear
We take more drugs than a touring funk band
Yeah you watch me when you work
Back stabbing, dollar driven status quo shit
Fuck, I'm putting myself at a distance
I tell 'em Lean back, just relax, we tell 'em
porque nunca quedas mal con nadie
You can't run from me Kim, it's just us, nobody else
You are the same with your balls and your chains
'Cause I'm waiting for it all
And let me leave your mind corrupt from this song
I'll bladefuck your heart baby
I want you to
I guess I never believed
I just can't get my head straight
Riassaggi i momenti 
That he has left his soul in someone's rented car
Why all I need is someone to save me I believe
Ticket please, thanks, walk through the door
Thug life is now on radar
I've already bought you a diamond ring we' re gonna start a life
Done run akin to the car on the lawn cinderblocks
You're gonna burn
Never get too close to the end of the line
I'm pale with a satan from Hell, groomed well
Face my fears
I disconnect the dots
But I can still make a fist
If your soul was deep just like mine is, then you would known not to give up
We decided when and which hoes we would fuck it
Go ahead and tell your sob story
I'll be waiting for you deep in hell
This is a song about the scary things you see from the corner of your eye
'Cause you've left me with nothing
Straight to hell
Some just gave up in the end
Claw hard from your casket
Why do you care what people think
Sends the shivers to spines
I don't wanna take a pill
To beat a hole in their defence
How many stitches do you think it takes to fix a cut that bad
I'm sick of songs about the summer
Ladies and gentlemen
See�the�prince�on�the�rocking�horse,�his�polished�face�looks�cool
On the wheels of steel, my spirit flies away
Leave it to the ones who disown you
Boat of the town, devilish grin look peculiar
After ten cups of coffee and you're still not here
I step into the sun's bright glare
Everybody, self included, is fair game
And the violence and the violence, and the violence, and the violence
Hey I got twenties on my benz you still fuckin' with a gem
You haven't even tried to tell me how it feels
Is the glory in your heart
Spiraling to hell
Angels round here don't sing
They're so tired of shooting protest singers
You've been a dick to me all along
To make believe, to ease your doubt
Tell them anything, tell them anything Don't ask me, don't ask me
In the backs of
Already heard that joke about how shit floats
I don't fuckin' understand why
We beat you like bitch
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
When I am queen I will not wait my body type will still be great
Any man wouldn't do
And into your dark is where I never want to be
This woman literally
It's exhausting to keep smiling when your toes are bleeding on the floor
Peace love and understanding, god
Pero nunca das un nombre,
Been stuck in some wars, but Vinnie fought his way out
And who cries for the nameless whores
Because some scars don't heal with time
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky
Shame, shame on me
I know my rights
Know me  I see the fear in your eyes
Yeah you be the one to run and leave me out in the cold
I hope you die
Driving down the back streets
Heartbeat
You can't wipe out my thoughts
I lied, you've worn out all your dancing shoes this time
Maybe it's all good yeah
Tied around you're back, you're treated like thieves
My body is aching
Why can no one ever touch a fire spirit
Turn and time and time will tell
He'll never change he's not like me
She was scared to death in that waiting room
And see the disappointments walking in their line
Freak out and feed the gods
Infiltrate the battle zone
How come jerks don't know they're jerks
Look once at life on the ground
Pimp hoes
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me
Tell you I love you, daddy, but now, fuck you
But I don't believe it not for a minute
If you ain't understandin me
They're gonna rock and destroy
Watch niggas kiss my ass without flexin' a muscle
With wack beats and gap teeth like Tyler the Creator
But they say be true, don't stain your bed
Is this a feeling of something about to happen
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
I gotta couple numbers of my own, just return the courtesy
You want a piece of my fucking mind
Max Cavalera was arrested after the concert but denied
And I hope you got the fuck out of our hometown
And everyday wear the same fuckin' uniform
Proud of my life and the things that I have done
When I am queen I will insist with perfect scars upon my wrists
And I hope that you're doin' fuckin' swell
If you gonna love me if you gonna love me yeah
It is stronger than truth
Speak through these walls
Too many pills in the pharmacy now
Somebody shoots a guy he don't even know
But I just can't help it
But where I'm from you're nobody till you kill somebody
You say I'm sick not so to speak
You can't stop coasting cause vanity is high
My hands look Pretty Baby 'round your neck
And my heart with grief was sore
Hate me now, hate me now
You're a product of my ministry, you are crushed on open arms, you will drown in open air prepared to heal your anemic heart Old vulture, gnarled nemesis, old cavity retooled I want to drive a nail through your eyes so I can get a better view A part of me longs to wash the past, yeah that part of me is weak, a part of me works to find the faults that part of me won't seek Carry me home, you improbable ghost, I would rot by your flesh, I will gnaw on your bonesare you calling out my name Elutriate and evanesce I would gorge myself on praise if you praise this
Can you inject love's tender touch back into the gang bang
Don't nail me up Why don't you buy my cross You'll never bear it
We put clothes on their backs
I'm wishing you all of my best on this election day
Scream if you want to
And while they always take the plunge
I take one step forward
Put the wounded man back in the ambulance
I got those minerals
Of television dreams he's living on the screen
Or bite your tongue until you've forgotten what to say
Your mother's job is to fuck all your neighbors,
Our bed's this concrete floor
And I pray to keep my head
That they no vision saw to maintain such a law
Reach out for redemption it bites the hand that needs
My viens are sweetly singing while
And in I come to lick it up
I can hear it in your voice I can see it in your eyes
How many times have you been mislead
Pain I felt so long ago, I don't remember
But that's why I know
C'mon now
"You been screwin' the milkman"
And my husband, Charlie, traveled around with us
Well, how's this for publicity stunt This should be fun
It's not what I sold
And walking in the dust
I I'll write my first love song and I will feel warm
Every once in a while there's that same asshole
I got fed like a fish on the cardboard smiles
To live a weak man's day
Gestern war die Sonne wieder größer als sonst und das Licht war auch viel heller,
Heart pounds, hands wet, mouth dry
Swung on this faggot, knocked the windows outta Silvia's
Whoa, black Betty 
The king of all excuses
Filthy stinking, standing on solid ground
That big fucking bomb made me deaf, deaf
Stop thinking
Devils in my head tonight
I want it to be like it was before
Until everyone lies dead 
With you around me I don't feel it's over
There's guns in the streets again
You smile as you stab me in the back
Resting her head and closed her eyes
 a punch a kick and I can't think of a better way to end the day
Activating passion vocal vibrations to the blind plus the seeing
You coward
Fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing
You've left me here in the cold
I've got a wantless need
I keep calling but nobody hears me
Won't need no purple haze
And midst lies in collusion
I'll tell them so right to their face
You won't catch me crying 'cause I just can't win
You know it's your last chance
You fucking whore
Make me cry; get off now, baby
And leave your fans saying, "How the fuck does he do that "
I got a rock and roll house
Be hunted down like a scarcity
They want to build them
I watched my toenails blacken and walked a deadened trance
The right to health and food,
Glad you had a chance to see the gift that I'm delivering
All because you lied and tried to pretend you a friend
Slavery and mastery  be one of us"
So far Left with nothing, hanging by a memory
Never fallin'
Life's not easy being dealt this hand
'Til every voice is heard
And no one's seen your son in days
Just run and get our ticket
Can you see them now
It just screams out loud
Yeah it's beef in the air and why she know
I'll never do you no harm
Livin' all reckless like there ain't no karma
A rush to my senses
There's a hole in my heart
You gave me a chance at the palais de danse to prove I'm worth your time
Under lock and key is the feeling I crave
I'll run this world, I'll lie and steal
They had to hand your name 
She said, "I'm worryin' outta mind" bambalam
I believe in
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
'Cause she had cobwebs up her fanny and I believe in giving to the poor
And every finger that you point will turn in your direction
So you want a piece
A rivers drying up the heart beat of god
I love to shoot smack
They hate the songs, we hate them too
You're always stickin' it in, you're always stickin' it in
Calling from the underground
I am the concierge chezmoi, honey
Every single piano I've ever met in my life, never
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
I spitup on my plate and I disrupt the family
Now that they're breeding all our animals insane
It's time I lett'em suffer tha payback
Wealth empowers its own views
Curled up in a can they don't know where I am
To stretch the thought a mile
Or was I just the messenger
And I am feeling oh so powerless
I hope it tastes JUST LIKE SHIT
I can't stop talking and I
So back off buster, you best not stress me,
Yes, I left the refrigerator door half open, Daddy
We don't do shit for the clubs 
Am I to blame Please excuse me for my rotten ways
Wait for life just
And I am always in reserve
If that's what you wanted to hear
Our sense of real is extinct
It's to repeat something that I heard on TV
Make my water break
There nine years old and they all carry guns
Oh, now how do you feel
So many times we have waited on others
And I covered my eyes when she told me the news
Clear your thoughts with Speyside and with your brain
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
And on this day I slit my wrist
See it happen in your own backyard
Twothirty in the morning and my gas tank will be empty soon
Its just a waste of money
I feel as though you're never gonna let it
With some semen in my sack and some problems in the back
You've gotta tell me goodbye
You don't believe in him
I hope you die in his trash,
Plenty goes in but nothing good comes out
I keep finding hate mail
In zona mia i sorci crescono, i porci arrestano
There's so much at stake, why can't I make you feel used
Maybe there's no haven in this world for tender age
You feel the past
But who the fuck died and made you King Koopa
He cannot stop
I can't take ya shit no more
Till my cheeks are hot and red and soaking wet
Well, you can have him I don't want him I don't
In a shallow grave of stubble field and halfremembered lies
Not even Satan can't stop me what
Your reality produces poverty, spiritually in a nation of greed
I'm not the  stepper
You've got to be there, don't you know
I'm not afraid put the gun in my hand
This is what we're here for, control the dance floor
We got little kids with guns fighting inner city wars
I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes
But when I did play I used to score hattricks
No I don't want to talk about it I'm okay, I'll figure it out myself but they just keep 
I know I will get over it
Neon black future charging like a bull with a funeral bouqet ready to explode
That's falling every place I run
All my sins 
Should've never glorified, now you're wrong
Which is yours now and which is mine
Päiväkodis piti aina olla prinsessa,
I am truly sorry about all this
Tears fall in the dark
You smell like shit, not the truth
And half don't suit me anyway
I'm paranoid
Don't drop the beat on me
No river leads back to mine
Hear the ceaseless screaming
But he's sleeping now
If I could only be in your body
I smoke a lot but can't get laid
That there's no use for
I don't know what's real without you
You'd notice anyway
It creates disruption midst circle of friends
And strip down to your voice
I wrote myself out of the day we ever had to meet
Take off all your clothes
I feel your breath upon my neck
Sometimes it feels like I'm clinging to an edge that knows
You're the memory, yeah
I, I crossed the line, line
Of everyone you know
Living lost just like deer in headlights, 
Until they run away
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you better let go of 'em 
But I feel it's time to say goodbye to fear
I bless you madly
Proof lies in history, say "that's how it always was,
"How can you do such a thing" a woman asked
I've watched them leave their families in pursuit of your nirvana
People hide what they feel inside
My rap styles distorted
Point it at your head
Of fingerprints and names
I know they're selling me a lie
I'm not tryin' to confuse you
Out of rehab Man, you look high as hell
You walk in, right into my world
I don't play with this rap shit
In his evil place
Been ripped apart but now
My parents made me strong to lift up that glass
While asking You for some answers, but we don't have that type of bond
Comming home from the school today
Stop the faux to be famous
I'm not someone you ignore
Lettin' shit slip
Close yourself, you'll fall away fast
God damn, this motherfucker gets on my fuckin' nerves
Dre Beats on, smoking that chronic just to meditate
Can you turn Mark up louder
You disagree homie then go on and jump
Drink lots of black coffee and I smoke like a chimney,
I'm still here but you don't trust at all
It should have been a joyous day
Pine box is fine for a killer to run
If there is a hell
Hard rock queens in ripped up jeans
Who has a plan
I feel her, and I ask you why
I'd visit father bob
This movie would've killed us
You have left a trail of deceit, assault, and flattery
Them lips foretold these apocalypse
Erased the thought of me
You know by the stillness in my eyes
An Englishman can he read it back
Ugly people, ugly people, say
Do it now
What if no one's watching
Whiteknuckle blackout, adrenaline rush
Can you knit the stiletto back into the bloodstain
Resist to cease, understand
You hate me now, I'm sure
Shesaid bullshit
I'm breeding memories I will not cry again
You blinded blockhead
Du schaust mi o, ganz so ois ob nix war
I walk a fragile path, of thought and habitats
All I need is my leather,
Yeah, while you're sleeping
With your fucking scams
Where's Chuck D when you need him
Help me stand
Leurs méthodes d'interpellations sont souvent passées sous silence 
'Cause the niggas showed me no love
To eradicate the problem, my friend
I don't give a fuck if you're drunk or not
I'm going to the mountain with a fire spirit
I hadn't had enough, kept kicking in doors
The days fall with the promises I make
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
Some guys never gonna argue, never gonna bet you're never gonna change
Nah, but for real I got so much shit on my mind
Just sing this song inside your head
I'm talking to you
Cause you know it's over before it began
Who are you to say that I can't speak what's on my mind
How did you get so big Can't believe it, now you're two
It's me man, I'm just me I'm a gan
I can't imagine I don't understand
I know your desire is to be desired
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
What does it take to make you believe
You walking, I'll look at,
No, sorry won't pay for this grief
Some revolution
Our children run through the streets
I'm taking what I need
I don't never wanna see your face
E nossas vidas são tão normais
But no one alive truly knows me
Now I feel better but it's hard to forget
The final push, the last battle
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die in plane crashes
I never been no good at staying out of jail
And then it ends quick and it starts to decay
You show no remorse for the lies you told
Open up your spirit 
Oh If you were a woman and I was a man,
I'm not going to be a slave for the rest of my life
Ilohem, fuck the pagans we mark them
The swarm is feeding defeat
Worried for my friend
We dark humor at boths you're funny Yes, man
Black holes of lost souls, let the story be told
Didn't know he had one
To make you so goddamn defiant
N N, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a What the fuck's up Dre
Rich daddy left you with a parachute
I close my eyes
Yeah head over heels falling
When it starts to hurt it only helps it grow
When Shady and Nicki's worlds class
Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
You don't believe it but I'm betting that you will
With a note saying "I love you"
We've got nothing better to do than watch TV
Stop me
Oh baby, let him break you
Oh, no no Now, I've got a dream
On the third day of the third month
Your mama and your daddy know you love this ass
When they need a hit I would be the one to get
To defend democracy
She would have left these red hills
Who are you to say who's to live and who's to die
Speak up now, darling, I have been waiting
'Cause it helps with the elocution
The game you're playing is so easy to see
Watch that ass cause punk I'll brand it
I ain't start your life but nigga I'm a bring it to an end
The air is precious to the red man
With extreme hate
Get pulled both ways and it tears me apart
Therefore I would run through scum
No pretendin
And all I want is company
The toofargone kicks still in the box, fix still in the pill in his sock, chilling, gill in the slop,
This is the beat that my heart skipped
Stand up I'll let you live a little bit with the pain that I bring
Niggas on a chain gang used to do that Huh way back
Flashlight in your eyes
I showed love to everybody before I walked about
Mahalma Gandhi cut crystal and having lots of showers
We're sinking and I'm thinking
Know it's bad for me but I'm calling you
Spiritual habitation for your responsibility
Fuck me, like you, want me
What bones
Ever since you got your buzz, you don't know how bad you tripping
Fucking waste of time
Either rob or join the mob 'cause I'm not salable
So we found ourselves a place we did not know
No way no way
Two walls, Four walls
A chi invece non ti pensa
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap Yeah
I guess they got a way of reading my mind
*Gunshots, screaming*
Last night, I had the strangest dream that I have ever known 
To shatter all your plans
But give it to me one time Oh give it to me, yeah
The graphic devils gettin' funky like the Nevilles
I can tell I just know that it's going down tonight
Though this dirty hell
And every idol ever raised falls
To fuck your thinking, it's not a mirage
Why is the world cheating me
I put together decks and push for beef, If head for less
I turn light into sound, 
Like prolifers, that support the death penalty
She's gonna fuck the whole city of Seattle
He sees his daddy bash a phone into his mamma's skull
She knows the party makes me nervous
I've had enough, made up my mind
I just wanna lie 
What about the times you shamed me
Stepping out to watch the final scene
Where you could get the help that you need
Total hate, total hate
Tell you what, I'd save a million souls, even you
Just a line between the pleasures and the pain
Why didn't you stop me from turning out this way
The trains and planes can corrupt and obstruct your planes of thought
Through the stench of disinfectant
what about the years I spent pampering your ass
'Cause Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
Says she's thinking of jumping
They ask me all about you, but my answers pull up lame
Speakin' to the punk that's tweakin'
Es war völlig klar ich konnte immer auf dich bauen
Left, right, left, right
Buono solo a cantare
Inspiracja postanowiłam podjąć temat własnej osoby, pisząc szczerze i uczciwie, równie bezlitośnie jak to zwykłam robić z bohaterami innych moich tekstów
And anger spilling out like gasoline
There's a stack of shellac and vinyl
And now they've got drive through
I am the alcoholic pissed in the park 
Of people, who would trade gold for food
When all I want is release
Come on join the bloodsport, show us some support Still working at the drugstore
By my friends
Something crawls to the surface
Will you never shout hua
Here's to a generation scared and always wondering why
The bottle slipped between her fingers
Everybody got the feelin' 
I got poor eyes and sore eyes, and no eyes at all
I wanna watch it all go down
I can't see 'cause I don't want to see at all
All with my tears
Ended up on the floor in the middle of a nudie show
This time I'LL take the stand
They say jump, you say "How high", yeah
But at nighttime I sit serenaded by the blues of a skyline hue
Found out you erased the memories
This house is full of mmmy mess
Welcome my downfall
Tied up in traffic, what do you know
Everyone got behind my back and broke it
Show'em what you're made of
They declared the war on drugs like a war on terror
Everybody loves to knockdown straw men 
And playiyay"
It will be weeks before they find her dead body
Forfeit the game
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a blood bath
Bells are chiming and tears are falling
Burn these words from our lips
I'm a God with spoon and syringe The world of darkness where death begins
And I ain't comin' around just to see them get pissed
That empires run on the old black gold
When you're the boy that I want
Evil from his head down to his feet
And who die when I tell them
Fuck what I want
Everyone wants to be America's little fantasy
No limit, hah, hella greedy, uh
Come on come on baby let me shout shout let it all out, these are things I can do without
In other words, hold my hand,
Well, I've got a bad feeling about this
Listen you tanningbedbaked, brokeass, goatfaced, oompaloompa monkey problem
You're stripped, vulgaryour pulse points none
Do you go to the temple tonight
Making money
Don't lose that skin feeling
We want to be just like you
Too late too late now to be
Play it off as stigmata for crossover fans
Ghostman
With a mind of a God and a hearth of an atheist
Another lesson learned
I'm that heathin blaspheming the lord above
Party everyday
Well it's a different man in your face
Cuff your tiny hands and feet
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you spit on my snatch
You're going home in a fucking ambulance
Breeding fear and loathing with the lies they're speaking
Prophecies of libidinous scourge
All those motherfuckers
You confess it all away but it's only shit to me
Let's just kill everyone and let your god sort them out
It's been me VS the world
Greed kill the need and bleeds the lines
You're not the one with all the problems,
Now that I know just what you're all about
I want you to know
Don't sing me lullabies
I wanna feel your heart race in mine
Bad flood flushing your veins
Safe and ignorant
Against these fuckers
I let go of everything I had left at home
Blood in or blood out, son was bugged out
Give them the respect they deserve Give them the respect they deserve
You're all the fuckin' same
My only true friends
Of a dark Scottish loch
But he was always trying to find himself
Still running
Donc cassos d'immigré qui fout le riffe à son scrutin 
Kill in cold blood
Breaking my back doing something
Like staring across an ocean and
They watch their sons die
I'll tie your legs, keep you, against my chest,
Under the table, under the daytime sky
So when you act up, he smokes ya and keeps firing
It's a thin line I walk, everyday but I'm good with it
Bleed motherfucker, bleed 
You should learn some respect I think you need to learn some respect
And blow that little piece off shit off the map
No more, no more
 And the material singers will fade into dust
Oh, what a heartbreaker
It's the bird, it must have been the bird, disgusting critter, it must
If it wasn't for lies, I probably wouldn't survive
"Be like me girls and become a real man,"
Come on give me just a little bit now
This is the world that I share with the clowns
These wounds, like a catalog of flaws
And I'm not a slave
The lights are on but nobody's home
I waste time by talking to the drama
Lies an army of a thousand nowhere kids
So let's gather with the Gods tonight
Who speakin' the truth
So hard to deal with the ones who can't feel
They shitty like suppositories, that's the end of the story
And it makes you wanna scream
One wrong move and it's death you're facing
I kill myself thinkin' bout things that you do to me
Everybody's a thought just waiting to fade
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
That's when you leave the room
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Life pouring out of my veins
A record executive records a demo of his apology
In a human holiday
I'm hungry and ugly,
Deshalb bekam ich mehr Energie und ich lief automatisch schneller
Sadly as I tie my shoes
Go fuck yourself
You can waste your life without my help you bitch, please die
So we'll see who stops the black guerrilla
But as I hold you and listen to you sleeping,
Jimmy died today
I don't wanna be defeated
Honey bring it close to your lips
We are the aliens
Fuck that's what they all just end up doing in the end
The way I hurt myself again just to get back at you
A mulatto, an albino
Now he sobs like a baby in agony does cry
My relief is my release
To inject the pain
Dumaladipa amadui amadui
I believe in peace, bitch
Telling us what we need
Ultimate killing machine
Then a van with no hubs suddenly pulled up and erupt
It's sexual debauchery, you fucking cunt
Ranked in no class like Marxist
I overestimated you
Why you wanna please the world and leave yourself to drop dead
Society has made me temporarily insane
GOD have mercy on me today
Suck, suck, suck, you pig
And in the morning the shells will wash up on the shore
I know I've been tolerant till now,
Oh, oh, honey I'm a mess
Erase this scum from my fucking sight
I do not know anything
Do you feel the same way too
This is war
You never really gave a damn
The tears will begin
To be kicked around the garden
Go answer your phone now
And choking on her candy flesh
I am the deviant and you're always right 
The�night�is�cold�and�long
Another world, another time
In came the girl with the saddened eyes
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
I move in another dimension
Makin' eyes at all my so called friends
Commentators bring aside try watchin my paper
And now I'm a different person
Come on let me have a final kiss now
Niggas want to act, damn, you don't even know me
Please someone help me take away my loneliness
Porque tú nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Still haven't done anything I did not later regret
Were you always chasing girls
Ima go get some new expensive shit
And he's mean talking beanstalking icey man
It surely works its ugly way inside
What we need to set us free
My bones are tired, Daddy
Were you thinking about me 
I woke up to my cold sheets and the smell of New Jersey
That it's over 'fore it's even begun
All I feel is bitter
Fake plants are killing me
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
Time to surrender, yeah sweet surrender
If you trust me
Cause niggas feel this right
To the lick of carnivorous winds
I move on, move on, I move on
And you want more
What do you lose when it all goes to your head
I'm trippin', this drink got me sayin' a lot
These are the days that are split down the middle
A little more time before I slam the door in your face
And breaks him off clean, call me the upsetter
I will not rhyme on tracks
Roll right, roll call
Oh God, he wants to take you
Dirty secrets, dirty secrets
No one knows the real reason  no one can stop him
Ich bin der Abgrund, das Chaos
You've got hate running through your veins
Boy or girl; pink or blue; yeah either way
Now you put me through hell 
Please don't play that song on me again
'Cause we all need to scream out loud
Too many happy faces, I wonder what that means
How can I grow a girl when you never were a man
You're the tip, tip, tiptop of the charts
It holds me prisoner too
Yeah, it feels like someone pushed the rewind
I know you never needed anyone 
And roll across the ocean
Before Guliani got into office and deaded shit
What you want  disease
You wanna go, son
I know when you're alone
Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
As the dreams of your darkness died
Lost my innocence to a nogood girl
Got my arms they flip flop flip flop flip
'Cause it's an oldfashioned dream to plant a family tree
We got CEO's making two hundred times the workers' pay
And letterhead
It must be raining 'cause a man ain't supposed to cry
Going back to the school tomorrow
And I made lemonade out of it
Can your mind take it
You were not honest
Y'all feeling my pain I've been running wild time and again
The juggernauts of this rap shit
Dahmer, Nielson, Yoshinori Ueda Blanche and Pickles, Amin, Milosevic
Everybody needs to find their own way
Yeah, he remembers it
So many stories stay unhold
No more happy face
I'm a fool I keep believing, I'm a fool I'll believe at all
Your loaded smiles
Innerman's stature
Break, break, break, break break it down
And he's gonna start a war
Then allow them to dine upon this flesh
Present day heartfelt moments killed by a slap to the hand
Fill this vacancy underneath my skin
Have your face in another bitch twat
Like a motherfucker from hel
It makes no difference to me
Taking his name
I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my commandments
Too late to unearth it
When I'm not around
Thank you kindly leave now Would you kindly go away 
Split lipped with nothin' to lose
There's colors on the street
Break me shake me hate me take me make me
Everything I thought I knew
It's on all night and day
And I do believe that you hate yourself
Spinning, turning
Spewing, sweating blood demon breath out
You're jumpin', you're runnin', you learn to play
I'd hate to see you on the pile
Ah, tell me, how do you sleep at night
The night full of blood
Unleash a stranger from a kiss, my friend
Will you die for the perfect war
'Cause in the end I'm a sensible girl
How could you tell me it was a murder
Does nothing to protect you
I'm fallingdown
That a heart's heart and we do what we can
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles heel is
And the day is rising
I like kids when they're asleep
Where the old north wind blows through southeast hell, yeah
I know we are all so angry
I spent my whole life
What have I got nothing much at all
Niggas that getting hot not this hot nigga very hot
Pocket money spent on hot pants
Can we fake it, can we makebelieve
You can hate me now
There's no chance I'm ever getting out
Now I need therapy to hate a little more
Break somethin' tonight
She said "run run run as fast as you can but you can't run run from our law given hand"
Their judgment now
Your discrediting has lost my consent
E il cuore è grosso quanto un pugno, non ci state in molti
Long before the waking dead will ever get their chance
Twenty minutes in broke another fucking string
Everybody's gonna hang out here tonight all right
Do you wear a vest no
WHAT Your body is the temple Everybody listen got to tell you something
And you sent your flames Your shooting stars
I divorce your innocence and my guilt
The right to innocence,
And I'd have seen Snoop give away Eddie Bauer's
And now
Forever each day
Cold day, warm heart object of affection
I wonder what you'd sound like begging me
Come now for you to be a MAN
I want to scream out in my self defense
Just let your body burst into a streak of light
And knocked his glasses
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap Oh
Now scream
Oh, I'm a liar, I lie, I like it, I feel good, I'll lie again, and again
Bad blood eats you all up
You hold me down like a magnet
The illness sneaking in
Bad words  Could you get back
A baby is born and another one dies
Pushing outwards
They send a sucker to your folks, lookin' stupid
Ha ha, got ya, go ahead, yell
So please don't whisper sweet nothings in my ear 
The policemen broke my door down
And I'm bout to take it to another level bitch
Well, I'd get you son of a bitch
Wishing I were better than the rest
The lipstick
I think I'm going crazy, beware
I'll see you all in class, but not if I ditch first
It's ' now and all that shit done passed
And you think that that's your baby you don't know
And your sweet surrender 
God owns god cheats god lies
Blues are falling like showers of rain
It just screams out loud, yeah
Death, murder, kill
It's either there when you're born or not 
The snakes get fat while the good rats die
But lord knows that this world is cruel
How many you betray, you've taken everything
It's everybody else, it can't be me 
Beat a brotha down in the middle of the street
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
Conquered, and the one holding rifle next in line
The more that you deny my pain, the more it intensifies
I need sometime to find out why 
She don't need no mustang
A simplified love sick taking no prisoners
My god pouts on the cover of the magazine
No no more 
Silence's like disease, but I dare not say it hurts
Have we lost everything now
My soul won't rest until the colony is free
Let them hear it in the night Yes, we'll fight They're listening Let the night roar Let the night roar, because they can hear us, they know we mean it We'll kill them if they come
Believe everything you say
Who've been stamping their feet to a different beat
Probably come to die in this town
Take a lung of dirty air
With the sound that travels around the universe
Left to take back all the mistakes you've made
Yeah, that's your skin;
Funny how money makes a fuckin' little picture
Your life can do
You will not touch my tools
Someday I swear I'm going to get it
Cut wide open, it's been rough being broken, all alone, this body better get up
E contro i morti non puoi vincere mai
And your blood runs like the venom of a poisonous snake
If someone you know is weighing on your mind
It is you they set their standards to
Comunque meglio non chiamare 
Make it be a whore, a tabloid cliché
And one day we'll see this come around
You're ready or not
Can't see nobody
And it has always been this way and it won't change
Our teeth full of holes
You lose your head on your chosen trip
Travel fulfills you but the distance it kills you
Oily hands wag a finger
Your loss mine now
We were born to fight
You swollen with a crime
Well I thought I got you on my side
To take a cold shower 'cause you get no ass
The least you could do is take it back, all the vicious remarks and verbal attacks
I'll give you fucking sores
I guess that's all that I got left
I know it's gonna happen but I don't know when
Either, etherlicious or rebel yelling anathema
Do you feel like suicide
Doesn't he know he's going down
Hit to Chirst NonPhixion striking prison Ice shirts
Wounds collected through a lifetime
So take your fucking faker face and stay away from me 
When your playing these games
And your ass will be home in one damn piece
Well back up and back off
Filled the shoes 'til I was ten
And we've seen how the tears come around
I gave you my heart
She's not my sister
Blade runner, in a beige hummer all summer
Don't try to make them mine
Same as the last punk, when I stuck the gatt up his anus
Well I got a bad feeling about this what is this for
I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
Ici y'a pas fake y'a pas de faux y'a qui ont est
We were peasants and the cotton was our king
But not to have it
Don't need no more lies
Do I have to put the law on you baby
Our nights are colder right
I have lost my edge
But if God put me in your plans or not
But the devil's apprentice, he gave me some credit
With love I believe
But you drive on through
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
Is fuck you
You're showing what you feel like inside
And how can I be someone you respect
He shoots his arrows wildely with bottles
Pathless makeshift, glass knife
Of somebody's life on the stage and somebodys life on
I'm living life through someone else
You are a liar you are a liar
th and like Madison
And do away with everything, fuck it
Ask a few questions, quit a few bad habits and after that
Now that I'm old enough to love
If you want to live like the folks on the hill
"She's dead Lent, just how we wanted it Great"
And we want to be just like you
I close my eyes to feel the cold
I could write you a song, send you a note
You wanna get a room like noone else
Die, die so viele beraubten, teilten mit dir ihre Gier
Well it's happy ever after that's what we want
Hangin' out with the OG's shootin' up the clubs
I play a game it's called insincerity
It's the fear that you can't do right
Your dead eyes wide open
The hearse brings corpse back to the morgue
You think I give a fuck Come on we're going for a ride bitch No
The double jab, right cross what they caught in they mouth
Another working day has ended
Yucca mountain goddesses
It was like the backdrop of a play
I know there's a better way
I hate you
Wild like hell
I'm hungry to begin
That was not what I wanted to do
Hey yeah, I'm a dirty mouth
We only want what's best for him 
On parle de pèz et de monnaie de femmes de fraises et de honey
And the fog rolls in on the highway
'Gainst lawyers and 'gainst priests stand up now stand up now
Promised only sky but given ground
Er war noch jung, g'rad dreizehn Jahr 
Taint my mind but not my soul
% believing all the videos
Lose electricity, lose gas, phone, plumbing, humming
And I'm tryna to use the phone but they makin' noise
And if you violate you'll probably get your shit chopped off
You've got a lot to lie about
But when asked to make a point I tend to whisper
And it just left you full of humiliated confusion
Of the blinkered eyes long enough to
You can scream right in my face,
My mic sounds nice
Now I have taken control control
Now the wolves of time who stalk Mankind
You love this ass, why not shake it
Ah yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Space age rage to rattle your cage
You can watch Good Will Hunting by yourself you bitch, please die
In which you hog the intellectual spotlight
The bloodshed on the dusty roads
Nós assistimos televisão também
Kill or be killed
And I'm sorry
As the dagger screams
That I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
From the whole fucking staff At you, they laugh
I'll be your enemy too
You don't know me, no you don't know a thing about love or life in between
You say that we are friends
Somewhere between my shoulders and neck
Well I just made my perfect worldoops you're gone
Came from voices talking in your head
Will you be able to tell 
And you won't see me surrender
Practice of a humanist made in his image
Face the day embrace the pain
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me"
Oh Oh Oh Oh you were going to be my life
I never underestimate the enemy that's what you do
I may not suit your taste tonight
You say that the magic's gone, well, I'm not a magician
I work hard to take care of every one of my niggaz
Love me or stay the fuck away from me
And before you had a chance to get up
I'm gonna pack me a gat tonight
Anything to break the silence
I know you can't help it
Mr International, passport pimpin'
Fuck your droid noise, Voyboy's Noid ploy
Someone's on the bathroom floor
Woman like a man, like a man, like a man
You shouldn't have to shout for joy shout
Now they know their robes damn hoes that fold my clothes
Recycled Angel tears
Baby penetrate my mind
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
Oh, baby, its in my head
That's how people are
Who was born into the wealth of this sytematic fuckin' scam
Some people get away wit' losin' my rhyme
And half the time I open my mouth to speak
You know, we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately 
Can't help but wish that life was like a Drake song
BomBom, rock the nation
Stop, stop, stop, stop 
Cram that cop donation in your ass
Boring fucking politics that'll get us all shot,
Oi vey, the slayers of your harmony porn life
To know this will
Even without a nonday first
No no
You're all reality and sound bites, and the freedom is never in plain sight
Neon black tanks grope the skyline
It's not fair to deny me
All men are just so fickle these days
What will people say
Gotta hit the ground 'cause here the slug comes
Cause this shit's gonna publicly crash your systems and isms and formulaic flows
The government says that killin's a sin
Tell HER the truth, ALL of the truth
Aber dass die deutsche Sprache sich auch daran berauscht
I know to be
I'm gonna kill it, yeah
What's that you said, you were my friend
Where the hell you creed 
We go through the pain together by any means
And revive her dying mind
Yeah, that knife in my back
There's room at the top they are telling you still
Hide your eyes
One that's born of memories
Blood flowing faster, no clotting
Without me, you're nothing
Look, we can just take Hailie and leave
I won't hate myself to be loved by you
When you break the circle, you have no right to live
The better days
Because you've got no soul
Af en toe moet ik nog aan je wennen
'Cause I think some shit about to go down nigga what's goin' down
Stop the want
There's one way in no way out
Inside your head
Shake your skin Like a scrambled TV
Star no star
Just shut up and make it right
When asked about the man that had died by their hand
Unplugs its eyes
Been working hard been writin' songs about the things he feels
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
I'm gonna try should I oh fuck
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
He asked me "How would you feel if everybody acted like you didn't exist"
Ill drink less
lachend auf die Strasse scheißen,
All the planets and the stars
Don't know how long I've been awake
I feel all right
We know how to pray
Now you want to try a life of sin
The cross, the capital, the pale families
Just a vanished ghost And your legacy
Young and sweet like mother made you
Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Just let die here
Maybe I'm paranoid
With a chat room full of lovers
And I'm down upon my knees
You fucked up  Ah
So kindly as I welcome niggas back to the jungle
To any fool with a grievance, it's open season
Ain't nothing changed niggas know I'm holding the torch, bitch
Who them niggaz that you fuckin' wit' us
Für mich ist die Sonne gefährlicher, das ist der Beweis
If you gonna leave me baby leave today if you leaving, leave
A breeding ground for your untruth
He only wanted someone to play with
I know you niggas wish you could prevent it
Can we ever forgive love for it's pain
Now I have come to be the walking enmity
Sit up front We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up
And now you're chillin' on a half priced clearance rack
Or a single KO
Quelli che sanno chi eri
Why do I feel desperate now
You think you're set 'cause you get lotsa hoes,
I'm a fucking unicorn, and fuck anybody who say I'm not Wolf Gang
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her
And the tree The tree of knowledge
I moved forward and thank God for the lessons learned
Some say the X makes the sex pects
But I'm afraid that it might kill you then
Another one you string along
To love another
I get choked up
Fucking buck in the wild kid
Now I lay me down for death
Sie sind ihres klaren Verstandes beraubt
Sometimes I gotta say shut up
I'm going to see to your immediate needs
You wave the red flag, baby you make it run run run
God, I clenched my fucking fists and banged my head
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
They all hate me 'cause he loves it
This thing does not end here
Give me stuff to break
It ain't gonna ever stop niggas
Because my scars won't heal with time
And I told her "Sorry baby, but I'm not the one to blame,
Manchmal schreib ich und die Wahrheit schlägt mir ins Gesicht
I'll give you three to die
While Deception was a clickin' his high heels
The fire is dying out
Come on, gather 'round the sound
When you come to collect my body
Does every morning make you happy
I don't want to let you go
We are the most impassioned ugly people
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Go ahead Walk away
Don't wanna be described as fake
Procrastinated measures decrease our chance to save
We'll steal the fire out of your eyes and turn it on you 
A poisonous saint with a brittle, crippled frame and she fooled me with her motherly gestures, my only guess is she's misguided
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask
Don't know much but I do know
There's a page back in history
Take my blessings where ever you go
How you dig that shit
The way I rhyme in Islamic promises, ignorance is common sense
This is the manifest
Of the working class
I want more
Find another life far away
Yeah This the most inteligent record lady, KPONEINC babe forever
Keep it all inside till we feel we can't unleash
To drink for forty days and forty nights
I remember when you used to be shy
And even though I'm angry I can still say
I want to kill this waitress
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
The evil ones
Overseeing the game, over being part of the same ol' thing
You better believe  you sucker
I smell human flesh decaying and rotting
'Cause all I want of you is just to let me be
I'm all alone two kids at home, I need a job just any job
Just victims of the inhouse driveby
I spitup on my plate, as I sever the entity
Ca sent, ils aiment les étrangers quand ils peuvent en tirer profit 
But I love disaster and I love what comes after
We rhyme sick and side  for dime chicks
The farm, that's where she belong, better leave me alone, calling me and asking where I'm at
I'm sorry for the mess
All things must pass
There is no strength in trying to break me, no
Ronald Reagan was an actor, not at all a factor
We were born to live here we were born to die here
Want it all Are we singing
To Injest The pain
Well "good god damn" and other such phrases
You're still a lawyer
You will be looking right here
Will not keep me interested
Oh oh ain't that nothin'
There once was a girl, and she suffered from sickness
Oh, don't you know that anyone can join
New found power
They just ignored the words I said
Get up, put up, open your eyes
You fucked up, you bitch  you really fucked up
Woman there's someone in my house, there's someone in my house
Lay me spread eagle out on your hill, yeah
There's an angel in your smile, a demon in your kisses
Funky piano
Your very means, they have no ends
The taste of ink is getting old 
Two types of people in this world I recognize
But there's nobody there 'cause nobody cares
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
Pass the prozac, designer amnesiac
I gave you the Documentary, shit was a classic
Oh, the leaves began to fallin'
So please just leave me the hell alone
Now I can't believe
Watch the truth manifest once the story unfold
So stop wasting my time stop wasting my time
You say, "Who the devil"
Don't call me nigga, this MC goes for his
Find another fault of mine you can scream to
When I'm dreaming, yes, I know I'm gonna dream 
You say you miss me like crazy now
Send a death fetus to my ex on Valentine's Day
They bustin' out a blunt for this shit
Taking their time right behind my back
It makes me want to stick my dick in your face
And I see that it makes me want to shed my skin, shed my skin
Robbed and stole so many so much
Left you in the forest with your carcass in the harness
And watched you silently
From your darker days
But you can't pass the police or the pentagon
In your filthy little worn out, broken down, seethrough soul
The sky is fallingpeople running scared
Now dey got me losin' my point
I still want to see you
So, keep poppin' at the mouth and get fucked up like a Bitch
The devil made me do it"
So I'm left here seedless, mindless, careless
Track masters
A bridge is only there for you to jump
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins
We kill for oil, then we throw a party when we win
Sometimes I drive slow
Let's pick over the traces
To me you ain't no angel's child
Che sei il sole e non un raggio
Like a hunchback juice
You left me lying in your dog descent
Are closing in
Man, you gotta be crazy
Thinks she got the mix all right, says she wants to drive tonight
In this triumph of the wills I won't be overrun
Someone's gun is laughing, laughing
I pace around the parking lot
With all the ways of communicating
Suckin on the tits Had the hooker beggin for the dick
Ah yes I'm all grown now
Batter but the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters
After deep cups of patience have been drunk to the dregs
From the edge of the world
Nothing makes sense, so I won't think about it I'll go with the ignorance 
Parallel crossing lines
Take the pleasure with the pain
And have a fat nigga sit on him
Communication is not just words
I've learned some nasty lessons so I'm shutting
I am me, and I know exactly who I am, what I am
Stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss
I'm your meanest thought
Just stop your bitchin, your bitchin
For the pain you caused me 
And I wait for the flood
To know the words you speak to me aren't honest
And all I got was a fuckin' shitty article in Thrasher
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned
Everybody looking for the ladder not the answer to the question
He'll remember you
Only thing to liberate my soul
Have another drink and drive yourself home
He shuts his eyes
There won't be room for people like me 
Then he'd rape your mother Stick her face in the mud
Got a pack of Kools and a buzz to kill
The power amp, we call the "pamp"
Where you come from must be beat
It's not me you're dying for
One foot in the ground
Nobody sees it nobody sees it
Yeah they'll do anything just to spread disease
And always will until the end
I need another and another one
Counting the happy days 
Dried my tears up
She's widely known, the only maquereau that pays her taxes
I trusted you
Never fall again, never fall again
The violins play 'em baby
I sag my pants until my ass shows
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Here we go negero, I'll sing figueroa, figueroa
You feel the same
Less concerned about fitting into the world
All the misery you feel
Begging all fucking men and women to listen
She sucked the poison out of my wounds
Silence so sweet feel the dreams unfold
Play another charming
I don't wanna play
How do you tell an angel
'Cause ev'ry day I'm feeling fine with myself
Should be made unemployed
I like this, I like the way this feels
As detectives trace my hands with chalk
So here I am, it's in my hand 
Y'all know the niggas that be steady screaming fuck you
And you know, you know, you know it was all wrong
Ah, how do you sleep at night
Filling our brain with a lot of cocaine
It's none of my business if it makes him heal better
I'm walking, follow me 
We like to suck before we spit
It's a bitter mouth it's buttered and knifed
He just drinks his Poland Spring
They invented a dividing line, street credibility
Uh, you hear that shit
Waiting on a trickle with your hands out
The boy I love's got another girl
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be,
And this sting won't help this bleeding heart forget you
I know when I leave
Finger on the trigger but your punk ass is scared to pull it
Don't care if the whole world falls apart
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
You're not that smart, you're not so strong
California king wrestle gators in the Everglades
With this hungry girl
But now you are coming
I always wanted the most
And all the pain that you hide
And honey I'm the world's forgotten boy
I've heard them rotely repeat your teachings with elitism
In a crowd of laughing people laughing
Just feel the pain
But we mean nothing to you You would believe
SplendidAnd lets end it
I'm sad, I feel sad
Calls down fire upon
And the mother of gloom
I know you're full of shit x
I think he's in a jealous rage
Not a single soul is breathing
Now you're closed, now you're closed, now you're closed
The party's far from dead, I'm happy in my empty bed
We americans can't write
My brethren and sisteren, I'm speaking are you listening
Oh Mississippi come and wash my pain away
In a swinging door
Break your heart and bring you down
For from hist'ry I had learned
And we plotted out my death
And I don't know who to trust
Our faith was made for those who lost their own way
I'm not afraid of the price I pay
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
While you sleep, I destroy your world
But I know that God put you in front of me
junto a los artesas y conscientes snob
Fine, you don't believe Black real official
To a world devoid of lie
C'mon, keep sleepin' on me
Where life is worth more than a living wage
Close your eyes, we're coming down
Don't you fucking know what you are
Bodies thrusting to the beat of our shame
Killers reinvent and believe
Some make a living doing killing Colombian penicillin
But now we get scared like our parents
But the people in control don't care for you
Kid ain't shit changed
The gentry are all round stand up now
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
"Just how we wanted it laughing"
Wish I had the strength to turn my back
Power That's not the way to do it
A bullet came to visit a doctor
If I make love to you now
You did nothing for me
The drugs that I took have made me impure
CHRISTJah flesh; CHRISTLight Within; CHRISTBeginning and the end
Take another look around and find someone else to play
I hate the way I love you and I love the way you hate me
Is the position that you hold
I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do
She's ashamed of her birthplace
Getting down and dirty baby
Sitting on a fence is a man who strokes his twenty beards
"Come on baby, what's on your mind
But if you'll give me just one more chance I swear I'll never lie to you again
She hates her life
Peel the candy crust of my body fake flowers
"Are you ready for the joke" 'laughter'
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Yeah, if you'd like that, we can ride on a black horse
We go in the back
If you ever want to know what time it is
Beängstigend wie Ratten, die sich auf dich stürzen
You're out of your mind
Oheeoh through the civil earthquake
You gotta let these shits go, man
Did I read between the lines or erase
These verses ain't for the religous and the weak at heart
Fucking worthless parasite do your own fucking work
So tiring when you cry
I'm Hopsin, I spit shit so unfair and real
Me not unfair to you
Fuck your traditions, fuck your positions
The oil burns in thick black columns, the buzz saws echo through the forest floor
Now this here's for those who choose fights
When I know they don't believe in me
That man before
Dead but dreaming, memories remain
You're crawling back to tell me
I hope it all comes back to you
You wanna hear my long snake  moan
There is nothing left to say,
No more, no more, no more
I've know the damage
Now in ', let's see who beats the jack
Lines on a map we don't need
I can't always be playing, playing your fool
This is not novelty
Little bitch wants to live in her own delusions
About the American boy back in the states
Behind the smile of a thousand moms and dads
A molotov to start the conflagration
I think you keep playing to play
And don't waste my fucking time
Back slap you like a bitch
You're the man
War Ooh, good god
American grave
Let the starving ghosts feast,
Go lie in a hole and be small
She's not really my type, but I think you two are forever
Macin', nothin' of gunnin'
Scar tissue, blood blister
And I'm starving, I'll bite your arm off
When the sun and nothingness beat down
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Well, she crept back in the house at half past three
My head is filled with disease
Come via antenna to your car radio
I beat that bitch with a hit
I soldi entrano ed escono
You got this power over me, ah
Riding in the dirt
But you hurt me in a way that I've never known
IAK niggas, westpoe killing you slow
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Far behind if not for her condition
I'm on fire
I spend my nights in the factory
When it all burns down
And I should get on with my life
It won't be enough these days to say sorry
Give me some answers 'cause now I'm lost
It's not like me to have my back turned to open places
You want it back
He is down on bended knee 
Ready to hold heat, driveby with Rule
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
She hides in the back and is unseen
From day one I could not comprehend
Standing on the corner, waiting for the bus
I feel stupid and contagious
I've been through hell, And I think I know it very well
Tempestuous love passing me by
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Love, disfigure, amputate
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
'Cause I got more back than them, so it makes alot of sack
There would be tears in my eyes
The sheets are stained and bloodied
That's why I'm glad Jesus died when he did Oh yeah Because if he lived to be forty, he would've ended up like Elvis, come on Oh yeah, he had that big entourage Twelve guys willing to do whatever he wanted to do He was famous already at that point If he lived to be forty, he'd be walking around Jerusalem with a big fat beer gut and black side burns going, in Elvis voice "Damn, I'm the son of God Gimme me a cheeseburger and French fries right now Where's Mary Magdelene, I want a blow job now Come on now Fuck you, I'll turn you into a leper Give me a cheeseburger now, goddammn it Bluhah Love me tender, love me true, empty my colostomy bag Ah Bluhah Huhah Oh, I think I shit my pants on that last 'huhah' Change my diaper now Huhah"
From this flesh, from these bones
And don't tell me not to reference my songs within my songs
Oh, The beat goes on
Before you're gettin' warm by my heater
I want to be a star
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Graffiti Jack sprays in black
The city's sweat is scaring her into her dreams
Your mother's arms
Chasing this pigeon down the street towards the banks
Shut up I'm about to tell you how
Alt "This song is a joke, & my life's a joke"
Now bleed bitch, bleed
'Cause no one truly lives or dies
Blew a head gasket flipped shit and shot up a school
Natured now and blown apart
When you watch the smile fade from their face
Don't ever let them change your face
You know what, man This is not an independent rap beat, can you tell
Please, please, please tell me
And the truth I keep pushing aside
The Epic, digital bliss, the mega sound
Embrace and fly through the madness 
My mind is focused, my thoughts are disciplined
Why don't you go watch it by yourself Go to hell
Designer impostors find us twitching in the claws of the snake
Now from the slime on your tongue
Speak the truth don't you dare lie to me
But I find more joy in coaxing with a gun
Disgusting flows like third world country tapwater
Give me back to the earth we've defiled 
It's in her kiss, black as sea
Come move in another dimension oh oh oh
Backstage, everybody wants a piece of JD
We got politicians running races on corporate cash
I ain't buyin' no future when the past is so far away, yeah
Name but I didn't even hear it, and she started screaming BUDDY BUDDY
Grown and released with the heart of a thief
So send my love a letterbomb and visit me in Hell
But that's just the way of the world
To the mindswapping parasites that feed off my existence
Cause today's not the past
I'm ridin' high now
And argue that's not what you did
And she'll say anything to make you move again
Got some wires crossed in my twisted head
My heart is not a football for you
Kuulkaas enot
Fuck all your jewelry and fuck all your cars
Can just make you look like a liar
And Deception made me as I am
Who can make me feel like this
I've never been afraid to die
Too bad bitch, you're gonna finally hear me out this time
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot
I was taking control
The trumpet of freedom has sounded
You said you'd call, that's a lie
It's funny how your worst enemies always seem to
That's could break your day or make your day
It would be to hold on to your dreams
Tu postura no molesta
Red is the colour of revolution
But I'll wear dark glasses all the time 
Than have the world and all of it's gold
I show my life for all to see
Reclaim your power
But when the shit comes down, you're out of places to hide
You see me drinkin' there every night
Better tell her
Mother Goose ain't got shit on me
Oh Mississippi come and take my pain away
It's all fucked you 've blown it
Turn on the TV, seein' the pain
Don't need your attifukintude boy
Say boom, say, I've kissed and caressed
And someday when it's all away
Five young punks for you
He kissed me he said
Just a scratch upon the skin, 
Feel the pain yeah
So play with the pussy or play pussy
Gimme me some fucking feedback
Before life was easy
'It's healthy for you to express your anger'
No matter where, no matter when
Big Brother's got no heart
Where words blister and die
II I I think it's something in the water man, it'sit's gotta be in the water
Shut the fuck up, the beatdown on the verge what
I'll see ya motherfuckers at the next show, pac, the media is my bitch
With a little understanding
To clean the mess that he has dropped
'Cause now I have something to say
In this division of the law
No fighting all the time
On her milk white neck
Why should I suffer when I can't see your eyes
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
Well I need a place to run to
The darkness still falls
The bombs were attatched to the wings of the plane 
Do not rely on this broadcast alone
I get home and it's the same old sound
Hey now, all you sinners
Could rock your show single handed
She only gave you head
You mean more to me, than I could ever tell
See across the field
I don't want to care
Just you try to hold me down
Dog faced boy
Move my heart to the side
As if the heart were not enough
Of emotional rollercoaster's
Full of passion
You wanna be a woman like a man 
I still love the way you feel
Just to piss you off
In the valley of the fucking locust
Is not a good vibe, or something I've missed
What a life, you do it like you really mean it
You can hate me nooow You don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
To resurrect your soul
 If you want to stir up real mud
I'm living with a perfect stranger, but I find myself alone
Look around you, is this what you want
I was taking control
Bring your IQ and try to understand
I'm the ringing in your ears, I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Whatever dude
I'm fucking done
Oh Baby Why won't you talk to me
I represent the wicked and I'm creeping out from the dark
It burns like the open flesh on my arm and reminds me of the days
I am the doctor and I'll kill your pain
Years I've wasted waiting for her to come through for me why was I so blind
I'll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun
So when your new shit finally drop, that's one album I will not be buying
I want the life you think I have
That takes the beat from my heart
Stepping on some toes that he does not know 
Hes gonna evolve us, some rockes to prove that shit is garbage
Set, Style blaze hard with the criss one race over to race
The black sand stuck beneath her feet in a warm Sorrento sunrise
Its payback, and it's all
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards Duh
Kick it to me now cos I just can't figure
To obtain the sight I need
A social alliance, are you in distress
There's no price tag on my conscience
Roll some notes an' hail a cab
To submit to the  race
Think I'm going for a walk now I feel a little unsteady
No you're not thinking, you're on drugs Normal people don't act that way
And I have nothing to say
With backing  with blessing,
I like playing with the pans in the kitchen mama
Fix my head 
So open up that prison door
That's what you ought to know
Fear this hate Fear this doomsday
These eyes have had too much to drink again tonight
So I can cold spark the party when I'm rockin' the place
If I ever will be there Do you sleep anymore
Sleepin' wit the enemy bitch
Where is my head
You want the badge of honor when you save my hide
I'm angry with myself
You're bleeding me x
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
You're all or not
Make good in the end
Bitch, we have got a problem, it's not enough to be hitting it
All I want is a little respect Respect
And maybe it's a woman
Your money talks but my genius walks
The one I want to hate
I'll tell you what you should see I'll tell you what you should see
Baby, I've had all my shots and I'm fine
Watch me now
Well you can't walk in my shoes
I would never want to
You stabbed me in the back, you're lower than a snake
It's time you know your enemy
'Cause the earth and space gave birth to this paleface
I never thought I'd change my opinion again 
Don't you wanna go for a ride
My hell
Save what you can do 'cause that's some bullshit
Came face to face
Brought you to tears again
That's when dickhead put his hands on me
I'm red and thick like fire
Life on the edge is the bread which I feed
Our little group has always been
Living in a city where the skinny niggas die
If this is spring than it's time to sing
All is left is pain
I know it's not allowed
Why did I see the birds an the sidewalk today,
So finally asked scratch when I can get my dick sucked
I said, I'm sorry mama
Understand
It's time to pick up a knife
You're so predictable no shadow of doubt
I love to see other people get
If I want to honky tonk around till two or three
Eh shit
Are just shucking and jiving
I see your mouth running
There was the bones of a song
You've got to learn
When did living start being a sin
Black chalk living room couch professor
That dog in you spit me out into the Mississippi
I've heard you talk about how
Giacchè non sono neanche carne da cannone a Dio
My distance from your toes babe
If you get burned
I feel you baby when you're so alive
And now, we're all to blame
Let them ferment and came back to our senses
My world hypothesis
Dem niggas bout to jump u
I can't keep control my anger
Stop and listen
And I'm just calling to let to know
It's time to fuse ourselves when love set free loves burning spirit
Pale arcadian moon, high definition flat plasma, Imax citywide transfer,
Sounds like you have a problem
So nigga fuck you x
See the waitress throwing attitude
Embrace me
Knowing this is a big mistake that I'll regret much later
He's a remote explosive waiting for someone to call
Smell the burning wreckage of even you
En unión con sus hermanos
And when the shit goes down, you're out of places to hide
Yeah, use your rights but don't imagine that it's heard, Oh no no,
My, my the kindest truths are often spoke but never heard
Of the landlord and his son
Until you taught them all how to bite
I got a bad feeling about this in you, in
Won't you let her leave today inject the holy spirit in her
When your chances fall in your lap like that
So hold your head 'cause I'm a torture yours, leave them open sores
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
Get down and pray to the souls from up above
Hear the warning, the end's Beginning
Oh it's often use many words to say a simple thing
Well, you can have him, I don't want him,
It's got nothing to do with me
E proprio questo sono stanco 
Do you care Hell no 
I'm not exactly sure of your motivation
Elvis had  but this one is mine
And there were jumping jacks and whistlers over christmas,
She's got a secret surname that nobody knows
Until the end of time
He's losin' his touch
When I'm crossing the road
I've got a long way left to go and you've shown me no grace
I'm so unhappy that I could die
Breaking the silence
Okay, here we fuckin' go
I think that I'm happier now
That they do not respect in any degree
But the real problem with this man
E non servirà un abbraccio
Fix it with your tiny fist there
And that's no one to talk to when feeling depressed
You're not what you seem 
Money buys you beds but it can't buy sleep
Lazy sunny day
Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down
I'll leave out the teasin'
We've spent our lives living in their past,
Attacking the vocabulary kingdom, see not everybody's cool
You want it
I'm gonna fuck the whole state of Ohio
My aim is dead on from my room with a view
I'm out this motherfucker
Keeps me always believing
Force the pace, ignore the speed limits
We're going to turn the world UPSIDE DOWN ON IT'S HEAD
And I hope you feel the same
I'm just saying I ain't heard shit from the horse's mouth
But now we're alright, we're all calm
Chorus I only wanted to be somebody
Line my nest with your soul  cleansed in bloodshed
It's all greater  minutes till doomsday
I, I, I don't need this poison
Wash up and kiss the altar
Moving the masses
You can try to suck me dry
I'm motherfuckin' radical
Picture frame broken daddy
And I'd have doubt it if she's heard a single word that I've said
Your silence shatters my sense of hope
This bright red feeling
You know those other girls just can't grind like me,
You piece of shit
Baby it's you I want,
He said, "You got your whole life to live,
Don't wanna think about the schools in Bosnia
What do I know What do I know
Ich möchte endlich frei sein, aber wohin soll ich gehen
Recall the sweet taste in your mouth
Every inch of planet Earth,
bin nicht spontan und mitreißend,
I've tried hard to make amends
You made me throw it all away, my morals left to decay
As I gazed down at his grave
We've lost that kind of spirit
And now you're desperate, and in need of human contact
All but the primitive side  the animal side
Trust built on a mound of shit
The club is all their law, to keep all men in awe
But I've seen the way she covers her chest up as if it was a national treasure
I'm not Jesus, Jesus wasn't fair
Till you come everywhere yeah
A little bit deeper
I wanted your words
When I shake your hand I'm a step on your toe
I want this ship cleaner than a hospital ward A radical has polluted our ranks
With the world running faster faster then
There was a voice behind my back
I cry and beat the bathroom floor
You piece of shit
I don't want to fade away  away 
Oh my god there's scenesters everywhere
And some strength that you won't believe
At four years old thought the world was joy
These hooks sink in
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
As a snap of rifle rounds echoes out across the fields
Set her soul on fire
Nailed inside my head
I don't like these tiny portions with your artful abortions of sound, 
We'll move forward
When I am queen on royal thrown made out of parts of broken bones
I won't play girl to your boy no more
The damn city bus, it moves so slow
Damn you for trying to fuck this up
Angry grip around your neck
No nodon't give me your nothin'
You stupid asshole
In these days to be an oddity
They just wear me down with more chains
I won't lie down as you walk away
The tide is swelling and we've fallen asleep on the shore
Type o negative cover, written by Peter Steele
No man is an island
Don't you dare mess with my Mean Machine
Anata sono made hashitai no, I just wanted you to talk about it
Blood is on the ground, they're shooting all around,
Look what you've done to your arms
My blood was an untrusty ink tonight
There's nothing wrong
And if you can't run to save yourself well then you deserve to be had
All night and day
Our hearts littering the topsoil Oh
You've played your little games
We learn to fall and run away
Drain out your blood we all deserve to die
If you ain't wit me I'ma throw you WAY over the edge
Bully boys out fighting, it's just the same old game
I don't want to hear it
And standin' like this with my ear to the ceiling
Well, I'm here to remind you
Got a pain, I've got a hunger
From those old lips to a town where its dry
And I want out desperately
Then have a mental breakdown and proceed to use a crack pipe
We can do it however you wanna do
Here's your answer it's still
When you kill the mother, there's no other
Your houses they pull down, stand up now
So, who's that ahead of me,
All those things I loved I now despise
They drink and they fight
You wouldn't have begged me to hold you
Make me hungry for you again
And still you have the guts to claim to the world
I gotta feel you right now; comin' around
You know I wish them all dead
Mä oon parempi kuin sinä, koska mulla on aatteet vitun ylevät
Right now I want to thank God for being me,
For passin such judgement, I can only wish you death
I think I know
Lookin' straight ahead like they know just where they're goin'
I think I'm paranoid
So what makes you think that I need
Doomsday
Life filled with deception, unwanted inception
Never let them make your face a mask to hide behind
I want the world to know
But now that's gone, gone, gone
Cooking up the books
I've talked to a bum out on Sunset Strip
On top of being talented, bitch I'm fucking passionate
 I'm on your fat claw
I've just stopped trying
Wipe the tears from your eyes
These aren't things I say to save me
Do my dirty work Yeah, yeah
You get more fun within your shell 
I'm feeling more alone
Mom and Dad said I was nothin, So it's time for me to show
I gotta get out or figure this shit out
Meet me where the city turns to trees and nothing comes for free
Shoulda known what ya missed at home
She wants to break free from eve
Real good, feel good, don't got no more brains
I would be faking, I didn't know
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
I am left in the night, trembling with fear,
So I've made music that made my mum cry
They say most of your brain shuts down in cryosleep
Walkin' slow, there go the po', now here we go
To be my friend
And a oneway ticket to nowhere, Baby
No, we don't sleep
Red orange furnace sphere notches down
I want to get off one time and not apologize 
They don't care if you cry
Stand for what the fuck you believe in, and don't let nobody tell you can't do what the fuck you want
'Cause it's die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Holding on at the end of the noose
I'd trade an eternity, for what's been taken away
Would you sit on the fence, take no chance
'Cause your punk ass made it up your fuckin' mind was gone
Down on their knees at the half court line
The guy who crept through the shadows every day
And I'll paste it into my heart shaped locket
And I know what little I've known of peace
What are we gonna talk about I don't know
Open it up, the stink of your sin
It left me caught between
The crowd drew the blood
And for the wars they wage
You've become the enemy
The warrior with the deadliest weapon is the one without an instruction manual for his gun
I wonder how it got to be You lied
Eighteen deep when the plane soar
They say a day of rest
I'm breaking the limit inside you
You fuckin' bureaucrats
She's running out the door
From the hands of Christ to the heads of the Daily Mail
You're stumbling in the darkness
As if you could not suffocate
Telling evils of the reefer, but all through time we've smoked the sky
Until the next breaks up
But I can't buy it, it's just too hard to stand beside it
Now fuck wit me
So you never get cash unless your record is "Shoop"
I just put my monies in the hands of the same people that left my people stranded
His heart went blind on me
You'd never understand
With your pigheaded rules
Wasn't it me you didn't want
Für die, die mit ihr die Welt regieren
Can we talk to make it right
Looking down every few steps
They think they got the answers, but there's something that they missed,
They're oh so flattering and so sincere
You're in a fucking coma
He's a fucking drag, But if you don't then you watch him go
These are all certain telltale signs of my decaying mental health
You will learn
With nosacrifice
You tried to make it all stop
Secluded from the whore
Now I just wanna make good on all the promises I have made
We learned to take all the corruption and greed
Crucifixion nails stain the bed of the holy
We will not spiral down
Is your wife, when ya look, oh, you ain't there
Where words go to die
And it's killing you, killing you
I give a damn about the damage to the body from botox
I will not suffer this loss
Oh no no no no no
Revolution come and die
On election day
Come into my life forever
They sell the tickets wit'cha name up in lights an' shit
This doll has turned to crap
Hit you in the stomach now you're feelin' what love does
I can't believe
Livin' deep in my soul
I've seen so many faces, and always left my mark
You can hear the devil laughing
You need a place to hide and I am
Meet all of my friends in the alley tonight
You got your game, made your shot
I crave the morning
I am numb, I'm everything you want
And deepest black
I spray terms like throwups, I'm 'bout to spit a feelin'
So you stagger back home, and wait for nothing
tritt diese Verfassung außer Kraft
Ghostface Killa
rahassa ja lahjoissa on tosi kiva kylpee
Bitch, bitch, bitch
Now that I made it through
They're gonna burn like hell tonight
And I am frozen with joy right where I stand
Textbook fucking mental
And got hit wit bullshit
Drink your beer, take your drugs
A ritual to mend my angry heart,
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed
So tell em' I said fuck you
No more having sex
A fist to the voice
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
It's such a shame to ruin this bright
I know my heart will break the day
Go to sleep
I make em' jump and mosh oh my gosh
But I climbed through
Only the rush hour hell to face
I thought maybe we'd made a pact,
This is a call to arms, to conquer, now to war
My life had barely started since you jumped all my heart
You'll never find your pleasure if you worry about your pain,
My white girlfriend won't suck my dick jus 'cause it's pink
I'm not Jesus, I will not forgive
I wanna new body that's strong
They know it all, that's what they want you to think,
Now label this my fuckin' trick shot
Somewhere that is Soylent Green, we're living life instead
In the shadows where the heads hang low
I know everything, I know everything about you
Like the rivets in my skin
The fucking brat
I don't believe her 'cause I just got the news on the wire
Are you talking to me
That forest burned A halo
'Cause free labor is the cornerstone of US economics
I keep waiting for the day that I can give it all away
But not another reason enough to continue
Rather swim in some fuckin' hot tar
The blood of Christ was shed to save your soul
And while your praying hands were up
I don't want anything from you
With one hand over the mouth, still managing to shout
And if you tell me fiction, you will never get me back
That you just can't trace
In arm's reach of the black remote
I'm sorry for you I'm sorry for you
Your mother sucks cocks in hell
Promises I made to you went down the sink
Innovation, I leave to smarter men
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see stars
In the end almost nothing changed
My life is their disease
Stand up I'll let you live a little bit with the pain that I bring
This game
'Cause it was etched in tears
The length and breadth of his body
Man please
Hey, and I don't think I can hold out long
If it's not the rule then it's always the case
Instead of sinking in the bay 
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em
These heads do turn
I don't ever want to
Coughing till there's pains in my fucking abdomen
All hail the wounded heart continment
There's a white horse running wild through the switchcane
All I want is you
I want you to say that you understand 
Only feelin' in this world is the life within you
I wanna punch you in the face
How white you fucking are and how you can fight for your race
My heart is so wide open, I'm so easy to deceive
Gossip gossip, nigga just stop it
I don't think I'll be your lifelong friend
I'm not letting you check out
Does she treat me like a snowman
Doin' some play from Backstage
Your bigtalkin' man friend came round to my home,
Can you face me
 And you're gonna know how fine you are
This is your life
You don't need her
So eager to walk plans
Yeah I see you acting all conscious gettin' passionate in rap songs
Oh, why you don't care no more
There's holes up in the sky
Master horned head turns to see what's on the bottom of his hoof
When you see the flags of freedom flyin'
We're on a bullet
You feel the jolt
Er war zwar etwas komisch
Self mutilation is the only thing I know
I can feel it
You're nothing to me
Out of my life, out of my hair
 Come over here yeah
There wasn't anybody that I didn't leave alone
And When you are free from the work of the towns
And hoes can't roll on
And this is not all that I am
I can't help it if I'm lucky
Abulic disciple
If you got so many dollas then loan me one
Let the smile give her everything she needs
Uh, as we pick up where the last Mathers left off
To let somebody touch you
In my dirty lungs
T'es à l'usine ici, les rimes ça sort au cost guy
Take me back to the beginning
And every time I tell that lie, I live without guilt
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying
Two cool people came, they're hiding by the door
You wanna get boned
You checkin' my pagers scrolling down my caller Id
She polished all upon the wall
Wealth and power crashing through
You're the one with all the pride
Child, don't you know
When she knocked upon my door
By that confession I've made
Maybe you'll come back 'cause you want me, maybe you won't
Dyslexic critters talk backwards to rap words
It's fucking righteous baby
Ignorance is bliss, didn't have a shoe
Is like waking, waking the dead
I didn't come here to be damned with faint praise
Why are the stoners always stoned
A paranoia got the best of what I hold dear
Make 'em hot and jumpy, trying to get that God money
You wanna fire my fuel
So you're the kind who deals with the games in the mind
If you're giving it up, you better spit that gum out
But there's a hell of a lot more to me
Conscience easing curiosity pleasing
Never hear, never cry
I'm so close to the fucking edge, I should be close to You
It was you and me hoe getting cnotes
I don't care no more
If you never take the time you never know what you won't find
Now I have better things in mind
I tongue a socket
We all get mad
I just get so hot, you know
Fixing to die, fixing to die
We're getting close, man, toe to to, man
You're setting things off  all over the yard
And it's fine, all those lies
You've been choked oppressed
'Cause on sunless days we're side by side
It's everything you had when it breaks
It's not that we don't get along
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
Oh, we never talk about the past anymore
A rising sun loomin' over Los Angeles
He says we knocked his socks off
Immortal Technique, I made this the bump in your ride
Thousands of white men standing in a park,
We're not the ones who let the children starve in faraway lands
I hope you get all that you want
They're pointing fingers and they're whispering discreetly
Everything that swore it wouldn't change is different now 
You could have spared her, oh but no
I'll shoot your useless brain out
So go ahead and put your tears on ice baby
My body's not a football for you
We need vices Awwww
We are peeking
Who fuck round with the trigger
They look like fucking machines
I blow you a cold kiss
I need privacy but can't be lowkey 'cause it isn't me
I'm fuckin' radical, nigga
And I've learned a lot from all these break ups and make ups
Their Saturday nights in
I have to take advantage, before the moment passes by
A slip of the hip or another
In this little booth where the truth has no place to stand
And the feeling coming from my bones
This is fucking loveless
See how far you get on top
Hey Got some static for some niggaz on the other side of town
The American people have spoken"
It's run in the family
Oh yeah
Shit, I'll take a life for my moment's moment
And see the truth, yeah
It's not funny 'cause when you think you're on the atip you slip
Consumers consume my soul away
Or just a hand to hold
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
Go see the rain forests
I'll end the world tonight
You said, "There's no one watching over me, over you; it's always out of reach"
While the edges slowly Fray
Don't want to leave
Of a dark Scottish lake
I'm all alone in a world you must despise
My life will kill me
You better keep your distance
Helpless as it steals my soul
Blown stack what's coming back Jack, we'll turn back
The perfect crime, crime of the heart
There's nothing here but the shadow, and now you know
I fall down just to give you a thrill
Fading away, well you might say I'm losing focus
And the flames burned away
And yet you know that really I'm sorry for you
I don't believe your dream even exists
I see no sense in doing this
Walk upsidedown inside handcuffs
To live and die
I hate everything I fucking hate it all
You were coming along and her eyes lit up
If you lie you don't deserve to have them
Oh, it'll be perfectrunning scared
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
Fear, To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Oh how I want you to know me
Spend some time in bliss
No, no no
Does she make you shiver under your skin
You'll get a bullet in the back of the neck, Millions of men with blank faces 
People spreading rumors, they ain't saying shit for real
We are the people that you hate
And I sing my sad songs
Your bed's been made
So cry if you feel
I was thinking
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
In spite of all my good intents
Can't forget the things you never said
Big black steel cap dealt rejection
Like a man, like a man, like a woman like a man, like a man
I crept on bounded knees
Look at me now, 'cause I win
I lost my heart on a Monday
Decimate your paradise
The stop lights were interminable, but I get along all right
And in the eyes of the jackal I say kaboom
Taking the makeup off my face
And I don't think you care to know
But the very next day you gave it away
BURNNN it to the ground
I never thought how was I to know
Drink deep, it's just a taste
Kill, kill, killx
Burned all of your clothes
M's and them 's came out of nowhere like your kid's wet dream
Where my sister once played
Cry your tears, pussy
'Cause your God is just losing his touch
I'mma need to see your fucking hand
You're the ones we hate
Peddlin' contemporaries killin' me loudly
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
Wake up, lonely, hating my life, alone
These must be the flags of freedom flyin'
And I hope you die alone
Said one thing and mean another
Would you walk me home then, everyday from work
And left us naked out here in the sun
Homie you know me
Not to say what you don't want to hear
Man I tried to do your stepdad
If there were no heaven
A whack rapper is what Hopsin isn't I kick it
There's no fuckin' way That I'm gonna fix you
And our dreams become fake reality
Naega bwado nae jasini meongcheonghyeo
Fix her hair and hide heir veins
And if you should confess to the crime
If your mum and dad
We're just a world away from where
The face of the Mother Culture is sickening
I used to want some explanation
With every breath I learn just a little more
When we hit you with the lick you'll see the wickedist
Let me tell you I'll eat all day
I'm gonna twist your head off, see
The Black Panther is the black answer for real
How many records you expectin' to sell
God cannot change
We wanna be somebodies
You're breaking off like something's in the way
Or street serfs who walk around dressed in all red
 "Through by a barrel of gun"
Roamin through the forest as the hardest lyrical artist
So what the hell is different
You catch me 'cause I'm falling down on you
Ah, future farmers of America
We're coming up with the sounds
When I'm dead I'll rest, I'll rest
I gotta go and write a song just to remind myself how bad it sucked
It's not yours  fuck you
Is this truth or is he writing fiction
It's nothing to you
You're putting poison here
Talking 'bout TV, please shut up
The paramedics walk backwards, like an Irish dance
I got a bad feeling about this in you
Does anybody remember back when you were very young
But you ban computer games
Let them break their hold over me
You may not feel me bawling out
Your screams were made silent
He smells the future on the lawn
Say lick my thirst
Total hate Total hate Total hate Total hate Total hate
Losing sleep wasting time killing myself till the day I die
But I am not a maiden fair
A million love songs could't save the world how hard they tried
Is it his brown eyes 
 j'suis la perdu dans c'putain d'merdier J'ai été condamné pour outrage, putain de procureur m'a allumé 
The road is turning for you
Don't tell me that, you're on drugs
You wanna come and rob the cradle
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
No one knows what I've been through 
You suck the light out of a room with merely a glance 
You never seemed to care the first time You never were my friend
Come on man, you wanna be an activist be a real activist
With all these feelings inside
Not enough beer
Fuck the club, instead of bitches I'd hang with a group of nuns
Tell me a story, offer me a glass of milk
That your hands were raised up to the sky
Until then old friend
It's no fair
Oh I don't think I'm better or kinder of heart, I'm as guilty as I can be
At the end of it all lies of course the final phenomenon of deterioration
I don't know what it is,
Every fucking morning is the same bullshit
Nothing left to die for
To distract you from the damage that they do
See it in your eyes niggas ready to die
Come back rewind one time
Ripping through your life like a fucking hurricane
Take a small mistake and make a small one bigger
And she says, "it's a copout and I know you know I know
What you want to be
I gotta get this shit off my chest
Heavy, you want it heavy
All of your shit when I'm sober
Gil irheun aigachi peokkingyudem
Why don't you just go if she's waiting
She bit into my neck, snapped my necklace
Never believed in luck a benefactor of the damned
"If you cannot bring good news, then don't bring any"
I would rather be miserable fo the rest of my life
Out on Bail Hey, hand me some motherfuckin' Colt 's from the fridge nigga
You'll find devices to kill your master
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
And we ain't got no love to give
I am not a whore
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
What about the times you lied to me
You can't tell me you can't, no, no, whoa
Save your soul tonight
Now I want out
A fucking hypocrite draftdodger like George Bush
"I believe in the Power of Good
You say you can't tell any difference
She's out of my life
Wracked by guilt on slick machines
 We gettin' shit done, you know what I'm sayin' Geto Boys,  The year  and forever And the shit don't stop until I say it's over with, muthafucka Know what I'm sayin' This is Geto Boys for life
I'm sure raising my hands with questions and demands
For every evil deed
A dash of truth spread thinly
How many fittings must I sit through with my big feet blistering
Thanks, thanks for nothing
You're so fuckin' special
Gonna give you the righteous answer
In the distorted German channels of my own mind
I begin to hate you for your face and not just the things you do
Through the smoke beyond my parking space
Rather then be on tape and make my own song this messed up
Like a river running wild
Ich stand nur daneben konnte nicht mehr mit dir reden
If you got a lady and you want her gone
Sell me down the river, sister
Voting doesn't work it's easy to see that
Bitch, what's your problem You expect me to be optim
Trust me, It's that real shit
Human doesn't mean just being
Once, you sang your own song, now your dancing to the same drum
Cast your eyes into the distance
Realize who they're talkin' to
I can feel her so far away
Golden earring, golden tan, blowwave in the hair
We know you've got some drugs Shut up, man 
I set shit right one whore at a time
It's runnning in the family, oh
Je n'attends que le bus qui me mène vers là où je peux espérer, babe
Face à la loi, je pars avec un handicap 
Thousands of children scarred for life
To build the piece of the puzzle called the human race
I'm asking my friend I need you again
I'm not a motherfucker ignorant
She's not you this is not the end
And all I ever needed was to fall right through
Oh no, no, no
Too bad he never knew that you were just a grimy whore
But you know, there's no turning back now
We all fall down to build up
If I could just get past my pride
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
I sold my soul to make a record
Now I know, my A, B, C's
At authority's heart beats a dollar sign
Those words weren't meant to escape, but they do anyway, I hate the others
Won't need no haircut
They'll tell you about guilt 
Come closer now
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Knew what I was doin', everyday that I've been doin' it okay
All those bad things are on your mind
Then stand up and shout impeachment
Across the bluebird sky
Because it wasn't due to you don't mean I'm paying dues, you stupid fuck
I'm talking 'bout war
And there's no hope
And everything's okay
Please turn off your cell phones
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
Come on honey
So they tied the knot, now it's too late to reverse
Too late to be tellin' him
The white man won't notice the air he breathes
I am the dirty, you're the clean 
'Cause I don't wanna be no, no, no, no
They pass the homes of greed and plunder
But now it seems that the tables have turned 
So go and tell your friends, you know, the ones you got gassed
I said, I can't say what I want to
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies
Well my inner luck knows better, it's what I wanna hear
It's just another repeat of our history
And step back, as I take up the helm
Where big shotters lick out white mountains like everest
And my heart goes out especially to my nephews
They drew a line in the sand and made their last stand
I can't imagine, I don't understand
You got to sit in back
I hope you choke on your Bacardi and Coke
If you make your perfect world you will find
And praying to a sideways cross
If I was deserving, who am I to disagree
I dunno what happened its just what the ghetto did
You open your mouth and all I hear is lies
Before it's coming to an end, yeah
So fucking triumphant
We pull up to the cabin way above this damn metropolis
We were strangers when we met
Better burn that dress, sister
Unchained tearin' your flesh we unfed
And everybody thinks he's some kind of warrior for the Lord 
You're all going to die down here
So don't sit there and play just 
Somebody else
Man makes a gun, man goes to war
The same idiots that can't get water into a major American city in less than three days are trying to
Made our Saturdays
As the doorways they were full
Oheeoh safe in bed and they're dreamin'
You better see right through that mother's eyes
I'm haunted, by regrets and mistakes
I'm lookin' for love, but it's got too many damn faces
Walking on fire, found a place away from humans
Strip her down to her bare ass
Everyone's passed out in the van
I beat that bitch with a hit
And flying is fearful of me
Because of all the things I should have said to you
Distance making the heart grow blind
I should have seen it coming, I should have fucking known
And die
Spoke on everything from war to how the ocean is vast
Or watching you fall apart
Is there a boy in this town that's not exploding with hate
What's left of me
All these scars keep ripping open
Rationalize the lies and the hurt, that it's all worth it, sure hope it is
Motherfucker
You'll bleed out of control
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Development wants this neighborhood gone
Life is too precious to be fighting wars each day
My heart was poundin'
Oh please don't beg for your life
Seems that what you want and what you need
The lawyers they conjoin stand up now stand up now
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
Every time I see your dick I see her cunt in my bed
Cause everything you say just disappears
Look at you standing all alone
I put my faith, my faith in you
Without hope in this life
In the Halls everybody gets a turn
So I don't know
Tell me how you feelin' now what I know you illin now what
Into his head
You know that justice is never sought
It's been going on for months, said she'd only done it once with friends
Tell 'em, Tone The rage of Angels
Where I am no longer your misanthropic majesty
And dismissal
Tea parties are the shit, forty mags by the scones
U ain't fuckin' wit me Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
This is not the life I wanna live
Hey it's me Versace, whoops somebody shot me
That nigga had the power to make you crawl for him
Gather your pathetic masses and bring them to me
Lab rat is crude ego food
And this is the end of this session, let's anything else you've gotta say
Shut up I'm about to tell you some secrets you'll never know
Et bénisse tout nos efforts de ses dernières années
Sometimes I don't see any point in life
I'm a fool who'll keep on trying, and like a fool, I will crawl
I'm cracking up
Sublime rockin' No Doubt stylie
How many times have you taken the beating
You can complain But they are not concerned a bit
All of my thoughts
Sitting here like a loaded gun
Buck fifty face stupid and say but run Nike swoop
Now maybe someday
Hey, want it back
Please am please
But by strong folk, not a puppets feeble imitation
I've seen more guts in elevenyearold kids
And I hope you love your life
Pay no mind to the rabble, pay no mind to the rabble
Ain't got a ride or no loot, yeah, uhhuh
And nothing looks the same
Too bad, Black ain't get the chance to extort him
And this the motherfuckin thanks I get Hello
I don't know where I went wrong
 Where you onliest way I think you can keep it is by being at peace and being honorable
People will always be tempted to wipe their feet
Hey God, I really don't know who I am
All dressed in red, always the bride
Crucifixes for ladies
Escape my justice until your dying day
Nobody cares, nobody cares
Bring our soldiers home
Nnnow that don't kill me can only make me stronger
I'm all ears, and I'm all scars 
Does Joe bring flowers to Marilyn's grave
Talk about making a sacrifice
And finally I'll sleep, I'll sleep through the night
And if not, I'll take my spoons
Wanna oh need you
How you get a county sherrif walking with a fratboy's brain
Shut up and stop your playing around
Got a fourdoor and a faithless wife
It's no fun
Stupidity's separated by a wall of glass
Hope Fox Trot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot
I'll never be the shine in your spit
You all know that I never miss
No, that's not the way to do it
And it's not something that I'll let you forget
Through a mess of sweatsoaked covers 
I'm gonna kick it in the arse
And wild because I would do anything
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
For all of you rappers that be bringing me drama, homie please be ghost
Sing me a song and I will surrender
What do you want to do
You thought that it was over
You want the answers, you got the face fleshed out
In body rocking, rapping, and macking
I'll just talk the talk, I walk it
Highways fill with refugees now
I've been dragging a bitch called hope a bitch called hope
Angels in my heart tonight 
You know death and the devil sure got it easy today
I've got my own crimes now and I won't let you in
At school the choices I made
I will run for you
It's burning down
And nobody questions
Said it was blue when the blood was red
What a pain, well, it's all a crying shame 
Across it all, it was never that bad
Taking it long enough we crush the formal journalistic
I am chest deep in her swarm
Steamed glass
A phone call I'd rather not receive
Yeah, heads I win,
But baby trust me there ain't nothing that could
They try to get you with the funny money
I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's
I'm holding on to what is gone
Oh, oh, oh then ya know, that li'l' girl would just have to go
Come if you really want some of the chingazo
It's on, and being foolish won't cover up 
You best believe I got your draft card
The world throws its light underneath your hair
Ah, shut the fuck up
A nigga'll die for a brawl
No sir, no ma'am
We going to knuckle up cause the Jakes bring war
How come I ain't got no money here
If bullets don't get good PR there's other ways to kill
I should give some money to that bitch
Turn your bleeding hearts into some bleeding hands
There's no use fakin' it
With protective shell
You'll see a hell of a body on the way to blast your eyes out
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
Kato mulla todistus on priimatavaraa
Do you know you are a filthy thing
If I couldn't feel
It was on the back seat of that Fiat Uno you stole
But I can hear it in your voice you just pity me
The whole world was made of wood and smelled like gasoline
It doesn't take much these days, my dear
Well, some passersby took me to the station
NOW I'll play God
You suck me like a whore
I beat, I beat, I beat, I beat
It's not your pretty face that matters
Like fighting, like sex
'Cause face to face you're sweet
Here is a song to sing to do the measuring
And we keep wondering when we're gonna feel something real
We're kept in the dark
On the wall so high I'll make this fair if it's what you want
Of course this mean giving up from all my sleep
Probáltam a rendõrségen megmagyarázni de nem értették meg
ThugLife will never fail I'm out on bail
'Cause I'm feeling kind of jealous
Hurt somebody, we're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself
I wanna see the ground give way
Is there a human alive that can look themselves in the face
Oh you know
'Cause I'ma nigga  life, so I'ma nigga till I dizie
Vitalize your benevolent thoughts today
But when it's time to pay they came up with all type of shit
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go
Turning shit into solid gold
ANd I just made my perfect world, now you're gone
You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye
It's worse than Monday
Though we won't ever meet I remember your name
When goldcapped irony
Break me down just to build me back again
E você passa dia e noite e sempre vê
You think I got time to give a fuck about disorder
Oh don't you understand
To even do that shit, like I'm that guy Bitch come down 'cause you're not that fly
From the cold light of day
Nur für den Kick  für den Augenblick
In studios, conference rooms think they're smooth, but no finesse
Funky, but ya don't understand
All the houses on the street would not compare
I broke down crying on your return
British hooker hired by bert's bandmates sings "Happy Birthday" and "He's a Jolly Good Fellow"
But there is no time to explain
Cause in the end, we're such close friends, sugarnspice, and since then
Don't be so damn benign
Don't stand too near
The pedestal is high enough to fall
I'm tired of falling backwards
But in a back room in Harehills,
But it doesn't matter anymore
I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna let you
My pen is prepared, and so the guns and the swords
I come across a substance yet I couldn't lacerate
Better watch your back, sister
We're only treading ground that we already know
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows
And I don't care Do you sleep do you count sheep anymore
A simple choice to fall away
Lives lost due to needless violence
I'll 've just begun
Nono the Zeplin song
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
Every day everything gets shorter
From th street
And when he beckons his finger to me,
Slipped out of every noose
I don't know where you're going
I'd really love to break your heart
Ha ha ha ha It died out long ago
Since pick up lines are tactics
When I begin to rise, you start to fall
Those kids suck, yeah they're fucking beat
Did you really need me
Feeling pretty sore
Those demigods
I remember we could talk about anything
Please don't shout
Crush it all, kill it Calling out my enemy
And it made me fight again
I'm unattainable and crippled with desire
And when I suck you off, not a drop will go to waste
For those who died that Eastertide in the
Made your body smell of mace
I don't need your ignorance get he fuk out of my face
Snap yo neck like a Bitch
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
I make them heartless,
You know, I feel it crawl across the floor 
Never would I thought you'd try to lie and deceive me
Better yet, I'll build on to the beat like tetris
On days like these starts me thinking
It's always being said but it's never been heard
Stay the course and make your mama proud
There's nothing to do on bloody Sunday
Staring at the cracks in the walls
And the movie turns into a photo
Body, I'm not an animal
Fuck pigs, fuck guards, all some fucking retards
I saw a cop beat a priest on the TV
I'm so sorry if I'm alienating some of you
Blowing through the curtains in your room
I don't need no family
I spit inside her face
Inside the future of a shattered past, yeah yeah
Mom I'm not on drugs I'm okay, I was just thinking you know, why don't 
They got it all, that's what they want you to think,
Cut my skin, it makes me human
I'm sick of the sickening fakes
The safety's off nigga, so get the fuck out my way
Start to fall but I'm still standing here behind the wall of dying faith
Time to make life shine again like glass
Another dumb bitch that you can show your friends
'Cause I need you here with me
But it�s alright, Ma, if I can�t please him
My head
List of things I'd like to change, waking up's like frightening
Over the rain and storm
In the Hotel Argentina they can hardly tell between us
What you so mad about
My other brother, I won't mention his fuckin' name
Every tree a finger of my glove
I, I, I don't need you
All ice water is tears and tears and tears and tears
That's what they made my hero say
Don't make me laugh wit'cha funny money
How many instances can you point out where I was less than kind
The peace offering another day
I was hoping you would be waiting there for me
You catch me if I'm falling
With a sunrise and a sunset, there's a change of heart or address
Your pretty little eyes
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Suffer not Your neighbor's paralysis
There's love on the telly
Clinging to your own sense of waste
She was an animal
But no less Astarte to behold
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
No I cannot be beaten
We do it Monday and on Friday
They wanna drop me like an awkward subject
Of this United goddman States of this bitch America
When I'm in paris niggaz Frenchkiss the pinky ring
Voting doesn't work, why
'Cause  shots tearing through the side of ya ride
I promise you towards the heavens
Spider bite panic attack
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today
Well, there's a lady that knows
See you in hell
The knife, the gun, broken bottle, petrol bomb
But liquor doesn't exist in my world
Devil got me a fat new bribe
Achimmada saenggakhae
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
All my problems are for me
"Oh no they're all dead, they're all dead" Sample
But I wouldn't mind if you did
You'll see ten thousand lies
For niggas that ain't right they get it upon sight
I spitup on my plate and then I turn and walk away
But fuck these rappers, they're bitches
But now you're gone, gone, gone
The love she sought through faltering thought
We are in deep shit
It makes you homeward bound
I come to purge the prince of death from off the earth
I'm not really bitter
'Cause Nietzche said "god is dead" and I believe him
To come to an end
Black man's got his problems and his way to deal with it,
Get drunk, get drunk, stinking drunk
You know I'm not surprised the Illuminati had to keep it a secret
When there's nowhere left this crutch is broken
We salute or burn, there is blood on both shores
Needs a dedication song about it doesn't it yeah, YES
Now I kiss up to God my fists
Dehumanize my heart
You're like a rare disease
Now you can see the reason why not everyone's the same
You're workin' too hard
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
Here's to bad cops turning cheeks when real cops are on the street
All of you, both of you, none of you
Damn it feels like heaven every time he comes around
'Cause you won't believe the state I'm in
Yes it's fucking political
You ain't gonna need
Let us unite because of love and not hate
We'll be who we wanna be
And the rings fall out like a silver snowfall, Into the blinding light
What people think
I got so sick of being told
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right
I'll watch you squirm
Love your masks and adore your failure
You gotta kill you gotta maim
You know what else
Cause you know when my nine goes buck
'Cause you've got a beautiful faith
Awareness of our conditioning is slowly seeping, leaking
Who spoke of many powers he had
When you sent me off to see the world
Gotta break break through somehow
And even asleep
I'd tell any lie to keep you listening
Gift of gab, this mic gets grabbed
And I will sing no more
And I'm in your mind
Ooh come here and give me a kiss
And every day is another test
Far beyond control
Selfabsorbed
All because of fear
She will never learn, ah, bye
It's hard to control
You know the thing you never see
Pacin' back and forth looking savage, stop it
We be stackin chips, packin clips, mackin chicks
È Dogo Gang e sai che mi basta un cenno
So check your attitude at the front door
Probably feel a lot better if you talk about it, so why don't you talk about it
Too fucked up to care anymore
We're only living this instant
The beat that my heart skipped
Believe
This is our battle
I'm afraid to die
That odd hates blacks shades and other players
You've made mistakes
You really fucked me Kim, you really did a number on me
Maybe now you know how much it hurts
It will shine throughout your life
Got yourself a beauty queen, yeah
In the province of gun,
Your history haunts you like a knife in the back
You want a way to be the same
I know you like me 
If they be hustlin' back, we'll fuck 'em
Tell his brandnew wife and second kid
And the sky was all violet
It's clearer now
That you know, and I know better
In her Kiki Montparnasse
Or burn it off the Internet, and bump it outside
I'm tortured, the pain's tormenting my soul
There is no progress
For those dying days
I know you cared even though you weren't here half the time
Find a spirit of resistance
You'll see my teeth in the stars above
I got all that I can do just to mind my own
I'm so damned
Does this job ever bother you, darkly creep up in your conscious too
We both know you could deflate
The label'll just throw your shit out, and got it floatin'
Peel away the shell and we're rotten on the inside
And all the water in the stream couldn't ever wash her clean, in my mind
He jumped into the void
I go wild
All pink like birthday girls and valentines
His power  his power growing every day
Now I have taken control I have control
Nunca quedas mal con nadie
I'm running out of air
I'm restless to escape
What I'm trying to tell you is, do what the fuck you want
I keep breaking all the promises
What's forgot  ain't no eazy, no scott larock
Every president we ever had lied
But it just won't run on lovely red diesel my friend
To make the life we know
She'll fuck you up and then some
From here to eternity
But my Ass it's a play on words
You can never understand
Too late to reimburse but, wait it gets worse
 minutes before the end of our lives
God in the flesh came
Hell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em
I'm slinging blood
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
Always in my way
It's okay that you haven't called me in a week or two
Ah, you're the speed I need 
Ain't got no time
While driving, niggas shot out my doors
I wasn't raised to seize the day, but to work and worship 'cause he that liveth and believeth supposedly never dies Rise up, rise up, live a full life  'cause when it's over it's done So, rise up, rise up, dance and scream and love
There's something sweet about seeing the world
Simple souls overload as I explode data banks
Flickers on me
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is
The warehouse getting smaller skitzing played yourself
Hey, four corners of the globe, all invent fire
The voice was so familiar, though
Don't be sorry just ignore me because honestly
Used to ride around here on my high, high horse
My dress caught fire
For this game we play
Or drowning at the bottom of the sea
When I come in, kickin' with a vengeance
So don't fool yourself you're helping with your white liberal shit
She said "Sweet of you to notice"
Erst wenn du woasst,
And your untouchable face
But you know what the fuck I think is just pathetic and gay
See her up in the tree, looking down at you and me
You're rising on you're rising on
perché non scappiamo insieme
It's been awhile and I just can't handle this
As everything changed on a new year's day
And that near death shite do I believe in a bright light
Ripped shirt, black eye
What's over is over and nothing between 
Take a piece of America back
You're feeling old with me you're up a creek and you don't know it
Sex, death and money, sonny
Don't wash your mind if it's dirty
You ass dicks had gastric bypass
I just can't learn to forget
They mad shawty
Yeah, I don't want to hate
So thoughtful, so gracious 
Run through Little Havana yelling "Viva Fidel"
Ow, rage in the cage
If cleanliness is next to Godliness 
The only chance you get is past your control
Waking up again
And give you that proverbial taste of your own medicine
Open, you need it but I returned the point of acceptance
There's too much shit in the air we breathe now
When your whole world comes undone, let me be the one to say
My passion's emphatic its mixed with tragic romantic instances
I'd like to know
Wake me from my sleep
And you're a fuckin' disgrace
"Oh somebody phone home
You better hope you get shows, which will not happen
Sew our angers and our strengths
The city is
I know that no one is
When I was washing the blood off my hands
There's no today and there's no tomorrow
Anklebiters
Pretty Baby, don't you start a fight
Now you are so alone losing all your style everything you adore has a perfect life inside you cry and bleed
We hold out our hands in hope for a free ride to successful endeavors
Roman Roman
o analista passeando na Europa
Before we die
I'm not the man but I'll asked who was he
Don't know where I'm from
You fuck around with me and I'm'a have to blast you
You must always remember
You keep on saying that you want to show me that you're really different
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk
You'll be nothing
, ,  days a week, shit ain't funny
His foreman would pat him on the back
Stupid shit
God damn, it's a brand new payback
There's more said within the lines of your forehead
There was a killer in the woods who would whistle
All my life frustrated, pushed, alienated
Won't need no stinkin' war
I don't know you like this
You know I gotta go out
I wanna cook,
If none of us on acres, and none of us grow wheat
Count bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums
This is where I wanna be,
Do my dirty work, do my dirty work Yeah
And lately I heard you's a broke bitch livin' in the lower class suburb
Jealous, it gets so sickenin'
I'm probably the sickest muthafucka who don't get recognized
Joint in ace bands, you move to Graceland and Satan
I've got none left of my own
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel the pain whoa oh
I love the pigment in your skin
What if no one's watching
Sex on her mind all the time
But you had to fuck up tha whole deal
I can't be stoppped
If you lie
Send it to hell
It feels like something
Why are the burners always toast
I got the hands of history's stranglers
Between the pleasure and the pain
We aim to win, made to end
I'm not one to go and start fights
I can hold out much longer than you
And no bombs went off that day
You chose your side, you'll get yours in the end
As I drive away the love songs play on my lonely radio
And now I can't tell the difference
But don't give a fuck who feeds us
Is just a lie, oh
I'll check tonight
Yeah I need a place where I don't need a smile as my disguise
You'll be cryin', slowly dyin'
Look through these blackened eyes
Humans are fucking dumb, still thinking that Pac's alive
I wanna sing along
And now I give this gift to you
Break ground
I try hard to teach myself I've got to pass the test
Well then, I got a story to tell
Someone else's fight
When inside we'll smoke the sky
It's none of my business if it makes you feel better
Where your grandma at She'll get fucked up too
Oh she�s gone yeah
The bed's thin sound
You've a body that defound with a mound of it all,
There's a tear in my heart where the blood ran out
Because of you I need to rest
Horse made out of Black Tar
For all we know and all we care they might as well be Martians
I want you to break me
Ready to make a song, she needa make a fat with it eh
How through your trickery my naked back is turned to you unarmed
La famille brille, mon business et sans merci
É independente
Every restless night
I shake, I scream, I cry
Really hand me a line 
That I can almost taste it
Death is the sickest way for attention
From her to eternity cry, cry, cry
And you will hear yourself when the rain begins to fall
Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lotta shit but I'm backing it all up
I keep clawing from the inside
For the minute a pretty face
Now bitch niggaz don't mean shit, from where I sit
Yeah right, that nigga can't even ollie
Ah, I feel better now
I been doublecrossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free
No I'm not listening
Look at you standing all alone
With this wall between us
A rising dream, or a falling star
This is how a heart breaks Ooh
We want to be loved for who we appear to be instead of who we are
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass
Fuck you, you fool
Mr McDermott, won't you help me to my feet 
You can tell it by the way I walk away,
It's hardly intimate, falling to pieces, out comes demons,
Yes I always fight for what is right and put my foot down
We gonna bang y'all, in the head one time
To the ground
Asking myself, "Bitch was this really worth it"
Standing over the sodomised body of their mother
Why don't you just go and kill yourself"
'Cause oc life is not the life for me
But man Heh Solomon
"Everybody needs a little Devastation"
And I'm feeling bored
When it's my turn again
Or get fucked up in this Bitch
We're holding back our tears
Ain't got nothing on you
Give me give me what it takes come on baby I wanna feel right
Rip and tear this unbleeding dead
I'm trembling like a man away from home
I never saw your heartless beauty
We may die with time
And it feels like the only way is the wrong way
Im Grunde ganz diaf unten
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
All my friends are dead and gone
Tonight's for fighting
It's snowing in his mind
I stand alone
Donc ma parole face à la leur n'a aucun poids 
Now won't you just curl up and die
My heart
Do it now, get the shit over with
Scrubing to get the dirt off
I was blind but now I see
I work for minimum wage
You know I wish them all 
We now embrace all the corruption
I am the worse piece of this human race
And I don't care now what you say
Don't want you to apologise 
It was your mistake but I will start again
Without worldwide belief, you step up to the mic and blow
I swore that no one
I dreamed your ego died
He screamed child why would you go and take my life
Gucci this, Fendi that
'Cause I'm tired of payin' these high ass gas prices
And now you're gone
Hell fuck yeah
I have cried so long that I can't feel
Talking everyday
On la surnomme l'anorexique 
When I'm the god of failure you'll love me later, and heaven dissolves for me
Oh backstabber, backstabber, backstabber, backstabber
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
 You had better pay with real blood
Every mile just feels like two
I never though how was I to know
If she's with the funky drummer we need an exorcist
Hell bent burnt you like acid rain
I see terror in your eyes
I am drunk, I am sober
But that kind of justice still preys on the ones with the stones hung around their necks
And learn the moral lesson and marching forward to victory
We make you wanna kill cops
At tha hands of MILENKO
A devil pretending to be a god
Your paranoia is starting to bore ya
It cuts like a knife
Fireworks for you The river's burning
Force my hand, I will sign anything
All my rides and fake tattoos
No matter how close we are, I'm far, far away
So resented, so disliked
So boredom captured another fool 
As I'm made to smile
I want to get off one time, get off one time 
Come on, man
Looking for a place
I thought you was a doctor be on call for him
The one without a room
Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology
It was a staple of brass tacks and wax backs
Then you're sitting in a spinning room
I'll bet you never thought I'd try
Well, I move in another direction,
Ist die Regierung erst in Panik,
And I hope she turns bitter, really really bitter
I cannot see through the cracks
And now Whitey's on the moon
Heaven knows what you've got to prove
A new town nothing  send for the hearse
We just don't feel like before
My nigga Frank Fuck, fuck Frank, nigga, fuck him
The party will be kickin'
Hey yeah, like a desert monkey
Politicians and gunmen
As long as I want you, baby, it's all right
And dreamed about his daddy how his daddy used to do
'Stead of lagging now
He throws his hands
The clouds carressed my sky and smoke
The restless consumer lies
Bitch, I'm a monster, no good blood sucker
Voices echoing in my head
Eazy's dead now
I'm a mess since you cut me out but Chuckie's arm keeps me company
Ignore me in the parking lot
Walking on fire, feel the way the world's inclining
I think I'm losing my mind but that's the way that it goes
Naw, they can't keep tha black man down
There's blood on the good book, love in the bad brook
Sick of bullshit preachers
I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me
I wanted so bad to be your girl, I tried
Who the fuck do you think you are to have power over me
Hand in my clutch, gun in my lap
Slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me 
Rip rappers a new asshole I never hesitate
Oh, you know how to smash a dream
But if you'll be my enemy
And after this black winter, the thaw
Is that a family manual you are reading
You know what I'm talking about, dontcha Dammit
But I'm still standing
And now I ain't buyin' that
Man's need to dominate overshadows need to breath
And better than the oxygen network
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
If looks could kill I would've never had a chance
You left your blonde wig in the car
And in my mind I make perfect sense
You made me such an asshole
I've seen it all before the way you disagree
Lot of fools, lot of fool scum bags
I don't wanna say
With closed eyes I
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
'Cause the Serengeti's bleeding
How does it feel to be down on your knees
It just sickens them what I consider fun
Y'all don't know what it's like bein' born with stress against you
The end's just begun
When truth turns
He told me that he thought we were sellin' out
Dancing while the blood runs out
Evil, evil, quit while you're even, evil, evil Evil man
I know another way
I want to know, exactly what you, exactly what you intend to do about it
Do you wanna go our way
But that's the way it is and it's the way it's always fucking been
I've been writin since P
And there's nothing left to burn except for ourselves
It's not without reason that accidents happen
Mommy was a living single queen with a lot tee
We can all kick back and we can laugh tonight
Do you remember
I let the dogs loose then I let the dogs sick 'em
That's her pussy so hey pussy play with pussy or play pussy
My heart cannot be found
And though Her eyes still held fire
Done dirt cheap, yeah
A hundred voices from a hundred lands
'Cause I don't wanna be
It's a motherfucka
And erase his name for good, don't you know that I would
I wanna live in a bubble
I've got to get the fuck out
They give you life, and in return you gave them hell
Johnny Rotten popped an Oxycontin, nevermind the bullocks, oh
Left wing violence, right wing violence, all seems much the same,
There's something disturbin'
And that seems pretty damned American to me
Got no selfdefense
Maria says she's dying, through the door I hear her crying
And everything that you touch in this life will simply crumble and dissolve
And the worst thing you feelin' the blood curses
Comprehend the ways of man and under a flag
And I'm in your life
When it comes to sex, you know my motto yes I can, can
You drive on my ass
But I'm telling you why so don't cry baby girl now it's time for you to be back on the right route
And I may not be able
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
Thinking I was sweet to it
Let's break a smart ass grin
Her chin is wet with someone's hate
Now even though things lately may have been real horrorshow
It's war 
I can see you're new to this, you don't know the rules
Rocce, vedo muovere la bocca, ma non sento niente
I stay diluted to avoid the pain
Practically singing it, the song that tears the world apart
And now I have no shoulder on which to lean
The kissing of feet
They say jump, you say "How high"
Oh shit
And I hate everyone
'Cause I am not your savior
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Now your brilliance no longer shines
Don't want to feel this pain no more,
To keep this body sober
Living on borrowed time so I'll die tomorrow die
Speak English or die
I want you to take me
Get this monster out of my head and stop wishing that I was dead
Nowadays I can't seem to tell the difference 
  Just another name in your little black book
Super double agent, shoot your mother with my brothers favorite
And what I'm goin' through, shot lipgloss through my veins
I'm standin', in a shadow, hating the world
And I know now they're our heroes too
I'll break the top off it and shove it in ya ear
While some of these folks' lost their whole life
These motherfuckers stepped on me,
Don't strain, 'cause nothing ever comes from it
No there's no such thing as an unjustified existence
Live hard, die great
Face down in a cell in a pool of piss
Blow in the face of my rivals
Gravid with madness
No escape from the mass mind rape
Is if you think I give a fuck
With what I want to do
Spreading lies spinning stories
And all of the lies, and bad things they did
Some love just fails without a reason"
I'll hold 
Kid Creole killed all of his own people
It's a rat, it's a rat, it's a rat race
When you're talking to an idiot
When we get delayed can we cast a line towards anyone dismayed
Please turn that fucking radio off
There'll be no more cigarettes
A drained white body hanging from the gallows
Either I'm crazy, or the black Slim Shady, or
They got him in chains
You know that I know that we're infected
Got my head over water, time to tum straight
Now you've grown into quite the man who beats his kids and slaps his wife
Entangled beyond all my control
A witch will burn
A rat done bit my sister Nell
If you wanna fight with us, you've got to refuse to please the game
The street lamp
I hear her crying too
Want this my love your mistake
You was brewed up, booed up, ready for a new fuck
To hell with you
My kingdom I bring
Che sia un sogno o sia un intento
And Jesus drives to Mexico
You wanna make me sick;
It's simple, soaked, and always on my mind
But the emptiness is more than I can stand
If I wash my hands in others blood, Am I sick
No noise can shake me but I feel me breaking
I had it all made
Guess I'll talk to you when I get back
Better back off if you know what's good
Fear I leave in the back of your mind,
Faces made of wax
The world I know aside
But God damn I'm the biggest fish with the biggest mouth bitch
Mä oon isin pikku tyttö, se on musta ylpee,
I'll strangle you, use my same hands to give you the Heimlich
With only one match and one chance to burn,
You black people still thinkin' about voting
Remove me
And we're treading water now
Hey daddy
You used to be such a loyal friend
You're bleeding
Single, no more, no less, stocks rang, yo
I'm gonna break his face
Consume me with your shameless want
Oh no, you got me in a headlock
It means take a fucking walk
On yo knees like a Bitch
Whatever man never, never, never, never
The coward who lovers kill off inside
Lay me down, please just do anything
I know what darkness means
Don't you ever try to bring me back
Don't know just how I got so low
And I know first hand so well all the high times you direct
When he died, looking in his eyes, glossy as he cried
In a black hoodie, nose bruised and a gold tooth
Fraudulent styles but you play em again
It's payback
I had a good home but I left, left
Despite your pseudobohemian appearance
Downed city
They'd stick it in your face 
And I also don't go for this other thing now, with MTV being so big where you get a band that gets a hit video, and all of the sudden they think that they're like icons and they can tell us how to feel about environmental issues and how to vote and stuff You know what I'm talking about Like REM "Shiny happy people" Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Pull that bus over to the side of the pretentiousness turnpike, all right I want everybody off the bus I want the shiny people over here, and the happy people over here, okay I represent angry guntoting meateating fucking people, all right Sit down and shut the fuck up, Michael Don Henley's gonna tell me how to vote I don't fucking think so, okay I got two words for Don HenleyJoe Fucking Walshokay Thanks for calling, Don How long's your pony tail now, okay
And know that I'll always love you
The scent of perfume on ya clothes In ya clothes
Holding on to let them know
Then you turn the other cheek till the bruises fade
I got no desires
I'd have given her my heart and my dreams
And Dublin in a rainstorm
Rise out of darkness
Yeah but I'll tell you
You give me stomach pain
Understand it's all about the Bengi's man
PCP  a PC police victory 
Now you roll alone wit no one to bone
A kiss in the shape of a bullet
When I write my bitter songs
Oh Look, man, we just gotta get some sleep
You said you're working for it, but are you fighting for it
Your lipstick is smudged, dear
I Am your voice what you propose
If I am just another girl
A thick lock and sheet rock is on my windows in the kitchen,
They want to take away my emotions
Gargles in the rat race choir
Everybody, everybody, everybody cries
Everyone has a different fight
I wake early in the first to help supply the second type
And the air is filled with shit to breathe
You know how Uncle Sam treat it's veterans
He's calling for backup
Someone's always someone else's one
A pussy is a piece of skin wrapped in a pocket
You talk about peace it's a very strong word
The fire
You're not mine
And I hate to say it, but you're perfect together
Silver steel towers stalk rolling land
Your tragic disco
Nnnow that don't kill me oh can only make me stronger oh
Torn reflections of burnt out trash
Makin' you a naked body, attic and it's democratic
But I wouldn't have none of it, no, no, no
We never doubted ourselves for a minute
Who always  who always wins
Who the fuck am I to say
I made the mistake of trusting you
Through the sweetnes of life
Whoa Tell me what you believe
Seems to describe every part of where we're at now
Never know, never know
Say lick my face
So sing for the moment,
That I'll never hold
But nothing will grow
Carved in hate, carved in hate
He wanders  he wanders across the promise land
The truth behind your eyes
She was good for one thing and that was taking the rock
Dancing wildly
Another , children were born into this world
Taking all you need but not this time
Your art, it brought me to my knees
On the otherside, things are simple
And wish that it was never ending
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant
You know someday I think you'll
So this is how it feels
All right now
I've got to have my voice be heard
This is what you want this is what you get
They killed the last man that had proof
Help you move furniture
Keep you against my chest
Keep your head down, go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums
Blistered and bloodshot,
I don't know what's wrong with the youth of today
That he don't give a shit about me
When you aren't here, it's got to know
I don't need this, I don't see this
A threat, a break, a mistake with the pulse
I'll never understand
The tricks, the blessings
Every time you think you're talking, you're just moving your mouth
I I we're not thinking my stromata
Saying the softest things
And lay the barrel to the ground, hold the gat steady P Dog
Some people call you father
Devour all our pride lead us to disgrace
I need more, I need more
I love my smoke when it stinks
When I watch you I'm proud
Livin' under my bed
Or the animal that died just so that your wife could wear that minks
If I'm wanted for leaving I will leave here alone
You fight from the day you're born
I hope you feel it
Military confrontation, safe sex, and masturbation
I hear it every day on the radio
Well, I drug your ghost across the country
e le coscienze si disperdono
You're not so sure but you heard it's great
He unlistens to his CD and unbops his head
When the madness stops, then you will be alone 
Wear your disguise and I see right through
It's a nonstop disco disco ddisco ddisco
So in  they already had control
No it's not all true
I roll at light speed through space and time
You're not that smart your not so strong
This is the cause, the root of my anger
With her hand on my head
When I think meditate and contemplate for my soul
George Bush doesn't care about black people
Whatever makes you happy
Not all those who have eyes
At least you could just let us die
And then shit down his neck
I'll break all my strings, stop playing shit
I ain't went no where
My old girlfriend's studying medicine
I fuck up everything but let me explain"
She said "I act tough, but we both know
Down into these desert veins
So I won't repeat it no more 
Sad little boy, I know you get confused
Called for I was tall, I was big, I could hold up
Here's a word to those that robbed me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Submerge my soul to the depths of your waves
A holy war  through your veins it courses
Law and disorder is all the media choose
You wouldn't like that Oh no, oh
But she told us where your safe be it's what I know
It always is the same
Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't apologize so much
I don't fuck with no phonies
Change is coming, yes it's on its way to make things fair,
Two grades below, she pierced her nose
I'm not afraid of being sick
She's comatose dead on 'er feet victim of sin
Shiny green, above to sky,
I know you ain't blind and I know you're aware
Started sabotaging the managers tactics
Keep your teeth
If my father was still alive, he wouldn't stand for that
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
When the smoke settle
Just thought you should know, nigga Ooohoohoo
Land sharks stole the tape, money money booze
Just get the hell away from me
I can't say, I've been drunk since noon, kaboom
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
And never get ahead of bills they gotta pay
You try to find another way in
He'd go out every night looking for himself
För att bli skjuten i bitar utan att någonting märka
But it ain't far to fall
'Cause I still want to be the mother of your child
You can't help deny forever
Checkin' out the punkass creepin'
It's moving back to the sea
Do you really want it all back
We drowned them all in their swimming pools
I'm not what you want
Just another day in the city life
That run's down the th street intersection
We don't need your fuckin' war, so get your asses out
You love this ass, want me to make it
In combat  attacking since way back
Emotions they suck,
She leads me to the edge of my own frail being
Just an employee of the country's real masters
You never liked that necklace 
The life of rhythm, get lost in the vision
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
Was I not what you thought I would be
No, no more your life
You heard about the judgement day
I'm the land you kill for in the name of your kind
I stay untold by the truth
Already made the news
Nobody lives forever
Enough is enough
You put your life in this
You build up walls around you
A failed attempt to capsulize a feeling
She said, "You've been pushing me like I was a sore tooth
Instigate the beat genuflecting in the steeple
Soon the drinks have kicked in
The truth buried within
Disciples of the watch
Let her sink
How this broken down machine pretends to try
Antagonism rising
Throw me in  headfirst, submerged in this great depression
From the th police office in Sao Paulo is investigating it
Your fingers string me like a pearl
It isn't in your fucking Paradise
When I come back like Jordan, wearin' the 
Où je reste ici, ou je meurs
Like a motherfucker from hell
You always had a lot of style
Bridges to bridges, you're nothing to me
My leader told me to jump in the river
I mean shit he bought you things and gave you diamond rings
Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow
A disease of the mind it can control you
Nuuh not stopping now
I wanna see it when it's comin', so I can open faces
I got no life, I stay in the attic
Take you away from your lies
Et c'est par combien de fois on m'la demandé
A police pig in every head
Where did my money go
Time will not erase
A chainsaw
You leavin', wasn't part of this plan
For the creation and cultivation of the plant marijuana on the planet earth
Please me, tease me, go ahead and leave me
So sorry
I see you crying in the sunshine
Wait, what are you talking about, WE decided MY best 
He said, "Son, remember where you came from"
Ich reiß' dir die Gedärme raus
Ultimate, desolate condition of man
Do you know how they play, how they play inside you
Suck, suck, suck, suck
You make me hate
Strike with a serious vengeance and before you die
You can try to fight it
He was taking one last long breathe; when he heard his cell phone ring
Is the sound of your voice
You take back what you said now
We've all been fucking each other in bathrooms at parties
I want them to do this to you
From fake motherfuckers to my future I'm trying to get in line
Instead you made it with him
Kill the need in me
Somebody just tell me that much
It's not so bad and anyway
To be the man who walked a thousand miles
And when you break our hearts you toss it out and never miss a beat
So many times I'm, covering my eyes
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
No voice, No choice, No true realality
Yeah, the war is the enemy of all mankind
When another girl violates that What, what
I want my money back
Life burns
Not endearing to any one
Sector, rectified and fly sound selector
That "INFECTED" my head,
We need to let it breathe
And she's shakin', breathless, holds her tongue
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me
To feel you squirm
You're much too good for this life
The world won't detest you
No it's okay, you know I'll figure it out, just leave me alone I'll figure it out 
Whoopee, two holes in my neck cause you like me Bite me
All I want is to see you in terrible pain
Spare your life and leave me to my misery
You're a sad little cliche, you say sorry
He stayed behind the assembly hall,
It's the breaking of the circle right at the start
Your man power, I sabotage the fire flys
I own a mansion and a yacht, haha
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'll fuck you in the hole
So don't try to be nice and don't you try to pretend
'Cause I'm the gunshot
Empower me forever
And I don't really care 'cause this is my life not a game of poker
Then you walk on, I'm running after you
All I can say is "I know I'll find a way"
Enough blood in these eyes
Pain and misery my only friend 
Oh fuck
Right now whoa
I I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
I'm no musician, but the pain has been instrumental
I only wanted to be somebody
I decide whether you live or you die
So assinate me bitch
And you know it
The dull, the dumb, the dirty and the dumber
No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
They're not home to find us out
Back down, tell it to someone else
Shock Shock  Is all in your head
Nevermind him, he's not here now
I'm in bed
And want to fix you a dream
Just like they want you to
Sure enough they'd both go out 
Saw you fake it
You step in my way, well now I have a little more to say
Grabbing your leg, so you live to the heavenless
Afin de replacer nos amours
But don't inspect it after dark
Well, everything you look at dies
You want me to bow down, lie down, accept it and die
That new style, break ya off like a chicken wing
Who needs a rhyme
Somebody said each day's God's masterpiece 
 I became what I hate
And I can't help myself, should let it go, wanna believe
As hot as the block as cold contradictions
Its time to reform and leave this lifeless body next to You
And I'm like no other guy
And I got a habit of gettin' away
And I should have known
God bless no one
She cried on my shoulder begging please
Soldiers are gunning us down
Lot of knots, lot of snags
Everyday I'm in a daze
And somebody says
Hey, do you feel our pain
I pined as days went by, but now it's fine
Do you know when
Maybe somewhere along the road I accidentally sold my soul for what
And I want to see you when you're on the deck of that ship
There must be a heaven
She's shooting up the junk again
Telling lies, alibis  Selling all the hate that we breed
If you wanna sit with me and talk about existence
I want to get off
I think I should tell
Feed you lies
 You know she liked it
You're only making this harder on yourself
That get stuck inside of your head
Like a flag on a pop star
Down Now we agree and understand
You might as well be talking backwards
Still, I lie beside you
'Cause I'm a prank call, CopShot, just for kicks
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Do you want me
Money and the record deal
Stab me in the back, preney
How can I be in such a mesh of unlikeliness
I've come to bring you to hell
See the world inside out and scream it out loud
For the glory boys at your bedside will love you
More peace for the people
I got no love in my heart 'cause I'm heartless
Sometimes I just, I just can't tell
Don't mean nothin' anymore
Well, I don't care now what you say
When it's all burning will we see clearly
Pretentious fucking assholes everywhere
I'm bein' attacked
Meet the lies and see what you are
It's another tidal wave
I don't need your shit
Don't give me your secondhand sympathy
What you got yourself into Great Milenko, wave your wand
From the boys in uniform  now you know whose side their on 
Well I'm not afraid
Just let me die here
Breathin' for me now
How you really feel
I'm sick and tired
And there is a hell
You turn on Winston in the den
Oooh, yeah
Like a lieutenant, and the coupe tinted got pulled over
Stop coming around, 'cause you bother me
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut
A trip or two to the blue room
No one will accept all of me, and the fire will stop
There were demons with guns
It's just a pity about all the redneck fucks
Courtroom pulls an about face
And if anybody identifies the guy in it, I'll hide for five minutes
I'm not a virgin but I'm not the whore you think
Face to face with hopes of longer days to build on something we should save
Then I can tell em, because my vibes go through denim
We'll do more than talking someday
But the boys run away leaving blood on the pavement
Until I fall into a dream instead
The rotted love manipulates me
Get me out of here right now
Don't you know I gotta get away from you
To get our fam in other lands to understand your pain,
I'm waiting on an asteroid
Straight to the needles
I gotta get this shit off my back
May increase if you're caught up in the world
When wicked thoughts come inter alia
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes
I'm burning
Pretend it works a while don't try
Go on get back to where you belong
While my medication's kicking in
Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces,
And then you watched me fall
I never thought that it could be painless
No angel of love takes another man's gain
The blurry eyes make me appealing
I don't give damn, I don't give damn
So are voices will be heard
Or could chose to be moved
For those we've known
And I trust my guitar
To runaround kids in getgo cars
With soul and my goal is to bring a little passion
And if the blood on your hands turns to water
It leaves me bored and black inside
Slowly moving from bending to breaking
If you're too deaf to listen to the people's choice
You were left behind you weren't watching' you were sleeping
And you were never a good friend
This is only temporary, no
Can we run away
And your Valium counterpoint bullshit excuse
We didn't have much of a chance to think about how we felt about a lot of things
Just when I may have needed you most
I can't tell you how
Too tired to fall for that
Ich pflück' dir Gänseblümchen, weil ich dich liebe
Jesus saves Domi shoots and scores
You can do anything you want
Who looks vaguely familiar
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
You never went through what I'm living
It's so hard to find out who you wanna be
Willemite turns green with cobalt nitrate
Fake a face to make the kingdom clean
Don't you know
I'll do it all day long
Silence is golden
I can smell the hunger, taste the angry air who resurrects this
Fight or flight, who gives a damn anyways
Under my skin For your own selfish wants and needs
They know all the names of your relatives 
Watched it flare up inside his heart
What a life, I watch it like a scary movie
My heart is filled with disgust I'll tell you what you should see
Driven by hate, consumed by fear
Fuck the glass we pump the keg
To suckup and give out
Where kisses go to die
And I fired two warning shots
'Cause life long cracks
And I spark a fire for the cold in the dark
I'm on fire I'm comin' around I'm on fire
On our fellow man we prey
I'm getting sick of it
The West scratches onto my skin
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you
We're passing slow, we're passing slow Slow, Slow
Done dirt cheap
Taco, oh, young bitch ass, I should, I, fuck, I hate all these niggas
Bad blood crushing your dreams
But I've never seen a time when they've done shit for it
Would I keep on hiking up my skirt
I cried and now I'm over you
Whitey's waiting night and day, night and day, night and day, night and day
Can't turn my eyes from the past
I'd remind you of your promises now
Why don't you lie down
Dass du ned nur so duast
I want to cry inside
I'm gonna be the man whos lonely without you
And when the smoke clears away
Out on Bail These motherfuckers are harassing me and that ain't cool
A middle class and an open sky
Don't want to know how many people are like me
It's the nature of business
Listening to Common's last album to get pumped up
So is my head
Death is abroad this day
Everyday is all the same
What a habit
It is not romantic
And just for the record
Into a shadow world of painted girls and marionettes
I've tried to wrestle some unbalanced nightmare
It's Long and Slick and Olive Green
It was a scream last night
But my soul, I pissed it all away
And I've got all the time in the world
Love me, love me, hate you
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"
I'm drifting off into nothingness
Remember the whip, remember the chant, remember about rope and
I'm proud of my life and the things that I have done
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away
Your race, your faith
As we grind ourselves into early graves 
You don't want to sound dumb, don't want to offend
Tired of wasting all my time to take back what is mine
In nowhere In nowhere
Cover up your face
I'd never tell you, it's something you should know
If I thought you were clever, I'd be even more upset
You die alone, the victory's none
That's what you ought to know
 an x an o and I can't think of a better way to end the day
And the ring on this finger
While you maintain control
In front of the classroom
As they lick their cracking lips
You lied
I wasn't made to suffer, huh
'Cause you like to think the world spins around you
With her lips parted
I can't sleep
Obedience achieved through fear
Well the only person talking about love
When was the last time you talked to me
Just leave me one to play with
I feel I'm
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
I need someone, a person to talk to
We thought for one instant we forgot our gun now
Silly shit
And all these songs about cash are what we just don't need
When were both headed off to school
No you must, no you must not go away
The world sees no difference
Give me a couple of bars and let the man prove it 'cause they ever dance to it
Their tears they form a trail
Get out of my life
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your needle inside
And give it to a police man
Ooh okay okay, okay
A meeting point off underground
You don't know where you're supposed to go
You know the feeling and it's stronger each day 
It's all about the sin that you're compiling
There'll be no lullabyes
They askin' me what happened
We sat on my back porch and watched it
I hate you
Oh, nothing is ever enough
Now I've done things I regret
The truth hurts, no wonder people rather pretend
I'm not running down
With every bit of my heart I have tried to believe in it
I've taken all you got and started walking I'm walking
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it, did it
And candy sweet faces
Why, oh, why does she treat me like a snowman
All you fools out there wanna get him on your track
Licking your own skin, so trippy
Like in desperation, murmur of a heartbeat
Wild boys will be wild, still acting like a child
So many dirty little places
Did I fool you too
As we go up, we go down And see the truth, yeah
Look like death
Before you point the finger
So why should I try, act like I'm a little pissed off
Sensitive, a painter
It's the emptiness it poisons it lies
He runs the gang on Pastrami Row
In your face, ready to ruin
Every day it goes to try and get votes but don't know the correct tactics
These fools are my fuel
Girl you're out of your mind
Ninini "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
I don't even know you and I'd kill you myself
Who can make me feel like
Stop caution hard hat yellow insect machines
Why I don't know
My heart can't take this anymore
Doubling back at me
Another rider, he was a talker
You can never fuck with the Esopterodactyl
I've seen a lot of shit
Now watch me kick in the teeth of the track like my mind was a steel toe boot
Live here my whole life
Then your religion is losing face
When you've left it all behind
Tootsie Hey Chi man
With fake tits and a bad dye job
We need smoething to break, I want something to break
Before she jumped in a cab she said, "Get home before sunlight"
This animal will jump up and eat you
I woke up dead today
I think I'm losing my grip
You could lie again
You won't catch me crying, 'cause I just can't win
Yeah you are the good little holier 
We're runnin' in a circle
Is mess you up and lie to you
Whoa, oh, oh Johnny get your gun
I can't fight it I can't hide
Are the uranium deposits and the genocides you closet
You fucked up  you fuckin' nazi whore
I wanna rip you open while you're laughing at me
Everybody's still slipping away
Out of my mind, there's no love in fear
Now it wasn't on the nightly news no more
She didn't wanna be, she didn't wanna know
She's the one that's full of shit
I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm so happy now we're through
Especially in my Pastelle, or my Bape shit
And everyone that I ran into would know what I came to do
I know you're always telling me
Well, I really need you
All you want
And the road is coming to its end
Snoop Dogg
My face
Class rebellion
The bayonets clamor on all night, hemming scars into the hillside
Like you wanted
Goosestep bravely on every face
Then who will feed our people when our people need to eat
Blurred your sense of guilt
The world
My fist is for your face to cock the jaw
I'm not listening
I just want to dance in your tangles
So you resigned yourself to failure, my friend
And you hate me now
So you should pump this shit like they do in the future
You tell him I'm driving X
"I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left"
My dance has passed
Now I don't live with a prince no tea with the queen
You're the respectable members of society
Androgynous
Welcome world, Miss Ann Thrope
I'm not always like this
Where were you when I needed you most
And they invented And they mean nothing to you
It's A safe haven of sleepless Where the deep fryer's always on
Come on, now
And I'm the world's forgotten boy
She's gonna be your wife
And I remember, when I tried to find a voice
I can call you when I get back
And I tell you, like before
Of what they thought you and I were allowed to know
Hey, Pretty Baby, are you ready for bed
Where the rain finds my head
The labels are slave masters Artists are slaves
I'm killed by the question
Hooray We're gonna die
They�say�this�anger,�this�emotion�and�this�passion�is�all�a�lie
You come across impure
Who don't know his own name
I want to know what you do with my grinder
And I know what it's like, yeah,
With lips like sugar, eyes like mead
I have grown the soul of an enemy
Huomaa vaan kun joku sanoo jotain sellaista
I wanna spend my life with you
It will break you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
With Ajani hold your head up if they ever take me from you
Fear is your, fear is your, fear is your only god
Dcups with extra filling, take it out, let me lick it quickly
No one knows your name
You can't quit, you're fired
Hmm you're not rid of me
There's no return to sender
Are you anybody
I know it's crazy but I know
This will go no further I swear it dies today
I took my spot nobody gave me mine
Too many times you trade the bottle for the body
A silver cross
Just living on the streets
Spend my days with chauvinists
Step back punk 'cause I'm a Latino
"Murder, you want some" Sample
That we have made
Little bitch got a lesson to learn
Fast forward There's been a murder and the police know who done it
Others thought I fell off but now I'm numero uno
Looked her mother straight in the eyes
They said "God made us in his image
Feel the fire
But now and then
Woman like a man, like a man, like a man, like a man
The circus has begun, now take your cut
I wanna put you on someone else
Face and embrace
A nice shot, man
You say nobody knows the truth about your body
And make me a fool
The bullet or the chapstick
All I do is pretend to be ok so my friends
I like to fly in the sky real high
I remember I kept thinking that I know you never would
And if they don't taste right then don't blame D D
Oh man Oh right , , 
Blow out all of the lights tonight
And when you die it's a shame
I know you've been lying boy
All the things you thought you had
And I'm feeling so sick your life
She said, she likes it better when were angry,
Take control of your soul
Mina läppar de avger ett leende då jag ser hur du faller isär
Instead of a cold goodbye
Left Brain, that nigga ugly as fuck, big ass nose
When they were kids you'd beat 'em and leave 'em home
Ni moseubi kkamadeukhaeseo
When I wake up and put this suit on, I feel escape begin
Son Wu for life
You got me on your hooks oh no
Just another day where we live or die
It's all a fucking waste of time it's getting nothing done
I mean cool, run and bungie jump off the fuckin' roof
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Stop your shouting
Io che non sono neanche carne da cannone a Dio
To bed
Burning candle, blackened malice
Everybody knows what's goin' on
I'd be a miner
I feel it slipping
Go getcha gun go getcha click
Do you remember me
Bearing gifts and trust
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
Forever I've searched and now I'm found
Whatever you do I'll agree
I see you standing all by yourself
Twixt Her cold, silent hips I kissed
I feel like shit
But  if you know a bitch, you don't listen to that bitch
Theyre asking me to export all of your insecurities
Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Time's up how long you gonna wait
I hated everyone just like you
Why didn't anybody ask him first
Their attacks inserted doubt, now you're stranded in the cold with a knife in your back
What did you stand for
Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
After me, there shall be no more
Please use my body while I sleep
My face has shamed, but you know it's me,
Some people just don't understand it
And ready ass, splash in the Jacuzzi
Don't you give me give me give me you're here to help me
Laid my clean face on the pillow
Tell me the truth, tell me the truth, tell me the truth
Listenin' with your arms crossed
This bitter sadness overwhelms me
But you will always be a tourist, little buddy
An image that you hold in your mind
Sleep and not to wake again
Something happened I don't know why,
Picked up, chewed on and then spit out"
Rasta man speaking in the island patios
Holding it together, making songs for me
A breathing piece of shit
Midnight, I'm drunk, I don't give a fuck
You're the one who's crazy being institutionalized
No sleep, no tears
How many minutes until midnight and you get your eyesight back
I haven't heard a beat like this in ages
And please tell 'em that I tried,
Some say the end is near
I got some deep dark issues within
Working through the heat out in the yard
Ah, how do you sleep, brother
This bitch thinks she's in Hollywood
Get out of that bed right now
And I cannot give up
rivorresti
And from a throne of their bones I rule,
For every fucking second the pathetic media pisses on me and
'Cause I'm in no mood to hold back
Look, I mature day after day nigga
Little bitch is the queen of the virtuous mask
Rappers nowadays are all phased when it comes to soft shove
Où on exile ceux qu'en savent trop et assassine les marginaux 
Some things that should have not been forgotten
One cannot stop the wind from blowing
Well it ain't easy to be bold in an unknown city
I hope she know
Resting your head on your best friend's sister's shoulder
These words do talk
No more drinking until you fall on the floor
My deepest scars
Off of his own employee, now don't ignore me you won't avoid me
They surface up through the cash crops with clippers for your bellyup mascots,
Held in awe while growing fat in the head
So I'm not waiting anymore
To a world devoid of sanity
Don't need to bring no kids into this mess
Check before rinsing
Running here, running there
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command
For these four walls I love
Me, I'm unworthy, callous and cold
So if you know another way
Don't think you'll upend me
Descending down
She's yelling on the phone, she's yelling on the phone again
I've been itching to get it, I've been given assistance
We got better things to do with our time
All this makes me wanna shout
But a faggot nigga nut huggas and big hoops
The ground, what a dead head
More clothes for the people
Rise up against your fate
Can't you see my walls are crumbling
And every time I try to see the bright side, shit gets dark
Laid bare at the end of my rope
The heart rate crashes and the rings fall out
Now my ways will be dissolved 
And let the broken ones taste my misery
Boy I gives a fuck, me and the homie Al Swearengen chill, brandy I'll swill, taking synthetic heroin pills
For you it's a different notion of music and motion
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
If the answer is so clear then why are we so blind
Sweeten the taste of pollution
Scratch my face with anvil hands
You're no friend of mine
There would be no hell
My whole life could flash before your eyes
There is a feeling I can't hide
With no sorrow, with no remorse
I'll be sure to leave the scene and start stacking it
I am not your savior
The ones about serial killers Let dreams flow into savage times
I want more out of life
Don't stop thinking
Believe me Pretty Baby, I don't lie
And scrape the paint that hides the crimes
With these milky lips
Now dead Italian tourists bodies litter up the Broadway
Jesus filling out paperwork now
We came to defy  living life as a lie
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Fear has its place in the scars that I bear
Give us water, give us back our lives
The king is dead
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning"
We're not here 'cause we want to entertain
Where I don't wanna find him
For our true nature is sin
Herr, lass mich auch mit denen streiten
They killed him then he came back and made a platinum album
Old money and crack fiends was a fetish
I'm sorry
If you're like me you'd like to think we've learned from our mistakes
Someone's got his finger on the button in some room
Little devil run around inside
Thoughts of turning pro have crossed my mind
Sealed with a kiss, slathered in the sauce sarcastic 
The mind rapers
Is because nobody else does
In the love of baby whores
Tribal chants, tribal war
You only want me when I'm
And under black skirts
But I'm not stopping till I'm the fcking king in every state
No hell
In a dozen bags a life was placed
Hey yeah we had everything
Pretty little eyes
Tell me what you want to love, in me
Faded pictures on the wall, it's like they talking to me
I'll turn up the volume
That I put my trust in you
I sense the end is near
Oh, the parents are the problem
Can't trust a word that she says any more
Be careful, we're watching and you can feel us stalking 
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Gocarts and guns are treasures they will bear
Fuck around with NonPhixion that's a bad move
zurückhaltend und nüchtern,
The slave master watching over you,
Hot tires sing like a string being bowed
I don't even want to try
You're under my fucking skin
See it raise its hands
Release this hate from inside
Keep tall body guys just to sit underneath
mut vielä mä nousen ja maailmalle nauran
Dealt a dirty deed and
All along it was the Geto, nothing but the Geto
With that there's nothing I fear,
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
Too many times you come in late
Dass du mir weh do host
Real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
There's a shadow on the door
I'll be waiting
Enough blood in my eyes
From fucking destruction, fucking destruction
The loneliest place to hide
Personal ambition usurps justice
And a cab driver's in a hurry that matters more than 
Was the fin on your back part of the deal
Through the streets of Rome today
Falling together, going for forever and never ending
Anata sono made hashitai no
Stop givin' juice to the Raiders
I'm sick with this
Yeah, I'm only people's sole assassin
You can't escape my justice till my dying day
I'm not some kinda superman
Just 'cause I'm screaming
She had eyes bright enough to burn me;
My blow goes like a quickie in the snow
I'll break your legs before
Waking in a sweat from a burning dream, yeah
Dass wir nicht mehr befreundet sind, da ließ ich es lieber sein
Du FN, des flics et des skins armés 
Your stupid life apart
Staring back in front of me
One of these girlies made my day for real
The many images of your pleasures
Being half dead wasn't what I planned to be
That said, We've had enough
And cut off that head
Put "Walk Among Us" on and turn it up
Sweep the black super market Sweep it up with your teeth
There's a sick mother
If I bathe myself in others blood, Am I sick
It's just that you are always wrong
Oops I meant bastard, a skinny ass disaster
There's nothing left but change
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Can't help feelin' somethin's wrong with everyone of you
But it's not my scene
Do you want a ride on my death machine
There are holes in the walls
And fuck the world 'cause I ain't hear to stay, Beyotch
Here I turn my back here's the knife, for you to stick in me
One more day of eating and sleeping
I don't know
I ain't bendin' for the soap
A hooker's scream heard around the world
Leaving me broken another time
Keep calm for a moment, look in my eyes,
Some girls will tell their secrets to anyone
It was my father's once, I still see his face
A pretty face may last a year or two
Down to this the good ones always
E il mio rispetto non ha prezzo, non puoi prenderlo
Well I've been climbin' and fightin' to heighten
I seen this muthafucka's  smokin'
Don't hold this over my head
The city was evil, some country was evil, the hippies were evil, the writers were evil, the homeless were evil, the workers were evil, the summer was evil, independence was evil
Please believe this
Don't stop
Why does it kill you
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years yea, yea
Let me through that door, baby
It's time to fear what we should respect
So sit back and have a cup o' joe
What step are you gonna take to try and set things right
I guess I failed my test
On the warpath once again
Run away, runaway girl
And in the back of your mind
For the sake of our own skin
Inside of me I'm crazy I'm just crazy
But I know that it won't be this way
No fiction, no fact
Your bed's been made, now go die in it
Let's burn him instead"
Take my life
Go home you fuckin' slobs
And God knows they're breaking in me now
There are things I got, there are things you're not repeat
And I've just worked out that I'm falling apart
It's a rat race
Swing back at you and hit you up black and blue
I see you and I'm so perplexed What was I thinking
Is keeping me from bed
I want to cling to something soft
Be offended by every sentence I jot
I still don't blame you for leaving, baby, it's cold living with ghosts
e violinos em canções de amor
Amongst friends
Dass I jede Nacht schwach gwen bin
But I'm the song, the song she doesn't want to sing
Fucking fuck it
Never figured out eating  meals a day
She say I got nothing to fear
I feel like I could go insane
In my arms and I will never set you free, set your free
The  winds blow 'cause the  winds know
When all I know is what you tell me to
It's the beginning of the end
Demon with the needles leaning over your shoulder
Let it go fall away back 
I'm a God with spoon and syringe Oh' sweet Jesus be my friend
With a fake ass badge and a gun in your hand
Made the fear seem almost right 
When I lay myself to sleep
In my face
I look like a devil's child
Hang my heavy head in sorrow
I'm disappointed
Und viele Tränen dick und naß 
She said, "Don't play that awful song
My brain  melted  down
The sanctity pushed me on and off to the depths of my own cowardly demise
I wanna ride in the bat mobile,
Like a man dying for many days
I'll never, ever return 
Since you've been gone I feel so much better
And someday every man's best laid plans
Mine is paradise
But this guy, he said that I was on drugs,
Where's the father you should have been to your daughter
Hey yeah, and I think of the past
The thoughts you think
Back stabbing hypocrite
I'm the selfappointed queen of shit
Seven deadly sins are my commandments
Of my life that I gave to you 
All I feel 
War within a breath, it's land or death
I don't need nobody, better off alone
I'm going to Hell for that bit And you're all coming with me And don't try to get out of it "We didn't laugh at that bit, Jesus, please" "Shut up Get on the bus with Leary and Scorsese You're going right to fucking Hell" And you know what Hell is, folks It's Andy Gibb, singing "Shadow Dancing," for eons and eons And you have to wear orange plaid bell bottoms and sit next to the Bay City Rollers "How you guys doing This is gonna suck"
Well I'm a truth addict, aww shit I gotta head rush
Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sellout
Believe me now  We have no choice left with our backs against the wall
It kept me looking for communion
You don't know what
I'm number six on they list next to kiss and all these kids
I rock a BBoy stance 'cause it's time to explode
You break my heart
You always struck me as the type to take it lightly
There's blood on your hands
And let you know tonight
It feels like everyone's asleep
Brother, get a fuckin' load of this
It's all according to plan
Beg a hoe, let it go, dick ain't edible
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
I'll lie again and again and I'll keep lying
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind hey, hey, hey
Millions of men with blank faces, 
I'm a rose petal fallen from a mainline train
Despite your reaction
The deepest black
We get they ass up off the corner 'cause they dyin' tonight
Now all my niggas gettin' bucked, overbite
They spilled his brain like homey the fuckin' clown
há vida na terra, há rumores no ar
Look motherfucker, my words damage and slaughter
And they built a city A perfect city of Baghdad
I need a new feel dirty
Alone, you support, and embrace
When I wake up, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
You say it offends you, all the talking it never ends
With the sound of a shotgun cocked and realized you're fucked
I'm gonna run away and join the circus, oh yeah
To bow out at the end
Huh  well that's not my bag
So you can suck my fuckin' dick through a glory hole
When you come crashing down and there's no help around
Fuck his ass up
Well things ain't always what they seem
I'm not a slave
Solarising future pictures
You're in over your head
I'm not your family
I'm gonna be the man that gets drunk next to you
I don't care for the weatherman, the promised land or shaking hands
Thinking of
I learned just how to beat you
Pass the buck or pass the baton
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
I guess you're happy somehow 'cause you made me stop believing
Yeah, I've been through some battles before
Do I, cut the ties or do I, hold on tight
Was it good or maybe you won't tell
I am the one who lives under your bed
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man,
Though I know that I can't help you anyhow
I'm runnin' from friend to friend
Whatever
And you're gonna need a lot of information to know what you're gonna wanna do
But extend your hand Extend your hand
I'll die
I'm through cryin' for you, no more lyin' for you
Stupid motherfucker, pull your head out your ass and see
The rain burns in my eyes 
That Paincave Kid talk, at the end of the painbow, the permanent stain bop
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
I've got to find something new that I can be now
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
It creeps up on you without a warning
God's truth, I'm not lying
Just to try to get people to buy
On these loving tongues
I'm not crazy, I'm a fucking table, I'm a fucking table
And I don't wish to taste of your insides
Clear your thoughts with Speyside
I know it's sad life's just a piece of fruit
The motherfucker's on selfdestruct, nobody guarding your back, it's all a front
Where are my bones
If we make it to the final scene fake flowers
It's lit it's lit tonight
We americans is positive
Don't want anything I want nothing from you
The weight of the world is on the shoulders of the man who can
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
You all are the people, they're runnin' around
With scars from shaping
Power to the people is just a fantasy
Where many cars get broken down
Oh, and this gift you left for me
I kiss the world and it all tastes true
Little punk needs to be inside the public eye
Keep your head up you gotta think possitive
They ain't shit they ain't sayin' shit spray 'em 
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get Hello
Start a riot in this Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch x
But I hate to leave my children crying
And head trip news turn a trick to the flow
Could have been , could have been , could have been a million nigga's that hopped on you huh
I got a rock and roll car
I got friends but they don't know me, but I'd tell the world to blow me
Every morning I see your picture from the train
You gotta scrape the concrete off your dick
About you standing in the doorway
In HellLA the sun is always there It's always there
Afflicted by their dispossession
 I did what you want
Kasamas hold me down and remember that I love you
I wanna party all night 'til they call the cops
'Cause if you're not trying to make something better
That's a great message but I smell your lies under it
Asks that you not smoke
Of the psycobeta beatdown, boy you get done
And I give it all back to you
And I've got to tell you a little sum about the way that I feel
Freedom holds a doubleedge for me
I was a man
All these little dreams you got, they're not shit
Shady records was  seconds away from the towers
Your thought of revenge makes you blind
All I need is me
You pretend
'Cause I make you feel so strong and so powerful inside
Long as we're safe, just hit your marks and say your lines
I had my speech prepared, my kissoff lines rehearsed
Offering forgiveness, then they talk of eyes for eyes
Swallow all your bitter pills
In the realm of peace And all the world revolved
We animals out the zoos, with a fuse abused
Fighting to stay ahead a part of the game
For you and for me the people over there and the ones in between
And you have no idea
Did you want something
Burned all of my porno, you say it offends you
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
Oh that drink went down smoothly, just like the one before the last you had
I may not mystify you
I feel good
And I lie awake with an achin'
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough
He said where's your donation man,
Nobody knows anything at 
Seven hundred plus see the killed and held prisoners
When you live in your mind
And I won't talk, I won't get stuck with you
That her father gave to her
You should've left the light on
Were ya waiting at the bus stop all your life
"It's a lie, it's a copout and I know you know I know why
Way before Christopher Columbus set sail
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
Me you're sorry with a straight face 
I'm the Everlastin' freestyle assassin
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
Spray paint the walls
Got friends to see,
Hmm, life,
Even I'll let fate decide
As I move upon the slate
Somebody lying under every stone
My mind's a nonstop tape playing and I can't rewind it
And then the stillness of the night reminds
It's the heaven that everyone seems to need 
You know that I fucked all my homies' ho's
How could you leave me when I had need of your love 
Count your sanity away, Put your faith in misery
I'm just freeing my mind
Making fun of me
But is it the truth I don't care if it is
I even signed it at the bottom so you'd remember my name
A lot of people ask me, stupid fuckin' questions
And don't remember
I don't wanna
I know what's in the air
Is our relationship and breakup is not a competition
Please someone kill me, tear me up and throw me away
The girlscout fell from grace
Here we are now, entertain us
There's nothing no trace
Now burning black inside of me, inside me
I know your name
 miles from Atlanta, this is nowhere,
Blessed be my fate and my tools of expedience
Here they come marching down the street
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
You wanna get burned
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if
These are the vices of the pnoid bastards who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest,
I like doing it with you because you love this ass
Need some more dope man
My sister too
We always seem to fall without family to hold
With your narrowminded cronies who are fools of the first division
With a boom box of beats and a book of rhymes
You only want me when I'm gone
Seeing you is like pulling teeth
The fire burns inside
Fullblown soul decay
The disenchanted, the romantics
And I every time I tell that lie, I live without guilt
My body's twitching with a ready expectation
Zawsze tak pełno krzyku
'Cause now I'm stronger than yesterday
My gut feeling says it's all fake
Waiting innocently as time went on life's gotten worse my resentment's strong
And said, "God, if I have to die, you will have to die"
These niggaz wearin' skirts like the pope
Or at least I can feel 
Dus stop met al die verhalen
Your paranoia is starting to boil
Your absence beating inside my chest
So go and speak your mind
Bitches brewing in our stews, on they knees like the pews
And angry men to terrorists
So I, I am headed home
And the cannons will roar as we march to the capitol, dragging your hide
So you wanted to take a break
With no last words I tried to keep you near
It's too quiet in this room
She paid for the blackout
Terminal, criminal sedition of man
You know that I'm not ruled by laws
What do you want from me
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
Dulman itgo sipeoseo geurae
The world we know
So turn on turn on, turn on turn on
My senses dulled
Seems I gots to lay the law down
Well I sound like a philosopher
The bastards gettin' under like crowded parties wit no laminents
That's why you're all singing along
Sex, death, sex, death, sex, death, sex
Sometimes you're nothing but meat
Everyday is Halloween
You're sour, so sour, all is hope and trust is misplaced
Rub it better till it bleeds
Revolution's our solution to the life we're given
When you go in for the kill
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Just remember this fuck, I'm the dead guy
I don't need you telling me I've got my back against the wall
Album version
My tongue gets twisted in your twirl
'Cause I ain't ever had no beef, but now I need some fuckin' heat
Wake up every morning
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
We were always inside, we were somewhere inside
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
And I learn every room long enough
More than anything we can hope for from the world 
Scarin' motherfuckers like Steven King flicks
Use a whip on your ass so you behave faster
I wanna try and die
If I gave you all my heart you'd send it back in pieces
What color are they now
Kiss more ass like you do
Or keep you from the cold
But you're not benefiting
Now that you're aware we're gonna give you the message
That she hadn't any money
In my eyes it's all gone wrong
Is like an evil sin
With no expression at all
While the world did gaze with deep amaze
'Cause *trying to sing like Aretha Franklin*
dass alle über mich lachen
That I know, into the decay, another day
That stole your soul
Know I don't hate you
Maybe I was just asking too much
Laugh like a motherfucker
He says, "Give it up boy, give it up or you're gonna die, Women and kids of all ages 
Go fuck yourself
I still recall what made me like you
And I don't want a part of all your hatred
The people who grinned themselves to death
You got a piece and hit across the sky 
To save me from the wasted, save me from myself, yeah yeah
Could've doubled as a power
Will things ever be the same again
And you're death comes wicked painful and slow
I'm washing my hands, I'm cleansing my soul
You danced on my bed
Behind your back in the supermarket
But I'm gonna die
Stand up like a man and not be there 'cause I care for you
You're so pretty when you die
It feels good not to be dealin' with petty cash
You know Casey Anthony, was handling
Everytime were taking one step forward,
Help me to know 
Is so you can pick it up and just bang your head to it
We scream it, we yell it, we living murda murda murda
Und dann wieder der Absturz in die Wirklichkeit
So wear a vest on your chest and the rest stand still
It was just one shot
With messages not thought of when released
Its time to come back around
A plan that I can implement
A religious fanatic posts footage of an interfaith service project
I'll be assistant to the blind knife thrower
To be able to sleep at night
Well, I sit on the corner and I drink drown soda
Head on the handrail feet can't reach the brake
I talk so foul, I talk so coarse, I show no regret, I show no remorse
The NYPD ain't got shit on me
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
At the bottom of a dark
I couldn't pull a damn anorexic bitch in a tugowar
There's no one to feel ashamed for
Oh burning fire 
There is no god behind their lies
Gettin' headz checkin' out
Don't really feel the need to argue this and that
Has never felt the way that I feel
As human gods aim for their mark
Held in your head, the things that they said
You better not miss it 'cause buddy I swear
I try to pretend I'm fine 
One day I'll introduce myself and you'll see you've not yet met me
And I don't condone dickriding
My face is scraped and bloodied
But I'm depressed and I don't wanna carry on
I should've thought things through
This one's a crazer, daydreaming disaster
Please be my next morning flower
You will suffer true pain
My hands grope for the light
Nigga, I sleigh, you pray, kill that ass uptown
And the phone would ring like a joke that's left unsaid
How I love to hate yourepeat
Cast to the fire
"You came from heaven is all he said"
I want to sit with my legs wide open and
Go the Motherfuckin gym and loose the gut and your fine
IIIIIs Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on
The beat, wears it like a kevlar
I love the way you lie
Voi kamalaa, no nyt se syö makkaraa
The tragedies reside in you
A middle finger with a barrel and it's fucking cocked
Trying, and I mean that shit
Don't believe me, ok be right back, I'm headed to the gun store
Burning down old glory while we jump around and shout
Got sick and tired of seein' brothers being treated ill
You'd think by now that I'd be over this
So break me shake me hate me take me over
That the wheel in my hand
Little punk wants to thrive on the industry lie
Please proceed to your gate, we are ready to board now
I could creep up beside put a gun in your mouth
But when it jumps, they ain't got no murder skills
Faith appears and holds a candle
Everyone left you
Disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
But, I'm strong enough to take that phone
"Holy, Holy, lift up your dress Feel your body
My friends are turning into opposites
And I am, whatever you say I am
Mousey, grungy, deceptive, wrecked
Away from this It's never ending
Neither a joke
She's thinks she's smooth, thinks she's smooth and now I'm saying
Yeah the blood poured down the picket lines
At which point will flot the new sounds
Some kids who flash like they assassins
And I want to believe
I've got enough of my own
Nobody ever said that life was fair now
But no drug war funds for clinics
But everybody's wrong about the one who needs
Thread a needle with it and weave a world of heads together
We talk among ourselves and hope nobody sees us
There's no civilians
And then it's on our hands
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone
I'm gonna be proud and loud and outta control
So I wasn't thinking clearly
I don't want to hate
Belief Belief
I'm not no red football
To fall in love with u
Now I don't think you care to know
I take one, one, one 'cause you left me
It's not enough, it's just a habit
So fucking bad, I came unglued
Now she looks so happy you don't understand
Cause the game is deep and the fame is brief
The bottles, the battles, the beetles will eat you
A sight to sore your eyes
Bitch I'm real wit this shit
Don't stand to close
On poison control IV's 'cause she can't stand the world
My intelligence fuck him up sacked me fuck him up
Slap to rebel yell
I can't explain this little man
So let it be known, the only reason that we do this
You hit me and left bruises on my chest
Believe me
I cannot go through this again
Let the war nerve break
Complacent as a passive racist
Looks like somebody forgot about us
You can say what you want to your boyfriends
My eyes are wide open
Head down, go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums
Red pools becoming thicker than syrup slow down your face
And as heart beats bring percussions
Sit around at home, stare at the walls
And you know what's even worse,
Still we grow and then the problems they become our own
How many more chances can one person have
"I have the answers for the questions y'all been asking me,
A stab in the back with a smile
There is no you, there is only me
It's never the same Ever since you went fallin' down, down, down
I can feel like I've never felt before
The echoes in my brain
Have you seen the writing on the wall
I touch your naked skin
Caught looking at the man in the mirror
I'm in love with the sounds
That love with a new peace of mind
My identity was in minority
But  you can't fuck with cowards, cause a coward'll be a coward
Gather round the sound
She don't wanna baby that looks like that
Your heads in quite a fix
Now raise your head from the floorboard
So break my wings and watch me fall
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through your head
Love will save us all, yeah
Walk the many walks of life
Angriffslust und die Sehnsucht nach Betäubung
Come out and play
Full of punchlines and jokes
I don't feel like talking your shit
I look back, what a waste of time
We feel the fury of devastation 'cause we tasted defeat
Plus twenty nine bust gum stuck cluster door
My eyes collide headon with stuffed
In my spiritual form, I turn into Bobby Seale
Oh my heart, my heart's gonna break again
Nobody hears it nobody hears it
Unsheathe the blade within the voice, my friend
Wanna dance on it, everybody want it
There came a cry "It's The Night of The Hawk"
Let's get lost tonight
Did you forget about me, Mr Duplicity
You're the Blood Of Me, yeah
I don't know who told you that who told you that
Drunk like  white boys in the
The king of the jungle
I'm looking back at my regrets, I'm still the same
You gotta get drunk just
If you mind your business, then you sure won't be mindin' mine
What you see is what you get tonight 
Before you get a chance to
We're not the ones who've kept minorities and women down
And nobody's saying a thing
Fuck that fuck you I won't give in
I ain't got no fucking money hey mom
I'm so sorry that I think
Lonely is the soul empty are the eyes
On a ball and chain I call my own
I woke up to sounds of my own
Hellohellohello
Turning back
That you're looking at me like you wanna be seeing someone else
And if your life
Your brain is clay
In my mind I catch a picture  big black raven in the sky
No incantations of remorse, my friend
Digest another hallucination psychosis by recreation
The welcome in a woman's eyes holds nothing for him
But I gathered up an army made of those
But I'm thinking about my
Is to keep your distance
Lethargy in disguise
You know we need oxygen to breathe
And we'll tell you when they're hungry again, 
If hell is truly Your pit of fire and I get thrown in it
'Cause I'll show you feelings that you've never seen
You cracked a smile but had nothing to say
No matter what you paid
Show me to the sapphire pit fake tomb
I hate my life, I hate my life
Why is the world falling in on me
Probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing
Turn around to see if he watchin'
And I'm hanging on, but I still know the way to make your makeup run
Let the code of silence repeat  times
Turn to me,  For the right answer
If niggas saying your flow weak, you shoulda bought one
You kill me with a single word
'Cause I'm not here for your entertainment
Now we've felt this, so you'll get yours now
Hoping this could be for you but it is for me patiently I stay busy, I wait, I see X
Why you wanna live out of bounds with a riot in your veins
Woman let me in
She's Miss Buenos Aires in a world of lacy lingerie
You're laughing when I cry
Question, what do these things all have in common
Some are willing to play the villain they just chillin'
You're none of my business now
In honor of the new year
You wouldn't believe the way it glows
How can you ever expect someone else to know you
Erasing my legacy
I'm living lies and shedding the skin 
That I'm closing in upon the dredge
I could not be her, I did not want to
Let me tell y'all niggas a little motherfuckin' story real quick
Oh, black Betty bambalam
To cleanse now all things
So my genuine advances are met with pofaced scepticism
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Whatta joke, I said go, boy you have to be one hundred percent
No, I don't hate you
I go crazy inside but when it comes out it's fine like wine
Yes I know you drink beer
Easy to plant with
Anybody get me out of here
You will become very friendly
Is a living hell torturing our minds
It feels good, and I'm gonna go wild
And I know you want me too
I've thought it through for a while but it doesn't get any easier
James, how I love to hate you
To watch it burn
I'ma  hit y'all niggaz with somethin' that you ain't never felt what
'Cause they keep half your cash just in case of returns
Now I wanna say nothing, nothing
And doing Hip Hop in this life and time
And you were laying in a cold
Now I'm in it, got to die before we see
You wanna bite it
It's disgusting, its offensive don't stick your nose up at me
For beating up the guys that hung my bike in a tree
I wanna thank the sweatshops in china too
Will get hung, even if you stick out your tongue
Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
Here the voices go
Got sick and tired of seein' people bein' treated ill
I really want to understand
Don't touch that seen in scandals, a blind man hold his hand and go
Too many weeds in the flowers
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah I can watch Good Will Hunting by myself
Rippin' someone's head off
Not punish less, rise the pain, sterilise rapists All I preach is extinction
And the smell of hope, the taste of ash
Hypocrisy and lies
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
I saw a brace of weeping willows
I do this shit for myself,
And We know the Flag of Love is from above
That tonight 
Writing on the wall
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
There's no signs of hope
Don't tell me it's too late
You gave me the Bible and expect me not to analyze it
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
And what do those hissy fits teach you except how to cry, pussy, cry 
See, they're always there with that funny hair,
I'm not a Muslim man
Ich bin der Abgrund, die Entwürdigung
Almost near my knees
Maybe we need some time alone
Ordered his gun and its done and its done and done
Oh backstabber, backstabber
You're all by yourself but you're not alone
While you were preaching to the needy each and every evening
You wanna go son
D'you get scared to feel so much
I needed that thing we call fun, but 
Converge to choke us
I'm not afraid of feeling and I'm not afraid of trying
Reflexalways too late
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
The flies, they all gather around me
When I'm not really dying
Keep singing songs for me
I'm the law and you can't beat the law 
Give you something in return
It's in the blood 
You've always had it made
Children of every race, creed and religion frolic through fields
And I, I took all that I desired
I covet everything you ever feared
Somethin's got to give, now
Everybody get to it, do it, get ruined
My name is Soul and you're holding me inside should I be mad at you giving me a dime but you wouldn't be the same 
Who will remember you
Everyone wants to be a teen dream
The Word stopped the game they begin to pray
"Trust us with your hearts and minds"
'Cause I've been trying to fix mine from the start
I'll never fall again, never fall again
And they would beat us up if we had diamonds on our watches
And your lips reached out
They waved their guns in my face
Biatch When we ride on our enemies
Everybody's someone else's nigger
It's not a secret anymore
I see it, believe it
Lionel rolled the blunts up, so meanwhile me and Lucas getting fucked up
I see the world, and it's full of hate
It takes a hijacking then you go attacking your enemies without any proof
The walls like a tiny mosquito
He puts the dense indents in the bed
The Game Laughing, smoking
Dear, I'm sorry
You are nothing
Feels like I'm falling, but I tell you I'm not going down
It's time for a rest
Try to hold me down
The neighbors are asking you what it's all for
I'd rather chuck up my middle finger than give a bitch a smile
Ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah
In a coma lying, waiting
Get back, get away from them, it's all wrong,
I don't mind telling you
But people from Missouri never incensed me
Baby I remember
I'm sick like Chuckie was sick, my defeated heart keeps beating on
I'ma ride where I wanna ride fuck that
Then the world would see
In the falling of stars
You can go out if you want we wouldn't dare
Everybody loves to love a winner
Kiss 'em on the cheek and life's okay
In my sorry heart
Niggaz ain't going back to court you stank ass bitches
And my heart flew from its cage and it bled upon my sleeve
Fist full of bees watch the children change
I am the worst liar I know
His collar's pulled, begin to be aware 
No matter who you are and no matter were you live
I'd kill a dragon for you
More fire for the people
I can still feel the chill 
And says, "I got mine, but I want more"
See me fall
I was busy bleeding and recieveing unholy seamen
It is a plant, not a demon
It's another end of another working day
Slim Jim's and a Tin Man grins deadhead's with dreads
I'm not a Mormon freak
So call me crazy, hold me down
So easy to hate
Wrote a message on my pillow that says "Jesse, stay asleep in bed"
And I got shot
You cry wolf like you're the town crier, cry girl
Now our time Said now our time
Tell me again your fucked up excuses
They're gonna give you nothing
I'ma tell ya like this wussup
Your bible's lines signify a barcode
Outside the streets were steaming
The God machine is hungry
But she's waiting 
We know that your world will hate this
Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
I try and feel the same but in my dreams your all that I see
I was more fucked up than your sister's tackle box
Don't ever underestimate what I can do
Oh and now you're going around trying to sleep with my friends
A bit confused by my reflection
It was an accident, a random chance
And I smell the coffee on your fingers
Yeah I mind what you do
But there's something about my face that always keeps you coming back
That noone's free from sin and when I look at you
Cause you know it's over
The white man doesn't understand our ways
Why do I feel like dying
My mama felt, she never liked you neither did my friends
The time is growing near put the trigger to the man
Spaz, animal rap, they love when the god spit
How fucked up that'd be
Oc life is not the life so free
The end of life
I see your face on the street
And we do what we need to be free
Feel the flesh fall off on to the floor
I don't believe in anything
Do you see a long road with no one on it
And go about your life, like it was nothing
We need vices at fifty thousand degrees
On the bathroom floor my life
He grabbed my hands
I am a bitch
Has been broken since '
I still remember a year ago
You know
As a man breathes into his saxophone
Razem i osobno chyba jesteśmy niezdolni żyć,
I got a man at home but, he ain't here tonight
That somehow sucks me in again
Did you hear me laughing in your head, when I saw you stuck in a rut again
Inject you with the gunpowder pegs
Not that it's my fault
All that glitters is not gold
"I just wanna be with you"
I'd give you the world
Still getting paid without no ties
Dass du mir weh du host
The hand of a friend
But there's nothing left to suck
"The damn thing gone blind" bambalam
I think me, you and Am should ménage Friday
They hardly know their sacred mother tongue but they know their duty
Total hate Total hate Total hate
Fuck 'em up and give him nothing
I heard you bought a crib on biters block downtown plagiarism's paradise
Innocence so suffocating
Every day I can feel you so near
And I do not feel the romance, I will not be
You say there's nothing wrong but I don't hear it
'I don't know how all this started'
If I let you in, will you run off with my maid
Cut away our smiles
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
You wouldn't even hold me
Illegal immigration, gun control hysteria
I'm glad ya'll made it
I'm right where I always dreamed I would be
And I'm as much of an asshole as I've ever been
I know it's killing you, it's a bitter taste
Well it's the funk back breaker
You drag me back there
So here I go kickin science in ninetyfive
Motherfuckin crew, motherfuckin mob
The truth's out there Ima find it myself
I swear I'm down for whatever you're down for tonight
Well it's a Pretty Baby, I don't really mind
left with the pain
Yeah, I'm toiling in shit, he's got no place to go
And what's it worth I'm easily checked and don't control my earth
You smear your filth across
I'm not talking to you but you're smiling at me
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Without a sense of confidence confidence
Ripped apart by the crows not the vultures
To sacrifice what I believe
Nigga ain't federal, I plan shit
It rings through wires and into my head
But I'm grabbing my clothes as I jet just to catch a ride
Around her finger
But you're the one who faked it all along
Live your life
That you kiss and resist me 
I don't think I remember why
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
That always runs slow
Ourselves for taking too long to discover
You think dick is the answer, but it's not
So I'll just stand right here for now
When you're feeling at last and reeling so fast
Gon' head
What you know about bein' bedside next to your girl
I'm gonna rip her flesh
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Bend me, break me, breaking down is easy
But their mighty appetites will not be tamed
Behind the eight ball nothing but flimm flamm
And nobody gives a damn
Now I'm supposed to bow my head and close my eyes
The outlaw biker with my big shit kicker
Nothing is what I get from you, nothing
I disconnect the act
Stand for something, get money nigga
Can't believe all that you're telling me
Horny and burned out now is how it always ends for me 
'Cause if a girl came clockin' your man
From the heart, when he doesn't come home
I'll never be the same, break in decency
That you know, and I know better
I'd go through hell for you no matter what
The evenings get longer and I know
With nobody else around; you were outside the house
Cold eyes and a painted face 
Was it not what you wanted it to be
You share with none, you have no one
Hoping the security guard doesn't hold you in custody
For failing to see
Excuse us if we treat him like our idiot cousin
So get you're fire out my face and don't follow me, dipshit
I'm sending you all to Hell
Stop this airplane 'cause I got to get down
Burned out turned out lookin' for a handout no use
Are you turned on
The rage of Angels
Drugs, liquor, drugs
I spit upon your test
Mandibles cut like a knife
My flow sizzles, yo boy Hop go hard like some cold nipples
Now I'm no prophet, but the rhymes you vomit
Even though you were alright in bed
Don't point that thing at me unless you want to use it
Jet black  the blood that's in your veins
Worthless white power piece of nazi fucking shit
Death with violence
And usually I'm not into dark dick
Some children died the other day
And the sickos I spend G's but only make nickles
'Cause reality offends
Fuck all these guntoting
Because I'm feeling the cold of a last farewell
Changing up the codes on your phone every day
'Cause words like that don't matter
 Breaking the bones
They'll fake a smile and then they'll shake your hand
Question everything they say, besides whose life is this anyway
Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
The rage that I feel today
Don't look back If I can get my grip,
Everybody, everybody, everybody sucks
But that's how you want me
'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
Flags that line old main street are blowin' in the wind
Picked up my dough and bked this honey passin'
The sun makes me dizzy the sun makes me sick
The hair stands up down the backside of my neck
Got no name got no brain
I'm looking for a way to make a plan and keep it neat P Dog
Load it in ya head play it back slow
But, oh, how many dress rehearsals
Last time now
Some of the image but all of the power
If I fail,
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
Just enough water to ensurface the world
Hoodlum can't find no peace only trauma in the grave
Till I walk beside you on the street and now
Cry cry cry
Arms and legs, feet and hands
Can't block or screen that shit, now everybody sing that shit
Someday we'll all be rich 
Ain't no way to set me free, now
Said it's strange 'cause I feel the same
Magnificent blow your back out, if you act out
And he replied, "Well, the secret is to hook 'em young
And now my fist is
Be a king or be a slave
'Cause what I get ain't half of what I give
So you think you've got some problems
But all I wanted was love to stay
You picked the wrong time to fuck with me
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Fuck Ruthless, bitch I never lend you a hand
They, they, they, they, who the fuck are they
To every inch of my skin
Nashes with the Nazis but it's normal what the cops see
And it feels like that to push me
Yeah, I'll be fine without these bones
Yeah you suck out of luck
There's a darkness in your soul demanding imperfection
It's so hard to admit that I drove you away with all this negativity, this anger every day
WuTang niggaz they shine and make the mic glow
And the smoke would curl around my face
Wound the watch till it broke all in hopes of stopping the time
Found her dead on the ground
Tend a wound that never mends
You see, no, I don't care at all
You were there like a punk
Red, gold, I told
These thoughts aren't mine
I'm not falling down
There's nothing you can say
At the end of the day
But every time I see ya face I think of me and you
I fell between the seat, but nothing broke
Temperature's rising
You make a mess
Au point de crier nos histoires
They won't know who you are
Beatin' around my head
I can't remember, I don't understand, is it malice that makes you this way
Declares me a phantom demon I don't know
Or am I just another sick bitch lunatic
The cat fights the dog
I heard a noise, it was probably nothing
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
I cannot believe it's taken so long
Yeah it's the little things
Keep her warm in winter
You've got to manage
Who stopped and swam
In joyous hell
 I despise the trendies, I know they're lying
The bloodshed on these dusty roads
While the paranoid try to stuff the void
Cause two suckas can't agree on something
Underneath the night San Fransisco sky
You turn on me, and left me alone with my fate
Well this ain't no time for bull as I fly into the sun
There is no other Troy
That beacon fallen from your eyes
You buy me lots of stuff because you love this ass
Who's got the last laugh now
I'm gonna kill it, damn dead
It's the most extraordinary thing in the world
While fountains fill with secondhand perfume
Fool, you're never home now
If that's what you wanted to hear
If all their hearts I could replace, but until then I'll have to
Flattered that you think I warrant ugliness
You're out of your mind,
I know your words mean nothing
Get off my sack 'cause your shit is WACK
Gallons of spilled African blood
Whoa, oh, oh The lines are drawn
As his gaze falls down on the city
You held at arms length
Lock you down tight so you can't move a thread
I don't want to see
Nor refuse the falling rain
PC she says inoculate, hallucinate, beware Shakespeare, bring fresh air, king cigarette snuffed out by her midgets, by her midgets 
When you make breakfast after ten
Willin' and able to change the game for the better
Yes I know that you can't withstand it
Smile in your face, undermine your back
Put your words on fire till I'm pure
Gonna use your tongue as a stamp
Now I'm glad you've got a broken heart
On my hands after I wrote this album
And every night I pray that you don't knock her up
What you, what you want
You mad at me 'cause I'm gettin' rich
And I'm talking to myself at night
Is making me sick
In aching heart that will begin
Flashing through my mind
Held the table for eleven games
I stopped the thought before its drip became insistent
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
My eyes see straight behind me
Sweat is beating on the brow
Even though you had these tendencies from the start of this thing
He goes to the desert, fires his rifle in the sky
To share in your sickness
You're the respectable member of society
Hardly recognize simple things anymore
You sleep alone at night
Ignorance plagues up this planet that we live on
And don't forget to give me back my black tshirt, hey hey
What a beautiful fucking time to be alive, eh Ha
Plus I really need a rest
How do you sleep, you've never loved
Did you think that life could mean so much
Nobody wanna sing a little bit out of tune
Love, hate, lust it's all the same
And for never beating the shit outta me
We sing that sad song
I go wild 'cause you break me open
I'm never wrong don't tell me what to do
Would you please give me my records back
The heartless
Oh they may criticize and compromise, but we were always in it
Baby don't be mad I'm sorry can't you see i
In heaven in the lies
Wait a min wait a min I got more to say bitch you ain't goin' no where y'all smile in my face and talk shit in back of me I got the ball I'm tryin' to shot but y'all niggas keep hackin me could it be that I'm a king cause r@b been good to me or could it be that us a lame that hate the game and can't beat me I use to rep the chi but now I no my worth I still rep the chi but earth is my curst nigga I been around the world trown bitches around the world hered roomers round the world still I'm tourin round the world talk about me on your records to make your better play it backwards it probabyly say kells is the coolist ever so don't think these is a song it's a taste of my raft back to your nevous nigga I got a dick and a half I'm a beast
Spitting who how I do niggas who knowin' they wanna ride who
Now your mother's squatted down alone and she's weeping
We were supposed to sleep together
I am not your friend
Jet black  We say, "how long can we take this chance not to celebrate"
My god is a shallow little bitch trying to make the scene
All of my things that I play with in daylight
When it get's dark in this town
Not getting an answer
I've had all the scars and stitches
Forced to sit so I play all alone, 
How many shows till were back in New York
And made it seem like everything 
Gonna let nobody love
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind
Fight on your own, that's not the point, boy
Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
And slam his ass into a brick wall
You said no, you said no
It was far away and slowly breaking apart
I got nothin' to lose
Mindless apethetic fuckers flocking to church
There's something in your heart that's coming over you,
I know their appetite for me
But now you're staring out the TV with a smile on your face
We never played by the same rules anyway
It was cool but it was just pretend
Do you know what they feel
Grey not neon, grey not real 
Just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters
If I were the king
Soll ich die Papiere holen und machen, was ich will
So get your ass out from
Oh lie on me, that's all I want is you to lie on me,
Pigs arresting you and me
What makes me say those things
I need another one to incubate
And it's not your style
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Thuglife niggaz Yo, EM Get me up out of this motherfucker man
'Cause I run wit Asians, Latinos and Black fists
It's not a secret
You're not a man, stand and deliver
Bboys make some noise, get connected
Disguise yourself plead innocent
I wanted to heal me and then destroy the world
Bleeding hands from solid lands
No way, no way, no way, yeah yeah, to disconnect
You're gonna fuckin' die, you piece of shit
Sometimes I want to rip out your throat, Daddy
You punks is petty, still we steady, countin' fetti
No need to help it take its toll
All your innocence for free
Except perhaps a few thousand rappers in this business
We can bang the drum at your door
Boys that always grew up better men than me and you
Today's the day our younger son is going off to war
I can't feel  I'm disconnected
To make a voice no voice at all
Stuck my nose 
The way you bit off my head
In the darkness of my dreams
Tryin' to get what I got ya might get shot
"My precious wife
And if I get drunk, yes, I know I'm gonna be
Watch you burn
He's on a stairway to hell
Get back to the show 'cause it's payday
Your shit is phat but I don't hear it in the format Jack
A minute and a half of having sex, that ain't loving
Trading friends for trips to the coast
Not to the next scene bitch the next check
Run away, you'll be okay
I've left bethlehem
That is not what I do
I'm not liking the sound of your voice
Now tell the, Now tell the TRUTH
Everybody has two sides
Silent Anguish and silent scream
Yes indeed a, dawn of the dirt and doom draws nearer
Laws written on paper and paper burns
Come into the world of endless odds 
It ain't hard to be a sinner
Somebody tell me
Why do people change
A toast to the end of our innocence
Y'all free up ya mind and stop actin' crazy
A little bit closer,
You think it's my fault
Sad to say, it's over now
But this city made me so
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty,
Can't stand weak friends that have pretense
I wanna love you
And this is not a fashion statement
Talk like a big business tycoon
Like this whole song was just some kind of sickly devised plan
And I be riding on the wings of eternity like
Inside your heart I cry for more
With all the glue that is in my head
Who want to step up
Time out, walk it off Think I need to throw a flag
For I'd sooner litter the earth with our corpses,
Thuglife niggaz You know what time it is
Blowing down the backroads headin' south
Everything you've done's gonna bite you back in some way
Ball and chain
Fuck smiley gladhands with hidden agendas
One move and you're dead, 
And it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free
The stars and stripes are running for their own big show
First you're telling stories
Why you won't return my calls 
So much more aware
No one else is looking for
Drug use  I kicked it
I'm barely breathing now you got me by the spine
Enough to fill it up again
The dark crow man sits and stares
Don't you see when you're looking at me
You can join the "in crowd" for being a whore
You know you can't complain
I can't feel 'cause I don't want to feel no more
And now my sister's got a fancy car
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is,
And now I come across without
Pick yourself up off the dirty floor
See there's something that he used to believe in
Musicisti mai fratelli
And I really wanted just be in your body
Got to get with the program, I don't need no charity
But they don't help me get any closer to you
Now all I want is my Patsy Cline CD
The ambulances engine turns back on
"I understand that time is running out"
How can I believe this untrue
You know I see it written 'cross the sky 
Wanna hate
Well, I don't want you to be alone down there
I am a world's forgotten boy
I believe the title was "Bin Laden determined to attack inside the United States"
My senses finely tuned instruments
Oh, we're not worthy
This is how a heart breaks ooh ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah
A shallow little asskiss art disaster
From record sales, to sold out concerts
Cast salt into your violence stop freestyling
I'm a negative creep and I'm
Sucker fish fuckers down in the sink
Now as a citizen, I've asked you to stop it
And you know too much
That I'll never end transcend transcend
Keep this rocking it's brown mixed with green we'll be swervin
For the mines of Mozambique
I see some very nice skin out there
I don't care anyway just give me a what I want
Reeking of ether and terminal madness
I know somewhere it's right
You know nothing about art or sex
Get your motherfuckin security ready fuck em
A mac with a pull, act a fool, excalibur
Did I take too long Was just teasin'
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
To dominate this shit has been my every intention
This is a sinking road that we all travel on
Hope you like my genocide
The future is Xrated
Then one day, you'll find us sitting in your chair
Freaks here in this hopeless fucking
I still believe in this society
My spirit walks the streets of Tottenham
Yo, man, how you doin' man
Nine chances to drown ourselves
Damaging challengers  resurrection, disorder
It's time to get it over with it's useless to run
And I don't give a fuck I keep it gangsta y'all
You could say that the sky is blue
And the scavengers are feeding 'cause the killing fields are bleeding
Then you realize you're not unique
My inner luck knows better, it's what I wanna hear
What story should I tell now, I'll just expose the truth
Wild 'cause we know there's no Jehovah watching over us
Wild boys will be wild, still acting like a child
I wanna tear it up, tear it out
I can't stand you 
What the fck y'all take me for I love you cause you hate me more
That I keep making to myself
I will be waiting right here
Es war noch nie Unwort des Jahres, Kindesmissbrauch
So roll over and lose it
Fuckups and punchins
The venom and the vaccine swirl
And I don't give a fuck
'Cause I used to move you in a way that you've never known
And cry my eyes for Your acceptance has brought me here
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
God forbid I suggest she lets me kiss them
Car Babylone a le pouvoir et l'exerce sur nos frères 
Climb backwards through the red room
And you're like that every time you pull heart back
Kurt Cobain e Billie Holiday senza la roba
She may be crazy, may treat me bad
High class, white trash, rolling a classic hovercraft
Corporations cold turn you to stone before you realize
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
There is no recovery
When you got her in the back seat
Yo, nobody care about how much money you stack
Living encaged like animals and cannibals,
Deep in the veins of the great rivers
Never come back no more
Books are easy back ups for what they do to you,
Is like Hannibal rollin' on elephant's backs
It began with a mistake
All these lines fall short of what I had in mind
To see if I'm okay
Ah, I opened up my arms to You, and we spun from life to life,
Then one day he decides to marry her
Can decide you, fucker
Don't run away bring it on
So you want a piece of this
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Said "I don't mind if you take me down"
You fucking ripped my heart out
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
I offer nothing in my defence
I really wanted to be in your body
So nigga fuck you x
Tired of falling backwards
I would never want to wake again
Another tag, another headline
Oil baron running the government
Alright, not bad
Gather your psychotic masses and bring them to me
But that shit don't work I just laugh
If you gonna leave me baby leave today Oh yeah
Smile on the face
It Wasn't long till I called you mine
Save your prayers and solve your problems with your fist
'Cause I made, I made
You make me sick
When I die won't you bury me
Just games for days, busy bees makin' our honey
Nobody likes you
I know what it's like to not be able to feel
But if you read between the lines, you'll see the missing link
Forget going on a holiday bruv
Won't you take my sins away
All my friends are gone, they died
A game of who needs who the worst
The law won't arrest you
But I got one foot in hell
You never did nothing for me
I'm gonna kill him
Yeah, well we both know that you don't play fair
But it's feeling all wrong
I dreamed that the world was crumbling down
Now, just cuddle up and sleep tight
Pay up to the profit, and you'll never look back
If I could kick your ass somehow you've sunk in those stupid lies in a major disguise
I don't need obligations to our crippled conversations
Cut glass on my callused feet,
Well, I don't think your eyesight is to blame
There's a gun at my back
Like you're running blind
The sun has set, all darkens
You stuck it so many times you 
Frankenstein I'm well aware of
Fuck you hoes, fuck you bitch ass niggaz too
F G F C     Enforce your rage
I will not forget the day
When you were yourself there it tasted sweet
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
The way you make me feel I have to react
Your silence screams
Rev Jim Jones Don't ever say hate is your enemy Love has practically caused me to just get you destroyed If I had hated a little more, just a little more, we would have had a little less trouble Sure you got love Principles But don't say 'hate is my enemy', what'd they say, what's that words "Hate is my enemy and I've got to fight it day and night" and "what else is death" is the line Love is the only weapon, SHIT BULLSHIT Martin Luther King died with love Kennedy died talking about something he couldn't even understand, some kind of generalized love, and he never even backed it up He was shot down Bullshit, "Love is the only weapon with which I got to fight" I've got a hell of a lot of weapons to fight I got my claws, I got cutlasses, I got guns, I got dynamite, I got a hell of a lot of fight I'll fight I'll fight I will fight I will fight I will fight I will fight
On life's highway, God with thee
Wem gehör'n die Drogen
I'm not crazy 'cause I take the right pills every day and rest
And I'm heading the wrong way, and I'm a trainwreck
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta
Heaven knows what a girl can do
Was früher die Gestapo war
We float overhead like a space odyssey monolith
Death's a part of life, you just can't ignore it
This ain't a verse, this shit talk at the end of the song
Hope were gonna turn blue
If I should fail, if I should fold
On all the pain you've been selling
Brasilian national radio broadcast, Brasilia  Brasil  
Talkin' that shit
You were a punch line
And can you keep sleeping metaphysical girl
I watch the snow cover up the bottle
It's nothing but my way
You break your back for something
I'm not the girl that lied
Us whores don't need you
Hitching a hand unto the breeze
Like you want you fuck you
The rascals win, killing them all with a javelin
I am the assassin
Je peux rester là afin de pouvoir tout oublier
The leaders of this world have shortchanged the human race,
Oh well, whatever, never mind
Allah stay chasin' dough like wild lions
Shut up, I'm not like you 
We full throttle in this bitch and never will slack up
No food for us but there's another fucking bottle of pills
Cause mommy's been been drinking again and we don't want to get beat
I could never swallow
Kouluun sä menit silmin vihaisin
And we ain't got no money, so she lose her fuckin' mind
But by free thought, not a gun to the head
Blood roses, blood roses 
You fake it
Cause I'll come and take your life away
It never ends, never ends 
This is the kiss off
Greasy, dirty, sweaty, smelly
My heart was still there
That you don't believe in God
Walk the coolest walk that you know
Tell, tell, there's nothing left to tell
Did you hear I don't care no more
And so we ran, like the wolves were biting,
I think I'll send these doctor bills
Broken glass all in my mouth
Hate is a river flowing with money and greed
I hate a man like you
Sors immanis, et inanis, rota to volubilis
I say them alound, to myself I am talking
I am nothing
This place is of the dark and I
Get yourself a break from self rejection
I no longer feel the need to rush
I only listen to the demon in my mind,
We always seem to fall with only words to hold
You're in my dreams and in my mind
Everybody wants
Pass a man walking like the man in the moon
Know it's over
No doubt the body count
You call it thanksgiving, we call it thankstaking
Make the coffee black as night
Fucking higher
I saw it rolling in
Zabierają mi wolność którą mam,
I need to feel,
Your girlfriend told me he'd been callin' out my name
So let's end this call and end this conversation
Giving you shit, cause something in his life won't fold
Back in the day
So I made a list of how you're gonna pay
Just like my daddy, yes
How I' d like to fly in an airplane
It's not what I gave to you
And taking over
That's for calling my sister a hoe, and for you
Well I'm a truth addict, oh shit I got a head rush
Would it be so hard to understand
Get a hold of your cock, get stoned on my hash
There's no fuckin' way That I'm gonna solve them
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Assault and battery, 'cause we coming with that street mentality
I need it in my brain
tu non puoi amare un tarlo
Step back
May your death come quickly
Comprendre cada jugada 
We slap tracks and attack like M Bison
And war war is the battle cry 
You should learn when to go
There's bitches in this building and they all in this section
Sailing cemetery seas after crew leaves and moves on
I never meant to fall this far
So the wind that blows across your room
Outside someone's screaming
'Cause when you're lookin' at pain you're lookin' at truth
It's not happening, it's not happening
I thank you for making me feel
We ask nothing less then settle for nothing more
Everybody, everybody, everybody livin' now
Got a half Armenian girlfriend
I tried to move you
I spread my arms
Why does this always happen
Come on, girls, I wanna see you drinking
My niggaz got my back, in fact
Forgive me I'm rollin' with deamon, I'm devilish
Has all but drowned
Check our habitation are we a peace lovin' nation
Singing again, singing again, singing again
When the smoke cleared
All of our freedoms are meeting their end
I don't have no time
They plundered and slaughtered in the name of truth,
I always feel I have to open my mouth
Got us all worked up
We'll have that criminal's head marched through the streets on a stick 
Feels like the future for you and me, fades in the failing light,
No need for police
Well, I'll bleed on through the night
Fuck R&B and the runnin' man
Dripping with sin
And the sky was made of amethyst
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
And I've realized my crime
Your pictures on my wall
Scorn your mind
We survived through our loneliest nights
I'll make you feel one second pass
To get at the girl that just walked in but she thinks you suck
Such sweet relief
And after all I'm glad that I'm not your type 
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
But I don't wanna be illicit 
Your armor cold, your time run out
One drink of water and I'm drowning in it
I've been staring a hole in the wall
Puts your name to shame
Never want another wife
And they'll leave in a bodybag
Then fall diatonically
They'd go away now
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
At my fingertips
Sphere of storms in my head
I love to hate you
And phased my view of the wicked hand you played
I feel I'm drowning
Fuck your god
I know, but you know why let it go So
Kick rocks
She's a bimbo playing on the damn phone
Write your novel
Who knows how far I'll fall
The lies derail
I'm messy, what's that say about you
It feels good to see freedom excepted
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait
My lead give head tunnels boom
I'm hungry, I'm dirty
Hear me say, better things will surely come my way
Drugs, liquor, drugs
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna
And make me your god
I feel you looking at me thinking that my happiness
You hate my life
I saw a dead man walking
Singing our songs of yesterday
So we bend the bracket
To whisper words like brother nothin' here is any good
You sell your soul when you sign on the dotted line hoping to go gold
And we're headed straight into God
You're the black ice on my road to wholesome
How in the hell did I get into this mess anyway
I want to smash the faces
These watching, plotting minions of the lower God scene
These people disagree but I don't listen to 'em though
Insult you like a fool
You have no direction and you have no protection
Is it because you're a fucking 
Some people look at me and talk about me like a clown
Hooded hearts and jeweled hands
Are you living in a rat race
And that's real from the motherfucking Bush Killa
Before we bought the house the cars before we had any kids
While you're sleeping
Poets gonna take control
And feel the fury of these tears
I wear the scars to show my shame
Suck, suck, suck
Please someone, please someone, please someone show me the light
At pettiness which plays so rough
I thought that was protocol
Can't explain the way that I feel
Those days are dead Forgive me
It's murda, please believe
Bullshit I bet you say there ain't no Allenwood PA
You can tell ev'rybody 'bout the state I'm in
Little wolf skin boots
We'll get it back again
I can get with this and I can see it all now
At least I cannot see them
I once saw a man
Out of bed and to the bong
No human contact
Concrete nigga, that's my reality
Don't try to understand me
Then I won't say faith, isn't made for me
For that day I spent
Should I bend down and worship the ground
Evil demon, quit while you're even, evil, evil Evil man
He leaves his father's grave and his birthright
Who hides in the shadows waiting for the sun
They nearly break their backs
Try and read between the lines
The world is sleeping, I am numb
I want some
Is enough to decide that some things
And we'll keep moving faster till you scream
Cnote rockin' in a pocket
Is it straight enough
This isn't a game, but I will pretend
Oh what a shame
 dispatch can you please run by your address for me
And your daughter's got nut stains on her back
War Ooh, ohoho now
No TV party tonight
I know I'm not alone and I really want to leave
And it makes me feel so sorry
Shut up, smart little bitch, I don't need lies
Disseminated decay of my death
God is Going to get sick of me
He ran into my knife ten times
It's hard to talk with your dick in my mouth
Love is not safe in a world filled with hate
There's nothing left in it
I'll surrender to it
Except fuck you
And it's in God that we trust"
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill
There is no milk
We'll tear your heart right out or your chest you're already dead 
Slumped in the back Burn bush by the son of George
Everybody thinks they know me
 times the pain
Mess with the Cube, you get punked quick
'Cause you're a fat fuckin' drunk piece of shit
I make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
All your friends got behind my back
Watching as the scars fall from your eyes
Nobody likes you where'd you go
I stopped trainin and turning up  matches
I've lost my taste
There's no doubt about it
You are the one at stake, you are at fault
And it feels so good to be on top of you
Don't know
I offend someone
That I sold  Cutco knives to afford, but whatever, hey, it's cool
But kill me first
Everybody wants to make it happen
Cause nothing matters anymore 
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
The art of killing poetry
Did he buy your heart with visa, or his platnum master card
Some of them end up in some six foot hole
It's certain tragedy
Without your plastic friends
Let's get this party jumping, let's see some  chugging
Die bastard, die bastard, burn
All your blood 
If anybody do she know how we flow
Oh did I tell you we got Fifi spayed
Or use your right to protest on the street,
Burning candl, e blackened malice
Look around you, is this what you want
I did not design this game
Can I hold grudges Mind saying "let it go, fuck this"
 dispatch ma'am
So stupid now you're crying your eyes out he's long gone and you're trying to find out
I'm your real life suicide blonde
We'll go to the pagoda
Thick with honey
City of Baghdad Abrasive aloof
I've been in Paradise, don't want to go back
Breaking myself to try to keep everyone
The drive the idea still existing 
I play the shit out of the drums
But that isn't true because everyone knows
Making a point in conversations
God hates god kills god slays
When the sound of shredding vocal chords is what I want to hear
I will watch you while you're sleeping
This fire will burn
When he gets out, we're one hell of a team
Making better views and close relaxing sounds
I bet you can't even tell me that much
It's strange 'cause I feel the same way
Muddy garbage the things within
Man, I'm thinking that I'd rather be stoned
Execution needed, a bloody vessel for your peace
The least you could do is say please
In this fire we burn
I know in an instant I could lose everything I'm working toward
Every night before I sleep
Not a scratch, not a dent
Ooh, baby it ain't enough
And her eyes have the surprising effect of rendering me restless
You trusted the devil
I'm always around you to show that I care but I don't know what for
I wanna feel you, feel you, feel you
They fucked us all 'cause they wanted to
So involved in all the wrong fights
Somebody as guilty as me can break this spell
We americans love guns
Now I understand why she gets up after sundown
Niggaz resigning, now master
They must of thought id never remember to pass to it
Decide what's right or not  I know
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assist
You are so fucking paranoid
Welcome back to the start
Oh, somebody teach me something new
But all that stands in the way is
'Cause the devil borrowed my clothes just for tonight
How could you tell her that you love her
Little bitch got lost in her own confusions
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
Everybody will know your name
Sunday morning it's the same bullshit
Are you ready to face the Doom
I'm standing up, Headstrong, In control of my life
Cal state, no fun
Hate to bleed but it heals my pain
The sun was setting on a golden photo op
Why do the same old things keep on happening
I'm too sore from fitting exactly to ride into setting suns aching to
Short, sharp, bloodlust reality
Denied our movement
I feel it coming slowly
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
And if I made a perfect world you'd be gone
Croaking its drama across an orchestra of friendly faces,
Minus the text in the language of ghosts
Staring in the trees, paranoid, are gone in the breeze
Ask the angels while they're falling 
And knock it off the hinges now
Just like your daddy, yes
By focusing closer
A devastated world we'll see in tomorrow's society
See who's the champion pace coming down break you fall
Too bad you had to have a better half
It's a breakdown, a breakdown
It feels so good to knock things down
I have when I'm dead I'll rest
Beg and steal and lie and cheat, d'uh
If you're havin' trouble with the high school head
And a good place to shoot from
And if I haver, whatever the fuck that means
When will I ever learn
Taste the wealth of hate in me
Crawling broken my face is
So far away, I don't want to stay
Don't move, don't breathe
Give me your hand and I'll give you a shoulder
I know it's sad
It's just you and your hand tonight
No one gave you the right to take your life that way
Welcome to my world grinding down and
You cannot take it
Leaving absolutely nothing behind 
And in return, the have become my martyrs,
Hey these girls say that this town sucks ooh
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
A different wound that keeps them bleeding
But never goes away, yeah
Bumpin' somethin' about clubs, bumps and hubs
Grand dissonance
It's the same old cry
While so much still stands in our way
I hate it when you breach my space
I'm glad I am crazy, it keeps me trying
Runnin' wild through the streets like I'm loco
When I'm God everyone dies
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it,
You can hate me now Die motherfucker die motherfucker die
Wrapped its arms around my waist
Fear is your only god on the radio, nah fuck it
"Ladies and Gentlemen"
And I can turn to the box for some peace
Process me, produce the proper symmetry to put me in charge of reinventing the mute Put me in party to the scheduled lie and give me your right hand but live by your left, make me murder every mountain and remove every paradise
I'm a golden curse, call me treacherous, treasure chest
Ain't no coppin' a plea, ain't no stoppin' a G
I turned into what destroyed it 
For the ill uses that the others might make of your ideas
Every scratch, every click, every heartbeat
Or another casualty
A feeling is a piece of skin wrapped in a pocket
I'm gonna have to kill you now
Painted a new picture that makes me sick
Play with me, play with me
I never put any faith in this life
Into the souls on the tree of pain
When it gets dark
Always revolving
The game I ain't even use a gun
Harlem Underworld
See how much you've done now
We take back control
If you really want hell, hell
'Cause I'm fighting with a thorn on my side
That's the life I choose guns, drugs, and booze
Jacobite blended dregs a gypsy's old bed setter
Free now from everything weighing you down
Choking away the life that I have left
I don't care for EEC or CFCs or the latest disease
This city once was mine
The spirit of Almighty Voice, the ghost of Anna Mae
L'on puisse m'attendre 
This is not the st time
And hide my cuckold eyes
To fake
That have long gave up the ghost
If I thought for a second it would do any good
And the readymen, defiant drinkers and charmers
He was paining, now a bunch of whispering immerse
And that little punk did it all for the cookie
I don't wanna carry any of your pain
I And put her in my claw
And beat this bitch with a hit
I just had to expose the truth like Leonardo DaVinci when he paint Madonna
Throw the pistol in 
So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes
Retribution is the way of life that we are livin'
I see a woman in the night
The lead giveth, I take it, if I didn't understand it
Lay your flowers on our grave
You end up dead in the end
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Could never understand or try
I thought we wiped the slate clean, that's fucked up
My ranking is vicious, you thinking it isn't
War Ooh, it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
What's real, anybody with nowhere to run
Come around no more
Come to save you 'cause you're all mine
Fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck yo' fine ass bitch
Give me back to the endless wild 
'Cause nothing is happening 
That high horse you get on from bullshit you where fed on
Head of the class and she just want a swallowship
C'è chi ti fotte e chi rinuncia, fratelli veri
High speed horse shoes harnneses and heavy string
It's easy to control us if you keep us all afraid
Lies burning eyes
It's kinda like our running joke
Oh, honey I'm a mess
Whatever it takes
Wir wollten nicht so werden wie die Leute die wir hassen
And the visions blew my mind
Here's to the justice never dealt, to innocent, proven guilty
What are you thinking
Who cares if you die
Such a lack of taste
There's no use to keep a secret
Into their graves
I want to destroy you
I hold out for the rare when the silence is golden
Believe Believe
You only see with your dying eyes
Standing in the tall grass
Saw some guy on the TV yesterday
If I let the niggaz around my way tell me how to feel about me
They break our legs to prove a point
But they can't talk Four walls
'Cause I'm so heavily influenced by the things that I watch
I know you're so alone,
'Cause beyond my hopes there are no feelings
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above
Know I meant, every motherfuckin word
How my niggaz feelin' good how my niggaz like it rough
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Lying in bed
All us yellowbellied cankers and book throwing believers
Don't bring your woman to the party 'cause I'll take her
che avevamo noi di sesso e tenerezza
Magic people  voodoo people
And if you cross it
But don't fall in love, 'cause we hate you still
Cause, if you mind your business, then you sure won't be mindin' mine
It's not happening, it can't be happening, it's not happening
I'm just so drunk and miserable
Try to take something from me, motherfucker
Hey look around man everybody's got one
The little boys are breaking bottles
I heard the sound of your bike,
Damp with fog the bog that grows the former business sector
And you don't have to please them, or try hard
Full of one night stands
Just dig a hole and jump right in it,
I need a torchlight
Come on let me shout, shout
No no
Just because of my shriveled little hand
I can beat your crew with instrumentals
Die die die until hell is full
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Oh can't you see she's pretty wild
But it would do no good
Let the wheels spin, Let the room shake, Let the speakers blow
And that ain't what you want to hear
In a battle inside of my soul
I'm surrounded by all these devil mouths they talkin' about kells some say I came from heaven but I rose up from hell and every since I rose up success has been my cell some caller hits my lawyer 'cause they got me out on bail never been a snicth boy never been a bitch boy why I got to hat on you look at me I'm rich boy you need a sten wheel the way you riden my dick boy say yous a go getta go get your own shit boy what it's gone take for you mutherfuckers to understand I'm a r@b boss kells think he a rapper naaw bitch I'm jus tryin' to get my point across niggas hatin' on niggas man y'all no y'all keep up that's why when it comes to these hits I'm gone keep up shit keep risin' to the top keep gettin' that money keep laughin' at you clowns cause you clowns is funny I've been gridin for  years tryin' to keep the piece but now you mutherfuckers done brought out the beast
But if you ask them, they can tell you
They chalk it up to my anger
They're gonna kill, kill your sons
To understand
A knife for the men who've taken the heat off you this time,
In an American grave
All because I lost control
Give me one good reason why in time I should believe in you 
I still smell the perfume in the bed
Oh no, I don't like this plan
Clear your thoughts with Speyside with your brain
Grow up and be a man
But I won't stop now You gonna hate me I'ma hate you too
It's kind of sad to watch you break down
Fuck fuck fuck you
Dead bull with the life from the low
Listen up, it's just not happening
Out of control
Introducing the reverend Hellacious Boom Boom So good of you to come, I call on the priests, the saints, the dancin' girls and the Goddamned reprobates Our decisions must be final, restoration is impossible To the ignorant members of the misguided populace, book ends to nothing Good times on bad times, free us of the modern idiot, cast away the bogey men, detonate your hate bombs Pick your victims But take good care of yourselves Hallelujah
But the solitary refinement of your room spits you back out onto the streets
If, by chance, you come for me
e volevi farmi mettere in manette
Never sorry, never wrong
And win the war with no regrets
Why did ya lie to me
But my enemy, it's your name on my lips as I go to sleep
No one ever tells me so what am I to know
Today, today
How do you smile You are a mystery to me You taught me by moving slow, you do not so quickly proceed Still you're warm and gray, a quilted memory, you market yourself by the faded company you keep And you were already herea shadow on my tongueyeah, you were already here and all alone like me You are a blister from too much sweet, you're an ulcer from too much wine You are dead, I know that you're dead, were you ever really alive
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
As I begin to cut you, screaming out in fear
If you know what's good for you
Shredding him to bits
Bet all you mutherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
We want it back again
I don't want to mention the reason I know
Piercing the darkness of these streets with my electricity
Staring at the sky
Well maybe my mind's deceiving me
What I found was a gutter where the love of entertainment meets the lust for blood and demerits,
Waste another year flies by, waste a night or two
It's not an empty threat you deserve what you get
Sunless days
Screamin' these words, screamin' these words
You could prop up the bar in hell
What are we gonna do tonight
The pride that is instilled cannot be overcome
See you can't stop me 'cause I'm a brainwash teens
They shut the fuck up, kid, get with it
Your sharp intellect
The Devil's mark
And oh, my mind is all, oh, my mind is all
I just stare with my one glass eye hoping you won't be back again
Ready to softly kill my pain
There is no debt here to be collected
Prepare to be told "That shit's gay, dude"
Which only now they're clearing brush from under
Dressing up every day
You should have known that I'd bite back
You showed me things little boys
You're not the best thing that I knew
Like assinate me bitch
See them hunting, creeping, sneaking
Turn around shooting at the monster till his knees are weak
Didn't I learn anything
It's all you ever wanted
So don't front and lie like you were all that in bed
Es wird Zeit, sich von diesem Sprachgebrauch zu lösen
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
I've gotta find a place to hide where I know you won't go
I couldn't find a trace of equality
There's nothing more than this block
Sai che lei non tornerà 
I bleed me
Say goodbye 'cause I don't need
You'll hear so many BoweBoweBowe, you think I'm Riddick
And it's all we have left to live for
Throw that motherfucker, "Well, whatchu gon' do now
Pray to your pagan gods while your twisting all those trees
If not you'll die too
Politics are assassins doctors dig the graves
I need you right now
And I'd have seen Ren fuckin' bitches from Howard
Because of the color of their skin
He got caught in tha chains of his own game
Saying what I wrote, you feel what I feel
You want to be down with the down and in
I'm known to strike like a Hittite
Poetry is no place for a heart that's a whore
From now on, I'll write about flowers and butterflies
You thought I'd always be there
They throw a war like a party saying,
Their backs
I've got you trapped under my claws
Und ich fragte  was ist gefährlicher, rassistische Polizisten oder Saharasand
And once you give the gift away, there's nothing you can do about it
In a failed attempt on blue
Stab ya till you're gushy, so please don't push me
I don't know one thing about my brother's blood
His heart is stone
So we can sing the sorrow
And to the jury carry your turns on my skin this color
Great Britain is fucking dead
Wherever she asks me after she licks it
What a difficult feeling
I'll cauterize myself back together again
From this glass of hate we sip
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through
Here, I do as I please
Vinyl in mono
Swallow them down to my colon
As long as I have life in me
Or involved wit niggas who lost their lives
Nunca quedas mal con nadie x
The sky
I live at the end of a  and  minute hallway
And the midnight sky reflects off my skin
Would not look the way your house looks today
Has risen beyond control
You're all going to wind up out on the street 
But I don't mind 'cause I've got time
Oh, this pressure center, rising
But I ain't saying nothing
Now listen, I'm not introducing you to my mind
A single thought to call your own
Just like I've always done
White motha fuckaz got the ball and chain
I foolishly began to trust, but 
The edge of happiness
And you fall to the earth like a leaf
But it's a different story when them muthafuckas coughin' up blood
I gotta run up your phone bill
'Cause I hate you now
Annie Single my ass
I know you wish you could the way I bang them regardless
I don't want no part
It's all smoke, there's no more fire
Guiding voiceswhere I will find you
I'm not a good friend, I'm not a friend at all
If it made you stay, but you won't, but you won't 
All the things we see
Get back, get away 'cause this could get ugly,
Eminem killed by M and M
You know I just about had my fill
Lay her on the bed
tiver que morrer, na guerra ou no amor,
I'd have made you look fucking beautiful
Wit the thickness that get dis
No matter what you did or who you fucked,
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me
Snuck up around my back
Will we ever do it big, or keep just settling for little shit
And grab hold of one long, sharp tooth
Well I'm feeling great
Sendin' a nigga to the desert to get killed
A blackout 
I need a fix
See the demon whore has eyes
Thousands buried in the ground
You play us out and take us all for fools
Married to the game, Divorce the Cathedral
I'm right here nigga
So we send a lil' money, tell 'em it's all right
I'm havin' problems with excuses
What song reminds you of when
Covered in flags that I can't see them on TV
Now I belong, I'm one of the beautiful ones Starfuckers
Tell me what it takes to keep your trust
Oh you bloody
You need to contact your nearest recruiting office immediately please
Look man, you must be crazy
Of befriendin' each sentence, endin'
Puked up and down in morbid faith
Before you point your finger
So after the showers with Sandusky, me and Sean Kingston went and rented a couple jet skis
You should wreck his life the way that he wrecked yours
Does it feel backwards to be on the losing end
I need someone, I need someone
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
And hearing your voice is like chewing tin foil, oh
Standing in the middle of yesterday
Lined up then slaughtered, nothing to die for
But his hand's on the wheel and my foot's on the pedal
Oh believe me when I beg you
And I wonder if the reasons why you left me were untrue
Go tell him how my wrist is sore from pulling at your insides all night
If I'm the fuckin' man
A working class hero is something to be
Except yourself so let them come and see ya standing naked
You still need me 
And a little crowd gathered to watch you pick yourself up
Chickens and kittens and shit
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a padalock
He's double dealin' with your best friend
You're so perfect to please us You make all the right noise
Would have left these red hills
You see I got other plans
Will you never shout
"That's a word I wouldn't know of
Part III Nobody Likes You
All is wrong if it's not right, take care
Not only was he married, oh no
Isn't that your voice
Another clever trick to keep us all in line
A reason to seek life again"
And see it's always this way
Feelin' a burst of pain
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
And these teeth are decayed
You finally made it
The basis is racist, you know that we must face this
You feel the earth revolving
We all know what's inside
I swear I will never lie to you again, please, just give me one more chance
You're just another one in a long line of fools
When did this storm begin
Behind an angel's disguise
This trouble in mind
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Stompin' around on the ground on the plains
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
What've we done, the outcome is always clear
Walk 'n' cry, walk 'n' cry
And now look at me
Whether I hated their guts
And conquer our fears
Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind
You know it's really funny how the tables turn
You're not the one I thought you'd be
I'd like to try another way
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect Yep, yep
'Cause she came back She claimed love
Still running x
Those kids suck, nah nah not me
On parle de pèz et de monnaie, de femmes de fraises et de honey
My god sits in the back of the limousine
I only play to win
They can stuff their punk credentials
An enormous and cold, universe
Magic without love, magic without love, yeah
You crossed a thin line
When there's blood it's time to buy
You wanna hate me then hate me
And somehow it felt wrong to tell her I wasn't
Tribal death, tribal gore
Me, yeah
La différence en nous et eux c'est  ans 
I'm just another rager with a Dairy Face
Don't want to live with myself
It started with me and ended with you
See, they don't give a fuck about you, like I do
Watch your back
So much to hate
Muthafuckas wanna calm down, put his palm down
You misguided fools
I have never felt such loneliness
Sink through your skin to your blood cells
Day by day, the violence is ingrained
Burn the flag with a fag
Protect her when it's warm
And by the way did you say that you couldn't make a better day
Just say you like to play
Smiling or growling, never sure I just wait and see
This is how it feels Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Monky wrench in my hand, razor cut the eyelids off
Well, can you feel it
The world is a shitty place and I can't wait to die
You're sucked to the very last drop
'Cause there's no one for me
I won't close my eyes,
Takin' short steps one foot at a time and kept my head low
So low Overwhelming, clinging to a tragedy
I don't give a fuck about you and all that bullshit you stressin'
You hold the future of the kid you daughter's gargling
I bleed forever and not a thing you do can comfort me
I want you out, I want you in
You've been eaten up by pride
Closing in, the hands of time
I sleep like Tyler Durden
I'd buy you lemonade right now
She is tempting and promises things that'll never happen of that I'm sure
You know I don't care anymore
Here I go, on my own now
And their swallow tattoos are fucking lame
All this sickness
Wage war all around you
What is cutting like the smoke through your teeth as you are telling me "forget it"
This ideology of sorry
Candy paint impala
A scapegoat for her life
And I can see things I know I really shouldn't see
Yeah, go on and lay your tired bodies down
Followed by millions of dumbfounded dipshits
Nado saraminde joechaekgam eopgesseo
The revisionist's death by her own hand
I can not distance myself
You better tell that girl to step You better tell that girl Oh, oh
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
I didn't want to kill her"
No one wants to listen to all your complaining
Suffer always
If you're not complacent,
Established to condemn
He blew his brains out into the bay
I give it all back to you
Scorn your mind well just feel the blow
And we run out of ice, so I go out to get some
You're not mine
This is my fucking life and I'm living it
Our whole life we've felt the upper hand of the man
Do you care Hell no
I watch you burn in humid hell
You're the loser, I won't dismiss you out of hand
This echoed compassion, it covers your eyes, 
No screams can be heard
'Cause you got off easy in comparisation to the pain that you've put others through
I took the greatest fall, I can't accept her
As I cherish every blessing and I greet you with hugs
I believe that reality's gone
Burn bloodstains from decompressed diamonds
Shot tha landlords who knew it was mine
You shoot the fun, I feel your black hollow consciousness
Und dann fiel mir der Schwarze ein, der in einer Zelle verbrannte,
Drown the truth out 
You know I've really tried
'Cause I was on your shit even when you had the jetta
Au point de hurler nos histoires
By forcing its Herod tongue in
I've got a needless want
In the breaking heart of town
And what you fear the most is what I need
'Scuse me but I don't remember
Broken, bruised, forgotten, sore
Someone to put your shit on
It was in my hand
Always right, a portrait of dignity
He's always there
Line your lungs with noise then just sew it up
And your son's a fuckin' doctor, phat paid
Whoa, black Betty bambalam
She'll only tell me what's wrong
She keeps naggin' at you night and day
Read in depth but you get the surface
But I'm not gonna let you, I'm not gonna let you
Are losing control
Every year the cycle repeats over again
Off of And there ain't no rain clouds
We broke but we rich at heart
You'll never know how to react
Crying in the dark, I'm sorry
Left all alone, left still forgotten
Of the mines of Mozambique
Looking back at yourself 
Cigarette now smoke it up
I'm just damn bored
And don't you know that she's making me see red
Ain't you proud I'm grown now
And I don't want to try
Taxes takin' my whole damn check
With you around me I don't feel it's over now
It holds me together
So sing for the moment tonight
Kato mulla todistus on priimatavaraa,
I love you, honey
So you want to be entertained
You are the fashion of now and the sickening flavor of cool 
And they tell me they love me and the shit ull get better
You wear disgust like a crown
Maybe I'm crazy
Living in the big machine now
The cracks we've made in the temple of want do seem useless
Somebody get the bank cause the berries round about
Fra', perfettamente nel mio habitat
The plague; I murder a show, you don't even know
Those wandering minds
Tension in the air and a strange earthly glow
The walls are falling down
Can I ever fully believe you
Daylights crucified in sleep
Waiting for what I need to change
Accept me as I'm not, and that's a shitfit
It's just a game but no one's playin'
Just stop and take a second
So I chose to live this life alone, without the teeth marks,
Cannot leave
Still standing on the hill
I don't care if you're angry
Who gives a shit and needs your help
Smooth talking, fully automatic weapon concealer
They won't ground me
But it's far from the norm when we perform, check it
Man it's so hard to find a girl who's close to having a mind state like me
Standards and values on the living room screen,
Are screaming your name 
To the punk MC
And now you're a cockroach
Feels like I'm falling, but I tell you I'm not going
But now I deal with all the consequence that troubles our times
I'll turn and laugh a ha ha a ha ha
Seven thousand one hundred islands I been missing
Chase a light that shines and disappears
My world is evil
But I managed to escape the good gendarme
Nigga I just came into the game ready to die
Then smells her perfume in his eyes
To me you're all so fucked
Today, I am dirty
I can't help but feel it's us
Here comes the panzer attack
Well now you know what it feels like not to belongso long
I break it down slowly
In James Dean's head bed
And if I cut myself would you bleed too
U cryin' like a bitch
I started fucking running as soon as my feet touched ground
What a wonderful world
I want to do things to you that you'll never forget
 went up in smoke
I'm here on earth,
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin horse's heads,
You'd been in an attack
For your fatass dirty dollar
I'll wait my turn
When you said you needed me,
Think we all know the answer to that
And when the dawn breaks through the drums start
Yes, my loyalties turned
Every night you drink the money left to pay all the bills
There is no one there
To squeal all day
Peace to all the homeless people livin' in the train station
But that is not the issue at hand,
It's your turn now
Don't these little punks
To hurt some poor c*nt I don't even know, and have never met before in my life
Just a phone call to ease your mind
Oh, he's like milk to you, halfSwedish and halfAsian
And hog tie your runaway bride with cold feet
Did anybody care at all
This didn't turn out the way I thought it would at all
Is the feeling of being in motion again
If I thought that half the shit that bitches said was true
Viewers of the divine rage learn to worship the hard way
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
A man is known by his tools
I can't control myself 
A mother fucker got it bad 'cause I'm loud
He didn't move to the city, the city moved to me
Another wounded memory dies
I'm pretty much fucked
The animals scratch at my skin
Don't ever get too close, 'cause I'm not good up close
When I said I was open minded
I have too much now to fill my day today
Girl in white dress, boy shoot white stuff
This is just another layer
Siehst du nicht, dass ihr Leiden uns besudelt und beschmutzt
"Law of the Penal Contraventions" Last Saturday during
Par contre, ils sont fiers de nous quand on porte une médaille d'or 
Telling what they know
'Cause I found what I needed
A couple months later this shit gets banned
I think are always going to save me 
I'm locked in the throne, whether you like it or not
And never had the ability to ever fucking understand
And your precious little details are stretchin' out my brain
I'm fuckin' dope and this is my reward
Tomorrow is the day, I can't back out
The dreams came in like needy children tugging at my sleeve
Hey yo, this song is for anyone fuck it, just shut up and listen
Nothing's real  I'm disconnected
I hear Mama they got him working on tha Payroll
Tell me to hear about your plans
I heard boar's head killed more than nuclear's warhead
I wanna feel him crawl all over me
Tie this knot between our teeth
Kiss, kiss, let's meet for breakfast 
That's all I wanna hear you say
There's no devil's haircut in my mind
Walking like his head's full of Irish fiddle tunes
My Daddy said "Son your gonna drive me to drinkin"
Mein Herz sprengt mir die Brust
I believe
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
Or a gaddamn star, you can have that shit
As another day's memory dies
Did you want me to break down
Charred remains the way you feel
What a good shot, man
And how do I talk to you without crying
It's the focus that you cannot seem to find 
All I feel, everything I'm not today
 models of fear on the wall timorous
Withold the expression
Reminding me of a time when the old was new
Would you feel it in your heart
Just one for the record
A little cut, no one will tell
So I could learn how to stand up for myself
I don't even know you when I want you dead
I send you back with my raps banging in your stereos
Another little flare up
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
Ask me why you're feeling screwed
And the sky iz black
Scattered across the sky  he trips on clouds
God give life, God taketh it away Not you; I think you are the Devil itself
"I found love on a prison ship" repeating
What was half in me has become whole
Everything is poison that's coming out
You always mad about something
Profit is worshiped smells like stale ghost
The woworld is my punchin' bag and
My god it's the end of the world
A good shot, man
No matter what I say or do
Breathing new life in to the sad witch and she promised me three wishes and all I wish is she should remain here
You wear all the finest clothes go or die say pussy and I say
If you even know the meaning
Live life, mind power
But is your life the one that feels like a ticking clock
Ready or not
Don't be ashamed to slaughter, the centre of humanity is cruelty
And the way that you feel
But it's not a matter of age
Oheeoh goes the Buckingham jewel guard
Play this game with you this game with you, this game with you
Can't shake this blood from these eyes
Just give me stuff to break
Don't drop the beat
Wear my heart upon your lips
Turn out to be all of your best friend's best friends
Poverty is toxic, everybody knows
That drive me wild
The MPC's do not come on tour,
Dare to take on the simple life
Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure too take
Everywhere I go, bitches always know
And the distant noise of some drunken jazz band,
Less talk more head right now, huh
I ran into the fortuneteller, who said beware of lightning that might strike
And not enjoyin' the show made
And it's not my last life at all 
Go fuck yourself you ain't no one to us,
This chance for us to reconcile these doubts
"In Death's bed I have lain
Don't let that bitch take you for a ride like she took me
You got chains on your neck, and the Man's respect
How long have we been sleeping
Said it twice lil bitch
'Cause everybody needs some company
Limped up like a dog with three legs shut up to the stage
But everybody likes you better by far
RobertEcomelately hayseed wannabe undercover Yankee
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
They say I'm a misfit but I say I'm not,
See all I know is that my girlfriend used to date you
And then watch her die
I'm just responsible for giving my investors some return"
Burnin it at both ends, friends let's commiserate
Fuck knowin' these broads names, extravengant champagne
Your people warned me we would never get along,
But I'll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside for an afterlife that isn't even guaranteed
If you wreck my day
I know life feels like a struggle some times
You're the painting
In the desert of my mind
Nine years more, if we're lucky now
Looking for the love of my life
How many times will the culprit kill 
You breathe life when you break the walls down
When a vicious creature took the jump from Monkey to Man
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me
In every circle of friends there's a whore
This boy's taking the easy way out
And I covered my eyes when she told me the news 
Waiting for the number that clicks on the wall
You're dead to me punk ass fuck
Just educate myself and pretend all I've learned's untrue
Cash for fear
The tyrant must fall
You'll still be fucking beautiful
That being handed a commander, it's almost romantic
We've begun inoculating troops and first responders against ballistic airports
I'm not sure who's fooling who here
nunca quedas mal con nadie
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
Her to eternity
Cock back and blast off written on the tombstone, ain't that a bitch
Sometimes I think I need a vacation
He laid down on it in a drunken stupor
In your pain you blame me
'Cause that would be telling a lie
Exaggerations still not true
Round your own world We are weeping tears
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
You wanted in, and now you're here
Yeah well I dreamed that the world was crumbling down
Put my son on my back and I maneuver through the obstacles
I choke back a laugh
We burn up kings
Flown to another country where
But city slums mute our drums and our drums become humdrums
'Cause three years in a row, I felt like the world was mine
You close your eyes and said "I'm feeling torn"
You taught me how to hate you
Follow dirt that is gonna let the God occur
And baby it's you I need,
That crossed the floor
Save me from my hell
Stomp box voice of fear
"Oh, speak now, precious
What, you want something like a cake Want a Guinness or somethin'
No one serves coffee, no one wakes up
And it's for life until my final mic check is cashed
I thought it through and my worst brings out the best in you
I'ma creep up behind ya my nigga
Get your broken nose
When all the cards start to fall in the ditch
Or on my knees
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
That appeals to people listening to this cd
What I want, what will I need
Rushing through my veins 
But who the fuck are You, You never showed the proof
Always the idiot
In other words, please be true,
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
I smash the glass into my face
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod
As I cross the Macon county line,
You'll get it back today
Beat up, whip it Topped with a little scream
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
My hated fiends
This shit will fuck you up
That have always plagued the good people"
Well I don't want shit and I don't need nothing
Eternity is not sunrise
If I should believe
So long fightin the bullshit for so many years
Never break down,
I'm gonna break his legs off
Like an insect staring back, like a dying dove
But if it works for you, it works
The bleeding hearts would got to be turned into some
See I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
'Cause I never tell
Does is scare you boy, that we don't need you
The days were atleast twice as long
Right outta my life
But here the sun will always shine It'll always shine
Because nobody gave a fuck
How's it feel to to know that god can't stand me
Do you sleep do you count sheep anymore
Till all her pastel chalk lines of fact are erased like a schoolgirl's slate
No one in this fair new world can talk us through this situation
And you medicate intravenously
It's over man
So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around
You get up and sleep
Can't fix my problem
I'm sick
Of the ones who know
I was there when you took all the people
Don't lie
I need a hit
Why don't you tell me somethin'
Sugar star comes down to talk to 
I gotta say, I hate people I'm so sick of them
And you wanna take a shot, no doubt
No, it doesn't really matter anymore
Dark sound, straight road
Push pause on the game and get to know each other by our real names
Loaded on vice and disease
Give me give me what it takes give me this love to make me feel it's real yeah
Hot ice, cold cash
I admire all the games
Dance of darkness beats
So sing for the moment, 
I'm not afraid of standing still
On your leg, and in the form of religion on your brain
Tangerine turning green 
You don't argue with that bitch, all you do is fuck that bitch
My eyes are growing weary
One by one by the gun
We must not destroy the safeguards
I've got to burn
Slit wrists talk shit
You into thinking you're the one
I was sick, I was broken
If you hear this song a hundred times it still won't be enough
I want courage I want to stand alone
I hate you too
Last stand on an ocean of sweat
Holding it back
Impossible to understand
You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
No rights and no one ever tells
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
She cost you your life
We would have had a lot to talk about
Oh shame on me
Get me out of this hell
Ha, you thought you could feed on my soul
Your face, your lips, your hips, your eyes, they meet, you're not hungry though
Martyr for god
I'm becoming less defined as days go by
Pray to god I can think of a nice thing to say
'Cause we know what they are
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you
Don't smile I'm not your clown I can see all the signs
You're not worried about what I'm doing too
You said goodbye and I just don't want you regretting that
When it might have changed things
I know I want out, but I can't
What happens to the brains
Tell 'em they can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
What a cunt this world
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow
What are you waiting for 
Nobody is against me, I'm my worst enemy
They smoked cigars and rolled their eye's at him behind their specs
Was asleep in his car
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
Have you turned yourself from thee
Carne e cannoni e Dio
I said I'd not come back, well I'm coming back
Don't lose me now, let me help you out
When that face isn't here and you rot underground
'Cause the breath of the death
I'm looking for love in the wine
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy
Put your faith and trust in the dusk
Won't be caught up in your game
Doch diese Wahrheit führt uns ans Licht
Lo I turned my neck toward home
Sicwidit records is very greedy
Eminem
You've only spent a second of your life
I don't care for "Have a nice day", the American way or the man on the moon
No rest, no rest, no rest, no fucking arrests
We don't know if we should be
So please let the cleaning begin with evolution
For going in unchained
Just about to fall down
Mach  velocity
I want you to
The valley is crying
Next time I'll keep my hands to myself instead
You'll work all damn day, but you will never see a check
Tell me what it's like when you've had enough
Eat your heart
'Cause I'd walk through miles of makeshift mud
He's in his own world and he's daydreaming
It's not far at all
A trail of tears upon your face
Chrome in our fingertips
Oh, you know how to take a spine and snap it
Oh look, they're losing all of their trust
"You know, you look really pretty without handcuffs on
We go blind when we've needed to see
The one I love to hate
Just wanna lie here next to you
You don't need no medicine 'cause I'm gonna take your life
I wanna rip her head off
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying
Speak every single language on the planet, kna'mean
Savor every flavor you got, 'cause it's not your own
I didn't know where to shake my butt
The empty bodies stand at rest
To push fake morals, insult and stare
And you'll see me return
We americans is cowboys
And they will never know were gone
Don't you think that it's a little bit too late
At the crossroads with the deal he made
To some thirdworld country 'cross the sea
Into the night we pass
For tonight, tonight is for us
Ale to wyzwanie jest jak podróż w nieznane,
This hits like fists bomb with the left and don't miss
Take my car and paint it black
Saying "Take me to the Folies Bergere and please don't spare the hearses"
Okay, okay, okay I'm gonna kill it
I saw you kissing that girl last week
Now I've smartened up I'm turning my back
The flesh we love the most
The soul incased in prison
Speak till dawn of violence
No one around him to stem the rising tide
Your only crime is you're an easy target
You anger makes me mad though you can't tell
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Fuck the kids
You've got a lot of nerve to come back
Those evilangelists
Please~ I stay professional in all my endeavors
You can't deny me of my needs
Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
They say it's not what ya know but who ya know
In the neighbor's backyard
Well it all dies anyway
Now I'm choking on the memories
What's wrong you're always crying lately
Don't ask questions, I'm not open to suggestions
I dry my eyes now receive my heart
Save me from the wreck I'm about to drown in
When the passenger seat in your car's been moved
How could this be a part of any greater plan
Had you speakin' the manual alphabet
Your God is looking down on me
I learned how to sustain myself in storms
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass
A knife in my back
In black hair dye
What if god ain't looking down
She wants to fuck that boy so badly 
Just mark me down as an angry man
He drove to the desert, fired his rifle in the sky
Yeah, I wouldn't give a fuck who it ices
She wants to know, wants to know where I've been
Rollin' off your lips, tensing up your shoulders
I'll never lie to you again
You need someone old enough to know better
Just mind your own business
You can't come and tell me that you're free from sin
I point my finger, take the blame
If you wack and no one's confronted you on your bullshit, then I will
Fresh blood through tired skin
It all breaks down
That don't tell her a fucking thing
You bring it down and ruin it please
And skee ball tickets still on count, it's real money
I met a man who was gone in a day
And cut me up like a knifeknife
It's always the fallen ones  
I am telling you I'm different than you
Felt she had a hook in her head
Darling, your face is radiant 
You say you're free I say you're mine, boy
So while you drunks look for a hook and say you masturbate
Merge on the networks, slagin' nerve gas
And we're really sorry for all the mistakes we made
From a real world once our own
Best flow I bet the whole US know
I don't believe in books
Dre, just let it run
When I look into your eyes
Can you feel this inside
You wouldn't believe in my new belle she flits and weaves a curious spell,
Round here, we talk just like lions
Turn the lights back on
You can burn my house
Yeah, the collapse you'd cause could pull us down with claws that don't let go
Claiming he can handle my mic mastery
BLOOD blood BY by SUN sun LIGHT light
She had nothing but time on her hands
And working against one another
I guess that's just your style to you it ain't no big deal
I know you will complete this work started in me
But don't you know I'm trying to quit
Die Spache verroht wie die Menschen und ich sah es
Where's the drugs We know you got some drugs 
And all the while I know you know it
Feels so wrong and feels so right 
And work out the reasons before you die
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
I didn't do it for tha payroll
I'm like a mad dog
Disturbed, I'll grab her by her beak
To ever single seat I smack flames
'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground
He'd rather not get his hands dirty
The white boy's scheming night and day, night and day
Laughing as their blood runs out
Make sure your fuckin' feelings end up up in a Glad bag
With a killer's pride, security
A plan that's right
Makes part of me slowly die
And in the meantime take an indigenous culture and rob it
You brought me to my knees
We break our enemies with fear
I won't stop smiling for my treasure 
She made it where the spot ain't hot
Past the flags of freedom flyin'
Reverend Sir, I don't want to seem irreverent, my teenage angst is far behind me But Father, certainly it's troubling to see all these people kneeling instead of dealing with the fact that we're all we have So rise up, rise up, there's no one to worship  but plenty of life to lose I'm not saying, "Let's burn down the churches" but do you want to hear my confession It's my greatest sin here it is
In pieces as I took the fall
And now you having hot flashes
The way my four pound turn your stomach to spaghetti
And all the swine at the cabaret lick their lips as they clap along
You fill my whole life with misery,
That's the admiral his taking in his cock
There's a girl running around my head
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
Kissed by a star, kissed by a star
I made my own wounds
We chin check niggas, them thin check niggas
You faggots got me cussing
There's a darkness
Your dad, your dad, your dad
Woman  Shenedoah, Shenendoah
Everyone that I meet, I wanna stab in the ear
The rotted love that twists the fates seem
Despite the traitorous label, makes you nervous as a kid
Here's a message from
holt man sich immer wieder gerne Rat
But you can't keep me captive on your wall, I'm still in my twenties
I perfectly understand
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Everything you swore would never change is different now
J'attends toujours le bus qui me mènera vers d'autres images et
I'm afraid of losing you
We brag on having bread, but none of us are bakers
Ecstasy is all you need
Once, once is real early but twice came back
It's turning into a year now
Running for my life
I hope it ends before you know me
If you don't stop after they call ya
 That's right, senior And that's good 'Cause you, by rights, would have every reason to forget some things "Change must come through the barrel of gun," said Mao Tse Tung This place would be a paradise tomorrow if every department had a supervisor with a submachine gun
Walking on fire, hate to deceive
One great big festering neon distraction
A rat done bit my sister nell
Oh, these rhythms of mine
I try but I can't remember
"Well I've got no time for victims and I don't think it was all that bad
'N speaking of the devil
I met a black man who became a police officer
Steal a kiss, yeah, and call us friends
When the needles go through,
This is a blood path
Now peep the way we coming in we picking shit back up
Go tell sis I'm out the door
Are your eyes playing tricks
After all, it's me and the king and the beast
I keep on pleasing them
Young enough to take it on
Terrible lie
Disrespect our sisters
When we ride on our enemies
You gun 'em all down, even the father
But I feel I'm only being civilcivil
Well it's the loneliest place to go;
I doubt if you can show me somethin' I ain't seen before
Oh, If he'd just shut off his conscience for one day
A king's horse for what's been broken
They wrote you off and left you behind
Until you feel your lies
Fuck that shit 'cause I ain't the one
Turn it on, turn it on
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
Snort it
Drowning in this petty world
It's the drugs 
Won't you let her taste herself
Its gettin' bigger now the information runnin' the globe
You're gonna make me flip this switch, I'm gonna make you my bitch
I see them seething between her fingers
Teach me a lesson that I understand
Four point restraint and my hyper cube on medicines
God knows I know I've thrown away those graces
Don't give me your nothin', just let me be
Johnny runs
Wait for death
If I were a man I'd have a gun, But I'm so bone tired
Like calendars dying at new year's eve parties
Yeah I'm an asshole yeah yeah
I'm drift drift drift drifting yeah
Know one knows what I've done
They cannot stop me
Italicised lies, headlines, bold type
I feel like I'm God
I hear them all say that I got heart
The price to you for this is nothing will ever be the same
Life was home on the dangerous
Solid gold
I step in hog heaven, stoney with no weapons, pissing on teleprompters, selling megaphones to hecklers,
And you trust me completely
You keep talking
Is just a front and I still want you like I did back then
There's a lot of people saying
Face flat along the edge of the grass
That I got suck at
People just pretending, that's a let down
If you hate me
Who the fuck who the fuck
Crying, missing me
Profit off a death
Diagnose the symptom
No nothing no one no more
"I don't want to feel a thing"
Meantime she settin the nigga up
Don't need your dick to fuck
Useless to run
I'm not a carbon copy so police think they have the authority
Give us brilliant boys we wanna fuck, man
Don't want to love it, don't want to feel it,
I don't care what you think of me now
I'm breaking at the seams of life, but I'm holding on
Je passe à table les jours de rable
Eventually I'll cheat on every man I meet
You taught me how to hate and how to hurt
I hope that you're back up 'cause I know you've been down
Yeah, when I'm gone the weight falls on me
And I died
Asleep in her hotel
And you just can't help but question
Everyday is Saturday so baby hit the snooze button, let's sleep in
But when you say, "Let's buck for revolution"
Or is that someone at your door
I could within all my power
I'll rub till it bleeds
A gift from god doing the devil's crimes
Don't leave me no space in your little boat
You couldn't pay me enough, you couldn't pay me enough
She's the first to kiss me without crying
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
If you ain't got heart you ain't got shit at all
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
Sure as the rain will fall
Every now and then I cower and I need to find empowerment
Collar pop jolly roger, die motherfucker die,
Can't break the chains that have kept you under
I get down on my knees and pray
I don't want to
And this is what you all been waiting for
Okay, okay, okay I fuckin' get it
Didn't take you long boy to stop from being a friend
And sterilize the sickness
Shot out to the curb with no place to go
And now the Feds growin' shark fins
To any motherfucker disgruntled exit wound, look like a funnel
A piece of my heart
Hendrix e Morrison senza LSD, prova
You're not the same
Things sound good right now
The more we see and learn
When I'm in one of those moods I can give a fuck
I need a getaway car
Come around come around no more
She crawls on webs of lies
On every door I already knocked
Or I'll burn you to that cross
To bring their shit into light
One hoped they'd break the patent when they die cast me in stride
Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of
A woman tried to start a fight with me
But silence is a crime when someone needs your help,
The single sista lynch, the cell doors crash
Show me a future that I can enjoy
All our aircraft on the ground, we might face another and infinitely more costly Pearl Harbor
Sit there silent, folded arms
We kick them doors down when nobody would let us in
Of conversation for the day 
Well when I called her evil
The subject right now is what's wrong
I want you to throw me away
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I wanna see you when you bleed
For handmedown albums and guitar with no strings
Shaping the human condition
You get no respect
And emcees have left materialism behind them
I watched the world pull you away
Oh anger
I understand you
Your world has been built to crumble
But white paranoia is here to stay
Buried underneath, hands slip off the wheel
Then I'll let you die
So don't you dare mess with my Mean Machine
But you wanna justify
No I cannot be that one
'Cause all I do, is mess you up and lie to you
And you should be killed
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
You can show me things I've never seen
Town hasn't moved but it's getting closer, losing ground
Friday after Friday
So catch me as I fall 
And tell me do you laugh yourself to sleep
How will you sink your ghost in a man
But tonight I clearly recall every little bit
Everything is fucked
E non cambia ora con la major
Just so you know
You don't have to put up with this nonono baby
And the way I make you feel
Would I, like the voices, rise and fall
I want to rape and kill you
Neon black whip, war gang hiss;
Here I go, an angry brother finna make his move P Dog
I hate the fact that I have to believe
Venomed body of thought
There is no romantic ideal involved
And regain control
I can't believe, this whole world twisted me
Hey God There's nothing left for me to hide
We fightin here for you
And I don't need such sympathy,
I wash my hands of you
Sunrise, wrong side of another day
An understanding
What the hell's your name
You little fuck
Man everything is �what if why is it always �what if
Empowerment is paramount to how I can begin to mount
The clock is laughing in my face
Same shit you was fuckin' wit way back then
Roses in the hospital
No more, nno more
Don't play that awful song", she said
Play my position I kinda dip it when I always kick it
She said, "You get too drunk, you get too high
Nigel is happy in his work 
Fuck you for making me waste my time
Consider this a distant early warning
I, I wanna love you
The crystal
I lie just to be real and I'd die just to feel
But maybe I'm a good man, wait and let it happen
No time to ask, could the motherfucker really survive
I shout like I'm trying to get heard on the island
For awhile I was cleaner than now
Wild, wild
We need ten years on rewind so we can return
You made it easy to decide there's no way that I could never be your wife
And we're playing nd fiddle
Okay, I'm taking my clothes off, are you ready
Oh, my mind is all made up so I'll have to sleep in it
But the signs I know
Tell me what you want, sister
Giving a thumbs up or thumbs down to incoming and outgoing trends and styles of music and art
That it's still worth it's weight in gold
Oh my god, I'm not supposed to say this,
Stands guard over stifled screams
And there's no more use
British adults expect a nuclear war in our lifetime
To make amends for all of me, and the fire will stop
My bleeding is for you, so that I'm dead
Let us unite on our own and not because of bobbedwired death
Come up out of these heels Oh no
I had a knife in my back
Doch konnt' er nicht von ihnen lassen 
I pushed down the pain
And let the rest remain 
Wash away the dirty things
I don't care for ignorance, indifference or tolerance
Semiautomatic hate machine 
'Cause there is no design for life
To sign my name with blood
I'm not looking to stand up real high
Down at the roller rink
rivuoi indietro
Gettin' madd opposition hip to the game
Outer world
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
Won't need no sunshine
It's long and slick and olive green
Niggas said hip hop was dead but I awoken the spirit
 Real life
'Cause it drives me wild
Once I get down there'll be no breathin', it seems when
You've got that look again in your eyes
We know who's ahead of the game
And rock and roll is what I'm born to be 
Because the beating won't stop
*SNIFFS* I smell smoke and somethin' sizzlin
Always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
I'm a prove that I'm the man in the kitchen mama
One day I'll see you
No more shit
Combine the throb within my head
I will not let you in
Let me make sure I'm crystal clear on this issue, okay Heavy metal fans are buying heavy metal records, taking the records home, listening to the records, and then blowing their heads off with shotguns Where's the problem That's an unemployment solution right there, folks It's called natural selection It's the bottom of the fuckin' food chain, okay I say we put more messages on the records "Kill the band, kill your parents, then yourself, okay Make sure you get your whole head in front of the shotgun Thank you for calling Thank you for calling"
Until your mind gets locked in
We are the underground
Shows the changes, and I hate them all
I'll waylay your daughter and kidnap your wife
And everybody else
Every limb is empty, robbed of pleasant memories
And I don't know what to do
Souls come so cheap some people give theirs away
And the radio on
I hate her
You stole all the covers and fucked up my head
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
You're going out with friends now somewhere
How is it that the only ones responsible for making this mess
New York's coming an' New York talks
To a bunch of fucking fags that can't potentially harm me
It's upside down my frown
The blood is not on your hands
Now all the evil thoughts I had
I'll see you on the street, dog, we gonna handle it
Slow dance alone with no one to the sound of four hands clapping
How many crimes can I try spotting dry before it leaves a stain
When it falls through
I do not catch the spark
You say one thing, do another
And get the feeling of the peeling from the other side P Dog
Oh no, I know a dirty word
Open your minds
Qu'avonsnous, qu'avonsnous fait
All your tears 
For me to cry out in my own defense
Drop dead right where I stand
We always loved the sad, sad songs
Black and I rap with a little bit of swag and happen to have a little money in the back
You best remember, you're twice my age
To change the whole fucking world
I've gotta hear it tonight
Wait Yeah wait for me
I found you alive, but the ghost is helpless inside, 
I'm surrounded by fucking idiots
Sick Girl want to cry
It's morning in Philly it's morning in Philly
And someday you're gonna see
Through arguing over who feels it more
It's 'cause he loves this ass"
Damn, would you like to take the fall
It's the same shit  different day
All my scales For your own selfish wants and needs
Tell me again your fuckless excuses
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me
Induction, destruction, who wants to die
You never had a heart of your own
I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk
We will fight for the rights of our children
Should I pray for all the hate to go away
All's well that ends well
If I did my tricks with smoke and mirrors
Well the name is Crass, not Clash
I come back, open the door
I only want what I deserve so who are you tryin' to kid
It never ends, never ends, never ends 
They will climb a tree and wait
To feel the pain
Decided you'd rewrite the law
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
They love my darkness,
I erase the lines that you mend, "I've done it before", I said, "I'll do it again"
Choke, choke, I choke you
CHRISTjah flesh; CHRISTlight within; CHRISTBeginning and the end
Comes directly from God so there ain't no holdin' me down"
So many dark arts to choose
Nuuh not stopping now,
Go to sleep Go to sleep my child
Coming back from the edge of town
And a bolt of electricity
Buy a saint to clean up your mess
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
I'm almost sorry that I must do this to get my name in lights
When it's hard I break the ice 
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read
I feel you baby
Like needle pulling thread
I got a bad feeling about this,
Kill that motherfucker
Waking in the sleep of reason
I'm not writing my goodbyes
I love myself today x
Like the man said its just a shot away
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
Sitting in my transport as we slip through traffic veins
We're starving and dying from our disease
E mi hanno sempre fatto credere che
Where your homies at They'll get fucked up too
'Cause you don't fucking listen when I'm around
Wideeyed and redfaces, my skin hot and flushed
I don't owe you shit
Don't you know it starts with you and that it starts with me
But now I'm stronger than yesterday
To explain that today
I'm talkin' about that shit you never tell your grandkids about, you know
Denn ich ahnte die Gefahr sie war da sie war nah
Man, it's funny that you scare me so, just enough to fuck me up again and again
If you let it instead get affected by your habitat
You're just another exile X
Then fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Wanting only to seek the very gentlest of streets where
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Messin wit them silly hoes Silly hoes
I don't know who sold you that but it's a fake
You tell him that I couldn't sit still
This is me in his room X
Will you forgive mine
If you do why the fuck are you looking at me
There's no sense in running from nothing
You see all the blood, yeah your boy was just here
Hell's no
I'm not spoken for, I'm ready to talk
Was all she ever wanted
In the shadows where the heads hang low 
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe
But we just left a lot of people upset
Four walls, Three walls,
Once in a life
Another day in life
An Hysteric at the top
But no one cared
What more could I need
Where was God when I lost my mind
Thoughtless trust into the lies,
I hate you all more than you will ever know
I know you love the way I come and I scorch this
Yeah, I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
Mary had a little lamb, her face was white as snow
And I put it back in
To a day that's never dawning
As weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine
War can't give life, it can only take it away
You'll never really ever get enough and you broke my heart But I'm weakest when I am up and you have always owned the weakest part of me And you've too many reasons you want to know my disease, huh Well that's just the nature of fools that is the prize for the rules get me to report, but never recognize
And my eyes more red than the devil is
When you fall down
Just turn around and walk away
They got no path that I can't see
Oh, tell me how you feel
I spit negative just like a halogen
Pretentious judgmental assholes everywhere
I was hoping that you'd know better
Sellin' tapes out of a trunk, to movin' this far up
My hand
I see your not hip to what's happenin'
But it'll kill you first
You never know where you'll end up
I'm gonna rip his head off
Gotcha feeling like you're some kind of slug 
Sitting on a fence is a man who sees no sense in fighting
Curse, for in their words tell them that you fucking heard
And she's a fool
 in the ', now watch the Chevy scrape
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Flushing our faces into the world
I can hear him now
With a note in his hand that read,
You had your chance now let me show you the way around
Make you lick my injuries,
Make me drop down on my knees
No, oh no No thanks, just point us to the highway
Maybe you just can't tell, I'm not under your spell no more
You're a neck and I'm Dracula
And I'll tell you something else I don't get, okay This whole thing these bands going backwards, you know what I'm talking about This whole nostalgia for the late 's, the early 's that's happening right now The Black Crowes wearing bell bottoms again I DON'T FUCKING THINK SO, okay I wore 'em once, they sucked, they didn't get laid, I'm not wearing them again
She wore out the feeling
They throw you pig lips and chicken gizzards Then you make a stew
You'd better start removing the lines of deceit from your face
Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
And lose those pounds and learn about football 
Good and bad that's passed
As above so below, now be careful
Draining your body for energy
Hey, we want a Universal healthcare deal
I think we're getting back tonight
Hello, hello, hello
You can hate me now C'mon
Sometimes I can't describe the wicked shit I feel in my heart
When my boot stuck in that ass like a dildo
Stab stab stab
I can tell it by the way you run away,
Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
It's only that my frown
I'm not a fool to hurt myself
HOPE Maketh not ashamed Everybody listen got to tell you something
I'm judged by my wild image a lot
She's wearing an orange jumpsuit and holding a picket sign
I'll see you cry
Mollasseo nan dokhae
I can hardly wait
Fill till this feels like hot gossip
I can see the truth in you even I know that you're lying
Keep it, don't want it Think I'll just go away
When there's nothing left,
Now whose is that in the body
This what you want this is what you want
Blare some of this blacklight
What would you, oh, go wild for
In another life
My body grows up 
Like an angry dream I was stranded
Deductively speaking, the polar of progress
 I said, "no"
He'll end up killin' these cowards, and I'm not feelin' these cowards
Mom is getting jealous I see my manager more
One thousand mothers are praying for it
Makes you cry, while the milk still spills 
Don't you understand
Fuck it I'm living my life on the edge
Lately I've been fuckin' pissed off why
Sir Jinx grew a little bit taller
When I needed my mother and I called her
We are You, and You're us, stop playing games
Working for shit another eight hours gone
Everybody here is free
That's getting married has a curse and it's made up inside of him
By saying less today, I will gain more, gain more
Some specials and rat food
Someday that bitch is gonna make me crack
Craning your neck at the car wreck
Get you back in my arms
And remember your place
Playa way, get your ma's cake, and kiss you
Poor kids just 'cause they were poor kids
You'll end up with no one to talk to
I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
I'm so fuckin' mad that I got a slug for you
"I'm not Jesus, you can't run away"
What do we have here, oh yeah, no way
The club is all their law, stand up now
Well I've got a bad feeling about this when it comes to this
And you'll be my family, my brother, my friend
There's a room of sweat
My leader came to see me in a hospital bed
A girl may lie to a suit and tie
I like take my time and it just doesn't work out the way I wanted to
I wanna see em
I'm not your s*** box
No matter what I do no matter what I say
Hannat seuchyeogan manheun saramdeul jungeseo
We're heading for Mars
Nobody knows it and nobody can see
And that's what you can't understand
How they love you now
Thunder bloody bloody thunder
Who are you pretending to be
When I feel more than a little strange
Look at you, you know it's true
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a motherfucking thing
But don't speak, don't say nothing
You won't believe me now
So it's my fault
You know another way
No matter how much you yell at me
We could of  hey, where you going Get back here
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel the pain
I'll do it all with my hands 
Take your mother's warning, Roman
Got a halfArmenian girlfriend
You've been touched by the doubt of man 
One hell beast shot over me
And now I realize that you never heard
Of cemetery things
Into a Grammy winning schizophrenic fucking orphan
Some people accuse some people of crimes
And you should've left the light on
Ils nettoient la bavure et l'affaire est classée 
Coast into the quotient provoking the local pistol pete, choking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens, smokey little pile of bloody pulp and codependencies
I'd probably do the same in your shoes
The only shit they wanna see is that doggy tag
As nation die we slowly move towards our doom
Your sweet surrender 
Tease you, please you, till I'm underneath you
But sometimes I wish the world would stop
A ' coupe is all I need
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
Fuck the police, break the law
How can I help you Yeah I need to make a withdrawal
This melody kills me
She doesn't ask me where we going, only holds my hand and gaze
You're so pretty when you lie
And when the night breaks through they wonder
Into the dark is where you want to watch me bleed
Und die ganze Welt geschockt
I can feel your body
Can't keep my mouth shut
Shake your wings Like they're painted with tar
The world is all coming
And it feels like that the only way
You can't respect me 'cause I've done so much for you"
Tell me it's killing time
I'll turn you into one and
I'm a very busy man
I can pretend to be so sad or funny
It doesn't mean shit
No visitors for you when you're in hell
Double park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy clarks,
And I wonder if you still think Bono writes his songs for you
Collapsed lung only help to breath diseased atmosphere
Ah yeah, stay alive all things will change around
Will I have to tell you
I know what's real 
Your enemies and all your demons
You ain't got no money you just ain't no good
How the fuck could you do this to me
Don't deny the fact that you're a mortal man
These fools want to rock but their rhymes are pathetic
Ah, the sands and hands of time have run out
Big guns are pointed at you
Make a stand, make a stand, make a stand
Or the warmth of the land it's strange to us
Well, I don't mind dying but
"We've got every rerun of Muhammad Ali"
There is no death there's only eternity
Where the roof at We'll stomp that bitch through
Lick my legs of desire
Down by the trucks on Christopher Street
Oh man, I said I'm under the gun, round here
Are now lost with in ourselves
Black and on the ground
All waiting to encamp
I'm living in a teenage human mediocrity
Towers people build up in life
Than reading poems to a horse 
'Cause I'll be damned if you flex on me
Of making it clear that
Here's your answer
And I'll go have breakfast with my good friends yeah, yeah, yeah
You know it's all you want
I just can't believe this happened
I came straight up out the gutta I was saved from hell
But this one holds you prisoner
And I wake up in the darkness and i
Fortyfive calibre killer, but out of the philla�della�rella
It's written all over your face
III am a poet who composes what the world proses
Said, "Don't you move a muscle, kid,
How they infect your world
Why is it so surprising, no on'es compromising
It was more than we could face, hey hey
I love to hate you,
You know it's only the beginning 
Snoop Dogg Why the fuck not
Please don't drop the beat
Back once more at the point of no return
Some feel that life's a favour
I wanna leave you all by yourself
For exposing that the earth was not at the center of the universe
Into the cold wave of a note
Is this how you get what you want
insieme ai muri crollano
I am voiceless in my angst
Multiple senareos, playin' wit' your mind
You are not unique
Your mind stops from nine of my divine shots
None can match my scalpel skill
We want to know how things could get so fucked up
On parle de pèz et de monnaie de femmes de fraise et de honey
I'm tired of asking
Turned into a ball and chain, oh
Sometimes I feel like just giving it all up
Circular Nature of Social Evolution They will never win the war
Now I'm just cold inside
Did I mention I appreciate the way you treat your guestsguess not
I'm not the girl that stopped and stared
They want us to go to they schools and be fucking miserable at they fucking college, studying that bullshit, fuck that
They went and taught themselves to die
I rise and pour my heart out tonight
At the mouth, toilet talking, pea soup
I look for signs that are permanent
That all we had would be all for not
I never wanna see your pretty face again
Some day you shall flee
You wanna get stoned
We don't need you,
Before I didn't give a damn 'bout what they say
Air rings through and through stagnant rooms
We know you did it 
He unsays the words, He said, "What you What the fuck"
To give me some reason to move
I ask 'cause I'm not sure
For Teresa is a waitress though she's now known as Juanita
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Bought what I wanted, and they said "buy more"
The idea of a happy ending
Checking my alarm clock
Do you know that I exist for you alone You alone
She's so rock steady bambalam
I got the stellar tights
This solemn piece of a guilty net it grows, so cold
I want my baby
Ever we want to
Sound, I'm a dead neck
What kind of love from a nigga every night make you cry
Let me do what Nas did and tell this shit in reverse
As I plan my great escape
High and noon  times
I can get lucky playing some shows, I'm a bitch
And this is war 
Popping shots through the sun roof screaming "fuck you"
The damn thing gone wild bambalam
But it doesn't fucking matter I'm playing a losing game
Battle cry just trying to seek the satisfaction of the captain
And through the walls you hear the city groan
We can't wait for the day that you're never around
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
Hand the children death and pretend that its exciting
A synergistically greater plan
It tears you apart, it tears me apart
When you get your hands on it, wanna fawn it
They want to take away the little they call something
If I tell you what you want to hear
I'm not Mr Friendly, I can be a prick
See I get betta with time like a watch
When I get what I want then I never want it again
You don't plan for intruders beforehand
Do what the fuck makes you happy, cause at the end, who's there
Lil bitch
I'm feeling bored
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time yeah, yeah
It's our world, please believe
My mom, she died and never wrote
And I've done nothing but lead you on," she said
So lets watch everybody bleed
Spill over the wall
Until we give up the ghost
I beat a woman with varicose veins
Do I lie alone and keeps my cold hands off it
And if I can't afford her, my veins begin to ache
Buy me a drink I've got some craziness to kill
Her face and arms began to swell
Oh no, I've started a war
I believe I'm fixing to die
You're not rid of me, you're not rid of me,
Let them split their tongues to lie with both ends
The plotted lines the faulty map
And it makes me so angry
All lost and summoning the face of their fathers
Everybody says he's mad
When there's innocents  there is guilt
The lick of carnivorous winds
It's not over till it starts again
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
Your world is an ashtray
What a habit when I needed you
Send it off to me
Suffer Fucking suffer Suffer, like me
Oh, suck
Tell me go back home
It's gone on way TOO long now
We burn  we burn at both ends
What's real, everybody who knows they're out of place
Oh, you thought it was over
Scorrendo i messaggi 
No, naw man, that's actually not on my mind, naw, it's different this time
It takes to put a girl like this back together again
Carry the load in the city life
Got a head cold, got a chest cold
Shine my shoes, ain't got the time
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
Everybody's got a little someone to trust but me
Where no one notices the contrast of white on white
Well I've been holdin' on tonight
But from my head to my toes, it's like I'm in heaven, heaven
Always, always darkest before the dawn
There's no kind like me
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool,
A bitter taste
Flesh for food and blood for wine
Safe in these halls discreetly
Are ya waiting for the reaper to arrive
There's something left in me
How I wiped my eyes
Taking lives in their hands, stringing all the losers up
Now go on and stake your claim to this ground
I'm fucking crazy, need slavery to be alien gravy
Doctors arrested for euthanasia 
Shut up and swallow my pride for me, go
I don't want to fade away 
But it's the genie at the bottom who I'm sucking at
non mi resterebbe altro
I seen the same nigga with the  die with his eyes open
It'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from  stories up
Change from Monday
Walk 'n' cry, I walk 'n' cry
Doesn't surprise me now
We see all but do nothing, in the hole of "How it is"
Ill mind
Die Taylor, die, you ain't no friend of mine
And when I come through you know I'm blowing the top off
Check the new style that Ollie found
Do you want to see your life pass by
My shaking hands are in the skin
Somehow I don't trust you
I take your life, I am defeating
I'm not your property as from today, baby
Yeah, let's fuck with their hearts
Another statistic, a body in a drawer
Touch down new ground stop living on the moon
All the things you've done coming back to you
This is not what I want this is not what I need,
We're in tight playing seven one night stands
You better know the house rules to finish in this life
One day we'll get the picture and all combine
Whether or not you shot, the aggression looms
Embarassed faces
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
But open the door and the clouds come in
Watch the skies light up Libya tonight
Let's jump upon the sharp swords
Sitting on a fence is a man who drinks real ale
The death of one is a tragedy
Like wat the fuck you expect I'm a muthafuckin cajun
You can run and you can hide
And know that I don't hate you
You blink, you die
Another smiling photograph shall stay  winters long forever
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
Watching you squirm in your shoes
Don't get mad
I got a message in a bottle, written in gas and oil
Says, man, you should try to take a shot
You know time don't ever end
Heaven knows I can't take more of this
Greasy, dirty, smelly, wretched
I'm living with a perfect stranger, is there anybody home
There's a star in the night sky
Five stories falling
As a killer
This is for you kids trying to get signed
Someone yells you suck
I'm left with, I'm left with
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie
Will you still be standing in your disease
You can watch Good Will Hunting by yourself, I hope your eyes fall out
Every bit, bit, bit
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
This is not what I want this is not what I need
MC Ren Why the fuck not
You keep on steppin' out of reach but you won't win the race
All the lies, Oh
All she wants is your lovin'
'Cause I don't want to marry my convictions
I see the blood on the floor
Cold gun, wild rose
Full of ecstasy, hard drugs and bad luck
So close to reach but so hard to hold
But feel like autumn 
I can't forget the fight that's growing stronger
And you laughed in my face 'cause you held all the cards
Who makes laws for lawmakers
Do you not go to the palace of answers with me Marie
Perhaps it's just the way the light falls 
Don't wear my heart on your sleeve
non lo sai che i miliardari
Love was lost in yesterday
Two thousand years of looking for utopia
I'm wolf, I spit flowy partly
I went down like a burned out rag of a child
Never compromise and you will never live a lie"
I wui dass du woasst
Destroy the answer that you've found
Casting doubt
I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
Independence is a game
Do my dirty work Yeah
You're in for it now Are these helicopters for me
And kiss the devil on the lip
Black no 
 It's not my fault
You've got to jump back
Your mother should've swallowed you,x
What are you thinking about
You dont know what it is to be a friend, now
For all things share the same breath
You want to wash away what ills your heart
Watched him tearing through the garden, killing everything in sight
But in the end she's left me a bitter twisted motherfucker
Stop parading your angles
And know that I don't want to fight you
Does anyone care if nobody cares
The fire burns on high
We were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts and march through the gauntlet of car alarms,
Stayed up those nights to feel
Pick yourself up now and walk the road
So I died in the back of the cab
Well they say that rock is dead
She's just a puppet in their indoctrination plan,
Do what's right, do what's right, do what's right now
Motherfucker, I'm Dre, I don't need your respect
Forced hellos
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say
It always cures the pain that would never leave and causes even more
Oh my God, I'm cracking up, get a grip Marshall
You know, you should be flattered
In my old man's shoes, and how you'd understand that
Question the purpose, it was a very sad day
How many miles can you put on one soul
I'd have made us a killer movie
I don't wanna baby that looks like that
I bite my tongue every time you come around
On a ball and chain I call my own, huh, huh
Distant headlights
I'm eating rat poison for dinner 
I wanna tell you something
That truth and love
I won't pledge allegiance to hypocrisy
To take a shot at me
Dip your hands right in 
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Video killed what we once stood for
No MSG please
And believe in a god we can't feel
Whatever happens well I'm part of all this
He likes to remember when
Above everyday, I'm hurting
War Ooh, friend only to the undertaker
But I'ma make your bitch ass holla
Bring it all together, I want everything
No more indie rock
And a gat that's filled with love, now let opposites attract
And motherfuckers lost their minds
Or is it my suspicious mind
The battles left us are far from over
Dress up this rotten carcass
We know our god is the same god
Satan ain't hard to see without craning your neck
There's no need to scream or to shout
He has his future in a British steel 
I'ma give 'em hurricanes until another Levee break
Somethings wrong and I just can't balance it
I decide it ends right here
We've got nothing better to do than watch TV and
The bitch threw her tits asked my click who we pay for
An everturning wheel
If you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine
The NRA just bought a man's soul
The gardenhead knows my name
Elle dessine des spirales et des drôles de coeurs 
And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Take a long look inside cause right now
But there's no time
Always darkest, darkest
You just piss in your pants
Well I'm not here to preach, I'm just sick of looks
Chorus I won't stop
Well you know if you want to talk about it I'll be here you know and you'll 
Your fucking television
I have focused on the cameos made by the tiger
Funneling through smokestacks
He died as me
Give a kid a gun, take away her Mum,
Weary of this hallway lined with ghosts
Every touch you craved for turned to violence
A room without a view
I know it's crazy but I know it
Rears its familiar head on the TV screen
Do you know what they say, what they say about you
To explain, let me kick it to you a little something like this
You don't need to be nice when you've been kissed by a star
Radio speakers gargle top  trash
Are turning 'round
I'm so full of love it deeply sickens me
I guess I don't know my own strength
I have no idea what's been holding me up
We built this city on lock and load logic
And lifes lasting misery
But I don't need her anymore
I need a change
Once in a while I could hear him shoot his pistol
Knowing when all else doth fail,
But, I'm afraid your brittle bones would break
What do the old people teach us but how to die die die die die
They said because of racism they'd come out on the street
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Exgirlfriend, exmember
But ignored them, and showed 'em the risk was to blame
So put on your thinking caps and get ready to fuck shit up
No surrender
Who would of known
So we give back a little bit of what the worlds given us
Bullet in your face
Master passion greed
At the bar, six shots, just beginning
You strip the joy out of their souls with all of your rules 
They just gave up in the end
The Devil's on rollerskates
And y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit
So this shit about taking in the souls
You're skinny and pretty and 
Will you save us from the cold tide
Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
I am not worth this
There's nothing worse than bitterness
You think you can come and go as you please
I'm not feeling too nice today
Peel out your eyes
Yank crime
And she's always ready bambalam
In your living room, haha, what, you think I'm kidding you
And I feel crazy
Odd Future Wolf Gang, came together cause, we ain't have nobody else
I tell you how to get it
We teach the kids, you rather have a bullet or a word to your wig
While these streets, got me to prayin' to stay out of hell c'mon
I wept my compassion away,
It's always been like this
The empty space between me and the sunken walls
Woke me up and shook me out of mine iniquity
Won't make you die
In these days with no love to give
One day you'll come down too 
In this chess game of language,
Did I do you wrong Was just teasin'
Something inside your head made a violent change
All those hours of wasted time have never crossed my mind
He knew that we'd come BUT *gun shot*
Hopeless fight
This time you're gonna feel it
Well, he doesn't want to look back
In synopsis this is my minority report
I am stabbed by grace and slinging blood
Come on it's not a sin 
Make you even sicker 'til you're slipping away
I burned all of my porno 'cause you were PMSing
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
I yanked on it till I broke his spine yeah
I'm calling you back
Puts the knife away after reattaching the ear
Give me strength allknowing one
All my subjects would dance and sing
Or is your belly always full
Your voice sounds like money and your face is cute
I'm a God with spoon and syringe This is where the pain ascends
You can try to stop it, but it"
I strap on one horse and prayed for luck
Tell me what it's like when you know it all
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Thy compassion shall be free
I jumped on a bus
But today's a confrontation with a thought that's not assured
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
Shitfaced, and pissy pants,
Continue to contaminate your bed
And everybody loves what they read
And, uh, the person that gave a fuck was me
Same routine, nothing new
Homemade 'tached memories
And I can't imagine why you wouldn't welcome any change, my friend
My dad is bigger than your dad
But I am a queen, understand
The vapors caught fire up in your mind
To believe him that is why
Is she a ride or die bitch
Nothing really matters
I see Orion and say nothing the only thing I can think of saying
In every city, memories would whisper,
Over the brainless chattering null set
And you know this when you work
A lake of fire lookin' looking like a long trip
How many times have you been defeated
If I soak my hands in others blood, Am I sick
The kind of murder where nobody dies
I am the girl who sold her body to the dark 
I was cursed by a talking snake
"We don't need it"
Believin' the lies
I have every right to feel the way I've been feeling shut up  I don't want to hear anymore of your dirty excuses
Ich möchte am liebsten tot sein und von allem nichts mehr sehen
Or what sky I am under
But she will never inspire a plan to save herself
Quello che ti insegna e non ti farà capire niente
Screaming bloody mary until my mirror breaks
They've gotta stop to laugh,
And a broken heart will turn to sin
'Cause there's women running past you now and you just drag your feet
Going around through my head
I'm in the motherfucking tractor from out the garage
Can you feel it inside yourself
Oh don't you know I'm sorry for my views
All the things that you lack
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
I'll punch the tree bark
You, I trusted your intentions
And all I wanted was a little patch of green
So wake up, nothing can stop us
Know
Oh yeah, a message left on the forehead of God
It bleeds horizontal straight from your wrists
RJD drop that shit so I can drop my thoughts
Lookin' through the crack between the blanket and the wall
We drink until we stupid and the party is ending
Sometimes things don't work out
Up against your flesh
CHRISTWord life; CHRISTResurrect; CHRISTEverlasting jah
There's too much fear in the way she sees life
'Cause of who you were affiliated with, and all that bullshit
Did I fall off Got you in your room
And a life that's full of crap, and a finger filled with hate
I didn't notice
Baby fire baby fire baby FIRE
I know you'll pay for what you've taken, tenfold
When the prompter dies I'm
The lights they tell me I should stop but you say,
And roll over in your sleep
And veil your eyes from states of Ain Soph Aur
The shape of things to come
That's some Camu shit
Is life good to you, or is it bad
Erase yank crime
In my Stacy Adam gators, where's that mothafuckin' stapler
To make these memories quit
You hit me, kick me, tell me you're what I should be 
Slackerbitch, fag hag, whore
'Cause I let you in my heart that one last time
And more books for the people
Ooh, a dark creep lover
Well the beat that my heart skipped sounded like this
And into a stranger's bed
So I parallel the brains of cobain
But you should've left the light on
You know what drives me
I'm talkin' about the ones who don't get chained to the rock
It's the heart you used to have when it died
Take a shot from every angle
Uncle, you spared not your children
So let's go before I change my mind
In my darkest hour of need
He's walking here among us
I didn't want this
You know you're alright, alright
This one's a cash fiend taking your money
There's a look on your face I would like to knock out
What will people know
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
To eat shit out a can like a worm
For the ill uses others might make of your ideas
But you might be the one who's lost my mind
So I'm going back to New Jersey, I do believe they've had enough of me
And then I'll laugh like a motherfucker
You choose to live on your knees, I'd rather die on my feet
Blood is all over my hands and body
Start a riot in this Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
A new discussion of an ageold question
Wake up feeling like a Messiah
ObviouslyWell I know it was you
You know you love this ass
Don't use your brain when your body makes a splash
Problems, you've been going off for no reason and we're afraid you're gonna 
This time you're in over your head
Shaking up the world  just like the nd coming of Christ
All these rock stars should've been killed, man Every single goddamn one of them Right after Jon Lennon died, we should've gotten the Partridge Family bus and driven around and killed them all one by one, you know Elvis Presley should have been shot in the head back in  Somebody should've walked up behind Elvis in ' with a  magnum, put the barrel of the gun right up to his brainstem and just pulled the trigger so you can remember Elvis in a nice way, eh Wouldn't it be nice to remember Elvis thin, with a big head of hair Maybe that gold lamé suit Wouldn't that be nice, eh Because how do you remember Elvis You know how you remember Elvis He was found in the toilet with his pants around his ankles and his big fat hairy sweaty King of Rock and Roll ass exposed to the world, and his final piece of kingly evidence floating in the toilet behind him Ugh Creepy One of his aides had to walk in and go, "Dang, Elvis is dead I'd better flush the toilet flush Oh, man I should've saved that I coulda made some money off that Dang, man A ding dang doo"
Whatevers possible becomes impossible
So don't bother, I won't die 
Your girl wanna blow me and don't even know me
Name your top , I'm harder than the most of 'em
Rudi Rudi Rudi Rudi gonna fail
But not today
No life, No mind, Nothing left inside
Bitches honeys that swollen
See your knowitall face on TV
To taste of immaculate sin
You can surrender or savor the scent of your old victories 
Not your type, not your type, not your type 
Drive a million miles down the PCH
And he trying not to eat you
The dirt and ugly from the stain that they try to hide
Yeah, uh, yeah, hehehehehe, ehyeah, yo
But what the fuck was I supposed to do
A life out of liberty
They let you decide, yeah
I don't give a damn about my reputation
My wives and I were all choked up
Who decorates the scarf with the fugi knot 
Before I die
Which has my name on the cover, along with my face
But there's no crashing until I see this through
Nice entourage lock mints wonder bras
Wait till tonight, I'm gonna show
Just watch out what you say
But then it hits you, then it kicks you
Fear I see in the back of your mind,
Then she turned off the headlights
Buses are on the way to take those people from New Orleans to Houston
Still in love wit niggas who was serving some hard times
You abused me in a way that I've never known 
You'd think you'd get the fucking point
I nod my broken head
Never come back in a mighty fright
Let them eat shit from our trembling hands
I'd build a boat to get to you or else I'd drink it dry
Into a life that no one should have to live
ThugLife see will never fail Out on bail  biatch
Couldn't pay me enough
With no place left to stand
On the devil's wing
Cut down, left to rotten
I don't think it's likely you're just made from all the wrong stuff
Don't take the fall 
God knows  who controls the radios
Let's move from this underground,
Back breakers Don't Come back here
I taught them aim for the head
Whoa Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
I told you from the start just how this would end
The Nina milli sixa, show ya how I don't give a fuck about you
Now His skinless crucifixion feeds a winged diocese
I don't want to be broken
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside
Everyone knows about it
Whoa I wanna get connected
So close your eyes and remember all those lies 
Don't tell your friend
But know I'm laughing in your face
I stand against till the shit drops
With You I'm at home now
Over little shit you do, pretty hittin in me
Did you get what you needed
Like fifteen strangers dancing
I did not name the stakes
I stood before the glittery borders of new radius in search of the fabled city of mud and crushed velvet,
A never ending chase
Waste life
Flipped it back so I'm back in gang green
That day will always be remembered
io non vi posso credere
It takes you back to a better time and place,
And in the end
I'm a bad ass BBoy, two triple O
You changed the world forever 
Caught up in the chaos of their minds
Ooh, you make me want to run away and hide
We spun like birds on fire
Fuck school, I'm a fuck up Fuck Harvard
Are all mine
So stop wasting my time
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
Get the business clothes off Take off Take off
To humans is it like staring at the sun, a blinding brightness that conceals a source of great power
You want it
Fucking in our cosmic hearse
The wife, the bitch, the Rapunzel
I wake up and go to work, back aches and my shoulders hurt
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure,
Please forgive me my cruel joke
Heaven knows if they'll ever awake
Of what is causing all the trouble
I think I'm dying for another one
And I don't need you to tell me how you feel
Oh, honey I'm a waste
He might be fucking her right now
Then you fall down, down, down
As you're driving down the street of gold Hey Pussy
No I am not a rich man
My whole world's falling down around me
But you come to me and you ask me out and I say okay now
Make up to break up *singing in background* niggaz need to wake up
My own space shuttle,
I'm a Thrasher you ain't know Thrasher
They're making martyrs out of little children
You're goddamn immature
The All Stars amped out bender got corrupt
You can't help me till the sunrise lifts up
Steal my game, go on, take everything
And I'm only fucking human yo, what am I supposed to do
You live what you've learned
But I could kill you instead
Broken heartbeats become breakbeats for niggas to rhyme on top, but
While you had your eyes closed with me
You dare not ignore the things I say
You keep on tryin' to hide it but we both knowow
I like to run in the sand like a horse
I think your head's fucked
Don't know what to feel
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
No need to explain yourself
I know you don't know if you
Till we've lost our voice
Oh tell me why
Scraped knees don't prove what you believe
I know I don't have the right to bug you with how this feels, its just the hardest thing I've been through, nothings ever felt so real
I'm perfectly content with being crazy
It's not enough, it's not enough, and more can never be enough
You'd fight and you were right
Little lever in my hand
The police force was elsewhere,
You want to breathe
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Tapped two of them on the neck so I could meet their eyes direct
The world's got no end and got no beginning
I wish nothing but
Are the kind that must be stopped  before their kind take all we've got 
See it's simplesimple, it's not that I want to make it rippleripple
Rende inutili Io non ci sono, adesso
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
No CNN or media now
Drive my car, with my jewels, now you're holdin' my wife
I love you, I hate you, I love you, I hate you
Busy man has blown his fuse
Close the door behind you 
This is madness
Enough to stay wide awake
I got a trunk full of funk like the Groovy Doolies
Kept screaming out my name
A hiccup in paradise
Millions of cowards
No difference between my hate and your love
Shake your hands Like they're full of disaster
The doors are wide open but your eyes are closed
Across the tin huts as children sleep
We americans don't read
Enough by now
But with her big eyes open
The swarm of locusts
So can you get the jist, imma make a move 'cause the game is over
I need noise
And doesn't she know that she is doing it all wrong
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Rape the king
Life's not meant to be expendable
In the tall grass where
If that's what you demand then set me free
I wish I could turn back the hands of time
Treat the bitch to fuckin' good, my opinion
Do you think what you need is a crutch
I know I can't help it
You have the same passion I have
Won't even bother now to tell me why
Fight now
O, baby, I want ya
I saw priest kill a cop on the TV
Now a nigga's selling millions, now it's time to celebrate
And I said I wanna fill you up, I wanna break you, I wanna give you up
And in my perfect world your perfect world don't belongso long
Do you think that you believe in yours more than they do theirs somehow
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
I did not believe
Cocooned in this world
The part that you've been playing has me dazed and missing you
Cause "The Nigga Ya Love to hate" still can "Kill at Will"
A fixture in the city of lust
Gonna keep my eyes open
"I never saw my friend alive again
Turn, turn the radio low
We all just race around, whoa
Okay what's the matter
And you stayed, what made you fall for him
I love to smoke crack
They fucked the operation
Then he jumps up and shouts gun control
So I can raise a black family with a true devils
Now I'm thinking
Left out behind your father's car
The fear I see when I look in your eyes,
That she wasn't, cause all that mess was making me hot
What would you die for
Every little bit
Closing comments made you wonder
I don't know who you're talking to with such fucking disrespect
Like a kick in the bag
Matthew and Stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you have till it's gone
Wo ist denn die Anleitung zum Kindesgebrauch
Do you know what we're fighting for
The people that you pick on
Listen, Ih know it must sound absurd
You love this ass, in the jacuzzi
We've got the method of groove that grabbed your attention
Watch the people 
Tranquilized like an animal
Some red handed sleight of hand
And nobody cares about your paranoid trip
Your life's an illusion
I'd really love to shout
Was früher die Gestapo war
But take your money and your soul
What's another word for desperate
And in this aching bed we are lying on you
Oh baby it's you I need,
I want to dance free till I fly 
I ain't talkin' shit nigga
To end this obsession
You know that I know that we're infected
Sie war geil diese Zeit wir waren zu allem bereit
I got a rock and roll girlfriend
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
That's how these niggas so onetrack minded
I promise you it'll be more than hard to ignore the gore
They break your skin when you're a kid
Fractured lines
You spend every moment of your waking life bitching about
Kalashnikov machine gun flow that I fire
I've moved on you know, I'm happy now, well, happy in a crying sorta way
Last whispers come bleeding from lips
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
Ain't nobody fucking with me, man
Just wanna lie
I'll sacrifice what I believe
I've seen their righteousness mixed without loving compassion
I'm only treading ground I don't wanna know
Is this true have ya really seen tha holy ghost
From the  to the fear of breaking down
And the blood pours up him, rather than down him
I know you're in love
Is why the world has to have so much pain
There's always one more thing, why don't you sell yourself
War is money, war is power,
Can't seem to break away
Every once in a while there is some asshole
When no one knows your name
I know who I am
'Cause the killing fields are bleeding
Don't you Know
Savage her sexless and burn out her eyes
It feels like I'm dying
Round to back
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Pour the poison in my ear
Life sucks  I'm over it
Say to the Lord, "I'll die for music", but there's never sound
Are you serious Are you okay
You wanna what You must be bugging
His heart is sick
Where eager eyes and sameness strangles concern and fashion murders worth
And you were the mother earth
And come back to haunt you in your time of need to say
I'll make you feel my heart's affect
Ice cube ain't a lick nope make me bleed
Bass and treble heal every hurt
Oh, walking in your blue coat 
You've taken all my money
Caused by how I used to feel
Thuglife niggaz Yes bitch that's a President
Their little arms around you
The fluid acid end up being no good
Thats the last time I cry
My very soul has to bleed this time
I know who can love my many selves
Living on borrowed time, I'll die tomorrow
You must think I'm a fool
 torched orchids and citronella for algernon,
I don't want to think
On top of the world
No more tears to dry
They watch you fall
You moved me in a way that I've never known 
Fire burn all our uncertainties
Provide the lines that make your mind spend the time
Mass destruction is my function  time to put it to the test
No, you're not rid of me
Like gay step mom, none of you motherfuckers can fuck with me
The truth you sucker
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
Its life or death for me now
Just long enough to really make it hurt
I'm holding out
Born to this  I thin not
And I'll go on and I'll break every last thing in this house
See how you lose in your life
Hittin with Jean and The Roots, my man Black Thought rippin
Is farmers and their families
You burn a flag,
When you're this close, it gets hot before its cold
And I want to fly away
See all the beautiful people dancing all around
I pick myself up off the ground 'cause I don't give a shit
Oh, darling, for just one day
Rock this shit straight back to Anaheim
But then I take two steps back
With things that I love now the things that I hate
Return it
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
Sepultura, Max Cavalera will respond for breaking the
To hear you tell me, "Boys like you try too hard 
Before this whole thing falls apart
I got no problem with you
Don't need no side effects like diarrhea or sexual death
Don't talk about anything else we don't want to know
For twenty days or more
Let's see, what's wrong with me might be my fucking tourett sy
My sister, Veronica and I had this double act
In a galaxy of stars with nothing in the middle
With all my doors locked up tight
Whatever pleasures those who get  from stripping skin with rhino whip,
Interest How do you know what MY best interest is How can you say what 
Turning into something, to the sound that the triggers make
My friend you are starting to become a bore
Tell that girl to step Step back
Look at the sad faces you've left behind now
To clasp one another more tightly
It will always hurt you fucking asshole
Are you feeling happy now
Levers here to taste the ruins
She left with the morning
Sleep with one knife open You can't outthink us, we've been out of thoughts for a while
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
Take the heat, take a free kick, man
Bet you wish you stayed near the cross
We are all so full of fucking shit
To hell with you 
What I want you to do is, uh
I spit the acetate
I know I got to be right now 'cause I can't get much wronger
I don't drive nowhere without the radio on
Someone knows I'm dead as hell
You can't do nothin' absolutely nothing' ok
"Oh, husband, I could not control it
Into the future, into the future
Fuck, shit
Oh, sleeping children better run like the wind
I'm not introducing you to my mind
Matter of fact, shorten your list nigga, top 
I sing I need a man
"I'd like to take you inside my head"
I got lots of this, I vibe to this like I rock a feegee
I see the point, but I can't find a way to get through this fucking mental hell
But the bitch say I'm hot and I say no bitch I'm blazin'
And the orange glow from the street lamps
This is the fence that hate built
I'll fight for me, only me
Scream battle, but you never fought
You heard my gun cock
Controlling
Than a space on your list of your things to do
carne e cannonicarne e cannoni
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Disturbia, disturbia
Don't need no dizziness
He had been redrum in his past life devil
And I'm tied to the sky
Churn that butter honey
Without winking
Now it's nothing but my way
I used to want to make you talk
Won't you let her breathe today inject the holy spirit in her
Cranked the radio
Oh, you're not rid of me
The rhythm that keep rippin' down the door
She thought burnt skin would please her lover
Hey yeah, We go down inside
Into the salted wax and the false attacks
Through sickness and health
You're very drunk and we were very young
We're just waiting, waiting to begin
And I could just sit in church and just say �fuckin the services
You mind to
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
I oh wanna love you
They lied a fear and loathing
And I spark the fire for the cold in the dark
All I need is me and that's it
I've watched you whore yourself for one more thing
Not broken not broken
To a safe place, that was made for me
Yeah man she was hot
You think you know me
If I thought it'd ease the pain
Flying past God and wars and conflict 
If I wanna fancy fool, look I would've hired a dancer, oh
I saw this lady close her eyes
Tell me what you believe Ahah
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
That's the rule please niggas don't get it confused
If they ain't never heard of it 'your record' they murder it
We'll be right back, well I will, you'll be in the trunk
Unlock your mind
Criticize when I flow for the streets
Making the world a saver place
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
It's you that's faking, living, breathing, dying too
Momma turned her back on me
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom
I know it's all getting away
You know you will never be right in the eyes
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
When you say all the things that you never meant to say
And if you'd left me ground to stand on
Seeing you laughing another time
This is beginning to feel good
You can't tell a joke, yeah
Don't get too raunchy They want you to behave
Got me deep inside the drum you see it's blackness
Then bring me food and wine
All those familiar faces
You'd better go and call for backup backup
Of this life that belongs to me
Could we stomp around your back yard
Someone help, someone speak, before I start to scream out
A painful time, a time where cynicism rots the vine
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven
See, promoter's making small talk,
The most meanest MC on this on this earth
When I wear Mary Jane's shoes
Don't go to London, no no no
You love this ass, why not make it
I know your kind
Yeah it is you that I remember in that glowing
And I have earned my disillusionment
Thinking nothing
I implied black skies took a needle to my eye
You can't stop me
Already know what you're gonna say
And the sky beyond you is Krylon blue
Is completely cold and crazy,
With big ideas of stocks and shares
To anybody else
Poison eggs reverse swallowed
Gettin' down in the town that makes no sound
Out of the old and thin and control
Yeah, we never talk about the future
The world was mine but gave it to my baby's mama
Do you mind if I were yours
You don't bleed
So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Hey, I'm the one with no soul
To not come and speak to me speak to me
And it seems to me there's a means to and end
Who cares get the fuck off your soapbox
When you come around and you flex that fake grin
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Can decide your fucking life
I can see it in your eyes, everything you're hiding
And weep at my grave
Nothing will bring rest
Hip gangster wannabes
I had a scream last night
Now don't ask what, don't move, don't cry Don't even ask where this is going
There will be struggle and fear
No cash to buy their lies, just the rage behind my eyes
Hiding in your room we'd lay like dogs
Better off not asking
If I was you I wouldn't fail myself
Politicians, can you fucking believe them
I'm the singer, I'm the singer in the band
But nothing compares to the path that I tread on now
You read of the tree Beget by god
I don't need much to be aight, live off the land, eat atnight
You're nowhere into giving
Politically erect romanticizing
Into attack position  ELIMINATE ALL
This industry business is all screwed up
Come on tell me 
You're not the one with all the problems
I'm talking as a walking document of our struggle
But you are nothing
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew
I'm sick and tired of all of your lies
Destroy the mind, destroy the body but you cannot destroy the heart
I'm coming over but it never was enough,
And tell her that she's beautiful
There must be another route, way out
Makes this wicked world go round
He was crazy and he kept screamin',
Singing tonight's the night Black Rob, let's write these hits
Because you make me nervous tonight
You and I have nothin' more to say
The pain junkie
Rolling up tab ends that the baby's collected
It's not the first time eye've tasted pain
Do my dirty work Yeah, come on, yeah
Shut your fucking mouth
Is used to help ward off the fear
From our swollen hearts
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
From now on, gonna start holding my breath
Take your broken pride, exhaust your basic quote
I like to feel this abuse I'm tucked away fucked and used it's trapped away in my mind unseen alone undefined this desiccation implied my fucking mouth so fucking dry
It's too much I shook my head spaspaspazmatically
Aw, fuck; Chuck's on a killin' spree again
Good Fucking Bye
Show you right back
Choking on a broken sentence
Give you poison to kill your pain
Put the cassette in the tape deck
Don't you think that I don't want them
Trying to meet halfway
Objecting to racism's like a candle in the dark
What is left of me without you
To waist this love on no one
And I wanna sing
Got a big chip, you want a fat lip
Over the border and to every corner and edge of the world
Tell me goodbye since you cannot rely
My life, my pride, is broken
And everybody wants to explore the new girl
I've always got a knife in my back
Your grave, it's your grave
Wake the fuck up
Shut up you don't know me, shut up, you don't know me
I'd rather catch something controversial and die
I can't fully become my mother's guiding light
We got sixteenyearold netheads buying garbage
You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf
I'll fuck you in the skull
But I went right ahead and told myself a pack of lies
Am I supposed to feel something
I don't understand, it can't be that easy,
And the next time they're gonna be looking at you
Your god machine is cold
Let's move from this undergound
But how things have changed now
These lovely words will dance above their head
Wither away inside your golden cage
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
With arms and gold in store
I am warning you I am weightless
You can call me crazy say I'm insecure
You feel the love
Even he'd like to end it too
Just one more chance, I'll leave it like I should
Would you be my wife
The world is feeling twice as cold today
But how much affection does one guy really need
Another set up for the fall
I'm picking sides and pulling the strings
You're a madman, need help to
U hoes can't make it in the game
I believe in something else
When you wait for a call that never comes
Say the word and make it right, so dark
Covet love it learn to break
Their government has failed them
I beg of you my only saving grace
Just walk away I've had enough today
You, you take so long to know
The weak die young and right now we crouch to make them strong
This is the sip that's drinking back from you,
Step to face, I'll break your ass in two, bastard you
It seems like every time we all try to go underground
I don't hate my loss of luck, I just hate feeling so washed up for what
You'll never know how your face has haunted me
Well, I don't care now what you say I don't care what you say
Okay Put the fuckin' money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you
Do it now Fuck y'all
I thought that that might disappear but you penetrate
But you gotta act right and not let it lack now
So pick your head up boy, and walk away
Heart's saying "I will once I bury this bitch alive
Some day, Ill form opinion, either stand up to God or fall for religion
Best estimate, straight blacked out for the rest of it
My hearts in the prison
Open wide for all the shit they feed you
I cannot distance myself
And with a heartbeat
How long they'll hold you down
They didn't think that Vinnie P was catchin' bodies no more
It feels good to say what I want
Don't give me your nothin', I can do it myself
As we kiss hard on the lips
I won't sell it for no payroll
Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me
Both arms and it makes you feel better
Stand in line it's not your turn
Intellectual artistic seriously
If you cross my path
Shut down the devil sound
Cause you will never see me cry 
Voices controlling my feelings
MTV stopped by to film our fortresses
And I know that this is new
The power of conviction
Spurs matte from the life force sprung loose from wells
As they run down my face
They shout give us our fair share, give us justice
I face towards the wind
We invented the zero And we mean nothing to you
Squawking over my head, don't let me down
'Cause humans be lying, we're such an inaccurate source
Prop me up with another pill
Today is the day
It's not right how they martyr our leaders
Ignorance bliss
If I could talk
Oh, shit she's a gold digger Well
I never heard of paperface
Do you know what they feel, what they feel for you
Just splashed across the page
But turn my mind off
From the chip under your wrist skin
Just in case you have been waiting
Everything tastes so sweet
An explanation is what we want
And keep warm
Waking up to realize
If you made a dunce cap I'd don it
Been gone more days this year than I have been home
Cannot breathe
No more waitin' around
I promise you won't ever see me cry 
Everyone on the dance floor is doomed Hit the ground Shut your mouth
Imaginary walls surround me
Oh God before I leave this life
Make you second guess your everyday
Don't need you to say we're cute
Swiftly go the days
And we don't learn from them
Is it near enough
Like to live with you someday I think that would be swell 
And I don't know what town I'm in
I just want a Pretty Baby to be her man
Now we got the whole world starstruck
Go see the volcanoes
In our shiny white snow
Enjoy this lonely sky with me 
My nearest and dearest
Slouch into position men, this is a war Set the traps
Come on now
The one I love I hate
So I'll meet you up high in your anger
No matter what you did or who you fucked
I know you feel betrayed
Feel like I'm knocking on the
My friends graduated and I'm way older then them
Don't care if you hated me from the start
I'm left to counting the days
I have come to know this world of changing faces
I know you can hear me
They mind believe in us
He says it's real, 'cause I got bills, but I got skills
Keep singing
When I tried to save us it was not enough
Flirting with a bimbo named disaster
I wantingly longed for your touch, but 
Nobody helps them
She wants to fight, wants to fight and I've been drinking
You act like you don't want it 'cause I'm with too many guys, but in the middle of the night, you called me twenty five times
Tell me what, tell me what
And been treated like shit
Reconstructive sergury if you know what I'm talking about
Did it, oh lover boy, oh fever head
And all I ever needed was to fall with you
Leave them now, let them go,
Hey yeah, been thinkin'of your life
Not through talkin' and not through waitin'
They give them civil rights to appear on the left
I'm on fire I'm comin' around
Oh yeah Oh yeah Well they think they got it all out there, see
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme
These people they take and they take until there's nothing left
Don't be assuming that I'm going to love you 'cause if you do I'll cut you out of my life I promise you
I spit off  fuck it give 'em the 
I'm not havin' it, My rap attract the service like a magnet
Oheeoh fuck the lawns that need mowin'
After ten cups of coffee, I'm thinking
Creature of elusiveness, nightlife exclusive fix
So won't you break me shake me hate me take me over
No one ever tells me so what I am to know
as encomendas na Bolívia
Beating the morning to the farm
Okay baby follow me now
Lookin' down from the skybox
The week is weak enough
Quit hollerin' "Why, God", He ain't got shit to do with it
We're gonna have a TV party tonight all right
Another cure to fix your day
"I'm gonna live my life to build a better world"
All I want to do
Looking out from the cell block
And I wish my life was done
I watch you sit I watch you dwell
That's when you made a pledge to yourself,
Stuck my knife deep inside as I saw my fate through his eyes
I could really suck you in
Don't go knockin' on my door
When the trust you had is broken,
Heed my faults  and heed my curse  heed my frustration  you just don't
I know I need to chill
Hardly waiting till the bed was warm
Girl in white dress, boy shoot white stuff
There'll be peace in the valley of death when I rise
Your clothes, your suits and your pension schemes
My heart is reeling
We know the score
Take you away from your life
Run game on a nigga
Sit down bitch, you move again I'll beat the shit out of you Okay
Yeah, we never talk about the past anymore
"Okay, there he go Easy, easy, don't lose sight, wait
I'm looking for love again
Show no shame like the pain of kane
Karma killer, karma killer
I needed a stage
Secondhanded, sick, and lonely
God don't you know that I live with a ton of regret
'Cause baby the memory is all you get now
I'd walk all day
The smiles only make it worse for you, you'll see 
Who broadcast  million versions of the sermon for that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains,
The kinda shit that's on your TV
But while you were busy destroying my life
But you old life stays the same
When their sons go out to fight to give their lives
Can you believe that
But you leave this taste in your ring around the rosy yeah
Citys play upon our souls like broken drums
The earth's like a belly
You told a lie
I can hear their song from miles away 
She tried to plot on a nigga, vacan't lot one shot bitch died go figure
'Cause if we die there's still direction and
And you'd better think twice before you step to me and pick a fight
How does it feel to know that your going to burn
A struggle ensued and then fat children took my life
I should be feeling so alive
I'm sorry mama
You suck the life out of the new with all that you do 
She'd walk on broken glass for love
We'll pass out on the couch all right tonight
And right outta my life
If it wasn't for hate, we'd be dead by now
And somebody will be peddling vials of penicillin stolen out of all the medical kits sent to the countryside
Hold it inside, all that is dark
Just turn it on, and leave it runnin'
Burn at both ends
I am older now, but I still remember
Y'all know what time it is
Get money fuck a little let a nigga touch a little
All I know is a  to  ain't cutting it
Gimme room as I light up the boom
Selfsufficience please
Anyone will do tonight
You're made of card
From Cape Town to Pretoria, to Johannesburg, there is a crying of people dying that can be heard,
I'm tired of this place and I want to go
So now try as you may
Put my makeup on and crack in half
You have the kind of eyes that turn mere mortals into wrecks
Promised that I'll never ever lie to you
Oh Such a lack of taste
Me, and my own inhibitions
I'm tired of people trying to take a piece
They tried to get me with their learning and their books,
You hatin' on me, in every single way
Flip your shit past another lass's
I've been shot
To make me feel keep it moving
Had a taste, you've had a glimmer
Round here, she's always on my mind
If I don't get what I want x
She wants you in her descent
And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people
Well, you can all just kiss off into the air
Tony's Touch create more gold than Midas
All your pain 
I cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin movie
He put his hands up
But I can't say nothing
Suffer not The paralysis of your neighbor
Passengers with destination
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
So quit spilling your drinks on me yeah
A wall limits our life
I'm like a goldfish swimming in a plugged in blender
Cover your eyes as they fire their guns
Oh oh oh oh, In hell I'll burn in flames
Yeah, I want to know
And its lights flashes as the sirens play his favourite song
Does anybody hear him
Haven't you had enough have you come back for more return to that plane of glass to remember what you look like and remember that you don't like what you see
Always making fun of my clothes, telling me how hot other guys are, asking me to pay you gas money
And shadows form from chandeliers
Now we've wrapped the past up in broken glass
Make you sick, make you ill
They hear the villain niggaz spittin' with them nigga flows
Church bells are ringin', the families stand and wave
Burn it off the fucking internet, and bump it outside
You've got a lot to learn about respect
And I know it'cause the fear you hide your eyes show it
And every pop song on the radio
We take yo fuckin' shit and live you stuck like a bitch
You need friends, you need help
Once bitten but twice shy
I have arrived and this time you should believe the hype
There's music playing
To be absolved through eternal sleep 
I got a bad feeling about this you, in
You think you're slick in everyway
Pondering on if you really feel her
Kill kill kill for   
With a baby in her hand
A mood that turns, a schoolkid dies
Driving me crazy
I'm drift drift drift drifting yeah oh
You're the great exaggerators since 
I will never fear you
Don't mean we're still friends
I've got a bad feeling about
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
Junior MAFIA, yeah
Bowin' down to the flag
Reflexes shot
A bag in my hand
I put years in this shit
Be a happy family, like the people on the pack,
Into the oblivion, into cold, into nothingness
I feel cold, I feel ashamed
Just bodies, these golden souls
Be very afraid you've made your last deal
This is my last real bitter song
Bein' fudged by a face I can't erase and can't see
People where the fuck is freedom at
We're ready to handle,
My feet are walking over him
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I will not leave it up to fate because I hate you too
I love my dick My dick loves me I love my balls too, it's kind of a love triangle thing we have going on I love my dick more than my balls, but don't tell my balls that because that would bum my balls out Wait, let President Leary clarify that last statement I love my dick, but I'm no John Wayne Bobbitt, you know what I mean Like, if my wife cuts my dick off, I'm not telling anybody Nobody's finding out I don't care if the cops show up at my house, with the dick, "Nope, no, not mine No, I never had a dick I'm a eunuch, that's right 'No Dick Leary,' that's my nickname I'm actually saving up to buy a vagina, that's what I'm doing right now But thanks for dropping by, fellas CLANG"
Driving back to her apartment
In the battle inside of my soul
So this will be the last bitter song
To another time, to another place
Your world that is
We think it's getting better but nobody's really sure
Do you really wanna be a part of it
As I hate hell
Ruthless wild
She says, "Now wait a minute, I'm with child"
And I fear him
What colour is God Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me
Butterfly wing crosswinds send Black Hawks toward hurricane survivors
I'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Well, I walked so far my feet began to bleed
Down a note
And didn't nobody use the phrase, "It's all good"
'Cause when I'm violent is the only time the devils hear it P Dog
Swallow you can't miss
Do you fuckin' know that Do you know that
The dirty bum bum, bum, bum, bum
She said goodbye to the ground
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Making unknown nuggets for the miners
I'm gonna sing the mile
Or pass the wine
I'm not an animal, an animal, an animal, an animal no no I ain't no animal
Nail the bodies to the crucifix
Bum bum bedum, bum bum bedum bum
While they do the weather I pretend I'm writing something
And everyday I sit and kneel and pray
You screamed give us Liberty or give us Death
Eine Schande ist und war es
Yes I believe that we can turn it around
Hey cousin, en veilleuse et constate par toimême 
One way or another, I'm gonna win ya
You're sleepin' with danger
I feel like I could go insane
When magic slips into the air
You see my sad wife and my high margin of profit
Hey look what's that sound
Harder than the white kids that copy shit
I know you really care X
Oh, baby, its gonna die
Let's not let us forget
I think I'll spit
Trapped in a world that I never made
Don't feel sorry
Putting bullets in some guy's head for no particular reason
Murder, taste the flame of the
If it's any consolation, I guess I wouldn't want to be you
But enough is enough
In a state of shame
You can't run the race
I see the carcass in your eyes
Denn du hast nicht den deinen Taten entsprechenden Weg für dich gebahnt
And even through the loneliest time
Gather 'round the sound
Tell me what you believe Tell me what you believe
When we gonna torch the restaurant
 Oh, shit, I ain't no "being at peace" Mao Tse Tung said that
I just sit outside waiting for frost to bite
Don't know yo facts but I saw the blood pour from her head
Learn from mistakes and move on 
And I don't know where the gun is 
You keep spreading your message that I despise
Who've given us something more than faultlessness to sing about
Caught redhanded with a grin on your face
Rip through your motherfucking temple like Phantasm
I'm looking for a new solution that I can swallow I can swallow
And she don't play neither
Gnaw on the bones Fata Morgana
This is a toast to celebrate the end of our innocence
It makes no sense
Perds pas de temps, laisse nous faire si tu sais pas
And so now when I drink, I'm going to drink to excess
I realize I'm dead, I'm fucked in the head
How could they know this
Tell me what is man without the beasts
Always better a fashion show
And we drive
Need your goddamn pressure
And I cannot sleep without the radio on
Talk, talk, talk, talk again
Make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
Who you fucking now
Instead of mental hospitals
Put our feet on the ground
Cheater, yeah
Fear I leave in the back of your mind, hey, hey, hey
And honor of me
And it will be okay
I know you have no idea
You know I'm trying to quit
Oh honey
Of a generation said to burn
When you've had enough
Now how dat sound
That's against the law, now he's behind the bars
And we took off our clothes
But now neither one of us will give an inch until I break
And if my day
No bodies ever knew
Smile on the day of your disappearance, smoke in mirrors
Don't try hold us in the corner be
Imitation demigods
Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
We will play along
The factory belches filth into the sky
It won't be long now
I don't need your meddling when you gonna learn
And God knows what will unfurl
Go on, take everything, take everything, I want you to
No fibre now chaff
The way you made me compound to compound
And since pain is all I know, I make the weak bleed slow
I walk into the room
I might as well let the sperm, of that other nigga father me
Everyone knows you need a piece of lollirot
Science City of ideas
Space always expanding
Carve "DEATH" across your face
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins till amnesia
And scum is just ahead, ah we see it,
Step out the front door like a ghost into the fog
Depression  I kicked it
I am not your friend, I'm not your lover
God cannot lie
For the need to breed and consume
With police watchin, full of various toxins
Antagonizing and instigating my hate
I hope you've learned it too
You made me look a fool
There came a cry "It's The Night of The Hawk
There ain't no ain't knowin' me
Regardes la tête qu'il a quand j'lui demande ma carte électorale 
I go wild because it doesn't make sense
It moves outside you, it stays inside you
I've even had you believing that I really, really like it like that, like that, like that
Don't wanna be that guy
Forget school man I never could pass threw it
I cashed in all my chips tonight
And spending our lives for moments that won't arrive
A coded message heard
My tendons tend to rust with time while wires misplace their currents
All of this talking and all of this chatter
What is this world without pain
You rose your god damn hands and fucking parted me
But all I could do was close my eyes and cross my arms and hope to die
A room full of doors
A couple o' notes and get you hogtied in rope
Punk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hiphop
Broken from where we have failed
I couldn't resurrect it, I feel my arms break
How do you hold the special victim
Couldn't kick it like I kick it bitch I kicks it
Oh my God, where are we now
Stampede and break your chains
It's too much work to help a crazy
The princess and the whore, the lady
Now I know that slime ballers laying out and all
And you won't call me back
To stop me from tears
I don't know why, all I need is someone to save me, I believe,
Won't you kiss me goodbye
Dressed in black shit
'Fore it fades into black and it's all over
You fucking whore
I gotta get out no more
Put them back together again
I'll leave the luggage of all your lies behind
From disparate strands
But we was kids then Kim, I was only eighteen, that was years ago
Heavy, I want it heavy
She left behind, forgot to pack
And its every face seems worn and stale and overplayed
Drift madly to you
I wore them  to make you bite,
The perfume burned his eyes
I stand around for family
People like you just fuel my fire
You follow, find yourself at war
For dear life, we hold on
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
Defiendes a la humanidad
Silicon inject what's lacking
Call the police
Runrun
You'll lose your fucking mind
He answered with his thumb,
Note distorte 
I'm walking away, yeah
J'ai déjà gagné assez d'terrain mais je pourrais pousser encore
I like the pigment in your skin
Sprinkle a little Big L on top
When I see the way my friends gotta slave
Call me on the line but there's no time quick
Another time and another place
Now I know hallmark was right
Fade to black
Got hand me downs but honey no Vuitton
We always loved the sad, sad
You suck the life out of the crowd without a sound 
When I was youg all my dreams seem so far comin' up was hard now I'm a rock star cause all I do is rock bars I stays on fire just look at the cars you need a hit from kells all right my nigga no prob I'm clean but dirt I'm good but I'm the worst I'm last and I first I'm blessed and I'm curst but my carrer is sorin while my life is a hot mess but the depth of y stuggle determins the height of my success I believe that wat ever billion dollars tryin' to see that wat ever billion I'm be still askin were the weed at hit lots of clubs take lots of shots of patron hold my middle finger up and tell haters to get the fuck on stay shinnen boy stay grinden boy keep these fine ass bitches stright eyen me bot now where you gone hear a better name  years in the game still continuan to make it rain puttin' these folls to shame I'm a beast
Through the hallways of a sleepless night
Somethin' so ridiculous, funny, so fuckin' sick of this
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
I see my giant face
What if there's things we gotta do
But truth seen trough our eyes
Laaf durch die Nacht scho seit Stunden
So what do we do, we put these little kids behind prison doors
Show 'em what you're made of
Until I believe
Faster, faster, until the Centre cannot Hold
Spit it out for better taste
When I sit back and giggle like the rest it's the ritalinafest
Thirst and hunger, workday rhymes
All my friends wake up alone
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
Darkness at the break of noon
The world falls down around you
'Cause I can look your god right in the eye
I always felt far away
And realize that you got nothing that I need
But you're not gonna stop me from having fun
Then that would mean the government's god
Thinking fight, fight, fight
Since the apple wasn't there, yeah
She made me cry
But I really want to know what she thinks of me
This message will be briefthere's nothing much to tell
I'd like to see you take off your clothes for me
I've just got to close my eyes
End this fucking bullshit life
I want to make you bleed for the things you did 
It's not quite right 
Cause ain't a fuckin' thing 'bout me pussy
Fake me break me shake me hate me take me
To waist this love on no one no half of you
Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
I don't wanna talk to you anymore
He ran away with my best friend
Just the way this would end
But if she keep on disrespectin' I might just
Please believe me
Every time you think you're looking, you're just looking down
As opposed to always travelling
Got enough guts to sew trash and bust up your fluke act
I worry about how this album will sell
Not right, I'm not right, you're not right
There's no telling how long
And I need all the love I can get
And don't talk about war, when niggas know that your puss
To make a poem sing
Another dead end, another lesson learned 
And if another fan asks for a photo while I'm snacking on my pizza lunchable
Act like you can't tell who made this
Another broken promise tips the scale and it goes pale
You can say what you want
Watch the dance as they dance such a pretty dance their legs are worn down to the knees
Dalle mie parti i torti restano
Don't want to hear it, don't even want to think about it,
I hear Mama they got her working on tha Payroll
Don't ignore the 
Never mind the fools who know what we're getting into
Little bitch wants money to burn
You're all going to die down here
Without my life, caving in
Hey now, all you children
No, nothing ever shames me
The people in blue ties rise from the podium
Virginity was torn Soon babies was born that was half white
We are the thorn in your side and the bullet to blow you apart 
You tell him that I had a skin full
Laß die Mädchen bloß in Ruh 
Got my head on a spring
Poisonous seeds of bad apples
You know I'm sorry darlin' don't you cry
Naked and cold, nothing left to steal
The last time always hurts the most
Your playin' days are through, or so you say
You keep on aiming for the top 
Sure enough it don't take that long until they find a reason
And I think if we got back together again,
Kill the motherfucker
I erase the lines that you mend, "I've done it before", I said, "I'll do it again, do it again"
Needed to feel you so much
She doesn't want to
Feelings of love became feelings of hate
They'll whine, they'll bitch,
Just watch the reversals
That's a lie, lie, lie, lie
And each desperate drive
Disconnected my XBox and ditched all my friends
You'll buy it secondhand
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
I never thought this would be such a nightmare
When your world comes crashing down, I want to be there
E ad andare con gli scemi le tue chance iniziano a scemare
Life burns from the touch of the reaper
If you're really mindless
I'm your darkest fear
Bury his body in Missouri
Of the game
Oh I am a fool when I need you, I'm a fool to believe
You've never been the girl next door
But you, you're nothing, you just need a dad
I'll tear your mind up, I'll burn your soul
You're disgraceful, like getting caught pissing in the sink
A fool among the scholars
And I am no longer afraid
Don't you come back no more
That you were standing in the middle of an open grove
For five minutes at a time the power held true
But then you're shooting me down
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
And then she reeled me in expecting nothing more than kissed necks and quick sex
When chickens get a taste of your meat, yes
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
Throw your rude insults against my face
And you made an island of me
Up in detroit holdin' weed court, all through the south
The ones that can lie to your face
The lord god almighty, creator of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen
With scars from breaking shell
And buried the pain inside
Stab the devil in his belly, took his Pelle Pelle
With a tiny hand you're picking
Got this creeping party doubt
If life's for the livid
That's all you gon' do cause you niggas is punks
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about that mom, but uh look, I'm kinda busy right now
I am not dead
I know that everything can change
And they keep finding more denial stuff There's a doctor now, I'd like to see what size he is, a doctor in LA came up with a theory that being fat is actually a virus Ah, I guess I'm the asshole here, right Cause every other virus we know about is a flesheating virus the common cold, AIDS, cancer But he's the found the one that makes ya bigger Okay, yep yep yep yep yep That's all the fat person in each family needs Now we're at Thanksgiving with the fat person going, "Well I'm not actually overeating AHHMUMFMUMF, I'm trying to keep the virus at bay, AHHMUMFMUMF" Look, I'm trying to help here, okay You have a choice it's either me, or Richard Simmons coming over to your house, okay He's gonna cry and shave his legs, I think you want me, I really do I think I'm the better choice And there are definitely signs, folks, that you should stop eating Let's make that very clear
My freedom is best, whole country's on house arrest and everyone's a suspect
Criticas a la sociedad
My perception with no conscience 
Today's the day
Stepped out the door
Mais j'ai crié mon innocence, demandé de la reconnaissance 
I want you to, to kneel all day
I try to maintain, the pain is unstoppable
Soon enough we'll be the
Feeling so damn humiliated because they looking at me like I'm hell bound
I love you to death
All our efforts seem to fail
We never bleed
Tell me, tell me what are you
You're not the only one who can smell fear
Corroded and rusted trust beyond repair
I never meant to make you cry
Died with your belief in me so who the hell am I
All my fault 
A non com observer  I assassin the collector  defector 
And I wanna be a local face and play the social game
Never thought I'd be this way
But I don't think there is no reason
Black heart pumping discount rates
And now it's time for me to get
Non mi abbasso a certi schemi
I can't stop that fight
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
I can almost reach it now, now, now
We want your oil, we want your land
And I try but I can't and I want to so bad and
Don't ask me why, you know the answer
But it seems like I've got everyone fooled
The devil's on sugar smacks
Spill his blood between my jaws
Lost soldiers coming home
Lend a hand to hold you down
I wanted you for nothing more
Let me touch you now
I hold her too lightly
We don't need to know the answers
C'est dur de ne pas être rancunier, business is business homie
Listen to that bass Rhymesayers entertainment
We're a schizophrenic race
When there was no giving up
Run away, run away, run away yeah
I gather strength to spread the disease
Tell me, how does it feel for ya
The lies, the cries, only the
Burning rubber into the end of the dream
Still carries scars
You fucking eat shit, you filthy shit
You lost control of my life, you want control of the rest
We've been missing long before
What day is it anyway
But I hate you
I don't know Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore
Colorless men and ladies of the world unite
Ohno ohno
What would you cry for
Losing ground to the things that matter
uns manipuliert, uns wegzensiert, uns exekutiert,
But god knows, I didn't wanna be alone
Stand up now diggers all
To all the suckers on the block talkin' shit while I was locked up
Though you maybe made it clear
On est né sur le sol français contrairement à nos rentpa 
Drag your sister down
I believe that morality's gone
I'm not a Christian or a Jew
This motherfucker thought the coochie had a padlock
Starfucker, just like my daddy, yes
Sunshine has always been an enemy
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
I thought you should know
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
So live it up now
Remember all your yesterdays
No body's getting in, nobodies getting' out
Trap door with vocal chords
Like candy sticking to my teeth
I know what I did was pretty rotten
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night
The washing of hands
We have a struggle of wills all for black swollen pills the semiconcious thin lines my fucking truth so fucking blind
Without your fake teeth in
Well, who is working, who is not
Europe's gravestone carved in plastic 
She's overbored and selfassured
Oh, honey I'm a wreck
Don't be afraid the threat's not for real
You wanna go, son
True like friendship
And playing the accordion that same old song
So we decided that it would be in your interest if we put you somewhere 
Through the sound of sirens
We'll squeeze his goddamn brains out
Yeah, I wanna say nothing, nothing
Telling lies  I kicked it  I won't kill myself
A little game of who's distracted more and
While playing on the ignorant storm
But love is passion, may love is vengeance
Seeing the first star burn white
Where kisses rot and die
Lie behind a camera past the city music hall,
Fuck you asshole, yeah, bite me
You know I'm kinda glad Nixon died
Procrastinated measures decreases our chance to save
Brother john saw visions of god
I start to cry, I start to cry
You ever had a friend kill
Tomorrow call me the fool
I feel like I could loose control
Did you want me to give in
Ain't no hoes fuckin' wit this bitch
Just to get in my face
Make it hard as it burns
Crack yo head in this Bitch
Well it's the man with the plan to get all your skins
Rassistische Polizisten oder Saharasand
Long ago if not for my condition
He says I run and then I run from him and then I run
And I can watch Good Will Hunting by myself it's cool, it's fine
Sometimes you still think I am crazy when I'm sane
To feel the sand between my toes
There must be some solution but I just don't know
It's easier to bow than keep these knees locked tight
My faith has waned
You handle shit sloppily, I drop a ki properly
Now you say you know how we feel
I must say I commend you on all of your fire,
To live or die
And I never eat you unless the fucking, meat looks fresh
"It's cold out here"
Rest your head on me
Why 'Cause I think it'd be best for the who To hide the mess from who
Now I have taken control I was taking control
This is what it feels like
You lock your minds up, shut the curtains, you close your ears
 Go ahead and cash in your antiwar songs sucks
Never been kissed
It doesn't matter
Adrenaline is telling me when someone's thinking they're too cool
I go wild
I don't understand
And I was looking at me, yeah
But then I thought
I'll bathe my eyes in a river of salt
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Just let me die
I want you so bad tonight
But must hold inside yourself
And take your sorry ass
Goodbye dad time to make amends to me but you don't see me
Embrace the wave
That bitch, the cinnamon spider
My fist'll break a fuckin' boulder in half
Someday you will see my face
Into a world that you may not remember
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
You know they got me trapped
But that's just so far from the truth
I forgive you now I'm moving on
Truth and lies has consequence
Bad words smashing your soul
I'll tell you what I got, boys, I got this
Into a hollow sky
Is it in you now
Are you happy now
I'd go through hell for you no matter what,
Drowning in a sea of rage
You will need them when I bury you
And I'm not living without you
I took your piece of shit for real
Everyone you love, but does she loves you back
It's a violent pornography
It's an inside joke
White kitchen walls with a thousand windows
But it's all you want
One way or another, I'm gonna see ya
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh
People rising from the highway 
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Well let me tell you this, I am shamelessly selfinvolved
Never went commercial, Never TV screened that shit
To save your disease
Jetzt wo du für immer verreist, werd ich noch mal zu dir gehen
"Leave my fucking life alone"
I got to get on with living or get the hell on with dying
Perhaps he's got a shot and now he's dead
But I manage 'cause I'm a savage inside
There would be no music
And a thousand times I've thought again
And you must stop that damn track from going
Oh someone stop me now I can't do this
Without even thinking
You're staring at me from across the room
Got their sorry asses stapled to a goddamn desk
So muh'fucker if you want this encore
Fuck silence, fuck that
Suck up on the dregs, sister
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
We're the bullet in the middle of the belly of the beast
There is no one here but loneliness
Hey, you're not rid of me
That raised its branches into the sky Every branch of knowledge
She stopped to see herself in the mirror
I run from love, but seem to feel the pain
And ever since the s I think something's in my Tylenol
All your lies are bound to break your neck now
I'm not passive aggressive, but I had to leave
You say "Republic", I say, "Blind man, it's a cage,"
Another nigger used to make another buck
Don't need to be taking no children into this abuse no no no
Is my back all that bad
Makes you believe, makes you believe
That's man who says it's your turn in the barrel
The Unites States wants me for what Hahahaha
I love to watch you tear it up
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore
Get your forced confession, I am fucking lonely
Waiting in the ground
I am feeling weak again so please rest with me
Then they could ever try to fine print on the inside of that warhead
Just to drive me wild
In a betty crocker oven
No crooked spine no tornup rag
So find a man to fit my shoes
Wanna be somebodies
Kill smokers through blind vanity 
I think of what it tastes like
I'm looking for a way to become
Has fingerprints that belong to you
L'armistice pour les nôtres qu'il la fasse signer à d'autres 
Mama Mama Mama Mama I couldn't say no
D'un passé lourd de portes a casser
I'm glad your daddy's gone, baby,
That I've been messing around
If I was naked and screaming
Crossing my fingers and my t's
I love the way you kicked my face in 
Burnt hands but features so clear
With a smiling face
Murder is fun because my daddy told me so
Slaves to city streets
You earned my trust but then you
They're runnin' this here town
This time I'm not coming back
The sicker the quicker, thicker, the fatter watch 'em all scatter
I see an image of the future that we don't have
You can try to pretend, you can try to pretend
A heart can't be unbroken oh, oh, oh, oh
When I don't like what they talk about
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Uh, now, it's the opening salvo,
I can't understand it must be crooked
Alors quand s'arrête ce manège,
The bible tells us Jesus Was a rockstar
It would've made a mess
Dreams where the TV made 
To the chest I bust Then we ride till the sun come
And come to bed again
For days and days and days and days and days and days and days and days and days and days and days and days and years
You're gonna die tomorrow
'Cause they know the only thing that they could send me is cheques
A black flag and a red star
Reality fired her wooden bullet, splintered under our skin
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Enough in a way that I'll probably say you destroyed me
Repentance needs ventin' when in
I hope you see my middle finger from the stage
Praising the devil they said
War Ooh, yeaheaheaheah
I hear the dying screams
I know you used to be him
You rush in a game of lies for need
Ask my pop, "Can you solve it", this game, I'm bleedin' to stay
I don't wanna wait
Better find the troll up hold up got a clever line to pull up
There's nothing special about it 
And now we're lazy
When I choke
And lives that hide in scriptured lies
Oh, you don't even try no more
I hope you hear this song boy 'cause I want your life to end
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
Keepin' warm
And if they don't know then tell 'em this
That won't ever seem to break or bend
You need a little love, I can give it to you right
It's not safe out tonight
In these days the beat is militant
And the evil inside you is my revelation
Do you know how they prey
Produced by your god
Sleep walking through the allnight drug store
I'm not no animal in the zoo
Go on, get back to where you belong
Now lost, replaced by fear
And Juliette wanted Romeo
Alert the masses
We will fall
Why does it feel like
Rants and fictions of violence
And when I scream, I will scream until I'm gasping for breath
No more sexstarved teachers
Fuck tha police
"Last person in the world you wanna fuck with" repeat X
I got a fresh pair of nike shoes
And the gun's in my hand and I know it looks bad
Lay your head down, child, I won't let the boogeymen come
Did you pass 
Early morning exorcisms keep me awake
Your darkest little lies
 Well she was asking for it
When I'm lonely, yes, I know I'm gonna be
And I might just fuck up the place, a disgrace
Because the drumline's going wild in the San Francisco streets
They wanna ban us on Capitol Hill
Though awkwardly unnamed
A knock on the door brings no smile to his cruel lips
On the palm of my blue hand
Suicide  I kicked it
Fo actin' like a bitch
But I don't mind tonight
Lights in our eyes
And now you're gone, gone, gone
Now there is one less tongue that will bend to say your name
Beg until you cannot speak
Popping shots through ya rearview
Looks real cute, her lips are sore
You were dark blue
So you can live to face more punishment from my divine lips
I've got the love that's strong not weak
I don't mind if you read while I'm coming
Breathed hope into our future, before he died, he smoked the sky,
But if they could talk What would they say
Yours are not lives I would save
You love the things I say I'll do
Of this honest fool
You know you're being used but still you play along
Things will always go their way
Layin' down, suckin' up
Was there nothing in that promise
I use the back of my hand
Tell you I got fire
The building and the club you niggas know how I pop off
Instead of fuck him up to me fuck him up
Pollute my heartdrain
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it, checkin' the 'male' clicks tongue twice
I taught you how to cyclops rock and then you turn around and break my heart
And rested there on you
Shut up I'm about to tell you 'bout the difference you'll never make
That said the things I dare not say
Into another cerebellum
In violent times, you shouldn't have to sell your soul
All of my memories
Your grave, it's your grave
I ain't trying to be another one on the list, that'll make me a true son of a bitch
I can't even help my little brother,
The flags of freedom flyin'
Gotta fight back and reclaim what's truly yours
Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
His lips an' eyelids black
You're not getting through
They had the run of the house
Hate  and fears
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word
You want a piece of my fucking time
And as I wait, I'm dying For you
Just a little reminder
Might our anger not find a better target than ourselves 
A little closer to the edge a little deeper in the mud
In these days don't beg for life
Answer me  answer me
I am a fool I know, I know, I know
Every time I turn around you're there
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open
Absolutely nothing
We still pretend
To be taken back to younger days
While them that defend what they cannot see
Twist to the side to catch your man's eye
Please, just remember me when I am not around
It tell me just what to do to spend a chunk of this bread
Splinters So you want a piece of this
Every scratch every click, every heartbeat
When you start to raise your head
You just don't get it no
Oh, I don't know just who I am
Only a loser would live his life this way
And I betrayed you with a kiss
I thought you were a better man
As long as your mouth is shut
I can always break but I can never bend
So pass me my rose tinted glasses again
Well I'm not gonna sit around just waiting for you to get over him
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
And waiting
There's a crack in the blank stare, back in the black raised hair
There ain't no doubt about it
The workers need ambitions
Do you only want me 'cause I'm gone
Just wanna' run away today
I'm starting to wonder if you really believe
Okay I don't know what else to say
But that's the only way I know
The grace of falling snow
And I know that you're trouble but,
And what you did with human life
Cry on a pillow, weepingass willow
A noise, your phone is ringing
Beneath the body armor and weaponry, my heart quietly thumps and whispers
This ammunition never rests
Yeah, foul play nigga
I want you to make me
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Niggas be shootin' the gif like they for real
To sit and witness your illusion before you burn
That's why they giving drug offenders time in double digits
The tunnel two thousand twelve the way the shit packed up
Waste my time if I'm lovin' only one thing yeah
So take all your guilt and play with someone
Trying to remind us it's time to awake
Of course not, I got no mercy for no one
If you take the sacred things
She has a hook in her head
Fill my heart with song,
So don't you dare mess with my mean machine
Smoking in the sky, damage the ozone, don't it
We should have known better than to trust
I'm sure she doesn't know 
Means my Grandmother's gone
Behind these eyes
Doch dann fing es an mit den Sachen die war'n weniger zum Lachen
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living
You poisoned me through and through
Happy now
The ballot or the bullet, some freedom or some bullshit
So many trampledunder footwear
Lie  don't lie, x
Oh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
You fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun
I make hoes pop collars
And make mistakes
Deep sleep covering
He'd rather be doing something else now
Scared the shit out of me
Accept me as I'm not, and that's a shitfit
Needless to say That you've got problems
Stomp stomp stomp on the bodies below
Blood roses, blood roses
They say you need to pray if you want to go to heaven
What about cigarettes and alcoholic drinks
Cause my heart can't take it
It was just two miles from here
If you were a woman and I was a man,
The last call, ballin' up my palm in a fist
Out on Bail You know what fuckin' time it is
Real niggaz, biatch, you know, ha hah
A little bit closer
But you gave into foul temptations making all the
And no one's gonna save us from the lies
So you could go to the opera, dumped all of my girlfriends
That there is no race more human
A les paul single cut away
Frosty mug, big ring leaders top secret thug
I did not shed a tear as I watched the snow fall
My mind gets filled with rage
Once you get a little life
Never feeling normal, can't accept the truth
Taste the salt of my tears
You can make me wrestle naked
Say pretty please
BSide of the single "Old before I die"
Streetwise paid the price never enough nothin' to lose
 You know it's real because
Just another day in the city life, city life
Just because of my hand
Tear it from my heart
It's no mistake
While you were selling your soul you mess
Human cause
The motherfuckin' world is a ghetto
Whispers in the walls I hear
Tu non lo fai perché sei delle Marche
Who's next that wanna ride who
I got a rock and roll band
But confessions good for the soul
Chun King, not home
He's just eighteen for now but he's going to murder us all
On my life, on my head, don't wanna think about it
How many times have you been put to the test
I want to see you fucking dead
Nobody in this house
In theory I respect your right to exist,
Ain't no way for a boy to be
I wanna be a stupid and shallow motherfucker now
This is the beat that my heart skipped when we first met
Look to the sky, 'cause I need some guidance
The weak are the liars, the strong think too much
The bigger that you get the more you wait
My hate for you defines my lust
Let's sing the death song kids
Barely got the time now
Keeps you always believing
Bow to your queen and I will crown your head
I think I sealed my fate
Girls on a free ride to an open grave
Like a potato, she got fiveoh on the payroll
I don't remember
Hey man, you know I'm really OK
But it feels like something's missing
About the mess your clothes made
I had to wear a paperface
Und diese Kinder führn uns ans Licht
Then we would be relieved
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred
Ya dis me and I'm a dis ya back
In a year no one will even care
The matador in black, killin' bullshit allegories
I owe you every day I wake
Does he walk around all day at school,
Feel no shame, feel no shame, feel no shame
But I got 'em back
Crazy talk, I fucking love it
Still I sense
From her to eternity
En unión con sus hermanos 
You wouldn't even give me the time of day
Under mass hypnosis
Another industrial ugly morning
So far from roadmarks or homecoming games
It's about a faith
Last four years of my life
Feed your empty brain 
I've have been working the treadmill
Just sitting, waiting
I'm not saying to go out and do some stupid shit, commit crimes
I'm not sure I'm prepared to write it down
I be hearin' these niggas
What you want from me
Twist your fingers up, grip your balls
Abgefallen von Gott bin ich der Versucher
Control the audience
'Til you died but you're still alive
Straight up with the truth I give you liberty
Shock  Is all in your head
So why don't you suck on the end
If that is how we let it burn
With any thought of you
You know however cute, she's a monster in disguise
I am too cynical to say I don't give a fuck
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
They think the south is like a planet of peckerwoods and bozos
Hey you know, sometimes I go down to the club
Dig me in the white stone gravel
"Hopsin, I fucking love you, 'cause you supply the best rhymes
Please write a script that's made for me,
Ask me why you feel deceived
Why and how you had the heart to fuck up my whole life
And don't forget to give me back my black tshirt
Where no passerby can see
Money can't buy skill flinging at will
Dinner's getting cold 
Mom I'm okay, I'm just thinking
Shit hawks abound, in the town of bullet dodging
All inside the palm of my hand
My morals left to decay
Making lists, sellby dates or being rich
Nevertheless I'll live for all eternity
It's getting out of hand
Asking can't you see
Worried you smoke too many cigarettes
Lockin' us up I got a feelin' I'm
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
I submit no excuse
I just want it to be over
I attack all the lies
And mires me down with velvet arms
They're buggin at the eyes 'cause I got mad styles
And make me feel the danger
We'll be living in the future
You gave me a chance at the palais de danse to prove I'm worth your time
Suffer not Your neighbor's affliction
For the creation and cultivation of the plant
Now you know, now you know, now you know, now you know
Don't ever tell me how I'm meant to be
They say the road's a dangerous place
Muzak soundtrack to slow collapse
On the verge of knockin' muthafuckas out for no reason
Got friends but I just can't pretend, I'm alone
Provoke the ravenous mischief the counter rhythms are rowdy
And judge on subjects muthafuckas read about
Shadow whisper, breaking chalice
Flashback
I'll bet he will die of loneliness, yes
But this is not my trip 
I don't give a fuck
And give us a song we can really play
But doctors warned him, he'll die if he fights again
Because everything I say is everything you've ever wanted to hear
"Violence in America today is not cause for the war
Backwards gibberish
Make her know how it feels to miss you
On loyalty the victims choke
I'll show you no love
I'll look back on my life and say
It's four months now from when we started and nothing feels much easier
While so much still stands in our way Yeah
Take me, take my life
But promises mean nothing to me anymore
My eyes are bleeding
All of my hate cannot be found
I want to drink the honey blood
And now I feel like I'm alive
And hated them
A rapper so ill, my flow just stole Jehovah's heart
Disturbed is the word,
Deep water, deep water, senseless denial
Make everything from toy guns that spark
I'm not afraid to take the fall
These memories never fall, yeah
Vielä nousen
And fuck all his clones
I had to beg you not to leave I thought you were my friend
Brings the pain of light
Rotten and dirty,
He's just damned
Sing it, sing it
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
All dressed in your black
He's got a gun
Tell me what you think your pride is worth to me
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
She's talking to a hypodermic reflection
And to kill another, and to kill another
When I say you sucked my brain out
Oh God, he wants to break you
Though devilish karma can't penetrate the steel in my armor
I should have turned away and ran
Man, I could use a metaphor, but I can't get beyond this shit
But can I buck him in the city so I never lose P Dog
You surrender
If I could only see you now for about an hour 
But what good is a medal when your dead tell Uncle Sam I said
My pulse reverberates through this malleable shell
Off with the friends you couldn't keep
And leaving with my life essence embedded in your dirt
Evolution killed it all
Your problems are not our concern
Game came through, put the city on his back
Take the time to learn to hate
I feel the hurt so physical
Combien de personnes n'ont jamais cru qu'on aurait tant de plaques amassées
It's gonna set the sails, and send me back to you
Let's leave this world behind
That obsesses the heart
This cop who died in Harlem
Midnight's on the way I'm losing my connection
Why are you so sick
I don't need to take your shit, get away from me
With the upper hand
I said, "This stairway ain't to heaven
Its meaning is lost on ears shut tight
But it's man's world so keep him at bay
Flood barbedwired skylines
This is my life
Found another lead singer
They'll get you in the end then you'll pay
Discover dishonor with its thousand commands
With no hair in between, know what I mean
So stop breeding violence it's neither the time or the place
Toward distant stacks that shout "Feed on demand"
Do you want more more, more, more
I bare my cross, my soul, myself
I need someone
The restless comsumer flies
What the fuck
These are the things I can do without come on, come on baby I'm talking to you come on, come on baby let me shout shout, let me shout
What we most dislike
Son lies about, taking classes at community college
Cut your pride and watch it bleed
Did the hate filled wanna build bunkers
So I swallowed the shame
And now I know what I'm about to lose
Doesn't end at the end of your block
And, kid, you're sick
All its hate, All it's pain, so
And I know things could be so much better yet why don't we just give everything up
You call yourself a friend The teams are drawn
And see that look on your face
The masschosen leaders for a brutalised nation
I touch on the shit that they be leavin' out
The king of all excuses
The price of food is goin' up
And there's no more disguising this decay
Da war ja noch ok was ich gut versteh
I believe in moments, transparent moments
Sell a nigga rocks, bail a nigga out BUT
I don't care I only have one life to live
Have you seen your dog it's a lasserapso
From Marcy to Madison Square
To kill another and to kill another
I won't play the fool, I'm not screwin' around
This shit's making me crazy
Seems to cultivate the brain
Your ass will make ya shit your meal
Ignore, this curse
When there ain't no other way to feed us all
You ain't a friend of mine
Then tryin' to go on with my life
Grab a gun, grab a knife, even hands will do
If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
Drowning out the constant nonsense
God does not evolve
You're so pure  you know the cures  just keep us poor
A word that turned into a crime
And out on the porch the fly strip is waving like a flag in the wind
All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay
You wanna be ruled
Love, I don't get enough of it
Hello, hello, hello, hello
And it makes little sense
I ask why But in my mind, I find
When all your worst fears materialize
La laisse seule face à sa table 
Believe it
Gifted with talent are no big deal 
You were making fun of me
There is no design for life
Und verschont mich nicht und verkürzt die Frist
You go click, click, click
Godspeed the day, godspeed the day when we're the
So you could go to the opera, dumped all my girlfriends
And you won't do shit about it, like the Church during the Holocaust
I made it up to make up for all that I never really did
Old ways don't seem to know
There's a chance you can make it
I've got them in my garden now and
Though you know she's everything you'd like
gilt weder Ordnung noch Moral
We were the world
I'm waitin'
Another memory dies
The palace of answers with me, Marie
I can't believe I ever hurt you
I wanna be a horse full of fire that will never train
The face of Eve turning What sky did she see
But it's so different when I know you've gone
Don't cry Just die
Sad can't stand back at that deep end
Wait~ The promoter bitchin, is this asshole trippin'
Every single one's got a story to tell
We've done nothing to brandish our disguises
This is how I feel
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
How many motherfuckers gotta pay
From beating up black kids
But it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
I'm a be right here chattin' with your bitch
My mouth is open, my book is shut
Ashamed, naked
Cooking slowly in a frying pan
I know something you'll never know 
Here comes the hands on the leashes
There's a rising tide in the rivers of blood
Manhattan's sinking like a rock
Trapped in a world that he never made
Without fists
I gave you the benefit of the doubt, it's true
Everybody's riddled with disease
But we forgot Mr Bigot, okay, dig it
And fuck your short memory
When they get what they want, and they never want it again
Fuck you for all the shit you dragged me through
But we dance to the beat
I'm fucking tired and I'm saying goodbye
You hear the voices as the wind blows 
And I hate you 
Fate has no compass fear has no driver
Flowers cannot express the loss
Of the original face
And I'm so sorry 
I was dancing when I saw his brains run out on the street
It's been awkward I still offer it when it's that time of
I think they know that's what's coming nigga, just bring up
Load up on guns, bring your friends
Bear or it'll die
Get on your knees and let the games begin
And a million watch gideon scribes, but once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide and that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish while profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is death and doom, my occupation puttin' flesh in tombs
Swimming through a hazy shade of passion
A second of trust or one ounce of faith in anything you're about
Minnesota nights, but our frostbitten fists
You don't scare me I won't turn my back
When I'm the girl that you want
Fuck all of the people driven by the greed
That you're making me wait
I feel a lot like this town I'm so rundown
In a normal fashion another  or 
You fucking, you fucking ripped my heart out
It's never ending
As we sleep to burn the red 
My friends talk
And strum down all the pain
In this world of piss
A passive aggressive
I'll be right here waitin' on you Aight
You wanna feel it, feel it, feel it
U get on the mic wit that bullshit bitch Bitch then it's all on u
You wanna lick my wounds,
Go to hell lions, tigers, and bears
I'm gonna twist your hand to stay,
The rape of the Mother is the loving I need
Don't hang around, don't call my friends
Mm, but the way you play your game ain't fair
We live it, we breathe it, we screaming murda murda murda
That's for putting scars on my mother's back, BO
I only wish for snow to fall
All he needs is a knife
Bury your soul
Living in fear of Satan and the witches
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Someday I won't have a brain 
And left you home alone
I know what it's like I know what it means
I'm a lying liar with my pants on fire
I wanna drive them,
We take a pill, get a face
I locked you out, left you naked in the front yard
You can poison my cat
But I'll just tell people, "I don't give a fuck about that shit"
Ebon splendour
Yeah I need a place to hide
To be beatin' on and throwin' in jail
As you want to talk some sense
I don't feel like I'm doing it, it affects me
And the soldiers stand guard at the keep
No eat, no sleep all night
We think you're a joke
Is it different enough
You will be like your dreams tonight
The lines that cut right through
This one is mine
You always push me down
I know she loves you
Hold my knees, lick your treat
We call shots and the beats are rolling on
And every time you make your friend the beaten, yeah
All this bitterness wells up inside you
I'm counting sheep but running out
If your money ain't right
Smoke my hoochie, you say that I'm the Devil, reali THC
Changed the day that I met you
She'd gone out playing
Voices screaming in my head
Wake up, lonely, hating my life
Mais dis moi qu'est ce tu crouais kpone inc
Whatever you want
It's not over till you start again
If I give you just a little bit you're gonna try to take it all
They drained my very soul dry
From her to eternity go go go
I never thought
You cannot change the way I see
'Cause if you can take a fucking dick, you can take a joke
Bend the people to our will
Here's the thought that gets me
That says I have about one second left
But I don't think I can so fuck you anyway
You drive me insane
Losing it
So mommy best advice is just to get on top of this
Mix blood on blood in a family recipe
Out of the mind
They spit on my name, and now I have a gun
A sea of sins left unredeemed
A drop of blood to welcome them
Then tell me who let that fucking door half open
Like that game where you gotta put the hobnob in your gob if you're the last one to cum on the biscuit
We'll need more than  minutes
Gotta make this money and I make this money
With halloween teeth
Doesn't matter what we say
And when it all goes to hell 
I don't care for the government, neighbourhood watch or health warnings
We need your medicine
Love her and she'll return it
I'm thinking that I'd rather be stoned
Hate on me, but you can't deny skill
"I'm gonna be your right of passage, so boy you better spread, spread em"
Will you ever feel ok
Would you still know which one was me
I ain't gettin' my leg shot off
Living like a house on fire
Whyeeieei am I feeling no pain
It's not everything I am, my dear only friend
And fuck 'em and feed em
Throw the bodies into the streets
Get in back of the line
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell
Oh what is truth and what is fear
Turn my bones to sand
All of the drugs that we took
More motherfuckers die by accident than on purpose, why
And now his skin is kind of light
'Cause you're not fuckin' me
Don't you know I won't pick it up
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
Yo, I talk morbid, just to make you feel awkward
Used to love niggaz now I plug niggaz, and slug niggaz
I can't believe I hung around with you
I wanna take you home, but your friends won't let ya
I never meant to make you cry 
Just kidding world, you know I love you
I am the blackman, you're the white 
Where's the Holy Ghost at, how long's it take man to find it
I've been in the poem of many a poet,
Why don't you go fuck yourself
Don't need no Madison Avenue War
And in storms my husband Wilbur in a jealous rage
Just face up to the fact that you get what you give
I can hear its melody from here in the waiting room of hell
Best believe that I'm a pass on that, ain't got time for no asshole acts
Who was cursing him out
You'll cry out for mercy, but still there'll be more
So I'm thinking to bring my  but you grab it
Get the fuck away from me
And there is still nothing about myself I respect
On and on to the break a dawn
So what I wanna go off and fight a war for
Back and forth through my mind
Bitch can hide a treasure chest, in her breasts
Bloodsuckers looking at me stuck with mice
Time to get scared, time to change plan
What a cruel world clarity brings
In the paper, the news every day I am
And they try to take the money up front
'Cut Up Your Friend'
No flag waving celebrating your invasion
That you never made
They just wanna know if they can come with us
Slip the little prince in the back door
Hush now, don't say a word 
And if I haver, whatever that means
The master said, "If you don't whip 'em, you're dead"
I listened to everyone now I know that everyone was right
Die muthafucka, die muthafucka kill
It's sticking to my face
I rip it for the ghetto kids
Do it now, Do It now, weak, jealous motherfuckers,
Cause' your making me weak
Mmm, oh yeah, oh baby
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
So why does everything seem desperate now
Now, now you know
You just closed your eyes
What the hell was it that the President said
In bed alone lyin' myself
But I'm not going down I'm not going down
When I start drinking, my dick does all my thinking
Whoa oh honey, you better think about it
I will break you 
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be
It's the ache inside when it all burns out
That nobody liked me anymore 
And I don't want to hate
 No security, no guarantees, nothing like that for you and me
But before you go there's something you should know 
Wanna need you
And then you intellectualized my emotion
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
They don't understand It won't be long
And I put her in my claw
But we are older than you You come you wanna
Nothing in this whole wide world saves us from this situation
Morticians wait with a shovel and a fork
But it's to make the world safe for democracy"
And talk like you're a pro at this
Until I made it
A billionaire chatting with his friends,
Go sit back down, 'cause I can't go back until we just finish
Still sticking it in
I'm not easing the gas until we both can sleep, we might as well be
Yeah cancer people can't smoke weed
We'll bring them chasing down till they're all dead, they're all dead,
On your front lawn
I ain't goin' to war for a shit talkin' president
 Well, what yes, that's okay, I'm going to let you pass it but what'd he say He had a nice little phrase that everybody should know "Change only comes"
Everybody sucks
Who got biggie and who shot tupac
To give me the needed professional help
To the Hollywood world we made out of Barbie doll hearts
For it means destruction of innocent lives
Oh, I just want more
I don't believe in the fear
All shall feel my wrath
In the dark and secretly,
What I have to see, what I cannot be, inside you
People don't talk about keeping it real
Into the arms of angels
Kick rocks, mother fucker
America takes drugs in psychic defense
Blood in my eyes
I dug another hole to bleed
See this through and leave, my friend
Scarriddled saffron eves bleed like the conjugal
Make you think I'm gonna kick your ass
I really wanna, wanna see ya, wanna see you explode right now, yeah
Always one fateful night
Eight faces turned away
 bass over twisted metal
Convicted with no excuse
Change must come through the barrel of a gun
Let's face it you're basic, you aren't half the man that I am
Damn near dead to feel the wind beneath you
Go back to sleep
Or lovers, like spirits mingling in the mist
So many lights but
"Scratch my back and I will stab you in yours"
Now you've got both, what do you want next
I don't want to let go
All you know about me is what I've sold you
They knew all about the new world
The world starts making sense to me
Now it's  and white people say, "Forget it
You turn into monsters at night
It ain't no pop cause that sucks
You think you're the shit
The neon forest is lighting up
Fuck everything, fuck me
Get up off your knees
Like the noose on my na na na na neck
But I ain't here for your empathy, I don't need your apology
I slap you after bustin' a fuckin' nut in my palm
And I'll tell you things that you already know, so you can say
Mama always told me I was crazy
'Cause what I'm talking about here is
But really I'm just giving them back to you
But I can handle myself with the best of you
Such a lack of taste lack of taste
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you
'Cause dumb is back
To scared to ask for help
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man
You're giving in to failure
For individualism and ripe brains
The one who is always alone
You left your guru out there hangin'
I watched closely as the you I knew forgot me
This is the first day of the rest of our lives
Yeah, gonna bleed from life
'Cause the dye is cast and the bitch is back and we're all dead
On your head, on your chest
It's time you woke up before it blows up in your face
I needed your words
Now I'm somewhere I am not supposed to be
He spews out his sweet and salty sermon on the audience
I'm alone on my throne in this universe of fear
He'll fuckstart your burp hole, jet in burgundy pleather
I'm feeling kinda trapped, I gotta go
Don't wanna sing about no vivisection
Things ain't always what they seem
Die ik heb gekend
And I will make you understand what it's like to be me
No, I can't fucking stand it
Fresh from the northwest the hottest thing lately
You just got burnt, they're gonna rule ya
Beat a police out of shape
'Cause now that I am gone
Hittin fools up with the big ass L
Paperface, paperface, paperface, paperface
Show your hand, show your hand, show your hand
Still remember what it tastes like
A massive offensive
Say a novena for all those lost
I'm So High and you can't feel it
You never listen to a single thing I say
I need you more than ever now that I know who you are
As far as I can tell you've created your own hell
Just give me something to hold on to
Nice shot
I've been humming too many words, got a weak selfesteem
I stand around at American weddings
Take it pull my hair back Oh
Then have the guts to stand for something
I'll twist a nigga's shit just like a fucking contortionist
A dark angel leads me to evil far beyond the grave
Everyday  I face it
Enter the eye of the storm
Woman like a man, woman like a man, woman like a man, like a man
The morning is hell
She mouths the words please to the poster on the ceiling 
pois no fim da guerra todos perdem
Madman, madman
What a life, you wear it like propriety
Your composure gave you away, next time it's best to cry havoc
At least I'll die with a name
I can't stand you hoes, uh
As retarded as the sound of deaf people arguing
Keep your drink, just give me the money
But you really can't function you're so full of fear
Though I know that I'm not useful anyhow
It's all implied
Shoes off, hair down
Siihen painetaan
Tony Touch classic, knowhatI'msayin
Uh, I want you to trip like I do
But if you kissed me now
And then you pretend
A trusty number 
When Radon levels drop we walk the trails and talk and laugh
Stag shit
What the fuck do you got
And come back for my Rolls
Or drive a cab in New York 
This house is full of mmmadness
In the back of the spine where my darts is lodged
On each hand I shake
Dump yo' bitch ass back around your way
If that's what you wanted
But for now I'll lace up
I wait for food that is already spoiled
My way, remember screamin' my nameame
You're giving me a headache
You'll always miss my big ol' body
Hey hey, now mother mind
A rock could fall out, traded for royalty rates
Breaking into you
Nah you can't borrow shit
Watchin' Good Will Hunting, holdin' hands and drinkin' milkshakes
When I'm pressed up on the wall
Our hearts beat in slow motion
Is he coughing now
I am pure fucking evil
They eat shit, like faulty plumbin'
And get it made overseas
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum
Make him feel like a congressman
That's the word don't you know,
Push shove you're always in my face
I can't allow what has begun to tear me down
You and me were best friends we talked about abortions
You ask me what size it is, not what I sell
It won't be enough this time to say sorry
They say they are Christ's disciples
It makes my feeling go numb and black
I'll be calling out names but I ain't taking attendance
Got to keep it on the surface
I don't want what else is running out your mouth
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
Of this stupid game
He's thinking of his lonely room
And then look at all my friends 
I am  your  friend
Überall Bilder mit beklemmender Atmosphäre
I'm screaming through your door
Crocodile tears join to flood
Just how to make my world fall back
While it tears me apart
wie es die Frauen lieben
Acceptance of normality is what they want from you as proof,
You know how this part is
And you think so you're so fucking right
Bring her to my door now
You're my perfect tragedy
That I was wrong but not a crime
Contract your own sale, fuck a deal, you're in a option
'Cause you just get fucked while you're locked in a prison
In London recording to Fuse, I'm the man that confused
See the broken glass
Pacifist guerrillas move undetected through concrete jungles
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
I don't trust myself
Nigga, you couldn't handle half of me
And I can't cut a rug, without my fashion drugs
Heavenly devil 
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a hasbeen
Be coming don't believe it just belife it
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
And left, right, left
I am just like everybody else
How many happy endings do you need to change your fucking mind
Beat the drum, beat the drum, beat the drum
Never ending persistence
If you gonna leave me baby leave today
You thought might kill
You're the pain that I feel
They say, "You're wrong" again Every bit as wrong as you were before, when you first divined your word for love, now you wear it on your tongue, saturate your lips and kiss someone You're beautiful
The sky was grey like your heart
They're hawking me from high atop the food chain
Trying to step in my circle I'm leaving you purple and black
How many times have you been mistreated
There's always someone there going
I didn't give you my heart
Go to hell, go to jail
With the spark to bring my punk rock back
Working for the devil
I do not catch the spark x
Gurgling bloody mess
Shock around the clock, from noon till noon
So yes they have said things about you
There'll be no sleep till the morning
You swim I follow I'm feeling my head sink
It makes the world go round
But I dug my teeth into my knees
That you know, and I know better
With no sacrifice
May turn may turn, may turn, may turn
Someday that I might see things
 Okay What was the basic premise of Mao Mao Tse Tung said there's only one way a revolution can come Do you know, Millie How did Mao Tse Tung say the only way you can bring a revolution and keep it
As some warn victory, some downfall
I'd trade an eternity, that's why, you fucking forced me to say
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
Making scary sounds
I don't wanna be up or down Why
I'm the one that speak the language of fate
Ooh, yeah, oooohohoyeaah ooh
Me, I have the odd future motherfucking sargeaning
I do this for the dead, rest in peace I'm holdin' you near
I'll spend the night in here
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Now who's a faggot, you punk
Next Jehovah's Witness to come on my porch, I swear I'm slammin' the door
Until my friendship is a part of the phase
"They can have this revolution as long as they remember who gets to win the war"
You empty shell
Tragedy in your own dream
How many times do I have to say it
You, alone and graceless
Your days of glory 
As we go up, we go down Is just a lie
The crowd you're in thinks you're so amusing
You can jerk niggaz but you can't jerk me
I'm not a body
Cause this one is mine
You're a bastard you know it's true
Stumbling around in a mental circle because you never cared enough to be black
I am the animal who will not be himself
And Goblin You get no props on it
See when I be coming through kicking it raw, niggas like, "Gee, he's dope"
Still I do not understand
I wanna drive to vegas in your nazi car
Don't give me your shit, don't give me your nothin'
I do it because I want to, not to stay in the game
Greasy palms rubbed in delight
And burned beneath the ice
People are waking up
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
I'll write the world a brand new song
And hold on
And some scars on the skin
I can feel it in the air breathe
All the world revolved Around a perfect circle
There's nothing left to use
I know that they do it better
Perds pas de temps va, va prendre l'air, va reviens pas
Vibe revealed and revolved spinnin on a record y'all
And she lost the game
My kids can't eat my love for hiphop
Three legged dogs that chewin the wrong food
Janet Reno has no ego when devoured by the id
Beg to join me here or stay where you stand there to deny all your faults and beg to join me here
Whyeeieei is my bleeding heart beating
How the hell do we set stuffed
Pick my heart up off the floor
The road is turning for me,
And you won't feel a thing You wont feel a thing
It's everybody else, it can't be you 
Blow up in the face of my rivals
I heard horses came to
You call it romance
They'll never break you, but you keep it comin'
Eternity is not a sunrise
You're so fuckin' big
The one mistake you made was in your head
I say, "What you wanna do " She say, "It's simple, Marcus
I just end up getting hurt again by myself
Lemme put you on game
Now you're dead, now you're dead, now you're dead
He knows that something somewhere has to break
Där dyrkan utav döden är den enda sanna tron
We're ascending through the hollow mountain
Like no other guy
As tears roll down below your knees
Taxes and romances
And I've been racking my brain figuring out what to say,
I don't know why all I need is someone to save me
And won't you please let me in
I hope that I can leave here with my soul
At first, I'm like "Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine"
Promptly fell asleep
My soul tickles, but this ain't even fun and games
Gazed upon by the eyes of multitude
Back up in your ass with The Resurrection
What about those things
I wanted to be free
What's a man now, what's a man mean
And check it out and make around and pick a rooftop P Dog
I feel like a boy the age of 
And you talk like you're a pro at this
The size of a half a dolla'
This feeling of anger
Buck 'em and scram, don't use the shotty no more
'Cause I got a bad habit
When day light comes he's gone again
Not with grace but loathing
The queen of clubs drinks in pubs on days off, over
Everyone wants America's
Woman hello , help me, help me
And the right of men that you learnt only to forget
To war, to bring death not peace
That we should now begin our freedom for to win
The enemy is right here g, them foreigners never did shit me
Then you know a bigger burden comes with it
Is not my volition
Marijuana on the planet earth
Uhhuh I'm at home now
I wanna see you when you're high
With your barbed wire pussy and your good and bad weather
And I don't know whether
What the fuck do I know about a grenade
You'd be wilding out if you knew I had packed my things,
Her heated head and arms across my chest
Out of the blue and into the fire
She then strung me along threw away these years
So don't you give me give me give me your nothingno
RULE love me or hate me baby
 Hey daddy
But seven days a week
He screamed you fucking crack whore called me a fucking bitch
I'm not affected you've been rejected
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love
You want someone to hurt like you Forfeit the game
But your daddy left you with no love
Never get to fall in love
He seems not to wanna trade
I don't have much time left
This cannot be all that there is to life,
Screaming, there's the asshole
A spider underneath my skin
Poison, girl poison
Silent screams, quelled with pins
How the birds will sing
Ain't it just a bitch
I gave you a wristwatch, baby
Oh oh oh oh, If looks could kill then death would be my name
And if you're gonna cry to me baby
Yeah, rock out, whatever
And I don't care now what you say I don't care what you say
On the morning of the first eviction
This nigga screamed like a bitch
We've all felt like shit
God, are you listening I hear you in my room
Or do I try to catch them redhanded
I'll make my way up to heaven
There's no reason to live at all
Gather round you sinners who don't believe in peace
Giving back a bit of never giving a fuck
Nail your remorse to the cross
She sees her stepdaddy comin' and her knees get weak
I wanna hang your windows when you've gone to the sea
So now we've all discovered the world wasn't only made for whites
My life a chemical insanity
Of the disease riding on your lips
Rose up in my head
Keeps you always regretting
Do you know
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you
Pollution we fumble till the end
I feel my blood boiling
You were the one who put the stick in my hand
To my old best friend
It will be my last, real bitter song about you
I had my balls and my brains put into a vice
A stare in piedi anche domani
Oh yeah, he wants to take you
So go find some other man and set me free
It feels good to knock things down
Well, if that's what you wanted to hear
And I wanna slave
Ready and willing Can't stop the bleeding
Serve to remind me of all the pain I've caused
'Cause I know that none of it is true
Won't you let her taste her sins
I, I can't and I want to so bad
Huh, what you want
And nothing can take us back to innocence
It's a game 
But I don't think I can, so fuck you anyway
I hope that you're still trying to have a killer time
She's fuckin crazy and obsessed with death
She's got his number and she's not afraid to use it
I don't believe you
Your jury they will recognize the lies, the lies, the lies, the lies
Then you're the fuckin' man as well
I coulda killed you when you said your seed was growin' from his semen
I remember all the places
I am a fool I know
At least it feels that way
And fuck you and you and in addition
And you smoked with the ghost in the back of my head
I woke up in the morning
Sanction to a dirty sow
And don't tell me what they did to you
I know the world's got problems
Study of a face in a figure 
What you're seein is a dirty splash of Kansas City Eurotrash
And the anger builds up inside
I tune in with a bullet to shut down the devil sound
Und sie fragte  was ist gefährlicher, rassistische Polizisten oder Saharasand
Sit pretty now, watch the wishes fall
If she could put her hand on the brake of the land, find the treason in the diesel and the smoke, she would jar the teeth of the dull and the meek and feed them the truth until they choke
Devouring one thousand souls
Deine Ketten sind verschweißt, keiner wird dich wiedersehen
You're driving me crazy being institutionalized
That you make underground
And I hope she knows I've got this memory,
It can be really dangerous
U sound like a bitch
My arms hit the water past the disappearing shore 
When you know God is dead
Sparkling darkly as it cuts your feet
Thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
Far from the sirens and the screams
You know I love you baby
I am a poet who composes what the world proses
My mind is blank
What the fuck you doing in there
In their rendition of
And with our flesh and bones
You've got a knife for the girls and a knife for the men
And I got a habit of gettin' my way
It's never too late to learn in this day and age
Mouth loaded with a gun
I'll make you lick my injuries
To bleed and die quickly
So get with Ollie 'cause I'm probably fin to make you mad P Dog
I wanna think of nothing
In the s when the bricks came on military planes
If only I could release instead of talking to myself
To the beige row of houses and the prospect of spending
Something you don't want to view
I know where I can't know, I bleed for me and mine
Nothin' like pain to keep us all the same
My tunnel vision for life, it drives me
It's the world 
Oh, you're not rid of me, Yeah; you're not rid of me,
We're headed down to the lake this weekend
I could not convince or trust you
Sores breakin' on my funky ass feet
When I'm alone and I'm so damn bored
I know you're faking
As of now I'm down straight up
Stay TRUE  now that's the one thing I religiously pledge
From now on I'm gonna be so much more weary
For a sunrise or a sunset, you're either coming or you just left
Sulfur time bomb ticking
One time we believed but now its passé and cliché
And you suck it 
For a bit of cash to spend
ja ruotsinopettajan Visan
Living for a lie
The idle rich cocooned away from earth
Familiar exchanges
Future is a mass of shade 
My heart is filled with disgust
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
Just a little break from the games that you play
Let fall your drapes
Choking, gasping, dripping spit
Now we drive the night
But no one looks like me
Left, left, right
Everyone left you where'd you go
Hey God, I really don't know what you mean
Come on and work it baby
There's a beautiful sky tonight 
I watch them cut, watch them touch, watch them do what they came to do
At least you could pretend 
I seen your pic on Facebook, the skank bitch done tagged you in it"
'Cause time has no meaning when you're free
I knew you wouldn't understand
Oh why does this always happen
You used to get up in my head
Just passed away in here
Calloused hands and drying hearts
Your eyes were facin' your heart and soul
And your bass master, singing trout
You been hawged and your souls been damned
In your bedroom
Hot damn I'm a "Slam" ya like Onyx
I just want you to live up to
Too many happy faces, is that more than you can bear
Ab morgen wendet sich das Blatt
I think I should warn you
So 'fore you rest your case
So you to can prop up your fake cool
Tell me How many niggas brought they irons tonight I did
He looked right into my eyes
There won't be another day
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
I need women,
You only want me when you're high
Understand 
Are you personally offended by an iron on your jeans
Oh, If I could somehow make you mine
And that's how a new world began
And I can see those fighter planes
Kill your master with one cut of your knife
And I'm not benefiting
And watch the wheels go round
And Puerto Rican chicks tell me that I fuck like I'm loco crazy
Or it's gonna be a massacre, Tiananmen Square
You slapped her ass, that's alarmin'
Why do I feel desperate now
Flyin' back and fourth overseas
Brothers like me fill up with hate
One more girl on an insect diet
Missed it and hit its face
io non vi voglio credere
Now meaning is left on my own
If you can't keep your tongue
Southern fist rise through tha jungle mist
I want you to see somebody else
For the record, I'mm wreck it, even if my record don't pop
Now don't tell me they don't turn around and kiss them peoples' ass
Stand right before me, eyes wide open
Our work is never over
The sink that by his bed gives off a stink
You can never look back to the visions from the past,
I am  ft of anger
The soulless that you're made into
With your pretty little face
I'm not perfect, nobody's perfect
Where will people go
We all talk having greens, but none of us own acres
She's worked here a year longer than I
And I need you to remember one thing one thing Mike
I won't rhyme on top no tracks
All my life I've been waiting for this moment
We tell them dope stories, introduce them to the game
So much that we don't even notice that we're stuck in the box
Royalty divides my soul  in this role I'm revered
Only  percent that's controlling us
Forget everything you think you know about me
Count the bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums
And if you lie you don't deserve to have friends
And build up walls that make us safe
I'm walking away
That you want him to notice you
Through the darkness of a corridor
I tore a battle banner from His hide
Like we really still don't know who the fuck you are
I've stopped listening
I'd run so far away from you
Never anything but jump kerosene
Cut wide open and everybody knew why
"Ever think the world is just one big blubbery walrus ready to sink it's ivory tusks into you Me too"
This is a song about the everyday occurrences that make me feel like letting go
Just when you thought it was safe, you got raped
We see them burnin' crosses
They are spelling disaster 
You're gonna die tomorrow
I ran with a thug nigga, believe that
Won't letcha in for love, nor money
'Cause I could be your father, I could be your brother,
He could pick up a habit or get in trouble
Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm
Now your mother used to tell me you ain't nothin' but some trouble
They getting legal, so now I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out
'Cause they don't know what they doin'
Dumb fuck
Don't wanna take a pill
And the love in our hearts will shine
Dressed up and real fake
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Remove whatever makes you hurt
I call the play, now do you see why
I had enough of this ruckus
But came back, made up a lie about you missing your kids
By not burning in the wreckage
Lie are told but no one sees
Can't do it, not even if sober
'Til very voice is heard, voice is heard
I spit, I spit in the eye
Won't need no shoeshine
Advertising signs that con
Oh, we want to live
And find you sleeping on the floor
But I bet you say "not me"
Buy me a drink and I will tell you my name
When I found out what the smile on your face meant
What you want
Will you forgive mine
Each thing I show you is a piece of my death
With this around me I don't feel it's over
That has corrupted and destroyed so many of our boys and girls
And I'll know just what to say
As I watch the sun fuck the ocean crying,
See poison street cred weigh just about the same reflesh
You are nothing without me
Don't fuck with it
And it holds a nice amount
So please make up your mind please make up your mind
You know I can't apologize
And motherfucker yeah, oh yeah
Yo, turn him over wit a spatula
I hear the gunfire, see the blood run, smell the fear,
I don't wanna wait for you wait for you, wait for you
Fuck women, nigga Odd Future, nigga Stand the fuck up
Nights slip into mornings and days remain unchanged
Even in death it will not fade
So just where are we going now"
Some bullets in the back
And I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm the designated drinker
You do his work so fine
I can't wait on revolution forever
Only the rich benefit, it'll be a cold day in hell before I enlist
But it's ok we've got old blood and our veins are rooted to the hornets nest again
Stolen from our very eyes
Just another puppet
But baby she's not me
Feed our minds confusion
So stop frontin' miss 'cause I want that ass
So I can get back on my feet like Tina "T"urner
You think you're going to live your life alone
You move away
But you're never there for me, yeah, mmm hmm
And if I need all this pain I will find it alone
I don't know what to believe
What's the matter, my baby's dead
Now the working classes are obsolete,
Push it in deeper now
Lies prone, cold and alone
Evil, evil, man we'll get even, evil, evil Evil man
But now you're worse than before
And we fall asleep again with ties to mend
This desire to possess her is a wound
In due for respect I slap your face
You niggas are in the bottom pit, of nauseousness
Without a sense of confidence
What you did not need was a woman who was stronger
We have people who say you did it, man
They don't give a fuck And if your shit don't blow up, tough
And I'm here to remind you
The end of the Reagan Era, I'm like 'leven, twelve, or
All I get is these vampires and blood suckers
I packed up my things
When I think of all the things you've done
Niggas on a chain gang used to that huh way back
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
And no words were hasty and all thoughts were thought through 
My mother, the murderer holds me down in the road
I showed you all those moves she can't do
Richies, chickens and bitches just like you
I've watched this experience raise them to pseudohigher levels
I will not be locked down
You look like you got your clothes off the  floor
So our voices will be heard
You'll get a bullet in the back of the neck, 
I don't  know
I'm warm now so I don't care
But it's warm
With the sense of a life thrown away
Get your dirty fingers out of my hair
When something happens that makes the world go to a
Looking tight, feeling nice, it's a cock fight
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
And well I can't explain what happened to my face
But oh how I want you to know me
I tried to hold your hand
"It's hard to give a shit these days"
Who living a lie
And if I don't get that ass, well at least I did try
Oh sweetness, all I need's a brand new head
You can tell everybody 'bout the state I'm in
I can't deal 'cause I don't want to deal at all
Our patience is wearing thin as we all drown
PC caresses bigots and big brother, read Leviticus, learnt censorship, prolife equals antichoice, to be scared of, of feathers 
Hold on to your everybody
It's not true and it will never be
I have left my mark on you
Your nobody,
I don't care what you want, I just want mine
Their's no way I'm gonna be able to sing that song without
There's a place in my heart that won't kiss you goodbye that can't accept the truth that things aren't working out as planned
The kinda shit you get on your TV
I'm bound in bitter sorrow
You fake it, mistake it
I had a good home but I left, right, left
Kiss your mother now 
Fed myths to disprove by postcolonial prudes
Back and forth, say I'm a piece of shit, well that's duly noted
And my blood runs like the venom of a poisonous snake
Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
Won't tell you what or how or when
Millions die today
To make me turn the switcher
For the ghosts of our love have dried, have died
'Cause it's what makes us human
Hey hey, now killer father
'Cause I know
On sunless days we're side by side
Life is off running
Sit and watch the rain
Swayin' to the rhythm of the new world order and
I'm gonna keep you away, 'cause now I'm building,
jos olet hiljaa ja kunnollinen, tunnollinen
You're driving me crazy
Why you so angry
I'm a Rocky, run a hundred a mile before my coffee
And we're waiting around pushing our lives down and down
Just when I thought that you left me for dead
Due to sculpture but through the power and foresight
All this rebellion, all this crazy shit you got, saying this shit
Thuglife niggaz Y'all Blow that shit  Get me up out this
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna say, uh could you get me on the list tonight
Once again, it's all about me, and pride is not a factor, no
Burn singe the hair
As Zyklon beats reign to make carrion crawl
Yeah man, fight the power fuck the government
These eyes of yours
The restless consumer flies
Passedout in the gutter, wornout in your head,
Run around like a chicken, grand dragon finger lickin'
I'm waterin' my garden with some black bottle bourban
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous
When the time is right you got to get up and fight
While I feed you the heat watch how my niggas will act up
 times the pain, I could never be with you
Brought blue baby jeans just to shit on the
This is the end
"Who is that man what's he done for his homeland"
Don't hurt her anymore, stop now
You gave me shoes and pretty clothes, and I gave you what I had between my legs
I hope it kills you on your way down
'Cause I won't believe the state I'm in
I'm gonna force you to bend
I'll laugh until I am sick
And talk to birds like Kilgore Trout
It feels so good inside
So what makes you think that I'm gonna believe
That's it, we've had enough 
I was not the only one to do things wrong
A knife for the girls who never return your calls
Stuck in jail and mad as a bitch
Everybody wants to be reelin' 
You don't want the pistols to whistle
To think I once called you my friend
They wonder what's on your mind
What you need from me
What did I know, what did I know, what did I know
That's how I feel about the
Can't say that I'm crazy about anything that you do
This year to save me from tears
And the weak will never trust what they've become
But why don't you go upset yourself
I better, better, better, better not say this
Twisted ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
Every town gets an Eiffel Tower tonight
Taste all your fears, sugar and spice
But it's my first time so please ignore
That I surrender 'cause I've been searching
Two bad souls are destroyed
If I drench myself in others blood, Am I sick
Don't you know that I run this place,
And I know what I do and it all points to you 
Be ashamed
Chewed my fingernails to the bone
Hey, all right, it's Kip Kasper, KLONE Radio, LA's infinite repeat How we feelin' out there How's your drivetime commute I need a saga What's the saga It's Songs for the Deaf You can't even hear it
With the falling rain
Abuse  I kicked it
Plant your seed, darlin', my roses are in your hands
I'm an ideal portrait of a girl, I'll be your apprentice
Bring the gun, your tongue is what I'm slicing
This house is full of, full of, full of fight
All the words are gonna bleed from me
That you could sink so low
Seducing anger to haste my separation
God damn it's deafening
With a face to rip open all night
Or should you get your glasses fixed
She could be a Queen but now
Lost my money again
Yeah, whatever rock out
From the topFrom the top
So I won't repeat it no more
You couldn't pay me enough
I know I got to be right now, oh 'cause I can't get much wrongeroh
Your punk ass made it up, or your fucking mind was gone
They laughed at me wanting you
These phony living rooms and
Until the day I die
We all pass the hat around
No, no, not even if sober
Because you know what they'll say to you
And you'd never have known
Four dead in Ohio How many more
Another unknown soldier
On the end of your bed
Abendessen, in die nächste Kneipe gehen, Bier trinken
Up on my high horse
We came a long way from not givin' a fuck
But yo I'm not Phil Collins, I'm more like Henry Rollins
No, sorry won't save you this time
This whole damn place seems to, lost control
Always there to touch but just out of reach
He wants to sit down and think
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun
You are the one at fault
I got four walls I live here
I'm gonna kick it in the arse Big Brother's got no heart
"Nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are"
No one will take all of me, and the fire will stop
Like it or not
Of the leftist elite
I don't give a damn about my reputation
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
And sister, she got married on the Island
On to the wall buss it freefall, freefall
I could be the thing you want, I could do it all for you
Yeah, it's time for the party to make some sound
You don't fool me
What the hell, what was that for
On the same playground
Govern my contested ways
Fuck the whole world, fixin' to catch a murder case
Put away your short leash I'll get the fuckin' chain
But I'm infected, and you're the new disease of today
STD's, sick, sex, drugaddled, debauchery, monger
Cares not to come up any higher
And death rained down it made a terrible sound
There's no eyes in your own head
Can't fake it  I hate it  please help me
I'm spinning and turning
The Hill got the skill for the static like brillo
It's the little things
Le noir est plutôt frais
Back flips, flip flops, one right after the other
The one who lives a lie
Withhold it
Tryna figure out the meaning and break apart the puzzles
I ain't been crazy in a really long time
Yes, it's a war from tha depth of time
Kiss my motherfucking ass
From day one, forever ballin
Ay, run that shit back
I don't believe that she said, you're out of your mind
Free your hate
You grew up with war on TV every night
I am a fool I know, because it's all I know
Short sleeved shit kicking animals lining me up
So far from all of the things
Flesh for foond and blood for wine
Strange men wanna know my name, sweet girls oughta play their part
While you were looking the other way you mess
I'm going crazy now
Deep inside has died
"With an eye always in reserve
Stop breathin'
All my life I got B's and C's
Irony is waiting over piety and faith
Wow, I'm gonna kill it
My father taught me many things
Perturbed if you prefer,
Hands always where this skirt ends
Don't know if I can do it
I fuck myself, I guess, I guess
Anata ga koe no, Hey, your voice
So don't just sound like you mean it
Silencing the devil that speaks with forked tongue
'Cause I'm a watcher and I'm a doer of none
Give us this day our daily bread
So this is what it's like living in limbo
Any remnants left I let slip away
Soul stripper, soul ripper
There's a wound that will not mend
And I start watching
You sexist, racist, homophobic fuckers
Who lives to raise the ones who fall
Que la millefa est traumatisée et méprisé ces sales races 
The load I am tossing
Pull ourselves up now we won't choke
But this is mere foreplay to war
Tasty but worthless, dogs eat their own shit
Depending upon ones competence
Since you and I shared fears
Like city states of ancient humans
I'm tired of niggas
And now Christmas is for shopping
With your finger pointing at my shame
Standing on the sidelines, waving and grinning
I hope that you're back up if you've ever been down
I'm a negative creep
Try to pull my finger nails out
They say more independence, more
Still our descendants will inherit our mistakes of today
You're out of your mind, get,
Does she hold you like I do
Their cup which overfloweth, is just filled up with piss
Outraged against the scene
I wanna take you in my arms so I can give
Payback
You'll find yourself, running the gauntlet, of all these double standards
I am proud to shop at Target, I'll wear warmup pants any day of the week
As it drips from your veins
Then the sea gave birth and it crawled up on the dirt
I'm living on booze and birds
I can't close my eyes
And all the rest of it
You will remember, remember me
Cry for help now 
It's fuel for the fire of a family tree
She can't give a damn on cue
I'm not like other girls
I'm just a face in the crowd
Countless heads, ears and eyes
Then you're telling lies
Why don't you sing me that
And cut they ass head to toe, jaw to jaw
'Cause I'm proud of my life and the things that I have done
We braved the cold November air and the undertaker's curses
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
I wanna try and fly
Fuck cops, I'm a fucking rock star
I've got my knife and I could get a  milli
I know I ain't supposed to cry
'Cause you don't need to look at me
So you wanna get it all back
Push pause on the game and get to know each other by our first names
Singing oh you were going to be my life
I'm obnoxious, motherfucker can't you tell
The mango and the cashew trees
Talking with you's like talking to a sieve that can't hear me
No I don't wanna here it no more
Until it all makes sense again 
In a day there's nothing
Look deep in the river and try not to scream 
And I feel like a modern day patriot
You want my confidence 
It is one less tongue that bends to say your name
I couldn't feel her and it was just a game 'cause I was lonely and she was crazy
I am just a man who knows how it feels
Everyone you meet, sees your big ol' heart
On a record sleeve in brooklyn
It ain't to play games witchu
The lord god almighty
Wreck nights, spit flames
Let me take this awkward saw
'Cause I'm already the consequence of somebody else's fate
Believe what I'm saying
When I'm crossing
Oh I turn my back, my eyes full red
I spend time by myself
While the winners write the history books defeated die poor
But no, you don't
To picking and choosing to screw all of us one by one
You take no control for the pain you seem to cause
Come father of lies your time has come
But apparently, I'm looking at physical therapy
And I hope her heart gets broken
Into eternity riding the wave
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
Lock eyes with a thousand people at the same time
Curse my mind and it's allseeing eye
Hit to lose it to, it's that crazy crew
'Cause I can make you every inch a king
But you don't have nothin' on me
It's old and it's cold and it's no longer golden
Yeah, westside niggaz is very greedy, uh
You say this ain't the end of me
Your other hoochie mamas aren't wet like me
But I'm a fool who's off her rocker
This is how it feels Oh oh
What kind of love from a nigga make you wish he would die
Act like you know, this is no drill
If I don't run you'll drive me crazy
Y'all ain't never gonna see me in this motherfucker again
Not right now
I've seen them give their drugs up in place of makeshift altars
You're not rid of me; you're not rid of me
Fuck tha police and I said it with authority
Fronting stress I'm superman motherfucker
And I'm on your back
It's such a shame that it is this way
Seven sins were wrung from the sight of me,
'Cause deep down plumbing life is too cramped for me
To clean the slate, to pass the time
Looked up to the sky, Ain't I such a beautiful disgrace
Just with your heart of gold 
I need some sleep
The race of the Mother Culture is thickening
But, not too crazy to get busted
There's a fire in the peach pit, a blaze in the snake pit
Drop that shit em
For this rap shit that I stand for
Well I got a bad feeling about this,
Rum and guns and smallpox gonna change the face of home
Win a war
I will not forgive
And we can get down right here in the street
And I know you got the feeling, 
Get down with Blacksmith or get the fuck out the way
It kills me that I feel this hurtful
And wreck our clothes in the mud
Control feeble minds then destroy our race
Thought I'd turn and walk away
I don't know if they're fags or what
Screaming convulsing
It's all over their face
Am I moving too fast Am I thinking too slow
Envisionin' so much, my minds an open window
So you know I'll be
This is a story you won't tell the kids we'll never have
You can never touch me now
Me, I'm so dirty, covered in spite
A matter of fact, exact from granduos
They would not subvert you
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Only a man could make a girl a killa
Turhempaa ei oo olemassakaan
Ahah Tell me what you believe Ahahahah
Everybody's got a little someone to crush, but me
Yeah, you're sailing away and the sun looks right on your face
Surveying this language as a game,
One day you will burn for your decisions
Gatecrasher, rehasher, big faker,
Wanna live my life
A loose vaginal passage, uh uh bitch put that back in the package
To hell with you and all your friends, it's on
Save the day
Eating your brain
I saw a man and a little boy
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
And I know these things take time
You're no Playboy bunny
To avoid the bitter end
To watch ninety five minutes of simulated torture
I don't speak the language but my last laugh's hell
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
How do you expect I will know what to do
I have a life too I've had enough of you
You're like a warped godmother with your baffling love
And now I'm heading west on  again
I know that I really can't sing
Put the ma' fuckin' Fresca down
What you fear is your desire
I'm a beat specialist
I've got the heart of a wolf and I'm thinking
"The devil made me do it
We ravenous
That I would cut him down with my claws
He's in the street, with no ID
Even bitches looking like En Vogue gotta "Hold On"
I want you to notice
I'm gonna be the man who's coming home
She gets the pills from her skills
And drive it into the lake
Well I've learned my lesson
From my mind to reality
And took most everyone I know
Now there's nothing
Sitting like a cork on top of the town
A policeman makes reverse  calls instructing residents to take to the streets
The weight of the world has dragged you down
I rock the block with glocks and brass knuckles
Of a simple life of need
The last game  the last move
Instead of playing doctor we play shoot each other and die
All alone and you're waitin' for that call
Shut up and swallow my pride and go
Let's fucking start again
I watch you make the same mistakes
And when I get sick, I will stay sick for the rest
No, sorry won't pay for this loss
And there's nothing left to grieve
Ordered his gun and its done and
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
Stupid fools
Disloyal motherfuckers I'ma BANISH you all
Then he holds his neck which was bleeding already
I care but now I'm standing on a ledge
All I want, from all of you
E non sa cos'è il rancore
I wanted to help, to help destroy the world
I ain't trippin' in the county and I'm mad as fuck
The rest is yet to reveal itself to me
When you're in Snowshoe PA
No no no more son of a bitch
Another reason to see
I wanna get connected
She likes to stand
Like we were dyin' on the long haul drives
I'm just trying to help you man, trust me
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed
Couldn't tell a soul
And you will feel young
Think it's gonna make a trendy revolution
It's romantic if they mean it when they shut your fingers in the door
Lights ain't on, shit ain't right, never had peace, but I gotta fight
Bright yellow sun that fades away to black and blue every place
Time will heal us all, yeah
A sense of life is thrown away
But he say's fuck him up he'll run through me fuck him up
This is the way I'll express my feelings
The sight of your blood will lose your spit
Everybody's living and nobody's giving
Album Version
Let me see you tear the muthafuckin' club on up
Neon black cocks rot into poison wine
Oh, eye know you're scared
Still you fool yourself to ask
Encircled by darkness
Because of all the things I should have said
Es gibt keine Liebe auf dieser Welt 
Whispers "I love you my darling" tonight
I've seen them overlooking God in their own essence
And our backbeat's to beat your heartbeat off beat, let's go
Don't find HB the man to lose, you ain't a bruise
How many princes do you think
I feed my anger with the fucking bullshit that you preach
And here's my old school, "Jingling Geordie's"
Does he kiss your eyelids in the morning
Styles unbreakable,
You know we're right
The devil cannot see through as I unload
Someday even great walls will crumble
Cause everybody's sayin' Lil Wayne spits raw
I got a bad feeling about this to hell with you and all your friends, it's on
All my fear 
It's not the truth I see
Off top my unorthodox style of attack
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth
Passed down to this generation
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
No stars to give me one wish, so lost in the dark
And then come back and tell them villagers all,
Let them hear it in the night Yes, we'll fight Let the night roar, because they can hear us, they know we mean it We'll kill them if they come
If you want it did you never want for more
Do you know you're not dead
Can't you hear my heart beating
I gave you ,  chances
That I wanna be myself, wanna be the girl
I don't want you
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
I can't hold on To anything, watching everything spin
Aberrations fill your head
You don't really know why
I give a shout out to the living dead
That's your girl Bitch get over here, give me some brain
Now I watch as tables turn
Sitting on a fence is a man who looks down on opinion
Oh, God, police, ah
Can't seem to rest with a fuckin' pain in my chest
But as long as wood still floats, I can sow my wild oats and paint the town red
Brought home in boxes to a trumpet's sound
And in the end there was no blood spilled
Without the things your daddy bought you
Do I believe it if I do not want it
In your bed 
Speak to me in tongues
Put your problems down and pick up what's left of the pain
Still feel it all slipping away
I say do what you want
Me and Merse was gun running
I don't want to hate you
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
I'll have to sink my fangs in someone else's heart to heal my own
I hope you put gas in the motorhome and know the roads,
Or I could just get a real fucking job
Would help him do the trick
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing
Will I burn at the stake to have a chance to obey
I'm in the six you got to hop in the three company monopoly
It has a very high visibility, it is why stop signs, stop lights and fire equipments are usually painted red
'Cause it doesn't really matter anymore
And all of the hypocrites lie through their teeth
When I want to return everything
Back in his house, now back in his bed
Tha programs of Vietnow
And does he cry through broken sentences like,
"Drop the guns and grab her, it's time to make a run"
On the very same day in the very same cold
Let bitter silence infect the wound
And I don't need your sympathies
I want justice
I feel so stupid when I look back
With your hand me down views
This girl's getting caught in a lie, 
And three months on in this bad design won't make it feel any easier
It's the social circle that you're not part of 
She gave it all away, she saw her baby break
There's a base viciousness that nourishes my spine
When I die Die, bury me Me
I wanna sleep
All forgetting why the clothes of the rebel sound
Captured my heart
I never wanna see your face round here anymore
But without my friends
I'm trapped again in endless rain
Is this what you want for your children
In the states of the world
I got to box you for the money, said it might end
Ha, now ain't that some shit ain't that some shit
You believed in superstitions
Socially paranoid
And you'll dismiss it cause it isn't what you're used to
This year to stop me from tears
I'm your fucking queen
We don't need you, We don't need you
The working man got so tired of waiting
Finding a release in prayers and psalms I will obey her articulate commands,
Hotter than the thought of Nicki Minaj naked, making her booty shake
But flesh and blood never divine
Born at the badder side, half this time still await
An old friend convinced me that he was underjoyed
'Gainst the lassitudes of Death
Formulating flows in revolutionary science
But it feels like nothing helps
Now we're at the end and it's over now
Here we go, here we go, here we go, now
But I could never stop the torrent
But no bodies ever knew
You're the truth that hurts, hurts
Everyone wants it all
Do you only want me 'cause you can't have me
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
Your taste, your smell, your love
Lost on the street because you don't know what to do,
If we never took a taste
When you're ready I'll be walking out that door
Rest your bones,
Yeah, interest games, their interest rates
Leave me tonight
This isn't no fairy tell, I never had it easy
Don't drop the beat no
Around these silent streets the seditatives tell you everything is alright
Give it back
He's talking fuck him up at me fuck him up
und heut gibt es die GSG 
Because no one is going to ruin me
You had a hold on me
We had to ride on a nigga
You break the law and you breach
So you spread lies
I only fuck wit niggas that do business up under the table
The cannon sounded
Sorry I couldn't help
Needless to say, I guess you know I hate you
Life bleeds, death is your birthright 
Cross my heart I hope you die
Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment Hopefully we will be able to in the future Until then how about a random page
That appear to be determined by an unseen panel of hipster judges Bullshit
Your badmouth has killed off everything we had
Release, and run to me
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show, bitch
     attackin they frat
An ageold method towards a new direction
On roule en caisse les roues chromées ici tout le monde nous reconnait
In the mines of Mozambique
And all the time that you're needing me
Fucking righteous baby
I got a handful of lead
I have no snare in my headphones
ThugLife will never fail 'Cause I'm out on bail
I think my body's saying so
Oll my friends they got
I can really fuck you up, yeah
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
You sent them down on our city Shock and awe
All you want is entertainment
You're on your own now
In several days
My mother died of cancer, prince died of cancer, that was the end for me I just wanna to kill that motherfucking stepmother, kill myself, and kill all you And fucked of the cancer then I just wanna to be with my prince and my mother God, life's a cunt
What's life like to me
They wear hoods and carry shotguns in the main streets of Montgomery
Oh, El is back on that shit, huh
You fooled me
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or les
But making no sense
'Cause you just don't give a damn
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
It was a cold afternoon for a funeral
Gnash your teeth Like an exploding car
She's caught in a lie,
All your twobit psychiatrists
Fuck off, I'm gone after today
For the countless counts of low down doublecross
Woman in my room, their in my room
Lick my legs of desire
But we had a chance to change our mind
All the maggots made
Look in my head for the sadness you seek
Er ließ kein' an sich heran
I won the war
I am the coward and I shoot you in the back 
'Cause I know that none of it's true
Non fai rime del quartiere per sentirti grande, no
There's a tear in my heart where the love ran out
You can't believe the heart you save
You used to look my god right in the eye here
Bruise a heart, leave it there
I went to your concert and there was nothing going on
One look at the world and it promts these words,
And death the only thing you get for fuckin' with lords
You wrote it out, in blackened ink
Never mind the l'il birdies wing
Do you believe I would take such a thing with me
"Mein Name ist Legion, denn wir sind viele"
For you the time stops
I'm potent, intact, a blackhearted and lungedup
But I backed out
I string 'em to get the best necklace in the world
Thinking he bigger 'cause he's the, pick of the litter
It ends with me, wait and see
Encrust the encumbrance that encroach your brain
I made it so complicated
The mothers will cry
Yeah I know you
From the space between your bed and wall
I would die for you
When I was young PC meant Police Constable 
I'm sick of everything that you say
Is it not what you thought it would be
An earth we made into Hell
Alone you stand with nobody near
Dye 'em black
Yeah you're such a fucking liar
Don't you know they're gonna kill your sons
So don't pretend to know what it's like
We kicked rocks a couple blocks and no one talked
Per questo resto coi ragazzi veri
'Cause it's cold in December and there's reason to stay in
I didn't have the courage to say
Everything you do's gonna come back to you
Tell me something I can't remember
That a house which would be built without the sense,
And now I know why now, now I know why
A bible in one hand, he makes decisions
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
My life's all I got, and heaven is all in my brain
And I know it's right, because I know it's time for freedom
Today I cry for my sins
You say I'm trapped up in a shell
I crawl in shotgun and reach into his mouth
I want you for your body
To play my guitar
Used trucks dirty donuts you you're the one
Destroyed by madness, oh yeah
And I don't always smell like strawberries and cream
Mics spray then, bury flesh in wasteland
On fault lines
On the earth
Two faces one man
So how the hell could you front on me
Ripping through the walls
Running amok as we fuck up the stage
I wanna be a pig
In Baghdad, they they drop, they air drop water, food to people why can't they do that to their own people
World turned upside down
He pulled some teeth and I lost some blood
How's it feel to be the hunter
How do you tell your Father,
When you know you bout as sweet as a honey bun
Suddenly it didn't matter to you no more
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
Young money men play paintball games
Pentab professional, hold the ink
No, all my hate cannot be bound
The watchman, that kill us in this maze we locked in
Make you feel this 
What a life, what a life, what a life
The taste you leave is still stuck in my mouth
Yeah, give it to me easily, my feeble mind
Like a woman, like a, like a man
In the back, off the side and far away
Now I would rather you did not
Can't get my mother off my back
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way rap this way
I wanna fuck a car
Bleeding from my eyes
All that's left
Sunken eyes, a twisted spine
Unless I remember it wrong
You're nothing in my life in my head
I promised not to hurt you again
Not me, I'm addicted to sinnin
There is a war going on for your mind
You're looking at the million that you'll never make
I'm talking to you, so come on come on, come on baby I'm talking to you
 He marched  people on the Long March
Sing now is now yeah all I ever wanted
Let it be known, you can lean on KRSOne
My live source movin across with brute force
I completely blacked out, I can't remember a thing
I see the future and it's lookin' grim
Eat what you are while you're falling apart 
I'm number one you ain't nothin' but shit
I open my eyes but I cannot see
I'm feelin' really trapped I gotta go
Things are very different now
Don't you dare mess with my mean machine
Is I hate you
Sold into the fashions of the false heroes' fight
Set me on fire
I feel like I don't even know you
Right at your feetI don't think so  no
And take another step back, until you find you've walked away
I've been shot at, I've been cheated, how could you send me to this place
Shoot'em up, let god sort'em out in the end
I don't give a shit
The charges were made known to me
We'll be breaking free 'cause we're far beyond control
So I can fantasize that the chaos is not real
She wants to see galaxies
Staring at the world through the hole you put in my hand
But it ain't mine anymore
I'll display my disaffection you grind me up, yeah, you spit me out
How many niggaz eat it and shit it, you cats want it come and get it
I'll see your face in hell, my friend
I'll paint this town blood red tonight
And if I turn around
I'm a simple man, I lead a simple life, I mean simple like
You fake
Well now I don't mean to offend, much
You got to let her know you're swapping sides
I don't want to fade away, away, away 
Hammer the battlecry into braillestudded armor
But darkness is a friend to you 
Without that desire for communication
We can see the errors of our ways
When it's all burning when it's over
They don't need to use a crutch 'cause they've got the wheelchair
About some fear I have of heartache
I'm not asking to go dancing I'm not that dumb anymore
It's going to feel so good
All I can say is "It's my chance to walk away"
Within a breath, a war from the depth of time
But I still end up saying if and but
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac in his prime
I will relieve you of the burden of your six figure apathy,
Close all of the doors
I dare not ask who's been helping you fall asleep,
A voice of social change to rearrange the worlds perspective
Before the world came 
When a window which people would look through
Reclaim your honor
And later on, why not, I'll rip your throat off
Wash away the filthy things
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
﻿Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
It takes thought and time and rhyme
There's no one here to help you, no one's gonna hear
Aww, I'm sorry
Wild when I know you're near
And you bullshittin' bitches ain't changin' me
'Til she woke me with the knife edge of her glance
But when nature turns to habit
No body no fun
Emptiness, my old friend
Oh Baghdad Center of the world
That you couldn't read in any trendy New York underground fashion magazine
Or believe in something without thinking, "What if somebody doesn't approve"
With a mind that multiplied
It's all I can say tonight
We give this life to our children
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
You got so much hate,
Shifting through your city limits, trying to find the raw shit
Why did this feeling
On n'a pas l'profil type alors ils réduisent nos chances 
On est venu squatter les sommets you little shit, you don't know me
People all need a hero
My temper's burnin' and my face is red
This could be better for the world
But bobbys truncheon had to wait to show him
I never did believe you much anyway
My brother's back
This is what it sounds like  when we ride on our enemies
She will love you, if you return it
The number one defender,
I sold my soul but don't you dare call me a whore
Odd uhuh, that shit's corny as fuck
Fading facesangels crying beside me
A photo the size of my fist
You'll never learn a thing
As I'm clenching my fists so hard
Braveheart bitch like the times are medieval
Specifically addressin' the oblivion we livin' in
Another housekeeper fantasy afrodite
It's happened so many times, I stopped tryin' to keep track
A long drawn out year and I see now why
I'm leaving for myself and no one else
And I collect my thoughts
It takes a wall for the real you to break through
Now in an afterthought 
But by the time they fix my head
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Lacing my shoes, we the MellowHype jews
And you can't calm the rage
The brain of a sow kill off inside
Rattattat goes the gat to his devil's face P Dog
I'm here until the frontline breaks
But I will put right this disgrace
And you know how that goes
If you ain't got no wings
My breeze more of a fucking masculine
For everything I know
Do you take plight on my tongue like lead
I am the pulse of this fucking town, holmes, no
Or your ass is missing in action bro
Don't know what to do with it
And pull your eyelids up over your head
I know something you don't know 
'Cause it matches your eyes
The nebulas of eternity
My life is fucking pointless I'm getting nothing done
Today was the day
I know the fiction of the fix
'Til you turn it down to  and 
Nor use the voice they use the gun alone
It's the news on every channel I watch when I turn on the box
It's got nothing
This father must die
In the human holiday
I'm not ready, but have I gone too far Get stuck in a lie and all you'll hear is "let it go away"
Get used to the numbness, you won't have to feel that anymore
Forgot my own mind
You're unable to look any further than your nose
Live up in your city I'm about to steal the show
Comprends, la rage est profonde 
I know them
You don't make or break me baby
The heart is desperately wicked
With my one good arm behind my back
I self medicate with drugs and alcohol to treat my extreme social anxiety
You think they'd get the warnin'
The promise never harvested in fallow fields shall lie
Realizing the world wasn't what she seemed
'Cause I don't want you crying when we lay down tonight
Blood beneath their finger nails,
Show pictures you won't see, you'll never know
It's all trueit's all true not good but I know it'll doit'll do
Pleasantly surprised, I never thought you'd realize that maybe
Oh Baby Why won't you answer me
So what say you and all your friends
See, voting doesn't work 
Diamonds are Fuhrer's best friend
I was intimidated, assaulted, and for what
"Can you please open up the back door"
Send a reflection of myself to me
Big shot screaming, "Put your hands in the sky," Tearing out all these open pages 
And he doesn't even have a brain
I need one thing that's divine
I wanna hear you say, that you're sorry again
No no no no no no no no no no no no
If you don't live what you sing about
For just a crust of bread, watermelon, mirages and oasis that does not exist
Of this dick that cums lead
"'Cause then we'll know the party has gone on too long"
The more you cry your ashes turn to mud
I want you to listen, son
No man abandon his post A gatecrasher has called us to arms Take up your torch
Rappin' like the Treacherous Three, fuckin' cowards
In the end unity will be thrust upon us  lanketed, stipled
Those kids suck, check it out emcee
You say I have a problem
Buy this car to drive to work and work until you're fucking dead
Do you want it 
I'm making good friends with you
Exposé a mes façons de faire classé X si trop expert
I don't mind tying up the phone
nur damals setzte man Henker ein
And I'll take your hand and pick you up
Show a little bit of skin
If I listened to all the snake niggaz that's runnin' they mouth
So don't fear if you hear
Now what kind of life is that to lead
It floods with fury, fights and fits
But I know a thing or two
Why'd ya do it, she said, they're mine all your jewels
Lying tricks told them dicks I had a key
Without the dirt on your face"
I'm back to run this, bitch, I strive to keeping it humble
I have two big hands
I'm just faking it
Cunts are still running the world,
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
Take  shots to the jugular
Tanto non li ho mai avuti, li ho sempre spesi prima di farli
When your hands close tight around my neck,
Piss in your heart and be that, and be that special girl
There are ribs in the fireplace
I'd have helped you out
Taking flicks around the corner
I look back behind at the
'Cause you could lose it in a tussle, nigga, watch me hustle
Make no difference what you say
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other
Better back if you know what's good
You were always lonely somewhere
Evil, evil, we all know the reason, evil, evil Evil man
Casualties of their own flesh
Hold on now, hold on now
And creation and time are made from destruction
So, we started living together
You get the message
As long as it agrees with how you feel
Yeah you, yeah you
All the things you said to me
'Cause that's what a muthafucking monster do
Just the little things
And my face was scorched, scorched
They have no food but the boy have gun
Into the toilet without faces removed
You've got some nerve to come back here
And I say yeah, what do you have to say for yourself
Don't you know gonna kill, kill your sons
I know she means well, but I was proven wrong once or twice
I'm here to put you through hell
And make the most out of life
Circling over your head
And where was God when I came to an end
There was nothing I could do
And promised Christendom in flames
In the realm of peace All the world revolved
You play with the odds
And I scatter the bits
You confused me in a way that I've never known
Uoho, hey now
And fuck you for standing there smiling
You greedy fuck you pissed it all away
Dusty and disgruntled and crusty,
You may not hear me calling
Won't they give it a rest now Give it a rest now
Y'all niggas is lame, my niggas ain't sane
Hating you should be introduced as a new law
And we want to live
I hope they choke
Until we find another space,
Hell fuck yeah
Come on let me shout, shout let me
You say you're taking me over you say
Who would you want
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
One day is now
I die up inside her
Well I need a fix
You made for a bad lover's liver
Backstabber, backstabber
Parking lot to the spot, marriott
Too much guessing, too much "need to believe" 
Tearing the epidermis from your skin
While you handpicked motherfuckers givin' up transcripts
I had a good home but I left
I don't know if I could trust or if I could sits on my shoulder hell no
A knife for the girls who want to come home for just one night
Adrenaline is the lubrication, focusing my mind
Gotta learn that I gotta get through autumn first
I taste it now
Yeah, you're living a lie yeah living a lie yeah you're life is living a lie
Nobody gets close, nobody dares
Fuck this and fuck that
You're different from the rest, sister
And for you girls who be up in the club innocent age with a fake ID
Their wisdom so profound to cheat us of our ground
Down that hall comes the end of my world 
Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized
Used to believe in revolution, realized I was the only one
Oh you know, the usual, not much How you doing
I can make it go away I can make it disappear
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
Woman like a man, like a man, like a woman like a man, woman like a man
The substance assimilating to watch the bodies burst into a string of lights
Resent what your told see the truth inside
I'm talkin' greed
Let her know you're swapping sides
But American made
It's never ending, I jus wanna stand out
Just it's all you want
You need some pleasin' your love I'll be squeezin'
Husband, I could not abstain
I made this for you
If you wanna sleep with me and talk about existence
I want a feeling, worth paying for before I say goodbye
Someone gave a fuck Tyler
It's like I just can't get shit right
And lately being mindful of the babies I admit
Because I feel the strain
And when you wake from the shell of this body
Where a ghost was calling me
With straps and chains, we slap you in there
Hoe I only tell you once that this dick ain't free
Kkeuchi boijil annneun oeroumui mangchi
If you've learned anything from me
Run trains on, golddiggers beware these fo' niggaz
But you won't burn long
If people whisper
Drew a line between love and hate
I'm just a cloud watching the moon rise
Into the life of lithesome Juliette Bell
You breathe life when you set me free
You can beg all you want but you gets jack shit
Those downtown hoods are no damn good
By the way your the one I need
You burn me inside, so I put you in your place
You'll take away all that I'm asking for
I never been on the receiving end
I cannot take it, I cannot take it
And you didn't see the rain you didn't feel my pain I was left inside with no complaints and with lies you feed these fuckin' guys
I've found the easy way to die
I knew a man who hung drywall
 it's life, death and I can't think of a better way to end the day
You're not the same 
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Reagen plays the liar  power's his desire, there's nothing for the world we can do
NO you're on drugs
So dey play dumb
Nigga wheneva my bitch, fuck that my sister
Smiling in their faces
Took you to Target for a birthday meal
Fuck the motherfuckin' district attourney and the prosecutor fuck you
You can't fool me with that crap just leave me alone
Oh, this stairway ain't to heaven
Pump this shit
The lines are down, drowned by the hum of the radiator
I was in my room and I was like just sitting there staring at the wall thinking about 
He likes killing you after you've died
And I feel so sick my life
We have no sympathy for the lost souls
People like you just burn
I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
U whinin' like a bitch
And I can't help but feel pain
I snapped "who's that dude", I don't even know his name
As far as real niggas, bitch nigga my battle's sick
Spawned from eternal semen bred flesh predators
I told her she was killing me and
In bed she flexes her knees to try and abate the feeling 
"It's always this way," 
Aw just the little things
So they can get all the money they can when it's released
Make troubles then I blow off suckers then
And I don't want to see you fall too far away
Raja tulee vastaan, tässä omani
Jeffrey Dahmer enter the room without cuffs
When things don't go my way I have to
It figures the wheezing will measure your rate of depress and I hope you know
Don't need your protection
Hitech weapons are here to reassure it
Ah, it's time to pack up and move to the next town
Japanese God Jesus robots telling teenage fortunes
So I showered down, left my little room
They all can see him, they know where he's going
Just make your body burst into single line
Like my guns dirty and hands clean
You spend your time sitting in circles with your friends
Little bitch ain't a genie in a bottle of glass
And I felt my head exploding
What you need to see
You, a cavalier
The clock is tocking and it's laughing at you
With teeth
And if you leave me now
But my heart can't take it
They stand and laugh as they watch you crumble
Oh, you know how to take a man and crush him
My toys were my friends
Hold on, hold on
You pass on to me
Sure enough you know who's gonna
The Lord knows,
Move closer or drive further
Niggaz hit me I'ma turn into the crow *caw caw* and take a shit
Just one touch she passes out on the street
They made you the enemy
Pretend it works a while you don't try
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
The�night�sky�is�deep�and�wide
Mother fuck a war
And I like to get up in the sky
I'll make you bleed
Cause all I wanna see is motherfucking brains hanging
And all this tension back and forth
Pivot when we visit, spit victim if you stand there
As I'm made to
Oh oh, you backstabber Hope grabber 
You're no martyr
While you were licking your lips
That's my place, give it back
Love in the middle of a fire fight
I'm getting sick of it
Like nine fricking hours and fortyfive minutes now
Let 'em hold me down
He wants to pour you a drink
That skin will get numb
Kill that man, kill that girl, kill anyone you want today
Like some, some Imagined warrior production
I fell in love with my enemy
Better pray your soul to keep
Well evil in your eyes baby I don't care
Its time to let you know that
Keep you away, 'cause now I'm building
What are you waiting for
Would you turn on the light and come down
I'm singing this song
Everybody's lost just waiting to be found
City street dweller every asphault different
And it's been a while, I'm a little annoyed
There's an old street light near a garbage can
We thought for one instant we forgot our gun
I got the face of a million strangers
You're not walking away until your heart is torn, our tears are reborn
I make the beats that boom boom boom in they trunks
So the mind can fake it
I, I, I don't need forgiveness
Grazes my skin
And takes from the land just what he needs
I care but I am close to the edge
Hard life is hard as hell, better back the fuck on up, 'cause this is
Our real selves take a back seat behind the pomp and the façade
Vi vandrar hand i hand till andra sidan bron
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds, toilets clogged
And when the money comes in for the work I do
You can bump your gum
Time will tell how much they denied you
You will know my name
Wired over the thoughts I've dialeddialed
From the guys that's running the show,
In a slipstream of my possibilities
Yeah, when I'm gone the weight falls on me
There is nothing you can do
Hmmm, what you talkin' 'bout punk
You know ya need it all
The battles started are far from over
Take what's yours, Walrus's of the night, take your prey, with tusks bared in the burning light,
