Too many faces are glowing with pride and assurance
But it's their loss
Don't you see
The skyscrapers
They're too big to bring down
Awareness of our conditioning is slowly seeping, leaking
The cracks we've made in the temple of want do seem useless
But it's their loss
Step away 
The mind rapers
They will drown in their greed
Stop the want
Don't let it fuck with you
There's a little pile of ashes where my old life used to be.
Credit cards and memories all dumped into the sea.
Well this ain't no time for bull as I fly into the sun.
Well you can't trust anybody if you can't trust number one.
Well the man tells me my future, is not so far away.
And get ready for tomorrow, I gotta waste my whole today.
My inner luck knows better, it's what I wanna hear.
Just like a diamond bullet where it's crystal crystal clear.
Whoa Yeah!
Whooo!
I can slap a tornado,
I can dry up a sea, yeah.
When I live for the moment,
There ain't no ain't knowin' me
You'll never find your pleasure if you worry about your pain,
And your precious little details are stretchin' out my brain.
Well you spin around and bite your nails, now let me tell you son,
That you can't trust anybody if you can't trust number one.
Well the man tells me my future and it's not so far away,
And I get ready for tomorrow, I gotta waste my whole today.
Well my inner luck knows better, it's what I wanna hear.
Just like a diamond bullet where it's crystal crystal clear.
Whoa Yeah!
I can slap a tornado,
I can dry up a sea.
When I live for the moment,
There ain't no ain't knowin' me.
Now don't you sell me no future, yeah.
Don't you sell me your love.
I ain't vouchin' your number,
You couldn't pay me enough.
I ain't buyin' no future when the past is so far away.
I ain't buyin' no future when the past is so far away.
I ain't buyin' no future when the past is so far away.
I ain't buyin' no future when the past is so far away, yeah.
I can slap a tornado,
I can dry up a sea, yeah.
When I live for the moment,
There ain't no ain't knowin' me.
Now don't you sell me no future, yeah.
Don't you sell me your love.
I ain't vouchin' your number,
You couldn't pay me enough, you couldn't pay me enough.
Couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
Couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
Couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
Couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
Couldn't pay me enough.
Couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
You couldn't pay me enough.
Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our Rice Krispies
We can't hear anything at all
Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take
Many miles away
Something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark
Scottish lake
Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today
He doesn't think to wonder why
The secretaries pout and preen
Like cheap tarts in a red light street
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Many miles away
Something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch
Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race
Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now, looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
Many miles away
There's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake
Many miles away...
My freedom is best, whole country's on house arrest and everyone's a suspect
You can't feel the flow because you died, face-down on a suicide
The motherfucker's on self-destruct, nobody guarding your back, it's all a front
Save this, my rage is bliss, I'm taking names and getting pissed
Where's Chuck D when you need him?
You ain't shit, just a puddle on the bedspread
The maniac psycho, Cool J screamed the shit, but I still can't believe it
Man, it's funny that you scare me so, just enough to fuck me up again and again
Hard life is hard as hell, better back the fuck on up, 'cause this is-
No kind of life, this is no kind of life  (I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life (You can't blame me)
Can't be real no more, your mask is skin and bone
Savor every flavor you got, 'cause it's not your own
Bad ass at bat, man, forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win
Breathe, amber-cult, breathe, one more, seethe, freak like you got a pair
Won't be my fault when you're painted in the corner of a no-good life, this is-
No kind of life, this is no kind of life  (I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life (You can't blame me)
I can't remember, I don't understand, is it malice that makes you this way?
Carry it with you till someone forgives you, I laugh, 'cause there's nothing to say
You can't begin to consider the palpable hate in the air when you're here
None of us wonder what weather you're under, you're making it perfectly clear
Lights ain't on, shit ain't right, never had peace, but I gotta fight
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against the wall?
Slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me 
You're all reality and sound bites, and the freedom is never in plain sight
The feelings, the question, the price is too human for fucking sake, this is-
No kind of life, this is no kind of life  (I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life, you can't blame me
I can't be, I can't be, I can't be blamed
When reason dies behind closed doors
Face down in a cell in a pool of piss
It's time to fear what we should respect
It's time to question cause and effect
Striking with impunity
Hiding behind flags of immunity
When corruption rears its ugly head
The force of law becomes a farce
Personal ambition usurps justice
The rich protected at the expense of the poor
Would you sit on the fence, take no chance?
As those batons fall, turn a blind eye
In an ideal world
There'd be no need for law
No need for police
But in a society so sick
So obsessed with blind greed
Someone has to protect
The old and the weak
Officer down
Can we really afford to be so selectively blind?
If we dig too deep what would we find?
At authority's heart beats a dollar sign
Under such a regime we're all doing time
Striking with impunity
Hiding behind flags of immunity
Never say, you weren't warned
When they come to drag you away
To silence the dissident hiding in us all
They clench the fist of ordained might
From which side of the barbed wire
Do you want to see your life pass by?
When reason dies behind closed doors
Face down in a cell in a pool of piss
It's time to fear what we should respect
It's time to question
Cause and effect
Who teaches the teachers?
Who makes laws for lawmakers?
When they read us our rights
What about human rights?
The enemy in the mirror
Eyes of fire staring back at me
I am the judge, the jury and the executioner
Of everything I've tried to be
And now I think I'm dying
I could pray for rain
I don't believe in anything
I have cried so long that I can't feel
I am dry, I am dry, I am
I'm in and out of consciousness
You want so badly to get through
If I can't even save myself
Then how am I supposed to save you
And I think you know that
I could pray for rain
I don't believe in anything
I have cried so long that I can't feel
I am dry, I am dry, I am
So here I lay on the 
My mouth is dry and my hands are shaking
I do not know anything
I'm afraid to die
I could pray for rain
I don't believe in anything
I have cried so long that I can't feel
I am dry, I am dry, I am
I could pray for rain
I don't believe in anything
I have cried so long that I can't feel
I am dry, I am dry, I am
I stutter like a broken clutch
When you touch me too much
My tongue gets twisted in your twirl
You say I'm not your kind of girl
A spider underneath my skin
I want you out, I want you in
The venom and the vaccine swirl
You say I'm not your kind of girl
What kind of girl should I be
The kind of girl who doesn't see
That you're looking at me like you wanna be seeing someone else
Somebody else
You rip the sureness from my stare
And throw the pieces in the air
Your fingers string me like a pearl
You say I'm not your kind of girl
It's not a secret anymore
What you keep me around for
As my excuses all unfurl
I'm not that kind of kind of girl
See somebody else
See somebody else
See somebody else
(I want you to)
See somebody else
(See somebody)
See somebody else
(I want you to)
See somebody else
(See somebody)
I want you to see somebody else
Slag pit
Stag shit
Honey bring it close to my lips
Yes
Don't blow those brains yet
We got to be big boy
We got to be big
Starfucker, just like my Daddy, yes
Starfucker, just like my Daddy, yes
Selling his baby, yes
Just like my daddy, yes
Going to strike a deal
Made him feel like a congressman
Running in the family, oh
It's run in the family
Rest your shoulders, peaches and cream
Everywhere a Judas as far as you can see
Beautiful angel calling,
"We've got every re-run of Muhammad Ali"
Prism perfect
Honey bring it close to your lips
Yes
What is termed a landslide
Of principle proportion boy
It's got to be big
I said it better be big
Starfucker, just like my daddy, yes
Starfucker, just like my daddy, yes
Selling his baby, yes
Just like your daddy, yes
Selling his baby
Going to strike a deal
Make him feel like a congressman
It's runnning in the family, oh
It's run in the family, hey
It's running in the family, hey baby
It's run in the family, hey yeah
Mother Mary, China white
Brown may be sweeter, may be sweeter
Mother Mary, China white
Brown may be sweeter, she will supply
She will supply
She will supply
She will supply
She will supply
Supply, supply
Give me peace, love, peace, love
Give me peace, love and a hard cock
Scar me with your loveless hands
Consume me with your shameless want
Dig your claws into my flesh
Now I know you're having fun
You should have known that I'd bite back
Did you think that I forgot?
I don't know how you call that love
I don't think that I can stop
I'm pretty much fucked
Your taste, your smell, your love
You had to rub it in my face
Twist all that I said
Exploit my weaknesses
But now you'll have to pay
Down a tunnel, in a tube
On the floor, knocked down by booze
Busy man has blown his fuse
While crossword people look for clues
I say sir, get your nose out of the paper
Take a good look at what's going down
Get clued into the shape of
The shape of things to come
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Reaching out for you it calls
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Did you look for your cause?
Writing on the wall?
Life, I'm told's a compromise
Lethargy in disguise
Excuses by the faint of heart
Stuck in the mud before they start
I say sir, wouldn't you rather be
On top of the world
As opposed to always travelling
Underneath the ground?
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Reaching out for you it calls
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Did you look for your cause?
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
I say sir, get your nose out of the paper
Take a good look at what's going on
Get clued into the shape of
The shape of things to come
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Reaching out for you it calls
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Did you look for your cause?
Writing on the wall
If you ask me I will say I'm fine
All pink like birthday girls and valentines
And then the stillness of the night reminds
That I don't like to be alone
My thoughts are race cars running 'round my head
They burst into flames and crash into my bed
Until I fall into a dream instead
Where all my lovers turn to stone
And all I want is company
Someone to understand this misery
Send a reflection of myself to me
'Cause everybody needs some company
These times I'm living in just make no sense
Sometimes my face gets pushed against the fence
I want to scream out in my self defense
But I don't want to be alone
And all I want is company
Someone to understand this misery
Send a reflection of myself to me
'Cause everybody needs some company
Oh... what is truth and what is fear?
Will I find it under here?
I know they're selling me a lie
But I'm the first in line to buy
First in line to try
Oh...
I find some sanity on the written page
Where life is worth more than a living wage
Oh, they say the battle's over now 
It's time to change
Oh... and I won't ever be alone
Oh... and all I want is company
Someone to understand this misery
Send a reflection of myself to me
'Cause everybody needs some company
Someone to understand this misery
Send a reflection of myself to me
Mmh, 'cause everybody needs some company
I need some company
Mmh, woohooo...
Some company
Yeah, yeah
Shut the fuck up, take the pain
You can never understand
I'm the one, you rejected
I'm the one, you won't forget
While you sleep, I destroy your world
Getting sick of all this
You're no use to me
Your only crime is you're an easy target
Open your brain and I'll destroy it
While you sleep, I destroy your world
You noble diggers all stand up now, stand up now
You noble diggers all stand up now
The wasteland to maintain sing cavaliers by name
Your digging does maintain and persons all defame
Stand up now, stand up now
Your houses they pull down stand up now, stand up now
Your houses they pull down, stand up now
Your houses they pull down to fright your men in town
But the gentry must come down and the poor shall wear the crown
Stand up now diggers all
With spades and hoes and ploughs stand up now, stand up now
With spades and hoes and ploughs, stand up now
Your freedom to uphold sing cavaliers are bold
To kill you if they could and rights from you to hold
Stand up now diggers all
The gentry are all round stand up now, stand up now
The gentry are all round stand up now
The gentry are all round on each side the are found
Their wisdom so profound to cheat us of our ground
Stand up now stand up now
The lawyers they conjoin stand up now stand up now
The lawyers they conjoin stand up now
To rescue they advise, such fury they devise, the devil in them lies
And hath blinded both their eyes
Stand up now, stand up now
The clergy they come in stand up now, stand up now
The clergy they come in stand up now
The clergy they come in and say it is a sin 
That we should now begin our freedom for to win
Stand up now diggers all
'Gainst lawyers and 'gainst priests stand up now stand up now
'Gainst lawyers and 'gainst priests stand up now
For tyrants they are both, even flat against their oath
To grant us they are loathe free meat and drink and cloth
Stand up now diggers all
The club is all their law, stand up now stand up now
The club is all their law, stand up now
The club is all their law, to keep all men in awe
That they no vision saw to maintain such a law
Stand up now diggers all

(Lyrics: K.Lonnsjo)
Gazing up to the blackened sky
Makes part of me slowly die
Among a clouds I can see a dove
The messenger of love
Follow it, they said, to paradise
Afterwards I hate them and their lies
It was the beginning of my demise
I've been in Paradise, don't want to go back
It makes my feeling go numb and black
I couldn't find the desire of my heart
It was far away and slowly breaking apart
Hypocrisy and lies
There is no fucking paradise
Looking for the love of my life
It isn't in your fucking Paradise
I'm grasping for air, so thick I can't breathe
Inhale, exhale, asphyxiate
Among a clouds I can see a dove
The messenger of love
They don't much care for you
No, they don't like your kind
The way you look, walk
Or the way you talk
The way you always speak your mind
But you want to be my friend
You're not anything like them
You can show me things I've never seen
You say: "Ooh, child what a waste 
If we never took a taste
Of everything we find in between"
Ooh, you make me nervous
Ooh, you make me want to run away and hide
You make me nervous
When you look at me I just can't lie
Ooh, you make me nervous tonight
(Yeah)
Feels so wrong and feels so right 
It feels like insanity
Oh, I keep acting strange
Hoping that I'll change
Waking in a sweat from a burning dream, yeah
And then look at all my friends 
I keep on pleasing them
Caught up in the chaos of their minds
Ooh, child, the fear I have
Keeps me bound and keeps me gagged
Pushing harder all the time
Ooh, you make me nervous
Ooh, you make me want to run away and hide
Ooh, you make me nervous
When you look at me I just can't lie
I want to shovel all the blame
I want to shoot out all the lights
I want to call you names and start a fight
Because you make me nervous tonight
Hey...
Heart pounds, hands wet, mouth dry
I shake, I scream, I cry
No eat, no sleep all night
I build my lonely cell 
With secrets I can't tell
Oh, frozen in my fright
Oh, oh
Ooh, you make me nervous tonight
You make me nervous
You make me nervous
You make me nervous
Oh, you make me want to run away and hide
Oh, you make me nervous
When you look at me I just can't lie
I want to shovel all the blame
I want to shoot out all the lights
I want to call you names and start a fight
Oh, you make me nervous, nervous, nervous
Ooh, you make me nervous tonight
He is down on bended knee 
And that's all very well 
Like to live with you someday I think that would be swell 
I love the way you kicked my face in 
Then left me for dead 
Like to be the only person
Pissing in my head 
And she brings me sunshine
She brings me sunshine 
Thank you kindly leave now Would you kindly go away 
Take your worn out Y-fronts 
And those ones that have gone grey 
I don't care much for parasitic life-forms anyway 
Go now please and 
Close the door behind you 
On the way 
Seems so very clearly now 
The mess was in my head 
She likes the things that I like 
And to laze around in bed
Suddenly it seems to me 
I made my face go red 
She brings me sunshine
Cracked paint, faded signs, she said "I'm done
I feel a lot like this town I'm so rundown
Did the job but it up and died
I've got to find something new that I can be now
So what defines me
Are all my best days and years behind me?
Far from the places we used to talk about
Picked up, chewed on and then spit out"
We kicked rocks a couple blocks and no one talked
"It's amazing I can fit five years in a broken cardboard box
Well I guess I'm still alive"
Blueprints they blew up the story's old
You grab a hold of what gets thrown or else you drown
See ideals and my visions all burn up
When the sun and nothingness beat down
Then we caught our reflection in the window
She said "I act tough, but we both know
That this puffed up face is safe in well worn places
Hurts to let it go
Give me some answers 'cause now I'm lost
So just where are we going now?"
When it get's dark in this town
It feels like everyone's asleep
But you come to me and you ask me out and I say okay now
For tonight, tonight is for us
You've got me babe
And it feels so good to be on top of you
I've got you boy
And it feels so good to be on top of you, on top of you
Now I can't feel a thing
I am numb, I'm everything you want
Whatta joke, I said go, boy you have to be one hundred percent
Perfect
And tonight, tonight you prove me
You've got me babe
And it feels so good to be on top of you
I've got you boy
And it feels so good to be on top of you, on top of you
Speed toward hell
Shed no tears
You don't know me
Take my life
Steal my tongue
To defeat your taste
Could never criticize
No better 
No better than you
It's easier to lie
Than to tell the truth
You've become the waste that I despise
Speed toward hell
Shed no tears
You don't know me
Take my life
Steal my tongue
To defeat your taste
Could never criticize
No better 
No better than you
It's easier to lie
Than to tell the truth
You've become the waste that I despise
This is the motion of the new revolution

The trance is the motion
The trance is the motion

The trance is the motion

This is the motion of the new revolution
Your tricks are all so clever
Yet they all think you're sweet
How many others are out there?
I wish we all could meet
Why can't you ever admit
You're such a hypocrite!
Why can't you ever admit
You're so selfish, you're so BLIND
Why can't you ever admit
You're such a hypocrite!
Now tear off all your blindfolds
And see YOUR damage UNFOLD
You're so selfish, you're so blind
Now tell the, Now tell the TRUTH!
Tell HER the truth, ALL of the truth
ALL about US! The time has finally
Come now for you to be a MAN
This time I won't take YOUR FALL
This time I'LL take the stand
Your blindness is so frightening
Your deafness is so COMPLETE
It's gone on way TOO long now
You're such a spineless creep

Cast to the fire
Banned by the light
Worship and listen to me
Condemned in his mind
In his evil place
Your fate is all that you'll see
I am the one
To show you the path
Salvation is in the fields
Listen up children and follow me
Or I'll let you pay
The price of malachi!
Disciples of the watch
Obey!
Or I'll burn you to that cross
Holding the mass
The demon is cast
To resurrect your soul
Calling to him
Is like an evil sin
A prophet is what they're told
Taking the land under command
Killing friend or foe
Feel the might of his evil wrath
Desecrate your soul
Disciples of the watch
Obey!
Or I'll burn you to that cross
Cast to the fire
Banned by the light
Worship and listen to me
Condemned in his mind
In his evil place
Your fate is all that you'll see
I am the one
To show you the path
Salvation is in the fields
Listen up children and follow me
Or I'll let you pay
The price of malachi!
Disciples of the watch
Obey!
Or I'll burn you to that cross
My name is Soul and you're holding me inside should I be mad at you giving me a dime but you wouldn't be the same 
If I could kick your ass somehow you've sunk in those stupid lies in a major disguise
And you didn't see the rain you didn't feel my pain I was left inside with no complaints and with lies you feed these fuckin' guys
Though you know she's everything you'd like
Now you are so alone losing all your style everything you adore has a perfect life inside you cry and bleed
But that's not what you need some day a sign arrives and that day will be left all in flames
Now you're aiming in the dark I see your face no more now you've ruined everything and let it go and there ain't no heavy law to lay you on the floor
When there ain't no other way to feed us all
And you didn't see the rain you didn't feel my pain I was left inside with no complaints and with lies you feed these fuckin' guys though you know she's everything you'd like
Now you're aiming in the dark I see your face no more now you've ruined everything and let it go and there ain't no heavy law to lay you on the floor
When there ain't no other way to feed us all
When your time on the mountain is over
And you fall to the earth like a leaf
It won't be enough these days to say sorry
No, sorry won't pay for this grief
For you may lay down your guilt on the altar
Nail your remorse to the cross
But it's not enough these days to say sorry
No, sorry won't pay for this loss.
And if the blood on your hands turns to water
And the night in your soul turns to day
It won't be enough this time to say sorry
No, sorry won't wash it all away
For you may lay down your guilt on the altar
Nail your remorse to the cross
But it's not enough these days to say sorry
No, sorry won't pay for this loss.
When you're through with the spells you've been spinning
When our hopes and our dreams have all died
It won't be enough these days to say sorry
No, sorry won't turn back the tide
For you may lay down your guilt on the altar
Nail your remorse to the cross
But it's not enough these days to say sorry
No, sorry won't pay for this loss.
And if you should desist from deceiving
And if you should confess to the crime
It won't be enough these days to say sorry
No, sorry won't save you this time
For you may lay down your guilt on the altar
Nail your remorse to the cross
But it's not enough these days to say sorry
No, sorry won't pay for this loss.
We're on a bullet
And we're headed straight into God
Even he'd like to end it too
We take a pill, get a face
Buy our ticket
And we hope that Heaven's true
I saw a cop beat a priest on the TV
And they know they killed our heroes too
We sing the death song kids
Because we've got no future
And we want to be just like you
And we want to be just like you
Let's sing the death song kids
We light a candle on
An earth we made into Hell
And pretend that we're
In Heaven each time we do
We get the blind man's ticket
And we know that nothing's true
I saw priest kill a cop on the TV
And I know now they're our heroes too
We sing the death song kids
Because we've got no future
And we want to be just like you
And we want to be just like you
We sing the death song kids
We sing the death song kids
We write our prayers on a little bomb
Kiss it on the face and send it to God
We sing the death song kids
Because we've got no future
And we want to be just like you
And we want to be just like you
We were the world
But we've got no future
And we want to be just like you
We want to be just like you.
Just a reflection
Just a glimpse
Just a little reminder
Of all the what abouts
And all the might have
C-C-Could have beens
Another day, some other way
But not another reason enough to continue
And now you're one of us
The wretched
The hopes and prays
The better days
The far aways
Forget it
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it, did it?
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it, did it?
Now you know
This is what it feels like
Now you know
This is what it feels like
The clouds will part and the sky cracks open
And God himself will reach his fucking arm through
Just to push you down
Just to hold you down
Stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss
And it's hard to believe it could come down to this
Back at the beginning
Sinking, spinning
And in the end
We still pretend
The time we spend
Not knowing when
You're finally free
And you could be
But it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
It didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it
Now you know
This is what it feels like
Now you know
This is what it feels like
Now, now you know
This is what it feels like "(This is what it feels like)"
Now you know "(Now you know)"
This is what it feels like
"(You can try to stop it, but it keeps on coming
You can try to stop it, but it)"
Behold I come like a thief
My kingdom I bring
I come to purge the prince of death from off the earth
To war, to bring death not peace
To cleanse now all things
This is a call to arms, to conquer, now to war
We may fall
We may die with time
That day is not today
Now for glory
For my king
We storm the very gates of hell
Pay in blood
Reclaim your honor
Demonspawn your time has come
This is justice swift and sure
Your legions devastation full
Hell spawn, the air is ripe with fear
Hell bound, wretched eternity
Hell spawn, the air is ripe with fear
Hell bound, wretched eternity
Come bringer of plagues your time has come
Come father of lies your time has come
Come temper of all your time has come
Come reap your reward your time has come
Hell spawn, the air is ripe with fear
Hell bound, wretched eternity
This is an ex-neo-nazi leaders confession.
Until I became an alien,
I had never understood how stupid rascism is.
I realized my idea was wrong, dangerous and foolish
Neo-nazism never can be the sollution of the matter!
He isn't a neo-nazi anymore
Aaarrghh neo-nazis!
Why you don't notice your folly?
Why don't you throw your poison idea away?
Never too late
Miss Misfortune sails down the rails with her brow to the windowpane
The scenery that she sees in her soul doesn't match with the blur in her brain
Oh, she can trace the tricks of the tracks like the ribs of a rattlesnake
Till all her pastel chalk lines of fact are erased like a schoolgirl's slate
She is reading her own tattoos
Her diary is the evening news
She can't give a damn on cue
On a freight train to nowhere
Hey, if she were not scorching the rails with the haste of a bolting ghost there would be no reason to fear the death rattle in the engine's throat
She could call for the mini-cams, or take up a gun, or be politically correct
But that kind of justice still preys on the ones with the stones hung around their necks
Oh, she's reading her own tattoos
Her diary is the evening news
And she can't give a damn on cue
On a freight train to nowhere
She's heard it said, by the drone in her head, that the wages of spend is debt
She figures that's better than nothing to show for the years of tears and sweat
If she could put her hand on the brake of the land, find the treason in the diesel and the smoke, she would jar the teeth of the dull and the meek and feed them the truth until they choke
She is reading her own tattoos
Her diary is the evening news
She can't give a damn on cue
On a freight train to nowhere
She is reading her own tattoos
Her diary is the evening news
And she can't give a damn on cue
On a freight train to nowhere
I want you to know
That I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but
The best for you both
An older version of me? Is she perverted like me?
Would she go down on you in a theater?
Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died? But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well
Things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well
I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face, how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name 
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died? but you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Ooh
Ahh
Ooh ah
Oh ah ah
Ooh ah
Ah ah ah oh
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?
Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Well, you can tell everyone I'm a down disgrace
So drag my name all over the place
I don't care anymore (I don't care)
You can tell everybody 'bout the state I'm in
You won't catch me crying, 'cause I just can't win
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care what you say
I don't play the same games you play
'Cause I've been talking to the people that you call your friends
And it seems to me there's a means to and end
They don't care anymore (they don't care)
And as for me, I can sit here and bide my time
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind
I don't care anymore
I don't care no more
I don't care what you say
We never played by the same rules anyway
I won't be there anymore
Get out of my way
Let me by
I got better things to do with my time
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
Well, I don't care now what you say (I don't care what you say)
'Cause every day (every day)
I'm feeling fine with myself (I'm feeling fine with myself)
And I don't care now what you say (I don't care what you say)
Hey, I'll do alright by myself (I'll be alright by myself)
I don't care (I don't care) anymore (anymore)
I don't care (I don't care) anymore (anymore)
I don't care (I don't care) anymore (anymore)
I don't care anymore
Do you care? Hell no
Do you care? Hell no
Do you care? Hell no
What what?
Do you care? Hell no
Do you care? Hell no
Do you care? Hell no
What what?
Do you care? Hell no
Do you care? Hell no 
Do you care? Hell no
What what?
Do you care? Hell no
Do you care? Hell no
Do you care? Hell no
What what?
'Cause I remember all the times I tried so hard
And you laughed in my face 'cause you held all the cards
I don't care anymore
And I really ain't bothered what you think of me
'Cause all I want of you is just to let me be
I don't care anymore
Did you hear? I don't care no more
I don't care what you say
I never did believe you much anyway
We won't be there anymore
So get out of our way
Let us by
We got better things to do with our time
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care anymore
We don't care
We don't care
We don't care (anymore)
We don't care
Deep inside but still alive
A will to kill, a will to destroy
The flame still burns
And my lust returns
A will to afflict
My mind to distress
Sparing you
Is not my volition
Sparing you is not my aim
Sparing you
Is not my volition
Sparing you is not my aim
My scorn is current
Against all of you
My hated fiends
Our world needs
To be cleaned
The wrath in me grows
My inner storm blows
It's hard to control
You stupid asshole
I know that it never goes away
All I feel, everything I'm not today
So I try and I try to make everything right
I don't feel like I'm doing it, it affects me
You wouldn't listen even if I told you
Who the fuck am I to say?
You're too busy with the lies they sold you
Another cure to fix your day
Open wide for all the shit they feed you
While the TV defecates
And blindly walk wherever they will lead you
While the edges slowly Fray
I know that everything can change
What I need is to open up again
So never again will I look back in vain
Cause today's not the past
I don't need to relive it
You wouldn't listen even if I told you
Who the fuck am I to say?
You're too busy with the lies they sold you
Another cure to fix your day
Open wide for all the shit they feed you
While your TV defecates
And blindly walk wherever they will lead you
While the edges slowly Fray
Are you satisfied?
I've given all I can
And are you pacified
Or do you want more from me?
You wouldn't listen even if I told you
Who the fuck am I to say?
You're too busy with the lies they sold you
Another cure to fix your day
Open wide for all the shit they feed you
While the TV defecates
And blindly walk wherever they will lead you
While the edges slowly Fray
I've learned that this life's not just a game
Just a line between the pleasures and the pain
You wouldn't listen even if I told you
Who the fuck am I to say?
And you're too busy with the lies they sold you
Another cure to fix your day
Open wide for all the shit they feed you
While the TV defecates
And blindly walk wherever they will lead you
While the edges slowly Fray
Re rejection
Re rejection
Re rejection
Don't marry, uh, huh, her
Don't marry, uh, huh, huh, her
Don't marry, uh, huh, her
Don't marry, uh, huh, huh, her
The valley is crying
Don't ask me
Why it's grieving
Don't marry, uh, huh, her
Don't marry, uh, huh, huh, her
Don't marry, uh, huh, her
Don't marry, uh, huh, huh, her
I fill the sea
All with my tears
I drown the fields
You will remember, remember me
The valley is crying
The valley is grieving
He is, he's leaving
Abandoning me
Don't marry, uh, huh, her
Don't marry, uh, huh, huh, her
Don't marry, uh, huh, her
Don't marry, uh, huh, huh, her
I fill the sea
All with my tears
I drown the fields
You will remember, remember me
If I ride on the rails I shall ride them alone
And if I need all this pain I will find it alone
If I'm wanted for leaving I will leave here alone
And if I can't resist this then I am unfit to go
A simple solution is all I require
If fire is the passion I only aspire to be free
Let me be free if the strain on your conscience gets under your skin
And leads you to making a sacrifice
Sacrifice me
Let there be peace
To the grave from the cradle we don't rock anymore
Now I stand here with both feet planted firm on the floor
And if you're planning a future of indefinite grace
You'd better start removing the lines of deceit from your face
A simple conclusion is all I require
If fire is the passion I only aspire to be free
Let me be free
And all of the hypocrites lie through their teeth
Talk about making a sacrifice
Sacrifice me
Let there be peace
How much longer can all this go on?
How many more chances can one person have?
And all of the questions with no proper answers
Continue continue have to go on have to go on
Should I bend down and worship the ground
Of the beautiful people who live without flaws?
Success is a virtue to share with the world
But failure's a lesson that's best learned alone
Respect is a virtue that strong men command
But when words become weapons
There'll be peace in the valley of death when I rise
Peace in the valley of death when I rise
Harlequin-ee
No need to explain yourself
I was born to pay for my previous sins
Good girl goodness
We'll see how she is
Why is the world falling in on me?
Why is the world cheating on me?
Yes
Girl to girl sincerity remains
Though awkwardly unnamed
You never kissed
These girlfriend lips
A simple choice to fall away
Why is the world falling in on me?
Why is the world cheating on me?
Why is the world cheating me?
You won't see that
(You won't see me)
You won't see that
(Le magic)
Bad magic
(Big magic)
You won't see that
You won't see
Why is the world falling in on me?
Why is the world cheating on me?
Why is the world cheating me?

See my thoughts - and see my scars- see my clothes - I dress to kill
See my blood - and see my gun.

RJD2 drop that shit so I can drop my thoughts
Driftin' away and depress all within listening range
Nah, but for real I got so much shit on my mind
From fake motherfuckers to my future I'm trying to get in line
And doing Hip Hop in this life and time
Ain't all nice and fine
At times I feel like my whole life's a rhyme
Full of punchlines and jokes
Fuck-ups and punch-ins
It's like I just can't get shit right
The first time or somethin'
When no one knows your name
And your vinyl's still in stores
Once you get a little life
Through arguing over who feels it more
We got sixteen-year-old net-heads buying garbage
Wanting to keep you for their personal private artist
We don't do shit for the clubs -
It's for us 45's go RJ's archaeologist diggin 'em up
And I'm the saint sent {Saint-Saens}
To vinyl when it gets set to bash
And it's for life until my final mic check is cashed
Yo
I can't fully become my mother's guiding light
Till my dad returns to tell me what the other side is like
I keep the things you taught trapped in mind
I know you cared even though you weren't here half the time
But who am I to blame
I'd probably do the same in your shoes
I never held that against you
Complained or assumed
You never went through what I'm living
Hell who am I kidding?
Depression is practically
A part of family tradition
So I keep the time we shared close
It sucks to lose
It also sucks we had to share the month of June
I woulda shared eternal time before I left
Each month I celebrate my birth
I'm reminded of your death
And here we are again
Buried in my sheets
Your fingers are whispers
Saying the softest things
To every inch of my skin
And even asleep
These eyes of yours
Seem to keep me on my toes
They just swallow me whole
Oh, and this gift you left for me
Is one to put me to sleep in such a way that
I would never want to
I would never want to wake again
I don't ever want to
I don't ever want to
I don't ever want to
'Cause we're so good at what we do
With our arms crossed and our fingers locked
We work like perfect puzzle pieces
Cut right and formed to fit
But it's so different when I know you've gone
So take me quietly
And I'll leave this body behind me
Oh, these rhythms of mine
Are so inconsistent anyway
Just one gasp and I'll be gone
I would never want to
I would never want to wake again
So leave the lights off tonight
I would never want to
I would never want to wake again
So leave the lights off tonight
And we'll use this air as rope
To drag myself up through my throat
I would never want to
I would never want to wake again
So leave the lights off tonight
I would never want to
I would never want to wake again
So leave the lights off tonight
I get choked up
I get so choked up anyway
With any thought of you
And I get choked up
I get so choked up anyway
Those looks you throw, they level me
Truth mis-user, abuser
Death dealer, devastator
There has to be
Someone killed
Sometimes I try to do things, and it just doesn't work out the way I wanted to.
And I get real frustrated and like I try hard to do it. 
I like take my time and it just doesn't work out the way I wanted to.
It's like I concentrate on it real hard and it just doesn't work out
And Everything I do and everything I try it never turns out.
It's like I need time to figure these things out.
There's always someone there going
Hey Buddy:
You know, we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately. 
You know, you need to maybe get away and like maybe you should talk about it,
You'll feel a lot better
I go:
No it's okay, you know I'll figure it out, just leave me alone I'll figure it out. 
You know I'll just work it out myself.
And they go:
Well you know if you want to talk about it I'll be here you know and you'll 
Probably feel a lot better if you talk about it, so why don't you talk about it?
I go:
No. I don't want to talk about it. I'm okay, I'll figure it out myself but they just keep 
Bugging me and they just keep bugging me and it builds up inside.
So you're gonna be institutionalized
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
You won't have anything to say
They'll brainwash you until you see their way.
I'm not crazy (being institutionalized)
You're the one who's crazy (being institutionalized)
You're driving me crazy (being institutionalized)
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself
I was in my room and I was like just sitting there staring at the wall thinking about 
Everything but then again I was thinking about nothing
And my mom came in and I didn't even realize she was there and she calls my 
Name but I didn't even hear it, and she started screaming BUDDY! BUDDY!
And I go:
What, what's the matter?
And she goes:
What's the matter with you?
I go:
There's nothing-wrong Mom.
And she goes:
Don't tell me that, you're on drugs!
I go:
Mom I'm not on drugs I'm okay, I was just thinking you know, why don't 
You get me a pepsi?
And she goes:
NO you're on drugs!
I go:
Mom I'm okay, I'm just thinking.
She goes:
No you're not thinking, you're on drugs! Normal people don't act that way!
I go:
Mom just give me a Pepsi please
All I want is a Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me
All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me.
Just a Pepsi.
They give you a white shirt with long sleeves
Tied around you're back, you're treated like thieves
Drug you up because they're lazy
It's too much work to help a crazy
I'm not crazy (being institutionalized)
You're the one who's crazy (being institutionalized)
You're driving me crazy (being institutionalized)
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself
I was sitting in my room and my mom and my dad came in and they pulled up 
A chair and they sat down and they go:
Buddy, we need to talk to you
And I go:
Okay what's the matter?
They go:
Me and your mom we've been noticing lately that you've been having a lot of 
Problems, you've been going off for no reason and we're afraid you're gonna 
Hurt somebody, we're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself.
So we decided that it would be in your interest if we put you somewhere 
Where you could get the help that you need.
And I go:
Wait, what are you talking about, WE decided!? MY best 
Interest?! How do you know what MY best interest is? How can you say what 
MY best interest is? What are you trying to say, I'M crazy? When I went to 
YOUR schools, when I went to YOUR churches, when I went to
YOUR institutional learning facilities?!
How can you say I'm crazy?
They say they're gonna fix my brain
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
But by the time they fix my head
Mentally I'll be dead
I'm not crazy (being institutionalized)
You're the one who's crazy (being institutionalized)
You're driving me crazy (being institutionalized)
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself
It doesn't matter. I'll probably get hit by a car anyway.
We all know what's in your brain
Let's take a look anyway
Searing pain, expose your flesh
And strip it away
You will suffer true pain
Next cut will be deeper
Next cut will be deeper
I'll watch you squirm
I'll watch you crawl
I'll see you cry
I will see you...
Die! Die! Die!
We all know your secret sins
Muddy garbage... the things within
Silent screams, quelled with pins
Mouth held fast
The truth buried within
Next cut will be deeper
Next cut will be deeper
I'll watch you squirm
I'll watch you crawl
I'll see you cry
I will see you...
Die! Die! Die!
It peels the flesh
It strips the bone clean
We all know what's inside
You will know my name
You will suffer true pain
Next cut will be deeper
Next cut will be deeper
I'll watch you squirm
I'll watch you crawl
I'll see you cry
I will see you...
Die! Die! Die!
I'm gonna change my immediate circle of friends
I'm gonna run away and join the circus, oh yeah
They've been leading me around in circles
Round and round
I'm gonna change my immediate circle of friends
In my darkest hour of need
They all become make-believe
And they pretend that they are sleeping
I raise my game as the stakes stack higher, higher
You cry wolf like you're the town crier, cry girl
The queen of clubs drinks in pubs on days off, over
Swills down dregs, drags on duck arsed cigarettes
In my darkest hour of need
They all become make-believe
And they pretend that they are sleeping
I'm gonna change my immediate circle of friends
I'm gonna run away and join the circus, oh yeah
I'll be assistant to the blind knife thrower
Better that than being factory fodder order
In my darkest hour of need
They all become make-believe
And they pretend that they are sleeping
We're pretty boys for secret girls
Who never stood a chance in the world
I'm not ready for sincerity
I'd tell any lie to keep you listening
I gave you pretentious, I gave you indifference
But you only wanted undressed and defenseless
With all your cheap words about hearts and accidents
Who are you kidding
Sincerity's in
So don't just sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year no one will even care
If it's in
So don't just sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year
Everyone loves an underdog 
That's why you're all singing along
With all your cheap words
Who are you kidding?
We're pretty boys
For secret girls
Who are you kidding?
Sincerity's in
So don't just sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year no one will even care
If it's in
So don't just sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year
(Hey! Everyone loves an underdog)
(Hey! Everyone loves an underdog)
When the hook sets in and this all ends
I'll wish it never began
Oh I will die without all the attention
When the hook sets in and when this all ends
I'll wish it never began
Oh I will die without all the attention
Sincerity's in
So don't just sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year no one will even care
If it's in
So don't just sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year
Steamed glass
Out of the shower
You step
Sleepless
Drying off
And sliding in
To bed
While you try to bear the winter
And keep warm
While you try to bear the winter
On your own
They'll be around
On the bus
On the street
They're everywhere
You're pretending
Not to notice
All the little words they
Spit in the air
While you try to bear the winter
And keep warm
While you try to bear the winter
On your own
You're on your own now
You're on your own now
You're on your own now
You're on your own
Now
I've got a wantless need
I've got a thoughtless mind
I've got a needless want
I can't unwind
I've got a heart that aches
I've got hands that like to break
They tell me to hold on
They never let me go
I am a clenched fist
Looking for a wall to kiss
I am a looked door looking
For a foot to kick me to the floor
What have I got I've got everything
What have I got nothing much at all
Self rejected well protected
Too looked up inside myself to over get free
Frustrated self hatred my hands turn to fists
Violence so hard to resist
I get so mad
I do things that I regret
So stupid but not stupid enough
To ever forget
Got no name got no brain
It's alright I feel no pain
I've got music pounding in my head
Stop looking start looking
You better look out
I'm not feeling too nice today
Can't be late can't relate
Don't take my time
Don't give me your hate
I've got enough of my own
I can't stop
I can't start
It holds me together
While it tears me apart
Brought up as peasants at the bottom of the hill hobroken's only view a mountaintop rubber plant the factory whistle blows twice every day smokestacks make the skies black so thick I could hardly see I ain't gonna waste away for the price of steady pay townsfolk look like zombies gotta break away got no welcome mats you leave no coming back wasn't the first to take the same old crap this town no one leaves this town no no one sleeps so uptight no one breathes this town ain't for me don't give me no lip 'cause I quit the hometown if that's all there is keep it for yourself I've had a lot of steady jobs I've had enough another day's too much gonna pack it up I'm city bound catch the five fifteen out going to the coast hobroken nightmare used to be a dream hobroken nightmare gotta break free
Well, sad, small, sweet, so delicate
It used to be this dying breed
Well I've got a bad feeling about this
I've got a bad feeling about this
You kept still until the long drive home
And slept safe and close to the window...
Well, I've got a bad feeling about this
I've got a bad feeling about...
Who's to say you have to go (I could go all night)
Well say you have to go (I could go all...)
To hell with you and all your friends
To hell with you and all your friends, it's on
Well, sad, small, sure in porcelain
You're skin and bones, I'm a nervous wreck
Well I've got a bad feeling about this (when it comes to this)
I've got a bad feeling about this
You kept still until the long drive home

Who's to say you have to go (I could go all night)
Well, say you have to go (I could go all...)
To hell with you and all your friends

Well I got a bad feeling about this (what is this for?)
I got a bad feeling about...
Anyone will do tonight

Close your eyes, just settle, settle

Well I got a bad feeling about this,

I'm coming over but it never was enough
I thought it through and my worst brings out the best in you
Well I got a bad feeling about this

I'm gonna fight 'em all
A nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette
And the message coming from my eyes
Says leave it alone
Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do
And the feeling coming from my bones
Says find a home
I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera for evermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more
And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me go back home
Oh man! Oh right! 1, 2, 3
You haven't got a clue and you don't know what to do
You used your money and your friends
To try and trick me but you won't trick me
As far as I can tell you've created your own hell
Now you walk around this place expecting pity
Every time you throw a fit, I can't decide if you're full of it
And every time you state your case
The more I want to punch your face I go
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
I still can't believe all your plastic surgery
Now it's everybody's problem that you're unhappy, oh, come on!
And every time you state your case
The more I want to punch your face
And every time you state your case
The more I want to punch your face
And every time you state your case
The more I want to punch your face I go
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Beating out the force in you
He will not stop
Until you beg him
This red meat attraction
Is reason for action
To end this obsession
Of brutal deception
Your self control has gone away
You have to leave or become his slave
Licking your wounds
Until the next breaks up
Just get out of there
Because the beating won't stop
If this is really living
Then why am I so unforgiving
Half the world is down the toilet
Half is on its way
Well if I had a dollar for
Every time he hollers:
"Trust us with your hearts and minds"
Or I'll make you pay
Trust me
Ask me why you're feeling screwed
And I'll give you an answer
There's a Colin, Dick and Bush
Just a-hammerin' away
Ask me why you feel deceived
And stripped of all your liberties
It doesn't take a genius
To explain that today
Trust me
Listen to the victim, abused by the system
The basis is racist, you know that we must face this.
"It can't happen here".
"Take a look around at the cities and the towns."
See them hunting, creeping, sneaking
Breeding fear and loathing with the lies they're speaking
The knife, the gun, broken bottle, petrol bomb
There is no future when the past soon come.
And when they come to ethnically cleanse me
Will you speak out? Will you defend me?
Or laugh through a glass eye as they rape our lives
Trampled underfoot by the right on the rise
Ich bin ein Ausländer (x4)
Welcome to a state where the politics of hate
Shout loud in the crowd "Watch them beat us all down"
There's a rising tide in the rivers of blood
But if the answer isn't violence, neither is your silence
If they come to ethnically cleanse me
Will you speak out? Will you defend me?
Freedom of expression doesn't make it all right
Trampled underfoot by the rise of the right
Ich bin ein Ausländer. (x8)
Ausländer
Oh, looking to the cracks,
At the blood on the money machines
Well, the rain came down
And I found myself in a dream
Where the neon's pressed
Up against your flesh
And nobody's saying a thing
Then I wait from a (nine?)
In broad daylight
Sent the whole world into a spin
I'm (?) in a field
(?) In a field
(?) In a field of ice
There are ways
To keep walking
Don't get in the way
Just keep walking
Just keep...
I got nothing but the taste
Nothing but the smell of the piss stains
A writer only comes
When he comes with the setting sun
A girl may lie to a suit and tie
For the vibe in the back of his jeans
Hanging in the air with a pinhole stare
In the bowels of the pleasure machine
I'm calling
I'm calling
I'm calling
To say...
There are ways
To keep walking
Don't get in the way
Just keep walking
Just keep...
(?) On a field
(?) On a field
(?) On a field of ice
(?) On a field
(?) On a field
(?) On a field of ice
(?) On a field
(?) On a field
(?) On a field of ice
(?) On a field
(?) On a field...
There are ways
To keep walking
Don't get in the way
Just keep walking
There are ways
To keep walking
Don't get in the way
Just keep walking
Just keep...

We americans is dirty
We americans is positive
We don't know if we should be
We americans is cowboys
We americans love guns
Ain't no one can stop us
Not even them injuns
So shoot the president
Forget the national debt
It makes no difference to me
It don't effect my rent you see
And it has always been this way and it won't change
God bless the good old usa
We americans can't write
We americans don't read
And we don't want nobody
Telling us what we need
'Cause were better then that
And were better then this
And were better then everybody else
We got the dollars and we got the cents
And it has always been this way and it won't change
God bless the fucked up usa
You know you can't complain
We'll just wipe out the stains
We like to suck before we spit
We spray pain on the walls
'Cause we love those shopping malls
All those purple track suits make me sick
That's it, we quit
We americans is stupid
We americans don't write
Ain't no one can stop us
'Cause we do what we like
I'll bathe my eyes in a river of salt
I'll grow myself right up to the sky
I'll sing in the forest, tear down the trees
I'll foul all the fountains and trample the leaves
I'll blacken your Christmas and piss on your door
You'll cry out for mercy, but still there'll be more
I'll put a blight in the orchard
I'll run wild through the fields
I'll waylay your daughter and kidnap your wife
Savage her sexless and burn out her eyes
I'll blacken your Christmas and piss on your door
You'll cry out for mercy, but still there'll be more
Did I just hear you try
To lemon scent the sky?
Sulphur
Yellow sulphur
Yellow sky
I tongue a socket
You feel the jolt
You're like a warped godmother with your baffling love
I know what's in the air
I know what's in the air
I know what's in the air
You know what?
You know what?
You know what?
Shut the fuck up!
A spoonful of sugar
A labor of love
Pneuma and pollution
Don't confuse me any
I know what's in the air
I know what's in the air
I know what's in the air
You know what?
You know what?
You know what?
Shut the fuck up!
Aquamarine
And video green
Hot water and pink soap
Our teeth full of holes
And our guts full of holes
And our thighs stick to hot vinyl
Cringing through life wedgies
I strain to hear you
Over the brainless chattering null set
Living in the wasteland of the free...
We got preachers dealing in politics and diamond mines
And their speech is growing increasingly unkind
They say they are Christ's disciples
But they don't look like Jesus to me
And it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free
We got politicians running races on corporate cash
Now don't tell me they don't turn around and kiss them peoples' ass
You may call me old-fashioned
But that don't fit my picture of a true democracy
And it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free
We got CEO's making two hundred times the workers' pay
But they'll fight like hell against raising the minimum wage
And If you don't like it, mister, they'll ship your job
To some third-world country 'cross the sea
And it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free
Living in the wasteland of the free
Where the poor have now become the enemy
Let's blame our troubles on the weak ones
Sounds like some kind of Hitler remedy
Living in the wasteland of the free
We got little kids with guns fighting inner city wars
So what do we do, we put these little kids behind prison doors
And we call ourselves the advanced civilization
That sounds like crap to me
And it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free
We got high-school kids running 'round in Calvin Klein and Guess
Who cannot pass a sixth-grade reading test
But if you ask them, they can tell you
The name of every crotch on mTV
And it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free
We kill for oil, then we throw a party when we win
Some guy refuses to fight, and we call that the sin
But he's standing up for what he believes in
And that seems pretty damned American to me
And it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free
Living in the wasteland of the free
Where the poor have now become the enemy
Let's blame our troubles on the weak ones
Sounds like some kind of Hitler remedy
Living in the wasteland of the free
While we sit gloating in our greatness
Justice is sinking to the bottom of the sea
Living in the wasteland of the free
Living in the wasteland of the free
Living in the wasteland of the free
Living in the moment

They don't listen and don't pay
Put away your short leash I'll get the fuckin' chain
So step aside and I'll take control
I make right once you make wrong
I let it go too long
I realize that all of these
Chains and shackles fill all
Like ribbons and bows
Like kill me in law
Fuck you can't make me stay here
Fuck this I won't bow to you
Fuck you can't make me stay here
Fuck this I won't bow to you
Bleeding cat on the floor
No fighting all the time
You can scream right in my face,
I know your words mean nothing
You're just screeching out to fate
I only listen to the demon in my mind,
He's always there
He's always staying with you behind
Chains and shackles fill all

Gramma this one's for you (stay strong)
(He's strong!)
Mama Mama Mama Mama I couldn't say "No"
(So strong!)
Got sick and tired of seein' brothers being treated ill
(He's strong!)
They say to chill, they say my homey's not available
(Stay strong!)
I hear Mama they got him working on tha Payroll
(She's strong!)
Mama Mama Mama Mama I couldn't say "No"
(So strong!)
Got sick and tired of seein' sistas being treated ill
(She's strong!)
They say to chill, they say my homegirl's not available
(Stay strong!)
I hear Mama they got her working on tha Payroll
At 21 the brother "Smooth" he got a record deal
Been working hard been writin' songs about the things he feels
He says it's real, 'cause I got bills, but I got skills
My deck is stacked, if I could only get my shit on wax
When it was ripe he took his tape up to the rec execs
They smoked cigars and rolled their eye's at him behind their specs
Your shit is phat but I don't hear it in the format Jack
What's all this black crap check page twenty one of your contract
A friend of mine Roberta she got a job at the post office
She was college edjamacated but got fired up at the law office
I'm all alone two kids at home, I need a job just any job
So I can get back on my feet like Tina "T"(urner)
The boss came up to her said, "why don't you come home with me"
I'd like to see you take off your clothes for me
She said "No way man!"
He said "You don't understand"
"You lose your life, you lose your job if you don't do this shift!"
I met a black man who became a police officer
Officer, officer, officer, officer, officer, overseer
He tried to tell me it was the only job available
Either rob or join the mob 'cause I'm not salable
One night he went out on an undercover sting-ing
Bought some smack tried to break the heroin ring-ring
Two cops white cops saw juggling goin' down
They spilled his brain like homey the fuckin' clown
(He's gone!)
Mama Mama Mama Mama I couldn't say no
Got sick and tired of seein' people bein' treated ill
Picked up my nines, walked up from behind
Tapped two of them on the neck so I could meet their eyes direct
Pom! Pom!
I didn't do it for tha payroll
We're at auntie Jane's house
When the first shots were fired
Tandi heard her call her name
She'd gone out playing
There's about to be a riot
This is Orlando West
It's June '76
There's guns in the streets again
They got Peterson
That's how you sentenced to live
In Soweto
Streets that burn, a bullet flies
A mood that turns, a schoolkid dies
This is part of daily life
In Soweto
The bloodshed on these dusty roads
Carried by the wind that blows
Through the Ghetto
The Ghetto, Ghetto of Soweto
The Ghetto, Ghetto of Soweto
This is auntie Nancy's house
She's about to do Karabo's laundry now
He nearly missed the train this time
She found his papers lying
Down on the ground
'84 in Diepkloof
Somebody saw him there
They got him in chains
Taking his name
And then took him to John-Voster-Square
He's in the street, with no ID
That's against the law, now he's behind the bars
And they treat it like it never was
In Soweto
The bloodshed on the dusty roads
Carried by the wind that blows
Through the Ghetto
The Ghetto, Ghetto of Soweto
The Ghetto, Ghetto of Soweto
It should have been a joyous day
They gathered at auntie Eve's
The daughter had a child that night
The first glimps of light
The baby's positive
This is Muroka, Pimville, Dube
Ain't no one safe no more
From Apartheid days, now caught up with AIDS
You fight from the day you're born
In Soweto
From Diamond Mines to TBC
From violent to HIV
This is every second pregnancy
In Soweto
The bloodshed on these dusty roads
So many stories stay unhold
In the Ghetto
The Ghetto, Ghetto of Soweto
The Ghetto, Ghetto of Soweto
Today was the day
For dancing and for singing
The birds in the trees
And all the bells are ringing
The sun in the sky
Is bright, as bright as second sight
Is bright, oh God, I hope I'm alright
'Cause I'm gonna cry
Hold on, hold on
Slow down, slow down
You're out of touch
Out of touch
'Cause there is no design for life
There's no devil's haircut in my mind
There is not a wonderwall to climb
Or step around
But there is a slideshow and it's so slow
Flashing through my mind
Today was the day
But only for the first time
There is no design for life
There's no devil's haircut in your mind
There is not a wonderwall to climb
Or step around
Yet there is a slideshow and it's so slow
Flashing through your mind
Today is the day
But only for the first time
I hope it's not the last time
Karen a aujourd'hui 15 ans 
La ferraille s'accroche à ses dents 
Elle se mate des heures dans la glace 
Et trouve que rien n'est à sa place 
Elle déteste ses problèmes de peau 
Trouve que ses seins sont tout sauf beaux 
Elle se voit laide et mal foutue 
Sur le fil un peu perdue 
Elle rêve de quitter ses parents 
Sac chambre jaune son lit d'enfant 
Les yeux tournés vers le ciel 
Elle s'accroche aux paradis artificiels 
On la surnomme l'anorexique 
Elle ne parle jamais en public 
Encours son regard insaisissable 
La laisse seule face à sa table 
Assise au fond collée collée au radiateur 
Elle dessine des spirales et des drôles de coeurs 
A la pause elle s'isole avec Jim Morrison 
En secret Karen est amoureuse 
Et quand la nuit tombe elle écrit 
Des pages et des pages sous veilleuse 
Pour s'endormir avec lui 
Elle le voit grand et ténébreux 
Le regard sombre et mystérieux 
Ils partiront loin d'ici 
Quitteront la banlieue pour Paris 
Il aura sa moto 
Elle s'accrochera à son dos 
Ils vivront juste l'un dans l'autre 
Et plsu rien à foutre des autres 
Passionnés passionnément 
Vivre à fond l'instant présent 
Au revoir la triste gamine 
Voilà Karen l'héroïne...
In all official circles
Across this big wide world
Between the radio stations
A coded message heard
No one knew the meaning
All our efforts seem to fail
But if they catch you listening
Then they'll lock you up in jail
So we found ourselves a place we did not know
Tension in the air and a strange earthly glow
Then amidst the noise of a thousand people's talk
There came a cry "It's The Night of The Hawk!"
The wind was raging, and the stars were black
We all knew there was no turning back
The gates of Hell stared in our face
Nowhere to hide in this wasted space
Night of The Hawk!
Night of The Hawk!
Night of The Hawk!
Night of The Hawk!
The curious folk who chanced to stray across this downland way
Heard the music blast apart
The games that politicians start
On English land the people dance
Like moths caught in a lamp
Where tribes of wanton peacocks strut
All waiting to encamp
So we found ourselves a place we did not know
Tension in the air and a strange earthly glow
Then amidst the noise of a thousand people's talk
There came a cry "It's The Night of The Hawk!
The wind was raging, and the stars were black
We all knew there was no turning back
The gates of Hell stared in our face
Nowhere to hide in this wasted space
Night of The Hawk!
Night of The Hawk!
Night of The Hawk!
Night of The Hawk!
The wind was raging, and the stars were black
We all knew there was no turning back
The gates of Hell stared in our face
Nowhere to hide in this wasted space
Night of The Hawk!
Night of The Hawk!
Night of The Hawk!
Night of The Hawk!
I rise and pour my heart out tonight
Some things that should have not been forgotten
Are now lost with in ourselves
It burns like the open flesh on my arm and reminds me of the days
When the wind would strike
It breaks my mind
Right through the cracks of the floor
Where the rain finds my head
I cry out for guidance, I cry...
I find direction in You
Please forgive me Jesus for now I know
My love has found its place, my love with You
Its time to reform and leave this lifeless body next to You
I spread my arms
And cry my eyes for Your acceptance has brought me here
I dry my eyes now receive my heart
Forever I've searched and now I'm found
With You I'm at home now
Go to sleep
Go to sleep
I'll watch you sweat
Spider bite panic attack
I'm lost for words
What more can my friend do?
Make a mess
Make a mess
I'll make you cry
Leave you there wondering why 
The floor's all gone
I know that I really can't sing
Especially when these words are useless
On and on
And on and on I go
Our Kingdom is slowly falling down the stairs
Taking everything that's in its way
Apologize, I apologized to you
In and out
In and out is what we'll do
I am stumbling after you
Thank God you're here
Lover in the rain
Grow it out
Grow it out you'll look divine
Just as simple little line and then we're done
I know that I really can't sing
Especially when these words are useless
On and on
And on and on I go
Our Kingdom is slowly falling down the stairs
Taking everything that's in its way
Apologize, I apologized to you
Be proud
You finally made it
Knock, knock, baby answer the door
I'll be late
I'm stuck in traffic
I'll shove the gas peddle down by the floor
Water the proof then I'll do it again
Water the proof then I'll do it again
Water the proof then I'll do it again
Yeah, I got the note
I swore I'd tell you
I got the nose
I swear that's true
Assuming
Assuming
Assuming
Our Kingdom is slowly falling down the stairs
Taking everything that's in its way
Apologize, I apologize to you
An old haunt
Flint Point loop
I don't think
We were supposed to sleep together
I've never been afraid to die
I've never been afraid to live
I've never been afraid before
I've never been afraid before
I remember you
Seventeen in the dark outside a party
Crying in the dark, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I've never been afraid to die
I've never been afraid to live
I've never been afraid before
I've never been afraid before
I can't imagine, I don't understand
It was in my hand
It was in my hand
A petal, another petal, another petal
A petal, another petal, another petal
A petal, another petal, another petal
I thought we were decent
I thought we were twins
I was sick, I was broken
And I'm sorry
I've never been afraid to die
I've never been afraid to live
I've never been afraid before
I've never been afraid before
I can't imagine I don't understand
It was in my hand
It was in my hand
A petal, another petal, another petal
A petal, another petal, another petal
A petal, another petal, another petal
A petal, another petal, another petal
A petal, another petal, another petal
A petal, another petal, another petal
I broke my crown while kissing little flowers
I floated up the stairs and fell through the tower
You drew the sparkle back into my eyes
With your colored pencil
Tracing the years of my hunger like a
Plastic stencil
I'm still enchanted
You're still implanted in me
I'm still enchanted
The clouds carressed my sky and smoke
Dried my tears up
My viens are sweetly singing while
Blood drains from my cup
I blink my eyes and I am so
So enchanted
There's so much beauty that we take for
Granted
I'm still enchanted
You're still implanted in me
I'm still enchanted
Yeah I thought this was it,
True love had arrived
So I fell in
But what a surprise
And I bought you a ring
And I asked you to wear it
So when I found it on the bathroom sink
I shoulda known I was in for it
How do I release this?
And how do I let you go?
How do I mend my heart when I feel so low?
And how do I talk to you without crying?
And how do I let you go when I still love you?
I still love you
So I don't know if I can be just your friend
Damn you for not trying
And fuck you for standing there smiling
I know what it's like to not be able to feel
And I know what it's like, yeah,
To just kiss someone and make them fall in love with you
And then you walk away
To just make somebody come a little closer so you can push them away...
How do I release this?
And how do I let you go?
How do I mend my heart when I feel so low?
And how do I talk to you without crying?
And how do I let you go when I still love you?
I still love you...
(Intro - Swizz Beatz, DMX)
Whoo whoo! Dog ni-gga
What?
Whoo whoo! Dog ni-gga
Uh, ruff ryders, what?!
Volume one, Swizz Beats (whooo!)
What?!
Uh, uh, (what?!) all aboard!
(Verse 1 - DMX)
If I thought y'all niggaz really wanted drama
I'da been pulled out the armor, word to my momma
I'ma -- hit y'all niggaz with somethin' that you ain't never felt (what?!)
Hit y'all niggaz for frontin you caught up in that hell (what?!)
If I thought that half the shit that bitches said was true
I'd be spitting lead at you, to dead your crew
But -- if you know a bitch, you don't listen to that bitch
You don't argue with that bitch, all you do is fuck that bitch!
If I listened to all the snake niggaz that's runnin' they mouth
I wouldn't be in the crib, I'd be loadin up, to run in your house
But -- you can't fuck with cowards, cause a coward'll be a coward
He'll end up killin' these cowards, and I'm not feelin' these cowards!
If I let the niggaz around my way tell me how to feel about me
I guess I really, wouldn't be d
But I'm the best that ever did it, the best at it because I live it
How many niggaz eat it and shit it, you cats want it? come and get it!
[Chorus - DMX, Swizz Beatz]x2
Grrr, arf arf, woo woo!
Grrr, arf arf, woo woo!
Tell me how you feelin' now (what?!) I know you illin now (what?!)
Tell me how you feelin' now (what?!) I know you illin now (what?!)
(Verse 2 - DMX)
It's not like me to have my back turned to open places
I wanna see it when it's comin', so I can open faces
Open cases got me payin' to stay out of jail (what?!)
While these streets, got me to prayin' to stay out of hell (c'mon!)
Slipped, and I fell, got back up -- slipped again
But no matter what it's been, niggaz never got a win
It's a thin line I walk, everyday but I'm good with it!
Project nigga all my life, but wouldn't say the hood did it!
Knew what I was doin', everyday that I've been doin' it (okay)
Seein niggaz havin' a good time, so I'ma ruin it (yeah)
Fuck you, and fuck your man, both y'all niggaz is puss!
Frontin like you out the jungle but ain't never seen a bush!
When push comes to shove, whatever love we had take it witchu
Now peep what I just said and see how long it takes to hit you
Everybody knows you can talk all day (yes)
But when it's on what you gonna do - walk away? (yes)
(Verse 3 - DMX)
Man, I told you I lock jaws, carry a glock four
Close my eyes on y'all niggaz, the bullets'll watch yours
Then I gotta open up another can of ass-whippin
Y'all niggaz better pucker up, time for some real ass-kissin'
I'm a simple man, I lead a simple life, I mean simple like
I don't need much to be aight, live off the land, eat atnight
Handle whatever's comin' when I get there, but I'm good (what?!)
Dismantle whatever's comin', y'all niggaz sit there and put up hoods!
How my niggaz feelin'? (good!) how my niggaz like it? (rough!)
What my niggaz want? (blood!) we stay callin niggaz bluff
But if it's got to be, then it's gon' be, c'mon let's eat
Whatever my niggaz want from me, is what my niggaz gonna get from me
And if I ever... let the words, of another nigga bother me
I might as well... let the sperm, of that other nigga father me
But they know, like I know, the black rhino
Niggaz rippin through 'em and let the nine blow
Nigga die slow! oh... oh oh!
(Outro - Swizz Beatz, DMX)
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
What? ruff ryders, volume one, the compilation
Dmx, swizz beats, uh, double up
What? double up, y'all gotta feel us
Y'all gotta feel us
Rrrrr, arf arf, woo woo!

Sometimes it's hard to speak
Sometimes I'd like
Stop thinking
Like stop suffering
When heaven falls
And angels lie when stars cry
When silence speaks
I felt these clouds appear
In shades of gray
They conquered my horizon
In windy nights
I wish
They'd go away now
These clouds of grey
Fall in chains
Call in vain
(It brings
Me down)
And if I turn around
Maybe the sparks
That flew
Would blind my eyes then
A bitter taste
Runs
Through the sweetnes of life
Won't turn
Around
Lost in confusion
Thrown back by
Mistakes
Still mislead by illusions
When truth turns
To fake
...And it hurts
They'll tear out your heart, throw it neatly in a cart
'Cause that's what they do, with scum like me and you
And you feel as if you died. Whilst you're standing on the line
And you wonder all the time why can't you cry?
But the people in control don't care for you
Dear, you're just a robot with a job to do
And when your use exhausted, they'll be rid of you
As soon as look at you - go to the back of the queue!
Big Brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick it in the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Big brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick it in the arse
His eyes are dull. They stole his soul
They left him to rot in some stinking council hole
Where they keep him doped on beer and hopes
Of television dreams he's living on the screen
See there's something that he used to believe in
That was: Every human being should have his freedom
But bobbys truncheon had to wait to show him
He should be more useful, as they broke into his skull
Big Brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick it in the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Big brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick it in the arse
Big brother, beware, 'cause some of us do care
And the worm (and the worm, and the worm, and the worm)
May turn (may turn, may turn, may turn)
And the violence (and the violence, and the violence, and the violence)
In my head (in my head, in my head, in my head) is real
Bam-bam, you're dead!
Big Brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick it in the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Big brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick it in the arse Big Brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick it in the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Big brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick it in the arse
Arse!

Ay, ay, ay, ay
I know you love the way I come and I scorch this
Ain't nothing changed niggas know I'm holding the torch, bitch
Excessive with the heat see how I'm holding the fort, sick
I'll twist a nigga's shit just like a fucking contortionist
It's bang bully bust rhymes, I'm coming to squash shit
Demolish every hood, disintegrating the mosh pit
Spaz, animal rap, they love when the god spit
I know you wish you could the way I bang them regardless
It's the Conglomerate in case I ain't mention
There's bitches in this building and they all in this section
To dominate this shit has been my every intention
These niggas think they sick I come and kill the infection
And when I come through you know I'm blowing the top off
The building and the club you niggas know how I pop off
And if you violate you'll probably get your shit chopped off
The way I got police barricading the block off
Sometimes I act like I do because of this voice in my head
(Voice in my head, voice in my head)
It tell me just what to do to spend a chunk of this bread
(Chunk of this bread, chunk of this bread)
You make them niggas want to say
(Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Them niggas psycho how they ball
(Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
They buying all the alcohol
(Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Like they just buying out the mall
(Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Before I finish counting this bundle
So kindly as I welcome niggas (back to the jungle)
I'm back to run this, bitch, I strive to keeping it humble
I'm here to shake the building till it crackle and crumble
So back out bitch, see how we knocking the most hard
I'm about to split the ocean, get to calling the Coast Guard
Better call the ambulance, I'm coming to choke y'all
I'm smashing every country, bitch I'll send you a postcard
See now they acting like they ain't knowing
But I know you see exactly where the bottles is going
A couple box loads see all the money we spending
We drink until we stupid and the party is ending
Now peep the way we coming in we picking shit back up
The tunnel two thousand twelve the way the shit packed up
We full throttle in this bitch and never will slack up
While I feed you the heat watch how my niggas will act up
Sometimes I act like I do because of this voice in my head
(Voice in my head, voice in my head)
It tell me just what to do to spend a chunk of this bread
(Chunk of this bread, chunk of this bread)
You make them niggas want to say
(Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Them niggas psycho how they ball
(Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
They buying all the alcohol
(Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Like they just buying out the mall
(Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Oh, oh, oh
Sex, violence, money and dope 
You hang yourself when we give you the rope 
Porn, filth, smut and coke 
You bend over when you realize you're broke 
For everything you cry for 
Do you want it? 
We can give it to you 
For everything you die for 
Do you want it? 
Well, do you want it? 
We can give it to you!
All us brown rice jack rabbits and lab rats, fattened up
Spliced into big-box telemarkets and hybrid pyramid schemes
All us yellow-bellied cankers and book throwing believers
Let them live, put away your mason jars and slaughterhouse pickets
All us grip-clip samurais and safety pin street beggars
The cardboard change game, it ain't far from someone else's truth
All us deep-woods hole makers and barnyard Mussolinis
You release you, let yourself out of the manure and the cat piss
All us brown rice jack rabbits and lab rats, fattened up
Spliced into big-box telemarkets and hybrid pyramid schemes
All us yellow-bellied cankers and book throwing believers
Let them live, put away your mason jars and slaughterhouse pickets
All us grip-clip samurais and safety pin street beggars
The cardboard change game, it ain't far from someone else's truth
All us deep-woods hole makers and barnyard Mussolinis
You release you, let yourself out of the manure and the cat piss
Poika tuo, hyi, viinaa juo
Voi kamalaa, no nyt se syö makkaraa
Syntinen, saatana, ei se ajattele kantturoita kedolla
Ajattele, ajattele nyt, mihin kaameuksiin sä syyllistyt
Ajattele, ajattele nyt, mihin kaameuksiin sä syyllistyt
Halleluja hoosianna
Hei, katso, mä hohdan
Häikäseekö, hei, orpo pirun pakana
Mä oon parempi kuin sinä, koska mulla on aatteet vitun ylevät
Ajattele, ajattele nyt mihin kaameuksiin sä syyllistyt
Ajattele, ajattele nyt mihin kaameuksiin sä syyllistyt
(Julmuri)
There ain't no reason why you let me wait
Just give me up and I will go
Let's set it straight
Got a right to who I am
And if I don't fit your plan then set me free
But you refuse to set me free
And you deny me of my needs
You have me under lock and key
Just set me free just set me free
You never cared for what I had to say
It's just because you got to have it all your way
Well I ain't no superman
If that's what you demand then set me free
Couldn't you please just set me free
You get your fun just hurting me
If this is how it's going to be
Just set me free just set me free
Now I deserve to be as mad as hell because
I just don't get it
I place myself in your hands to fall
But I'm not quitting (no)
Feels like the time we spent was going to waste
Sooner or later it's goodbye we're gonna say
'Cause you just don't give a damn
So go find some other man and set me free
Just don't refuse to set me free
You can't deny me of my needs
Just turn your head to hear my plea
Just set me free just set me free
Couldn't you please just set me free
You get your fun just hurting me
If this is how it's going to be
Just set me free just set me free
Gather round you sinners who don't believe in peace
You can all be winners if you let your soul fly free
Don't be afraid the threat's not for real
Be very afraid you've made your last deal
Business men and money spinners rape the earth for gain
They don't like my ideas they label me insane
Don't be afraid the threat's not for real
Be very afraid you've made your last deal
Two thousand years of looking for utopia
Two thousand years of babylon rising
Don't be afraid the threat's not for real
Be very afraid you've made your last deal
Receive me
Unleash me
I crave the morning
Quickly, come
I get down on my knees and pray
And hope the dawning pulls me right out of my dream
You walk right by my window
Every day I can feel you so near
When will you come to get me out of my fear?
Would you unwind me
If you'd finally find me
I am tied to the ground
Ready to be unbound
Would you break me out and would you help me
To get out
Get out
Pull me out
Each day a new tomorrow
And I long for the same old aim
I'm bound in bitter sorrow
I know I want out, but I can't
Would you unleash me
If you'd perceive me?
Get me out, please hear my prayer
(Do you think it'll go that way?)
I get down on my knees and pray
(Do you think it'll run that way?)
I get down on my knees and pray
Get me out just to dry my tears
Yes, I pray
Would you help me to get out?
Get out
Pull me out
We run dis (Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch) 4x
U ain't fuckin' wit me (Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)
U ain't fuckin' wit me (Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch) 3x
Start a roit in this (Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch) 4x
Start a riot in this (Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)
Start a riot in this (Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch) 2x
Or get the fuck out this bitch
(Lil' Jon)

You always make us wait
You're the ones we hate

You don't know what I want
You don't know what I need

Speak English or die
You always make us wait
You're the ones we hate
You can't communicate
Speak English or die
Fabricantes de miedo 
Enquistados en la cima 
Vuelven tu mundo inseguro 
Ese poder te domina. 
Fabricantes de miedo 
Sólo velan sus riquezas 
No les importa la gente 
Y alimentan sus flaquezas. 
El Hombre nuevo despierta 
Con el alma desgarrada 
Y con sus ojos de cielo 
Comprendre cada jugada. 
Fabricantes de miedo 
Te hacen vivir separado 
Ya no confías en nadie 
Pues la sospecha es tu estado. 
Te vuelven intolerante 
Todo el mundo es tu enemigo 
Así te vuelves distante 
Así pierdes tus amigos. 
El Hombre nuevo despierta 
Con el alma desgarrada 
Y con sus ojos de cielo 
Comprendre cada jugada. 
El Hombre nuevo despierta 
Y tiende al otro su mano 
Para vencer cada miedo 
En unión con sus hermanos. 
El Hombre nuevo despierta 
Con el alma desgarrada 
Y con sus ojos de cielo 
Comprendre cada jugada. 
El Hombre nuevo despierta 
Y tiende al otro su mano 
Para vencer cada miedo 
En unión con sus hermanos.

A world full of hate is my alignment
Vicious thoughts are my incarnation
Seven deadly sins are my commandments
And the evil inside you is my revelation
I'm the bringer of the light
The opener of your minds
I'm the predator of the lies
Your route to enlightenment
There's no hope, no doubt, no faith
No truth, no pain, no sorrow and no grace
No fear, no saint, no Jesus Christ
There is no god behind their lies
I need a piss
Wanna hate
Fuck it up

I have crawled a million miles to reach you
But you won't hear a single word I say
Every thought got lost in the translation
Every word pushed you farther away
Now my world is disconnected
I can't feel - I'm disconnected
Nothing's real - I'm disconnected
You can never touch me now
Still I try to reach you through the darkness
But the emptiness is more than I can stand
I think it's time we cut these cords that bind us
I think it's time we let this story end
Now my world is disconnected
I can't feel - I'm disconnected
Nothing's real - I'm disconnected
You can never touch me now...
Disconnected... Disconnected...
Disconnected... Disconnected
I think it's time we cut these cords that bind us
I think it's time we let this story end
My whole world is disconnected
I can't feel - I'm disconnected
Nothing's real - I'm disconnected
You can never touch me now...
Disconnected... Disconnected...
Disconnected... Disconnected
(Talib Kweli)
Yeah
Ladies, make it hot, girls, make it hot
Ladies, make it hot, girls, make it hot
Ladies, make it hot, girls, make it hot
Mr. International, passport pimpin'
City street dweller every asphault different
Hittin with Jean and The Roots, my man Black Thought rippin
Now a glass goes whistlin, my rap flow's switchin up
Wait~! The promoter bitchin, is this asshole trippin'?
Why my cash flow missin'?
Don't fuck around this is how I make a livin'
Stop, listen, get the guap'
My kids can't eat my love for hip-hop
This ain't the circus, I don't see no big top
So - who ya tryin' to clown your money like Chris Rock
Don't make me laugh wit'cha funny money
Yeah, uh, yeah, hehehehehe, ehyeah, yo
These promoters shady and they good for broken promises
Some of them scared of the hood so they only promote the colleges
I'm havin' problems with excuses
Especially when it comes to my money and the contract is exclusive
They sell the tickets wit'cha name up in lights an' shit
But when it's time to pay they came up with all type of shit
Or tried to pay me in marijuana
The crowd was so thin he blamed Osama and the Twin Tower bombers
In my pocket like a thief and there ain't no honor
Livin' all reckless like there ain't no karma
You ain't on punishment, I ain't your momma
I just had to expose the truth like Leonardo DaVinci when he paint Madonna
Hey, hey hey, c'mon, uh, whoa
Illegal business control America
Illegal immigration, gun control hysteria
The war on terror, war on drug, now everybody have vices
So we still gettin' higher than gas prices
Yeah we have righteous MC's, ready to infiltrate
The system like a disease and bring it right to its knees
Who ain't fuckin' with the pay for play, that shit is gay
Get down with Blacksmith or get the fuck out the way
E'rything's straight! Just get out from under the table
I'm not a pimp runnin' a stable
I'm a kid with a vision runnin' a label
With the freshest MC's with somethin' to say too
We cuttin' the umbilical cord from the navel
Willin' and able to change the game for the better
A lot of crews claim they together
Then they fall apart and blame it on cheddar
Please~! I stay professional in all my endeavors
So we about to blow like Parliament in "V for Vendetta"
They try to get you with the funny money
Talk...
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more)
What you say?
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more)
Whoa Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you said so
I'd have to pack my things and go. (That's right)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more)
What you say?
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more)
Now baby, listen baby, don't ya treat me this-a way
'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
(Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood)
(You ain't got no money you just ain't no good)
Well, I guess if you say so
I'd have to pack my things and go. (That's right)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more)
What you say?
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more)
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more)
Well
(Don't you come back no more)
Uh, what you say?
(Don't you come back no more)
I didn't understand you
(Don't you come back no more)
You can't mean that
(Don't you come back no more)
Oh, now baby, please
(Don't you come back no more)
What you tryin' to do to me?
(Don't you come back no more)
Oh, don't treat me like that
(Don't you come back no more)
Bleed motherfucker, bleed 
I can feel the breath on my neck 
I can smell the stench 
I just want to make you bleed 
I want to make you bleed 
For the pain you caused me 
Bleed motherfucker, bleed
Bleed 
Bleed
I think it would take away the pain 
I want to make you bleed for the things you did 
I want to make you bleed
Bleed motherfucker, bleed 
Bleed
Bleed
So I don't know
I don't care
If I see you everywhere
It's gonna hurt either way
When he looks at other girls when you look away
Don't wash your hair, it's too early
Don't wash your mind if it's dirty
I wouldn't change a thing about you 'cause
You look like you and that's just beautiful, that's beautiful
You smell like you and that's just beautiful, that's beautiful
You feel like you and that's just beautiful, that's beautiful
The only ugly thing about it is that you're not mine
You're not mine
It's all the same
He's one of those
He doesn't like your Madonna nose
A little cut, no one will tell
I really wish you'd tell him he should go to hell
Don't wash your hair if it's early
Don't wash your mind if it's dirty
I wouldn't change a thing about you 'cause
I know you can't take it
You try so hard to fake it
You're never gonna leave it alone
You're not mine...
You're not mine...
Si je suis là, c'est que mes larmes se sont enfuies
De quel départ devrais-je partir pour que
L'on puisse m'attendre ?
Je peux trouver des armes pour que je puisse me défendre
A te dire vrai, je veux aller là où l'espoir est né
Mon envol loin d'ici, l'idée m'envahit
J'ai l'envie dans mon âme, je vous en témoigne
Prends conscience de mon manque
Tout l'air est à moi
Ou je reste ici, ou je meurs
Et j'attends et j'attends
J'attends que l'espoir prenne mon temps, baby
J'attends toujours le bus qui me mènera vers d'autres images et
Mais j'attends, je t'attends
J'attends que l'espoir prenne mon temps, baby
Je n'attends que le bus qui me mène vers là où je peux espérer, babe
Si le destin vous offre encore de quoi vous combler
C'est que le peu que vous ayez puisse encore vous aller
Je veux marcher sur toutes les roses qui n'ont pas fané
A vous dire vrai, je veux aller là ou l'espoir est né
Mon envol loin d'ici, l'idée m'envahit
Mon attente par ici, le temps me sourit
Je vous vois sans mépris, un jour embelli
Où je reste ici, ou je meurs
Et si l'on croit que le temps n'y est pas
Que l'attente est trop longue,
Que la chance se fait rare
Si le destin voit de lui même
Je peux rester là afin de pouvoir tout oublier
In this place
I get so safe
It makes me forget I still care
When it gets like this
When it goes this far
You never know what's gonna happen
You never know where you'll end up
When it gets dark
You never know where you find yourself
For you the time stops
Please stop crying
This time I'm not lying
Please stop crying
'Cause there is nothing wrong
The evenings get longer and I know
There are things you don't want to remember
I really want to understand
'Cause I'm not angry with you
I'm angry with myself
I huff gasoline from your shirt
And blur the questions that no one could ever answer
I empty my head of all that I know
Seems like the best view is the one from below
We are anti-movements, we are anti-anti
One time we believed but now we don't even try
And I can't cut a rug, without my fashion drugs
Inebriation leads revelation
Gettin' down in the town that makes no sound
You say there's nothing wrong but I don't hear it
I will burn your love letters in a parking deck
Where I have harbored great things that I will never confess
We keep fresh paint on the countenance
Now we keep it simple but make it more complex
We are anti-movements, we are anti-anti
One time we believed but now its passé and cliché
And she'll say anything to make you move again
But is it the truth? I don't care if it is
Fuck conversation
I'm throwing up my lever
Leaving the crib with a dear John letter
I'm taking what I need
Nigga fuck all your cheddah
Fuck all your jewelry and fuck all your cars
Ballin'
While I'm wishing on stars won't have me
Wiling while you're puffing on jaws
Had me in the crib in panties and bras
While you're in the benzo messin with broads
Have your face in another bitch twat
Go 'head playa boy that's how you get shot
And I ain't even like that silly nigga
But I'm hurt and I'm filled up with liquor
Pondering on if you really feel her
Only a man could make a girl a killa
And with a 9 like this my nigga don't sleep,
I'ma creep up behind ya my nigga.
I'm about to bizounce
I can't take ya shit no more
Picture frame broken daddy
'Cause I can't trust you
I'm ridin' high now
So nigga fuck you (x2)
Drivin' in yo Benzo
Shined up Lorenzo
Ashtray filled wit indo
Toss it out the window
Ain't as fast as your ash blow
Leavin' a nigga, fuck ya cash flow
I got my own account
And it holds a nice amount
I'ma come back for my clothes
And come back for my Rolls
You can keep them other hoes
Nigga that's how the game goes
And if ya didn't know
Better ask somebody baby
Shoulda treated me like a lady
Nigga I gotta bizounce
I'm about to bizounce
I can't take ya shit no more
Picture frame broken daddy
'Cause I can't trust you
I'm ridin' high now
So nigga fuck you (x2)
Fuck the conversation
I'm throwin' you a letter
Keep them platinum credit cards
Keep all of your cheddah
That shit don't mean nuttin to me (No nuttin to me no nuttin to me)
'Cause I'm tired of you stressin me (Tired of you stressin me)
The scent of perfume on ya clothes (In ya clothes)
Messin wit them silly hoes (Silly hoes)
Got me feelin' miserable (I'm miserable)
Fillin up wit Hen and Coke (It's on...)
Sleepin' wit the enemy (...bitch)
Boy you don't wanna fuck wit me (Don't wanna fuck wit me)
I'm about to bizounce
I can't take ya shit no more
Picture frame broken daddy
'Cause I can't trust you
I'm ridin' high now
So nigga fuck you (x2)
I ain't never comin' back no more
Know you heard that shit before
I don't never wanna see your face
Faded pictures on make-up case
Shoulda known what ya missed at home
Now you roll alone wit no one to bone
You ain't never gonna eat to-to
Not from me its no no
I'm about to bizounce
I can't take ya shit no more
Picture frame broken daddy
'Cause I can't trust you
I'm ridin' high now
So nigga fuck you (x3)
Want it all... Are we singing?
Take everything left from me
All! To! Blame!
How can we still succeed, taking what we don't need
Telling lies, alibis - Selling all the hate that we breed
Super size our tragedies (You can't define me or justify greed)
Bought in the land of the free (Land, free)
And we're all to blame
We've gone too far - From pride to shame
We're trying so hard - We're dying in vain
We're hopelessly blissful and blind to all we are
We want it all
With no sacrifice!
Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear
Stand to salute and say thanks to the man of the year
How did we all come to this (You can't define me or justify greed)
A greed that we just can't resist (Resist)
And we're all to blame
We've gone too far - From pride to shame
We're trying so hard - We're dying in vain
We're hopelessly blissful and blind to all we are
We want it all
Everyone wants it all
With no...sacrifice!
Tell me now: what have we done? We don't know
I can't allow what has begun to tear me down
Believe me now - We have no choice left with our backs against the wall
And now, we're all to blame
We've gone too far - From pride to shame
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
When all we need is something true to believe
Don't we all
Everyone, everyone?
We will fall
Cause we're all to blame
We've gone too far - From pride to shame
We're trying so hard - We're dying in vain
We want it all, everyone
Don't we all......
Cathedrals labors loathing, leaving the lookers soaking,
Pipes smoking litter in church, valiant and thought provoking.
Constantly noble, constant noble, portrait of persona,
Let it in your memory and leave you rotting without a stutter.
No churly g, not a sequel, not even one love,
Not even zero negative one, a crying dove.
A principality morals, maybe your standards might even make you
A matter of fact, exact from granduos.
So much for being famous if you take that rot road,
Don't touch that seen in scandals, a blind man hold his hand and go.
And then come back and tell them villagers all,
Only to lead them to the slaughter, contain perhaps a metal rope.
First figure ankes the body of Christ and all almight
Tie up your horse before the night falls, can stole your wife,
Or your significant other or just yourself.
Tie us up in feud, why don't you perch yourself up upon yourself?
You caught the royalty, let me see the shadow,
You had this, brought us, cause you blinding.
And we'll build our empire, and we'll build our empire,
And we'll build our empire.
We're at the horse and cherry, your race is blowing these rooties,
You have a corpse bride pace around, throwing you cooties.
We do a barrel repellar, constant make cloth,
You've a body that defound with a mound of it all,
Lost it for granted to finally figure out how you were done in,
Meanwhile we met your pal in its worse, you spit its thin.
Able to be process within text,
You never actually get a grip of my lithium spit, saliva acid trick.
Fuck off you fashionista, all of the twist bombs,
You're stanly Krueger stupid, you drug palms,
Rikki Sun, Alex and all hoes and walks in arrogant gems,
We dark humor at boths you're funny? Yes, man
They all resemble what we bring to the table last supper
For that day I spent.
The world is flat so they fall off to act on a crucifix nail.
Only to wake up in their own personal hell to go through,
But you already put us through that with that music you do.
Everything must change...
I'm not some kinda superman
I'm just tryna find who I am
And get my future plan
Don't know where I'm from
Don't know what my aim is
Don't know where I'm going
Don't wanna be famous
Don't wanna be that guy
I need privacy but can't be low-key 'cause it isn't me
Get pulled both ways and it tears me apart
Seems for years I've been wearing this mask
One to myself, another to the multitude
Now I'm confused with which one of those is true
In bed alone lyin' myself
I realise I was lying to myself
Now I'm here, finding myself
The truth's out there Ima find it myself
Forget going on a holiday bruv
I just wanna change
Everything...
I wish that I could make a happy song
But I'm depressed and I don't wanna carry on
I don't know what you've been told G
But no one alive truly knows me
Forget rapping I should find a job
I need direction, maybe a sign from God
I'm tortured, the pain's tormenting my soul
Got friends but I just can't pretend, I'm alone
I'm haunted, by regrets and mistakes
And everyday I'm just testing my fate
Like a boxer that loves throwing rights at them
But doctors warned him, he'll die if he fights again
Sometimes it feels like the weight of the world is on my shoulders
But that's just the way of the world
It's getting colder, it's too cold
Don't know much but I do know
Everything must change...
Must change...
Must change...
Must change...
So I've made music that made my mum cry
Bruv told me what happens when a loved dies
Don't even recognise my own face sometimes
Don't wanna stay around now, but I must try
Someone, somewhere might understand
I just don't wanna give my life to the fans
I'm tryna do more than just be real
In order to rebuild
Everything must change...
I'm just tryna survive today
And live my life in a righteous way
So I gotta watch what I decide to say
My pride's at stake
Don't wanna be described as fake
My mind states, I rate
And I'm wide awake
But I need sleep and it's kind of late
Don't wanna give them a reason to despise and hate
So I'm tryna change
Everything...
All around me, my people's dying
All being controlled by evil tyrants
Lives lost due to needless violence
Look to the sky, 'cause I need some guidance
But it feels like nothing helps
Gotta watch for my sister and my mum as well
Everyday it feels like I'm stuck in hell
I guess this is sort of how my brother felt...
See... just gotta hold on
Hope for the best...
Prepare for the worst...
'Cause nothing is promised...
All I know is...
Everything must change...
You shake me free of my dreams
From this bed I hit the floor
What day is it anyway?
Go away and close the door
I want to cry inside
As you want to talk some sense
I've just stopped trying
It feels like I'm dying
Please don't shout
It's only anger that your waking
Please don't shout
Can't you see I'm not listening?
Today I cry for my sins
Tomorrow call me the fool
Depression drinks me deeper
It's like there's nothing there to lose
Oh anger
My best friend
Why don't you pull up an easy chair?
You can't save anyone else
You can't save me from myself
Please don't shout
It's only anger that your waking
Please don't shout
Can't you see I'm not listening?
Please don't shout
It's my patience that you're wasting
Please don't shout
Can't you see I'm not listening?
I'm not listening
I'm not listening
Stop your shouting
I'm not listening
If only I could release instead of talking to myself
Every feeling that I have
Would you bury all of my doubt?
Well you can't walk in my shoes
Every mile just feels like two
I won't keep explaining
I won't keep on trying
So what if I'm hiding
You're giving me a headache
Please don't shout
It's only anger that your waking
Please don't shout
Can't you see I'm not listening?
No
Please don't shout
It's my patience that you're wasting
Please don't shout
Can't you see I'm not listening?
Please don't shout
Oh no
I've stopped listening
I'm not listening
No I'm not listening
Can't you hear me?
I'm not listening
Blues are falling like showers of rain
But I don't feel like crying
Death is abroad this day
But I don't feel like dying
I learned how to sustain myself
How to sustain myself in storms
Her tongue was like a scythe
And all her bones were haunted
A scapegoat for her life
Was all she ever wanted
I learned how to sustain myself in storms
Sir Bedivere slept in the field
His armour strewn around him
Curled foetus-like beneath his shield,
Still weeping when we found him
I teetered on the edge of doom
Degenerate and broken
She sucked the poison out of my wounds
And spoke the great unspoken
I learned how to sustain myself in storms
His monstrous ego, whipped and driven
Raged beneath his clothing
The compliment he paid was given
Not with grace but loathing
Deliverance is at the gate
With arms and gold in store
She apologises for being late
But I don't need her anymore
I learned how to sustain myself
How to sustain myself in storms
Scoured and stripped of all pretence
Shorn of all illusion
I offer nothing in my defence
- You may draw your own conclusions
I learned how to sustain myself in storms
Lot of knots, lot of snags
Lot of holes, lot of cracks, lot of crags 
Lot of naggin' old hags
Lot of fools, lot of fool scum bags
Oh, it's such a drag, what a chore
Oh, your wounds are full of salt
Everything's a stress, and what's more 
Well, it's all somebody's fault 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Get over it, get over it! Oh!
Make you sick, make you ill
Makes you cheat, slipping change from the till
Had it up to the gills
Makes you cry, while the milk still spills 
Ain't it just a bitch?
What a pain, well, it's all a crying shame 
What left to do but complain? 
You better find someone to blame 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Get over it, get over it! Oh!
Got a job, got a life
Got a four-door and a faithless wife
Got those nice copper pipes, got an ex 
Got a room for the night
Aren't you such a catch? What a prize!
Got a body like a battle axe
Love that perfect frown, honest eyes
We ought to buy you a Cadillac 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Get over it, get over it! Oh!
You used to be someone I could trust
But all of that didn't last to long
I don't know what I can believe anymore
God, where the hell did we go wrong?
Your silence shatters my sense of hope
How could this happen? what did I miss?
My whole world's falling down around me
God, how could desert me at a time like this?
I'm not perfect, nobody's perfect
But what the fuck was I supposed to do?
I'm washing my hands, I'm cleansing my soul
Now all I had will die with you
So bury the good and let that shit rot
'Cause if your only question's what's in it for me
Well then you might as well gouge out your own fucking eyes
For there are none so blind as those who will not see
Flesh for food and blood for wine
Because some scars don't heal with time
Because my scars won't heal with time
And all my love was left behind
Flesh for foond and blood for wine
But flesh and blood- never divine
Teen dream, teen dream
Straight A's on the cheerleading team
She's a teen dream, teen dream
Everyone wants to be America's little fantasy
She's a teen dream, teen dream
Everyone wants to be a murderous fantasy
She's a teen dream
Teen dream, teen dream
Straight A's on the honor roll
Such a nice girl
Who would of known
When the evil seeds were sown
Looked her mother straight in the eyes
As she stabbed her 37 times
As she begged for forgiveness
As she sent her straight to hell!
Straight to hell!
She's a teen dream, teen dream
Pinup queen
Everyone wants to be a teen dream
Teen dream, scream queen
She's a teen dream
Everyone wants America's
Sick and twisted fantasy
Teen dream
Teen dream
"I didn't want to kill her
I didn't mean to do it
The devil made me do it
I didn't want to kill her"
"The devil made me do it
The devil made me do it!"
When I went out last night
I saw a dead man walking
And he smiled at me
As he went on his way
And then he sang a song
Full of loss and longing
That's could break your day or make your day
Why did this man seem so alone
When he was standing
In a crowd of laughing people laughing?
When I went out last night
I saw a dead man walking
And he smiled at me
As he went on his way
2-0-0-3 j'suis la perdu dans c'putain d'merdier J'ai été condamné pour outrage, putain de procureur m'a allumé 
40 heures de TIG, j'ai fermé ma gueule et j'ai assumé 
Mais j'ai crié mon innocence, demandé de la reconnaissance 
Rien à faire le juge n'a pas voulu faire preuve de bon sens 
Cause en connaissance de cause, la justice judiciaire 
Suivi de près et même devancée par leurs bavures policières 
Frère, les faits sont les suivants : la tête endommagée 
Défigurée que j'ai gravé mon nom sur leur mur avec mon sang 
Comprends, la rage est profonde 
Marre du panier à salade, l'antisémitisme à la Française 
Suivi par le râtelage, mais on n'en parle pas 
Du FN, des flics et des skins armés 
On préfère montrer du doigt les groupes islamiques armés 
Demande à Mégret, s'il nous voit intégré, c'fils de putain 
Donc cassos d'immigré qui fout le riffe à son scrutin 
Mon comportement est le fruit d'une réalité 
Plein de haine et d'une jeunesse qu'on a vécu n'importe comment 
Quelle liberté d'expression dans c'pays facho 
Où on exile ceux qu'en savent trop et assassine les marginaux 
Richard le Grand, jugé pour viol, a purgé 2 ans 
Mohamed Diamoté, jugé pour viol, a purgé 10 ans 
Acte méprisant, regardes un peu, ca devient dangereux 
La différence en nous et eux c'est 8 ans 
On a beau s'plaindre, mais on fait rien contre ça 
Quand j'vois le score du FN, j'me dis qu'on peut contrer ça 
Tant d'fils d'immigré, si on s'mettait tous à voter 
La France serait désemparée et l'adversaire serait humilié 
Campagne électorale, chaque personne a des droits 
Regardes la tête qu'il a quand j'lui demande ma carte électorale 
La morale, j'incite au vote, 5 minutes c'est quoi ? 
Et plus particulièrement, j'cause aux galériens qui votent pas tout comme moi 
Notre force la voilà, donc à nous d'le faire 
Passer à l'urne afin qu'ils cessent de nos casser les burnes 
Leur injustice, leurs actes racistes et autres 
L'armistice pour les nôtres qu'il la fasse signer à d'autres 
On est en guerre, fréro, et c'est juste un simple fait divers 
L'Etat veut notre peau, espérons qu'on sera aux choses divers 
Leur injustice, leurs actes racistes et autres 
L'armistice pour les nôtres qu'il la fasse signer à d'autres 
On est en guerre, fréro, et c'est juste un simple fait divers 
L'Etat veut notre peau, espérons qu'on sera aux choses divers 
Si on répond à leur provocation, là c'est perdu d'avance 
Et si ça part en altercation, pour eux c'est légitime défense 
Leurs méthodes d'interpellations sont souvent passées sous silence 
Ils donnent leur interprétation des faits 
Ca y est la séance est levée, le juge a fait preuve de clémence 
Mais ça on savait, y avait pas égalité au niveau des chances 
Donc ma parole face à la leur n'a aucun poids 
Face à la loi, je pars avec un handicap 
Maintenant voilà, on sait que c'est comme aç 
Faut pas s'voiler la face, y 'a toujours cette angoisse 
Qu'un de ces quatre arrive un sale coup de poisse 
Perquisition oit à 6 heures du mat pour du charras 
Que la mille-fa est traumatisée et méprisé ces sales races 
On peut pas nous l'reprocher, quoi qu'on dise ou qu'on fasse 
Cramer dans nos clichés, renfermer dans nos carapaces 
Aller voter, c'est un droit et un devoir qu'on a 
On est né sur le sol français contrairement à nos rent-pa 
Les élections arrivées, j'ai toujours pas fais mon choix 
Par qui je m'sens représenter pas par un seul de ces mecs là 
Donc où est la nécessité d'aller leur donner des voix 
T'empêcher le FN de monter, moi c'est comme ça que j'le vois 
Sachant que celui pour lequel j'vais voter, va pas changer quoique ce soit 
Faut juste éviter l'pire, rectifier le tire 
Arrêter d'jouer les martyres ou on va toujours en pâtir 
Tout ça l'avenir à bâtir, la ge-ra et des choses à dire 
Leur injustice, leurs actes racistes et autres 
L'armistice pour les nôtres qu'il la fasse signer à d'autres 
On est en guerre, fréro, et c'est juste un simple fait divers 
L'Etat veut notre peau, espérons qu'on sera aux choses divers 
Leur injustice, leurs actes racistes et autres 
L'armistice pour les nôtres qu'il la fasse signer à d'autres 
On est en guerre, fréro, et c'est juste un simple fait divers 
L'Etat veut notre peau, espérons qu'on sera aux choses divers 
Hey cousin, en veilleuse et constate par toi-même 
Tu n'verras qu'un pays qui veut t'voir soumis par son système 
Un te-bé et facho, par ces lyrics je crache aux visages de ceux qui jugent 
Enferme nos reufs au cachot 
Une pensée à ceux qui sont partis avec la vérité 
Tué par l'Etat mais corrompu et la réalité 
Tout est prévu, tout est calculé à l'avance 
On n'a pas l'profil type alors ils réduisent nos chances 
Si on a l'malheur de l'ouvrir, elle sera nous faire taire 
Car Babylone a le pouvoir et l'exerce sur nos frères 
Y a eu de nombreuses victimes mais personne pour payer 
Ils nettoient la bavure et l'affaire est classée 
Arabe ou noir, ils aimeraient tous nous foutent dehors 
Par contre, ils sont fiers de nous quand on porte une médaille d'or 
Ca sent, ils aiment les étrangers quand ils peuvent en tirer profit 
Un étranger devient français quand il marque deux buts pour c'pays 
J'ai les yeux bien ouverts, on me fera pas voir ce qui n'est pas 
Liberté, égalité, fraternité n'existent pas 
Leur injustice, leurs actes racistes et autres 
L'armistice pour les nôtres qu'il la fasse signer à d'autres 
On est en guerre, fréro, et c'est juste un simple fait divers 
L'Etat veut notre peau, espérons qu'on sera aux choses divers 
Leur injustice, leurs actes racistes et autres 
L'armistice pour les nôtres qu'il la fasse signer à d'autres 
On est en guerre, fréro, et c'est juste un simple fait divers 
L'Etat veut notre peau, espérons qu'on sera aux choses divers
"What's going on here?"
"Murder, you want some?" (Sample)
Come on everybody let's go to the show
Murder is fun because my daddy told me so
Grab a gun, grab a knife, even hands will do
Punch 'em like a mother fucker even rape a few
Fuck the righteous wave and ride the evil undertow
If blood is what you want embrace the demon glow
Grab a gun, grab a knife, even hands will do
You punch 'em like a mother fucker even rape a few
We are the villains
Sucker fish fuckers down in the sink
We are the aliens
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We are the losers
Flushing our faces into the world
This is a sin fix
This is a sin fix
Now that we have seized you and pleased you
Come alive and murder your senses
Find yourself knee deep in the dead
Come alive and murder your senses
This is a sin fix
This is a sin fix
Come on everybody let's go to the show
Murder is fun because my daddy told me so
Grab a gun, grab a knife, even hands will do
Punch 'em like a mother fucker even rape a few
Fuck the righteous wave and ride the evil undertow
If blood is what you want embrace the demon glow
Grab a gun, grab a knife, even hands will do
You punch 'em like a mother fucker even rape a few
We are the villains
Sucker fish fuckers down in the sink
We are the aliens
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We are the losers
Flushing our faces into the world
This is a sin fix
This is a sin fix
Now that we have sieged you and pleased you
Come alive and murder your senses
Find yourself knee deep in the dead
Come alive and murder your senses
This is a sin fix
This is a sin fix
"Oh no they're all dead, they're all dead!" (Sample)
"I tried to tell the others, but they wouldn't believe me. You're all doomed, you're all
Doomed!" (Sample)
You drive like you're in a tank
And you're tanked
With the way you're changing lanes
No wonder you're banged up
Maybe you should hang up
Do what's right, do what's right, do what's right now
And pull it over to the right
You picked the wrong time to fuck with me
You roll like the road is yours
Uninsured, with those bent, expired plates
Putting makeup on
Inside the passing lane
Not that bright, not that bright, not that bright, clown
So pull it over to the right
I see your parking sticker
I see your visor Christ
But you don't understand
That the wheel in my hand
Can decide you, fucker
(Breakdown)
You drive like you're in a tank
In the way and you're driving like a bitch
You little piece of shit
I'll put you in a ditch
Do what's right, do what's right, do what's right now
And pull it over to the right
You picked the wrong time to fuck with me
I see your parking sticker
I see your visor Christ
But you don't understand
That the wheel in my hand
Can decide you, fucker
I see your mouth running
I see your finger fly
But you don't understand
That the wheel in my hand
Can decide your fucking life
Für was kann man ein Kind gebrauchen
Es zu schicken, zu ficken, zu schlagen und zu taufen
Für was kann man ein Kind missbrauchen
Es zu schicken, zu ficken, zu schlagen und zu taufen
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Denn ein Sinn für die Wahrheit schlägt in ihrer Brust
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Siehst du nicht, dass ihr Leiden uns besudelt und beschmutzt
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Denn durch sie wird uns unsere Kindheit bewusst
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Reden wir von Missbrauch, reden wir von "Nutz"
Es war noch nie Unwort des Jahres, Kindesmissbrauch
Eine Schande ist und war es
Im Land der Dichter und Denker geschah es
Die Spache verroht wie die Menschen und ich sah es
Im vollen Ausmaß ist es schmerzlich und schwer
Welches Volk gibt schon freiwillig seine Sprache her
Die Sprache wird leer
Es muss ne Bildzeitung her
Denn die Menschen verstehn ihre Worte nicht mehr
Sie verdient einen besonderen Schutz
Denn auch sie hast du in deiner Kindheit benutzt
Sie verdient einen besonderen Schutz
Siehst du nicht, dass ihr Leiden uns besudelt und beschmutzt
Sie verdient einen besonderen Schutz
Nur durch sie wird uns unsere Kindheit bewusst
Sie verdient einen besonderen Schutz
Reden wir von Missbrauch, reden wir von "Nutz"
Kinder können wohl eher uns gebrauchen
Zum Rat geben, aufwecken, Klamotten einkaufen
Wo ist denn die Anleitung zum Kindesgebrauch
Ist schon klar auf der ganzen Welt werden Kinder "verbraucht"
Aber dass die deutsche Sprache sich auch daran berauscht
Ist traurig und schade oder abgrundtief böse
Es wird Zeit, sich von diesem Sprachgebrauch zu lösen
Ich hau den Haken in die Öse eurer Sprachverstöße
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Denn ein Sinn für die Wahrheit schlägt in ihrer Brust
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Siehst du nicht, dass ihr Leiden uns besudelt und beschmutzt
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Nur durch sie wird uns unsere Kindheit bewusst
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Reden wir von Missbrauch, reden wir von "Nutz"
Manchmal ist Text, Kunst, Gedicht oder Gericht
Glaub mir ich kontrolliere das nicht
Manchmal schreib ich und die Wahrheit schlägt mir ins Gesicht
Und verschont mich nicht und verkürzt die Frist
Bis die Meinung der Masse auf mich einbricht
Auf mich eindrischt
Sie lieben mich nicht, ich liebe sie nicht
Was soll's, wer will später den Kindern berichten
Von Lügengeschichten
Teuflischen Versen mit Zuckerbeschichtung
Bösen Gedichten
Wahrheit ist Licht und Schatten
Beängstigend wie Ratten, die sich auf dich stürzen
Bereit dein Leben zu verkürzen
Doch diese Wahrheit führt uns ans Licht
Sie verdient einen besonderen Schutz
Und diese Kinder führn uns ans Licht
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Weise Worte führn uns ans Licht
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Und die Liebe führt uns ans Licht
Sie verdient einen besonderen Schutz
Und unsere Sprache führt uns ans Licht
Sie verdient einen besonderen Schutz
Weise Worte führn uns ans Licht
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Diese Kinder führn uns ans Licht
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Und die Liebe führt uns ans Licht
Sie verdient einen besonderen Schutz
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
This is out of our reach

If there is a hell
It filters through its neverending shades of green
And when it turns on those rains
It mutes it all to grey
If there is a hell
Its only life support is an idle screen
But to unplug is to spill a restless world at unset knees
If there is a hell
It always stares back through the same new cracks
And its every face seems worn and stale and overplayed
If there is a hell
It rings through wires and into my head
It asks me where and how and why I just don't try
But how can I explain
When all I've been is blinded
These words do talk
These heads do turn
But yet it's probably worthless
I'm not the one
I didn't want this
And whether it's chemical, emotional, physical
It doesn't mean shit
If there is a hell
There must be a heaven
And if just once
It shined right through
Perhaps I'd try
But it's only there
So the mind can fake it
And it seems that
All its innocence
Has all but drowned
And sometimes it calls
Through the submerged distance
And as its glimmers
Fade to black
The depths seem undone
But the only way to dive
Is through their engines
And while they always take the plunge
I've learned to stand aside
And leave them to collide
Since
I'm not the one
I didn't want this
And there is a hell
I had it all made
Don't drag me down just because you're down
And just 'cause you're blue don't make me, too
Though you found you need more than me
Don't talk to me about being free
That's freedom without love,
Magic without love, magic without love
Hear me say, better things will surely come my way
Hear me say, better things will surely come my way
You say that the magic's gone, well, I'm not a magician
You say the spark's gone, well, get an electrician
And save your lie about needing to be free
Oh, that's bullshit, baby, you just want rid of me
Your freedom without love,
Magic without love, magic without love, yeah
Hear me say, better things will surely come my way
Hear me say, better things will surely come my way
Fuck the kids!
Fuck the kids!
Fuck the kids!
Everything comes to a question, where time is the factor
But I can't care about it
Everyone talks about justice but truth is forgotten
You're accused but not on trial
Turn to me, - For the right answer
And I will tell you, - That everything comes into
Chaos, burning, terror
I am 6 ft. of anger
Panic, carnage, mayhem
I am 6 ft. of anger
I'm building tension but not any bridges
'Cause I don't care about that
The weight of my conscience is lighter than air
I am bent but never broken
Turn to me, - For the right answer
And I will tell you, - That everything comes into
Chaos, burning, terror
I am 6 ft. of anger
Panic, carnage, mayhem
I am 6 ft. of anger
Chaos, burning, terror
I am 6 ft. of anger
Panic, carnage, mayhem
I am 6 ft. of anger
Chaos, burning, terror
I am 6 ft. of anger
Panic, carnage, mayhem
I am 6 ft. of anger
I have never felt such loneliness
I cry and beat the bathroom floor
There is no one here that understands me anymore
I'm afraid of losing you
You can't look away
I'm already there
You can't look away
You can't look away
I am the one who put you down
I am the one right here
You can't look away
I'm already there...
There is no one here but loneliness
I'm afraid to be alone
Sometimes it feels like I'm clinging to an edge that knows
I'm afraid to carry on
Carry on
Carry on
Le noir est plutôt frais
Chandeur peut-être que je devrais
Rester, accrochée
Après elle
Le noir est plutôt frais
Chandeur peut-être bien que je vais
Rester, accrochée
Après elle
Je ne suis plus où je croyais être
Illusion d'un air de fête
Mais les sourires sont éphémères
Et les dos tournés se moquent
Se moquent
Et tout le monde le sait
Je ne prononcerai
Plus un traître mot
Mais toi dis-moi
Où je t'emmène
Le noir est plutôt gris
Candeur
Je crois que je suis
Restée accrochée
Après elle
Brothers and sisters there is a place for you in America
Places are being prepared and readied night and day, night and day
The white boy's plan is being readied night and day, night and day
Listen close to what rap say bout traps like Allenwood P.A.
Already in D.C. to preventatively detain you and me
How long you think it's going to be before even our dreams ain't free
You think I exaggerate check out Allenwood P.A.
And night and day, night and day - the white boy's plotting night and day, night and day
The Jews and Hitler come to mind
The thought of slavery far behind
But white paranoia is here to stay
The white boy's scheming night and day, night and day
What you think 'bout the King Alfred Plan
You ain't heard; where you been man
If I may paraphrase the government notice reads:
"Should there at anytime become a clear and present danger initiated by any radical element threatening the operation of the government of th United States of America, members of this radical element shall be tranported to dentention centers until such time as their threat has been eliminated - code KING ALFRED"
Bullshit I bet you say there ain't no Allenwood P.A.
And people ain't waiting night and day, night and day, night and day
There will be without the Motown sound and thunderbird
Wollowing in the echoes of Mlcolm's words
There must be black unity, there must be black unity
For in the end unity will be thrust upon us and we upon it and each other
Lock in cages penned, hemmed in shoulder to shoulder - arms out-stretched
For just a crust of bread, watermelon, mirages and oasis that does not exist
Cuntured up by the bubbling stinch of unwash bodies and unsanitary quarters
Concrete and bobbed-wire, babies screaming
Stumbling around in a mental circle because you never cared enough to be black
In the end unity will be thrust upon us - lanketed, stipled
A salty taste in your mouth from blood oozing from cracks and wooly heads
Red pools becoming thicker than syrup slow down your face
Spurs matte from the life force sprung loose from wells
Welled deep by the enforcers of mock justice of the red, white and blue
In the end unity will be thrust upon us
Let us unite because of love and not hate
Let us unite on our own and not because of bobbed-wired death
You dare not ignore the things I say
Whitey's waiting night and day, night and day, night and day, night and day
Calme et sans histoire,
Sensé tout savoir.
Le mot paisible, semble
Te vieillir,
Le mot sensé semble t'établir.
C'est comme ça,
J'ai entendu dire en bas.
Calme et

Calme et Sensé. 
(Merci à go0on pour cettes paroles)
Give me some more whiskey not that Colenmorangie
Jacobite blended dregs a gypsy's old bed setter
All of it makes me gag but I think that it's
The 20/20 I put in to stop the brown bag smelling smelling
Have you seen your dog it's a lasserapso
It was on the back seat of that Fiat Uno you stole
It was an injection though that's alright I suppose
But it just won't run on lovely red diesel my friend
Then there's a hole in my head pump up the volume you said
For the love of Christ you're the boss boss end more like
And that near death shite do I believe in a bright light
That red diesel you like
And sometimes I surprise myself I can stand the metal roof
I look out of my window
Someone's drawn tits on my neighbour's back door
That always makes me smile that artist has got some style
I think I'll sit here for a while
Anything for you
Turn my castles blue
Turn my bones to sand
Just to see you
I'll give you anything
I'll give you anything
I'll give you anything
Jackie O with the top down open
All the words to what's unspoken
Put together everything that's broken
Just to see you
I'll give you anything
I'll give you anything
I'll give you anything
Jackie O with the top down open
A king's horse for what's been broken
I'll bring back even what's unspoken
Just to see you
I'll give you anything
I'll give you anything
I'll give you anything

Immagina
Kurt Cobain e Billie Holiday senza la roba
Hendrix e Morrison senza LSD, prova
A immaginare Vasco senza la coca
La vita spericolata e la voce sporca
Se io non stessi qua in zona
Fra', perfettamente nel mio habitat
Con la sua fauna e la sua flora
Non sarei così reale in ogni mia strofa
Non avrei questo modo speciale di dire ogni cosa
Chiamami Marra
Il nome intero è Marracash, ma
Per ora non ho fatto il cash e va bene Marra
Andate e parlate di me!
Va bene, Marra!
Spiegate che faccio e perché!
Va bene, Marra!
È Dogo Gang e sai che mi basta un cenno
E non cambia ora con la major
Sai che buchiamo lo schermo
Intelli-gangsta fin dal giorno uno
Chi scorre così? Nessuno!
Bravo, nessuno!
[Hook]
Marra va dritto al punto, fra'
Marra va dritto al punto
I soldi entrano ed escono
I torti restano, fra', questo so
In zona mia i sorci crescono, i porci arrestano
Marra va dritto al punto, fra'
Marra va dritto al punto
I soldi entrano ed escono
I torti restano, fra', questo so
Dalle mie parti i torti restano
[Verse 2]
I soldi entrano ed escono
I torti restano,', fra questo so
E il mio rispetto non ha prezzo, non puoi prenderlo
E ad andare con lo zoppo inizi a zoppicare, zio
E ad andare con gli scemi le tue chance iniziano a scemare
Per questo resto coi ragazzi veri
Quelli che sanno chi eri
E divido pane, fumo e pensieri
E tra l'amore e far paura preferiscono fare paura
L'amore non dura, baby
E tenetevi i soldi, ma portatemi sulle spalle
Tanto non li ho mai avuti, li ho sempre spesi prima di farli
Rocce, volete me? Sì!
Avrete me! Pow pow!
Ok, al mio 3! Sì!
1, 2, 3! Pow pow!
A me mi basta il sole e non lavorare
E chiedi alla polvere, fra', piace pure a tua madre
Rocce, vedo muovere la bocca, ma non sento niente
Ma stai parlando o provi a muovere le orecchie?
Zio!
[Hook]
Marra va dritto al punto, fra'
Marra va dritto al punto
I soldi entrano ed escono
I torti restano, fra', questo so
In zona mia i sorci crescono, i porci arrestano
Marra va dritto al punto, fra'
Marra va dritto al punto
I soldi entrano ed escono
I torti restano, fra', questo so
Dalle mie parti i torti restano
[Verse 3]
Non fai rime del quartiere per sentirti grande, no!
Tu non lo fai perché sei delle Marche
Non sai quanto per la gente questo sia importante
Queste persone, zio, rappresentarle
E i miei fra' son forti contro le difficoltà
Ma deboli contro i vizi ed è li che vedi la loro lealtà, lì lo vedi!
Le donne, i soldi o la fiducia? Sei tu che scegli!
C'è chi ti fotte e chi rinuncia, fratelli veri!
E il cuore è grosso quanto un pugno, non ci state in molti
Marra va dritto al punto, fanculo quello che ti ascolti
Fan-culo!
Volete me? Sì!
Avrete me! Pow pow!
Ok, al mio 3! Sì!
1, 2, 3! Oh!
[Hook]
Marra va dritto al punto, fra'

Marra va dritto al punto
I soldi entrano ed escono
I torti restano, fra', questo so
Dalle mie parti i torti restano
A violent situation
Someone else's fight
Outside someone's screaming
Now this just isn't right
Time, Time
Time to escape
Time, Time
Time to escape
Time, Time
Time to escape
Time, Time
Time to escape
I walk into the room
A man he shouts alone
The leader of the kingdom
Just sitting on his throne
Time, Time
Time to escape
Time, Time
Time to escape
Time, Time
Time to escape
Time, Time
Time to escape
Escape
Ujrzałam cię po raz pierwszy w życiu
I serce me w ukryciu
Cicho szepnęło: to jest on!
Nie wiem dlaczego, wszak byłeś obcy,
Są w mieście inni chłopcy.
Ciebie pamiętam z tamtych stron.
Kupiłeś "Ergo" i w mym sklepiku,
Zawsze tak pełno krzyku
Wszystko ucichło, nawet ja!
Mówiąc "adieu" ty się śmiałeś do mnie,
Ach jak mi żal ogromnie,
Że cię nie znałam tego dnia...
O mój wymarzony,
O mój wytęskniony,
Nie wiesz przecież o tym Ty,
Że w małym miasteczku za Tobą ktoś
Wypłakał z oczu łzy...
Że biedna Rebeka
W zamyśleniu czeka
Aż przyjedziesz po nią sam,
I zabierzesz ją jako żonę swą,
Hen, do pałacu bram...
Ten gwałt, ten blask , ten cud,
Ja sobie wyobrażam, Boże Ty mój!
Na rynku cały tłum,
A na mnie błyszczy biały weselny strój!...
O mój wymarzony,
O mój wytęskniony,
Czy ktoś kocha cię jak ja?
Lecz ja jestem biedna i to mój sen,
Co całe życie trwa...
Pamiętam dzień, było popołudnie,
Szłam umyć się pod studnię...
Tyś samochodem przybył raz,
Przy Tobie siedziała ona,
Żona czy narzeczona,
Jakby przez mgłę widziałam was...
Coś zakręciło się w mojej głowie...
Mam takie słabe zdrowie...
W sercu ścisnęło coś na dnie
Padłam na bruk, tobie wprost pod nogi...
Cucąc mnie, pełen trwogi,
Co pani jest? spytałeś mnie...
O mój wymarzony,
O mój wytęskniony,
Nie wiesz przecież o tym Ty
Że w małym miasteczku za Tobą ktoś
Wypłakał z oczu łzy...
Że biedna Rebeka
W zamyśleniu czeka
Aż przyjedziesz po nią sam,
I zabierzesz ją, jako żonę swą,
Hen, do pałacu bram...
Ten gwałt, ten blask, ten cud,
Ja sobie wyobrażam, Boże Ty mój!
Na rynku cały tłum,
A na mnie błyszczy biały weselny strój!...
O mój wymarzony,
O mój wytęskniony,
Czy ktoś kocha cię jak ja?
Lecz ja jestem biedna i to mój sen,
Co całe życie trwa... ->
There's a place in my heart that won't kiss you goodbye that can't accept the truth that things aren't working out as planned
It's so hard to admit that I drove you away with all this negativity, this anger every day
Your heart doesn't belong to me
Your heart doesn't belong to me
I know I don't have the right to bug you with how this feels, its just the hardest thing I've been through, nothings ever felt so real
And on this Sunday night you'll be making love to him, I know because you told me I'm never going to win
Your heart doesn't belong to me
The blood is not on your hands
It's not your fault that I write these things at night
I brought it on myself
I deserve this
I deserve this
I deserve this
Do I really deserve this?
Oops, up on the wrong side of the bed
I'm in a bad mood, brooding like Achilles type attitude
Including a short fuse,
Shitfaced, and pissy pants,
You better keep your distance
My panties are twisted,
Anti resistant,
Red hot and bothered,
Blistered and bloodshot,
Rotten and dirty,
Disturbed is the word,
I'm down in the dumps,
Perturbed if you prefer,
I'm grumpy as something,
I'm one grouchy grampa,
Dusty and disgruntled and crusty,
You better not test me, trust me,
I'm a flustered old bastard,
My feathers are ruffled,
So back off buster, you best not stress me,
Just don't bug me,
I'm hungry and ugly,
So don't try to hug me, please and thank you,
I'm cranky for some reason,
Maybe I'm crazy.
A phase I suppose, it's just one of those days,
It comes and it goes.
I probably just need a rest,
Just a little PMS, I don't mean to be a pest,
So leave me alone, I'm a little low on patience,
Don't ask questions, I'm not open to suggestions.
I'm hoping to cope with it
Myself, and I'm sure
It'll help if I practice and act immature.
I'm a prickly cactus, a barbed wire bulldog,
A bump on a log, guard ball, I'm god awful.
I don't wanna take a pill
I don't wanna take a walk
I don't wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna have a talk
This is my grumpy song,
For when there's something wrong,
I don't know what it is,
It shouldn't be but it is (x3)
Don't wanna take a pill
I don't wanna take a walk
I don't wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna have a talk
If I soak my hands in others blood, Am I sick?
If I wash my hands in others blood, Am I sick?
If I drench myself in others blood, Am I sick?
If I bathe myself in others blood, Am I sick?
No life, No mind, Nothing left inside
Living for a lie
Brain washed, So lost, What's the point in trying
What's the point in fighting
You'll never end this in me
No voice, No choice, No true realality
Mentally controlled, Never to be set free
Not me, I'm addicted to sinnin
Killin every ???
God is Imaginary
Babble Babble, Bitch Bitch
And break the fuckin crucifix
Take a sip of this potion that be so murderis
These verses ain't for the religous and the weak at heart
I represent the wicked and I'm creeping out from the dark
I gotta story to tell, So kiddies listen up well
I've been through hell, And I think I know it very well
This isn't no fairy tell, I never had it easy
Constantly harassed, And brain washed into believeing
Stealing money for drugs, Name it I've tried it
Slit my wrist for the rush is this to much to digest
While you were preaching to the needy each and every evening
I was busy bleeding and recieveing unholy seamen
I'm that heathin always bathin in christian blood
I'm that heathin blaspheming the lord above
And I will make you understand what it's like to be me
Count your sanity away, Put your faith in misery
No life, No mind, Nothing left inside
Living for a lie
Brain washed, So lost, What's the point in trying
What's the point in fighting
You'll never end this in me
No voice, No choice, No true realality
Mentally controlled, Never to be set free
Not me, I'm addicted to sinnin
Killin every ???
God is Imaginary
Blood is all over my hands and body
I smell human flesh decaying and rotting
Burnt pages of the bible surround me
I pick one of the pages up, Proverbs 8:17
I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me
Hard to believe cause I was seeking and you never loved me
Could it be, Are you imaginary?
That would explain everything
But the blinded still never see
Are you proud of me, Mommy and Daddy?
How's it feel to to know that god can't stand me
I live to blasphem, You'll never understand me
And neither do the 5 hired sheriks that examined me
She's fuckin crazy and obsessed with death
Look at all of her piercings and that the way she's dressed
You fuckin derserve a knife in your neck
For passin such judgement, I can only wish you death
No life, No mind, Nothing left inside
Living for a lie
Brain washed, So lost, What's the point in trying
What's the point in fighting
You'll never end this in me
No voice, No choice, No true realality
Mentally controlled, Never to be set free
Not me, I'm addicted to sinnin
Killin every ???
God is Imaginary
Woke up one mourning
Outside the rain was pouring
I went to a church and stabbed the pastours heart without a warning
He screamed child why would you go and take my life
Stuck my knife deep inside as I saw my fate through his eyes
I dug my hands through his blood and wiped it on my face
Looked up to the sky, Ain't I such a beautiful disgrace
Blood stained with no way to be saved
God doesn't exist, I'd rather have faith in pain
And since pain is all I know, I make the weak bleed slow
Mom and Dad said I was nothin, So it's time for me to show
What I'm capable of, Without their bullshit life
I'm standing up, Headstrong, In control of my life
Now look into my eyes tell me do you see love
Of course not, I got no mercy for no one
So if I stick my hands in others blood am I sick?
Or am I just another sick bitch lunatic
No life, No mind, Nothing left inside
Living for a lie
Brain washed, So lost, What's the point in trying
What's the point in fighting
You'll never end this in me
No voice, No choice, No true realality
Mentally controlled, Never to be set free
Not me, I'm addicted to sinnin
Killin every ???
God is Imaginary
God Is Imaginary...
Laaf durch die Nacht scho seit Stunden
Es schmerzt in meine Fiaß und i bin miad
Wos i suach hob i nu ned gfunden
Und mir is schlecht vor lauter Angst
Weil i mi fiacht
Oh mit dir hob i nu wos zum redn
Bevor i dei Gschicht verbrenn oder zerreiß (Eis, Eis)
Host mi domois einfach so verlossen
Mi lingglossen, verletzt auf
Befahrnem Gleis
I kon dir ned verzeihn und zu mei'm Leid
Kon i es ned vergessen, ned bis heid
I wui dass du woasst
Dass du mir weh do host
I wui dass du woasst
Es war ned einfach so vorbei
Zwoa Johr is her,
Und jetzt sitzt ma gegenüber
Du schaust mi o, ganz so ois ob nix war
Du lachst bloß liab und moanst zu mir
"Schwamm drüber"
"In meine Aung häddst
Du gseng i wissads a:
Dass unsere Liaison jetzt vorbei is
So fix wia's ogfangt häd,
So heads a wieder auf
Du hädst dacht unsere
Liab braucht koana Worte
Und du host so Recht weil i
Koane Worte mehr von dir brauch
Du machst auf armer Hund
Doch woaßt genau
Im Grunde ganz diaf unten
Bist a feige Sau
I wui dass du woasst
Dass du mir weh du host
I wui dass du woasst
Es war ned einfach so vorbei
I wui dass du woasst
Dass I jede Nacht schwach gwen bin
Wach gleng bin bis in da Friah
Erst wenn i woass dass
Du woaßt wos bassiert is
Erst wenn i woass
Dass du ned nur so duast
Erst wenn du woasst,
Wos es hoaßt wenn di wer alloa losst
Du dauernd denkst, Du bist Schuid
Oh erst dann Schlaf i wieder ei
I woke up in the morning
Seven twenty-four
Drank a cup of coffee
Stepped out the door
I said Goodbye
To my old best friend
I took a ride
To the old West End
I walked along Princes Street
My feet were hurting bad
As I squirmed inside my shoes
I was thinking about my dad
There was the bones of a song
Beatin' around my head
Unless I remember it wrong
This is what it said:
Edinburgh Castle hugging the sky
Cold grey stone, humourless and dry
Sitting like a cork on top of the town
One of these days I'm gonna blow you down
I jumped on a bus
A trusty number 23
To the Royal Botanical Gardens
Where a ghost was calling me
I saw a brace of weeping willows
A burnt and withered land
I saw a man and a little boy
Holding hands
I scanned the skyline
It was like the backdrop of a play
I never saw your heartless beauty
Until I'd been away
As I was climbing up The mound
It struck me like a chime
I must have dreamed this scene
About a thousand times
Edinburgh Castle hugging the sky
Cold grey stone, humourless and dry
Sitting like a cork on top of the town
One of these days I'm gonna blow you down
I found myself on Forrest Road
Feeling pretty sore
This city once was mine
But it ain't mine anymore
And here's my old school, "Jingling Geordie's"
And I must confess
I couldn't step through that gate
Until I'm better dressed
Back at Waverly Station
Half dead on my feet
I got on board the four forty-four
Promptly fell asleep
I woke up in Queen Street
At my journey's end
I've got to say it's totally great
To be back in Glasgow again
Edinburgh Castle hugging the sky
Cold grey stone, humourless and dry
Sitting like a cork on top of my town
One of these days I'm gonna blow you down
When I die... 
Spread my ashes in the sea 
Set me free from humanity 
When I die... 
Give me back to the endless wild 
Give me back to the earth we've defiled 
How I long to be at peace, 
To be absolved through eternal sleep 
When I die, set me free from the lies 
Of this culture you call civilized 
Entire lives spent longing for escape 
As we grind ourselves into early graves 
For precious progress we lay this world to waste 
Day by day, the violence is ingrained
You drag my name through the mud
You show no remorse for the lies you told
You take no control for the pain you seem to cause
My advice to you, my friend?
You better back off if you know what's good
'Cause you won't believe the state I'm in
You better back off if you know what's good
I'll see your face in hell, my friend
You better back off if you know what's good
You better back off if you know what's good
I'll see your face in hell, my friend
'Cause you won't believe the state I'm in
I'll see your face in hell, my friend
Job well done on your smear campaign
I've learned to live with the lies
I'm the self-appointed queen of shit
The projection of your sick disease
Look around at what you did
Look around at what you did
I have just one thing left to say...
You better back off if you know what's good
You better back off if you know what's good
'Cause you won't believe the state I'm in
You better back off if you know what's good
I'll see your face in hell, my friend
I'll destroy you
Better back off if you know what's good
I'll destroy you
Better back off if you know what's good
I'll destroy you
Better back if you know what's good
'Cause you won't believe the state I'm in
You better back off if you know what's good
'Cause I'll see your face in hell, my friend
'Cause I'll see your face in hell, my friend
'Cause I'll see your face in hell, my friend
'Cause I won't believe the state I'm in
'Cause I won't believe the state I'm in
'Cause I can't believe the state I'm in
I'll destroy you.
I may not mystify you
In your search for higher love
I may just slip right by you
With your eyes turned up above.
We may not compromise
I may not suit your taste tonight
My love
But as the time goes by
You might think that I'm all right
My love, my heavy love.
A noise, your phone is ringing
Or is that someone at your door
Inside your head I'm singing
Inside your heart I cry for more.
You may not hear me calling
You may not feel me bawling out
My love
But heavy rocks are falling
Heavy love is coming down
My love, my heavy love.
A noise, your phone is ringing
Or is that someone at your door
Inside your head I'm singing
Inside your heart I dig for more.
We may not compromise
I may not suit your taste tonight
My sweet love
But as the time goes by
You might think that I'm all right
My love, my heavy love.
My heavy love.
You and Me
We can make it last
You and me
We can make it last
You and me
We can make it last
You and me
We can make it last
You and me...
It was me and you Trina who shared the hard times
Still in love wit niggas who was serving some hard times
Or involved wit niggas who lost their lives
When Hollywood passed I nearly lost my mind
I then rolled wit the traffickers worked in the Maximas
When D.A in back of us, I'm stretched out nervous
Asking myself, "Bitch was this really worth it?"
What's my purpose I gotta keep searching
It was me and you Trina who asked the same questions
We decided when and which hoes we would fuck it
Shop wit thug wit get into some thug shit
Turn 'em on to niggas who deep into that thug shit
Get money fuck a little let a nigga touch a little
Had to make moves our home was so fucking little
Feel that? I know you do, guess what I wrote it too
Please recognize this is a hip hop quoteable
(Chorus) + (over lapping the chorus)
(And even through the loneliest time
We survived through our loneliest nights
Just think about the struggling times
When we survived through a nickel and dime
And even if I had all the bread in the world
I'd give it all up for one shot at
You and Me, I'm that same bitch)
You and me were best friends but I'm the one you talk about?
I showed love to everybody before I walked about
The parties the club the function
I leave you bring up discussions on who I'm fucking
You and me were best friends we talked about abortions
As little girls hair braided o the same porches
We promised each other we would share the same losses
Ya baby daddy passed we share the same losses
It was you and me hoe getting c-notes
Bell hoppers to the death while Irish hoes deep throat
Yeah it's beef in the air and why she know
If anybody do she know how we flow
Miami bitches you know how we go
Nice entourage lock mints wonder bras
Sit in the club I miss how it was
(Chorus) + (over lapping the chorus)
You know it's really funny how the tables turn
I moved forward and thank God for the lessons learned
I used to strip clubs as a stepping stone
Hit the stage got paid it wasn't my second home
Ask somebody Trina been the shit on the streets
Roll wrap late nights been the shit on the beach
Brought blue baby jeans just to shit on the?
Keep tall body guys just to sit underneath
Sit back pop bottle y'all sit on y'all feet
Screaming my name tryna get in V.I.P
I don't own the club boo
I'm just showing love too
But every time I see ya face I think of me and you
It's disappointing that you fell off well not fell off
I just can't accept you not being well off
It wouldn't be me if I didn't tell all
I even tried to call you but ya cell off
(Chorus) + (over lapping the chorus)
I am left in the night, trembling with fear,
I have seen to the future, and the future is here,
Our leader will bring victory, but our land is in flames,
And as the final sounds of battle disappear, I had to say,
What about me, and you, and the ones that we love,
What about me, and you, and the ones that we love,  
Well what about us?
What you see is what you get
And no one promised you
I don't owe you shit
What you reap is what you sow
So you know I'll be waiting in the dark
Just to stick it in
What you see is what you get
And no one promised you
A free ride just to bleed me dry
What you reap is what you sow
So you know I'll be waiting in the dark
Just to fuck you up
Bloating at the bottom of the bottle
Hoping you don't suck it down
Bleeding me dry you're just a...
What you see is what you get
And no one promised you
I don't owe you shit
What you reap is what you sow
So you know I'll be waiting in the dark
Just to stick it in
What you see is what you get
And no one promised you
A free ride just to bleed me dry
What you reap is what you sow
So you know I'll be
Just wasting away
Bloating at the bottom of the bottle
Hoping you don't suck it down
Bleeding me dry you're just a...
You're just a parasite
What you see is what you get
Bloodworm, bloodworm
Bloating at the bottom of the bottle
Hoping you don't suck it down
Bleeding me dry you're just a...
You're just a parasite
Just a parasite
Bloodworm
Woo
She said "is anything wrong?"
And I tried to look away
She said I think we should
Put it down where secrets lay
I think we finally know
That this won't fill the space
It's over, it's nothing, it's now
The heaviest silence erased, hey hey
If you love me fucking let me go.
I will begin to turn it around
Try to start again and watch it come down
I will begin to turn it around
Try to start again and watch it come down
Come down
Woo
Come down
She said "I'll take you home"
I packed up my things
I knew I couldn't handle the words
And the deep regret they bring
I think we finally know
That this won't fill the space
It's over it's nothing it's now
It was more than we could face, hey hey.
If you love me fucking let me go.
I will begin to turn it around
Try to start again and watch it come down
I will begin to turn it around
Try to start again and watch it come down
Come down
Come
Woo
Come down
Come down
Start again
Start again
Start again
Why do I find myself here again you disappeared
With no last words I tried to keep you near.
But like he who stood before the open sea,
You rose your god damn hands and fucking parted me.
But I can start again.
I can try again.
I can always break but I can never bend.
You could lie again
Never to find again.
It was your mistake but I will start again
I will begin to turn it around
Try to start again and watch it come down
I will begin to turn it around
Try to start again and watch it come down
I... I... I...
Will start again
Woo
Come down.
High speed drift on a prairie road
Hot tires sing like a string being bowed
Sudden town rears up then explodes
Fragments resolve into white line code
Whirl on silver wheels
Black earth energy receptor fields
Undulate under a grey cloud shield
We outrun a river colour brick red mud
That cleaves apart hills soil rich as blood
Highway squeeze in construction steam
Stop caution hard hat yellow insect machines
Silver steel towers stalk rolling land
Toward distant stacks that shout "Feed on demand"
100 miles later the sky has changed
Urban anticipation -- we get 4 lanes
Red orange furnace sphere notches down
Throws up silhouette skyline in brown
Sundogs flare on windshield glass
Sudden swoop skyward iron horse overpass
Pass a man walking like the man in the moon
Walking like his head's full of Irish fiddle tunes
The skin around every city looks the same
Miles of flat neon spelling well-known names
Used trucks dirty donuts you you're the one
Fat wheeled cars squeal into the sun
Radio speakers gargle top 40 trash
Muzak soundtrack to slow collapse
Planet engines pulsate in sidereal time
If you listen close you can hear the whine
Gestern war die Sonne wieder größer als sonst und das Licht war auch viel heller,
Deshalb bekam ich mehr Energie und ich lief automatisch schneller.
Ich wollte einen alten Freund besuchen, aber unterwegs fiel mir ein,
Dass wir nicht mehr befreundet sind, da ließ ich es lieber sein.
Und die Sonne hat so stark gestrahlt, da brannte mein Verstand
Und er fragte - was ist gefährlicher, rassistische Polizisten oder Saharasand?
Hmmm, Saharasand
Was ist denn das für ein Vergleich, das klingt so hirnverbrannt.
Gibt es solche Polizisten in unserem Heimatland?
Und wenn tun sie mir nichts, denn ich bin viel zu weiß,
Für mich ist die Sonne gefährlicher, das ist der Beweis.
Und ich wischte mir den Schweiß von der Stirn mit einer Hand
Und sie fragte - was ist gefährlicher, rassistische Polizisten oder Saharasand?
Hmmm, Saharasand
Ich sah mir meine Hand an, sie hatte noch nie gesprochen.
Warum hatte sie ausgerechnet jetzt ihr Schweigen gebrochen?
Und dann fiel mir der Schwarze ein, der in einer Zelle verbrannte,
Das war ein so seltsamer Unfall, dass ihn noch niemand kannte.
Auf einer Pritsche Feuer gefangen, angekettet in unserem Land
Und ich fragte - was ist gefährlicher, rassistische Polizisten oder Saharasand?
Rassistische Polizisten oder Saharasand?
Sweet caress
Grazes my skin
It's loveless
These hooks sink in
Behind an angel's disguise
An insect preys
Mandibles cut like a knife
The reckoning
Forming clouds
Their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Descending down
Down they come
The swarm of locusts
Skies above
Converge to choke us
Feast of souls
Consume the harvest
Young and old
Suffer unto the locust
Surrender
These veins are bled
Devoured
Nothing sacred
Strings pull the marionettes
See how they dance
Upon the winds that beget
Our pestilence
Forming clouds
Their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Descending down
Down they come
The swarm of locusts
Skies above
Converge to choke us
Feast of souls
Consume the harvest
Young and old
Suffer unto the locust
Bleeding from my eyes
This plague is sent to erase us
Bleeding from inside
These vermin can't infiltrate us
Faith appears and holds a candle
Hark the angels sing
Forming clouds
Their shadow shrouds
Louder the tattered wings they sound
Tear the veil
The lies derail
Purity ever will prevail
Trumpets sound
The shattered crown
Halos of truth now they surround
The charade comes down
Down they come
The swarm of locusts
Skies above
Converge to choke us
Feast of souls
Consume the harvest
Young and old
Suffer unto the locust
Brother john saw visions of god
So they put him in chains
For acting too odd
As the crowd shouted, "off with his head"
The priest said, "have mercy
Let's burn him instead"
Trapped
Trapped in a world that he never made
I woke up with my head on the floor
In a windowless cell
A room full of doors
I got lost, now I'm so far behind
Took so much advice
Forgot my own mind
Trapped
Trapped in a world that I never made
We can't be slowed down by a big bunch of lip
And nobody cares about your paranoid trip
You know death and the devil sure got it easy today
Souls come so cheap some people give theirs away
You've got to break out, you've got to prove you're alive
What makes you think that the weak survive
And if you don't have the stomach
For all this radical crap
Then have the guts to stand for something
Or you're gonna be trapped
Trapped
Trapped in a world that you never made
Speak your mind and tell me something
Tell me something I can't remember
Speak your mind and tell me something
Are we meant to be together?
Speak your mind and speak it clearly
Speak it truthfully or speak it never
Speak it honestly and gently
Are we meant to be together?
You keep on asking me this question
Everyday now, for what seems forever
You keep on asking me this question
Are we meant to be together?
I'll speak my mind when I am ready
When I'm willing and when I'm able
When I've had the time to think
Of what is causing all the trouble
"Alot deeper than peter"
(Type o negative cover, written by Peter Steele)
She's in love with herself.
She likes the dark.
On her milk white neck.
The Devil's mark.
It's all Hallows Eve.
The moon is full.
Will she trick or treat.
I bet she will.
She's got a date at midnight.
With Nosferatu.
Oh baby, Lilly Munster.
Ain't got nothing on you.
Well when I called her evil.
She just laughed.
And cast that spell on me.
Boo Bitch Craft.
Yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing.
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing.
Dye 'em black.
Black no. 1
Little wolf skin boots.
And clove cigarettes.
An erotic funeral.
For witch she's dressed.
Her perfume smells like.
Burning leaves.
Everyday is Halloween.
Loving you was like loving the dead.
I could have found a way.
I would have found a way.
Did you want me to break down?
Did you want me to give in?
Found so many ways to hate myself.
Found so many ways to put them all away.
Don't care if the whole world falls apart.
Don't care if you hated me from the start...
You bring out the worst in me!
Pick and peel it off, this dried up skin.
Strip it away, this flesh and gore.
Open it up, the stink of you sin.
Was it holy as you hoped, at heart, at the core?
Did you want me to break down?
Did you want me to give in?
Found so many ways to hate myself.
Found so many ways to put them all away.
Don't care if the whole world falls apart.
Don't care if you hated me from the start...
You bring out the worst in me!
I make you stronger.
You make me weaker.
Can't take this much longer...
Since I stopped being a seeker.
Pick and peel it off, this dried up skin.
Strip it away, this flesh and gore.
Open it up, the stink of your sin.
Was it holy as you hoped, at heart, at the core?
Did you want me to break down?
Did you want me to give in?
Found so many ways to hate myself.
Found so many ways to put them all away.
Don't care if the whole world falls apart.
Don't care if you hated me from the start...
You bring out the worst in me!
I make you stronger.
You make me weaker.
Can't take this any longer.
Since I stopped being a seeker...
Rip and tear this un-bleeding dead.
Naked and cold, nothing left to steal.
Can't get it back, wish I was dead instead.
It will never close, this fucking sore will never heal!
I am a ghost, you are my host.
You will never see me again.
Since you've been gone I feel so much better
'Cause I saw how mean you could be
I used to want some explanation
Now all I want is my Patsy Cline CD
How I've waited for today
When I could finally say
You jerk
You jerk
You are such a jerk
There are other words
But they just don't work
Sometimes I wish I'd mailed you that letter
That said the things I dare not say
Instead I set the thing on fire
I had to say this outloud anyway
I'm so glad I found the nerve
To say what you deserve
You jerk
You jerk
You are such a jerk
There are other words
But they just don't work
They try to be so cool
Insult you like a fool
Never take your call when you're nobody at all
Until you're somebody and then they want to be your friend
How come jerks don't know they're jerks
(I don't know)
So next time someone makes you feel little
Just sing this song inside your head
And like a great big cartoon bubble
These lovely words will dance above their head
How I've waited for today
When I could finally say
You jerk
You jerk
You are such a jerk
There are other words
But they just don't work
You jerk
You jerk
You are such a jerk
There are other words
But they just don't work
You love this ass
You love this ass
You love this ass
You wanna bite it
You give me dirty looks because I been what you want
Do what you don't
Anything goes
He put the meat over the bone
Set me on his throne
Bitch he made me moan!
And left you home alone
Your girlfriend told me he'd been callin' out my name
And I told her "Sorry baby, but I'm not the one to blame,
You better watch your man 'cause he's spendin' all your cash,
And you know what's even worse,
It's 'cause he loves this ass"
You love this ass
You love this ass
Your mama and your daddy know you love this ass
You love this ass, why not shake it?
You love this ass, why not make it?
Take her to dinner, but come to me for desert
'Cause I'm a flirt and lift my skirt, and I don't care if it hurts
I got a man at home but, he ain't here tonight
Do you mind if I were yours?
You two just don't look right.
You think you're set 'cause you get lotsa hoes,
You're skinny and pretty and ...?
And I ain't comin' around just to see them get pissed
'Cause they know when they're hoes, they're about to get jizzed
You love this ass
You love this ass
Tell all those other bitches they can kiss my ass
You love this ass
So don't hide it
You love this ass
You act like you don't want it 'cause I'm with too many guys, but in the middle of the night, you called me twenty five times!
You call me a whore, but you always come back for more
Your other hoochie mamas aren't wet like me
Won't make you sweat like me
They wanna get with me
'Cause I got more back than them, so it makes alot of sack
They all hate me 'cause he loves it
Always miss it 'cause he does it
And whenever he's with you
He wishes that you was me
You love this ass
You love this ass
You buy me lots of stuff because you love this ass
You love this ass, so just take it
You love this ass, want me to make it?
You know those other girls just can't grind like me,
Make you blind like me,
There's no kind like me.
Maybe I'm a ho,
But that's why I know
How to work it, jerk it, make you go bizerk it,
Ride it, slide it, just the way you like it,
Kiss it, fist it, ?
Tease you, please you, till I'm underneath you
You love this ass
You love this ass
You're always at my house because you love this ass
You love this ass, in the jacuzzi
You love this ass, more than her pussy
Girl I must confess I wore that dress so he would cum on my breasts
I wore them ? to make you bite,
Whether it's wrong or it's right
And I don't care if what I wear makes everyone stare
'Cause he loves my behind,
Your man is mine!
You love this ass
You love this ass
I like doing it with you because you love this ass
You love this ass, so don't fight it
You love this ass, I'll copyright it
You love this ass
You love this ass
You wanna bite it?
You love this ass
You know you love this ass
People moving out
People moving in
Why?
Because of the color of their skin
Run, Run, Run but you sure can't hide
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
Vote for me, I'll set you free
Rap on brother, rap on
Well the only person talking about love
Thy brother is a preacher
See, No body is interested in learning
But the teacher
Segregation
Domination
Demonstration
Integration
Aggrivation
Humiliation
Obligation to the nation
Ball of Confusion, Ball of Confusion
That's what your world today
Ball of Confusion, Ball of Confusion
That's what your world today
Is like an all time high
City's aflame in the summer time, and
Oh, The beat goes on
Evolution, Revolution, Evolution...
Gun Control, the sound of soul
Politicians, can you fucking believe them?
And the band played on
And the band played on
Round and around and around we go
Where ever we're standing no body knows
Take a look around
Can't you hear me talking to you?
Just a
Ball of Confusion, Ball of Confusion
That's what your world today
Ball of Confusion, Ball of Confusion
That's what your world today
See it in the air
Tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
Killers gangs watch your ass
Gun control, the sound of soul
Segregation
Domination
Demonstration
Integration
Aggrivation
Humiliation
Obligation to the nation
Ball of Confusion, Ball of Confusion
That's what your world today
That's what your world today
Ball of Confusion, Ball of Confusion...
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well I got it all up here, see
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well they think they got it all out there, see
Well they can fuck off, 'cause they ain't got me, and they can't buy my dignity,
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Let me tell you, I got it up here see.
They tried to get me with the TV show,
But I wouldn't have none of it, no, no, no.
Standards and values on the living room screen,
Sarah Jessie Parker acting mean.
She's got it all, that's what they want you to think,
But if you read between the lines, you'll see the missing link.
She's just a puppet in their indoctrination plan,
"Be like me girls and become a real man,"
Live to the full, always act flash,
Don't use your brain when your body makes a splash.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well I got it all up here, see
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well they think they got it all out there, see
Well they can fuck off, 'cause they ain't got me, and they can't buy my dignity,
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Let me tell you, I got it up here see.
They tried to get me in the supermarket store,
Bought what I wanted, and they said "buy more."
Gallons of crap that nobody really needs,
Bright coloured wrappers to suit assorted greeds.
They know it all, that's what they want you to think,
But if you read between the lines, you'll see the missing link.
Buy this product, pay for the crap,
One quarter for the product, three quarters for the wrap.
Be a happy family, like the people on the pack,
Pay up to the profit, and you'll never look back.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well I got it all up here, see
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well they think they got it all out there, see
Well they can fuck off, 'cause they ain't got me, and they can't buy my dignity,
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Let me tell you, I got it up here see.
They tried to get me with their learning and their books,
Their deep understanding and intelligent looks,
All of the time, they never ever saw me,
They were just looking for what they wanted to see.
They know it all, that's what they want you to think,
But if you read between the lines, you'll see the missing link.
Books are easy back ups for what they do to you,
They'll bind you up as slaves for the privileged few,
Proof lies in history, say "that's how it always was,
Slavery and mastery - be one of us."
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well I got it all up here, see
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well they think they got it all out there, see
Well they can fuck off, 'cause they ain't got me, and they can't buy my dignity,
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Let me tell you, I got it up here see.
Tried to get me with religion and their Christ,
Said I'd get to heaven if I acted real nice,
But they were just preparing a crucifix for me,
A life of guilt and pain, of holy misery.
They know it all, that's what they want you to think,
But if you read between the lines, you'll see the missing link.
The bible's just a blueprint for their morality scam,
Another load of shit about how it's never been.
They stand there in the pulpit, doling out their lies,
Offering forgiveness, then they talk of eyes for eyes.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well I got it all up here, see
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well they think they got it all out there, see
Well they can fuck off, 'cause they ain't got me, and they can't buy my dignity,
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Let me tell you, I got it up here see.
They tried to get me, but I won't be got,
They say I'm a misfit but I say I'm not,
I never set out to exploit another,
Those smarmy bastards would steal from their mother.
They got it all, that's what they want you to think,
But if you read between the lines, you'll see the missing link.
They plundered and slaughtered in the name of truth,
Acceptance of normality is what they want from you as proof,
They think they got the answers, but there's something that they missed,
Their cup which overfloweth, is just filled up with piss.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well I got it all up here, see
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well they think they got it all out there, see
Well they can fuck off, 'cause they ain't got me, and they can't buy my dignity,
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Let me tell you, I got it up here see.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well I got it all up here, see
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well they think they got it all out there, see
Well they can fuck off, 'cause they ain't got me, and they can't buy my dignity,
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Let me tell you, I got it up here see.
Instrumental
Hey yeah we had everything
Vinyl in mono
And we looked the other way
Man we were so dumb
Is this the part in the book that you wrote
Where I gotta come and save the day
Did you miss me
Did you miss me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Well they say that rock is dead
And they're probably right
99 girls in the pit
Did it have to come to this?
Oh God you owe me one more song
So I can prove to you that
I'm so much better than him
Oh god please listen fast
Here comes the crash
We're gonna rise above
We gotta smash it up
You won't abandon us again
Give us brilliant boys we wanna fuck, man
Full of ecstasy, hard drugs and bad luck
Yeah yeah yeah
Turn the lights back on
You burn so hard
But you won't burn long
Three chords in your pocket tonight
Are you, you the one
With the spark to bring my punk rock back
(I don't think so)
Oh God I wanna hear you say
I wanna hear you say, that you're sorry again
Oh God you owe me one more song
So I can prove to you
That I'm so much better than him
Oh God I'd give you anything
To hear you say that I was right
And you were wrong
Oh God before I leave this life
Enable us to love,
A hooker's never gonna come
Just give it back to me
Blow out all of the lights tonight
Oh yeah
Drive a million miles down the PCH
(And now he's gone)
I slashed his tires, I bled his brakes
(It had to be done)
Their hand-job lives were just too cruel
(But) mercy was done
We drowned them all in their swimming pools
Run away, run away, run away yeah
Oh God I wanna hear you say
I wanna hear you say that you were wrong again
Oh God I wanna hear you say
I wanna hear you say that
That I'm so much better than him
Oh God you owe us one more song
Get out of my life
See this world as it really is
Is it just a sad slide show
Can you make a hooker cum?
And enable us to love
I need one thing that's divine
Let me hear it tonight
Let me hear it tonight
I've gotta hear it tonight
You're gonna let me hear the lost chord tonight
Yeah

You've got a lot to lie about
All the angles you've covered up
We've got plenty to talk about because some of them you just
Can't block
Pretend you're the daughter of elvis and you're married to
The king of pop
Without worldwide belief, you step up to the mic and blow
It off
You're in over your head
This time you're in over your head
You're in over your head
This time you're in over your head
If it's any indication of what it's really like to be you
If it's any consolation, I guess I wouldn't want to be you
Can't say that I'm crazy about anything that you do
Without concrete belief, you step up to the edge and follow
Through
You're in over your head
This time you're in over your head
Just when you thought it was safe, you got raped
A fickle incision from the hand that fed you in the first
Place
Ten million opinions in your skin color face
Contrary to popular belief, this time you caught your foot
In the grave
Could it be that I'm demanding
Could it hurt me later on
I don't care I only have one life to live
I wanna take you in my arms so I can give
But I know that it won't be this way
Could it be that I'm too selfish
Could it kill me later on
I don't care I only have one life to live
I wanna take you in my arms so I can give
But I know that it won't be this way
I never thought how was I to know
That you would leave me now
I never thought that you would go
Could it be that I'm still hungry, hungry
Could it hurt me later on
I don't care I only have one life to live
I wanna take you in my arms so I can give
But I know that it won't be this way
I never thought how was I to know
That you would leave me now
I never thought that you would go
I don't care I only have one life to live
I want to take you in my arms so I can give you my heart
But I know that it won't be this way
I never though how was I to know
That you would leave me now
I never thought that you would go
I never thought that you would leave me this way
Hurt me this way, take me with you
I never thought
I was thinking about thinking
About thinking about thinking
I was thinking
Contemplating situations
And the visions blew my mind
In the gutter I was crawling
As the shells just kept on falling
All around me
What colour is God? Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
What colour is God? Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
What colour is God? Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
As the library was burning
And the pages kept on turning
Back in history
As the doorways they were full
Of refugees and lonely people
Staring at me
They were asking of me
What colour is God?
What colour is God?
What colour is God?
No matter what I say or do
It never looks like making any difference
Don't keep on looking down at me
As if I don't exist, as if I'm not here
Don't focus all your anger and resentment that you have
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
What colour is God? Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
What colour is God? Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
What colour is God? Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
Black brother in an open sports car
Pulled over by suspicious officer
Uniform man got a nervous partner
Weapon was pulled from a shoulder holster
White jogger see the roadside gangsta
Heart beat just a little bit faster
Rasta man speaking in the island patios
Gonna give you the righteous answer
Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
What colour is God?
What colour is God? Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
What colour is God? Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
What colour is God? Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
No matter what I say or do
It never looks like making any difference
Don't focus all your anger and resentment that you have
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
What colour is God? Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
What colour is God? Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
What colour is God? Why can't you tell me, can't you tell me?
Please, please, please tell me
Please, please, please tell me
What colour is God?
Following a proven time line the social upheaval starts
The fools Slogan has become an anthem I watch ascend the charts
The powers that be let take hold a movement which they abhor
"They can have this revolution as long as they remember who gets to win the war"
I'm ready for some hard times
The boredom's beginning to show
We can't possibly lose this one
The answer already known
They give them civil rights to appear on the left
We stay stuck in the maternal gaze suckling the demons breast
But when the stomping of the jack boots starts, all we be crushed under foot
Master horned head turns to see what's on the bottom of his hoof
Marching around the square they are all dead on their feet
Watch the dance as they dance such a pretty dance their legs are worn down to the knees
The revolution has gone the way of so many before
Circular Nature of Social Evolution: They will never win the war
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment...
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
(Yo) His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope
 
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's
Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)
No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)
You can do anything you set your mind to, man.
Live by the gun
And die by the gun
...So they say
The pressure's building
The blood is coursing through my veins
I feel like I could lose my mind
I feel like I could go insane
The dam's about to burst
I feel like I could lose my mind
Shoot'em up, let god sort'em out in the end
It's not my fault anyway
Society has made me temporarily insane
Shoot'em up
And Shoot it up
And Shoot'em again
Shoot'em up
And Shoot it up
And Shoot'em again
Shoot'em up
And Shoot it up
And take away my pain...
Shoot'em up
And Shoot it up
And take away my pain...
For the need to breed and consume...
And die
All over again
I am God
I decide whether you live or you die
Only a loser would live his life this way
I'm sick of the sickening fakes
Consumers consume my soul away
Wouldn't it be nice to just blow them all away?
Away!
Shoot'em up, let god sort'em out in the end
It's not my fault anyway
Society has made me mentally insane
That's what they'll claim...
Shoot'em up
And Shoot it up
And Shoot'em again
Shoot it up
And Shoot'em up
And Shoot it again
Shoot'em up
And Shoot it up
And Shoot'em again
And take away my pain...
For the need to breed and consume...
And die
And do it all over again
The pressure's building
The blood is coursing through my veins
I feel like I could explode
I feel like I could loose control
The dam's about to burst
I feel like I could go insane!
So blow'em all...
Blow'em all...
So blow'em all
Blow'em all away!
Shoot'em up, let god sort'em out in the end
It's not my fault anyway
Society has made me mentally insane
That's what they'll claim...
Shoot'em up
And Shoot it up
And Shoot'em again
Shoot'em up
And Shoot it up
And Shoot'em again
Shoot'em up
And Shoot it up
And take away my pain...
Shoot'em up
And Shoot it up
And Shoot'em again
Shoot it up
Shoot it up
Shoot it up
Seven on the beat
Kansas City, motherfuckface (word)
See I don't wear those trendy-ass dunks anymore, or them dumb-ass Bathing Ape hoodies
You know what, man? This is not an independent rap beat, can you tell?
Listen to that bass. (Rhymesayers entertainment)
It's gonna flip your car over
What I want you to do is, uh-
Tell your grandmother to stop bitching, load your bong up, take a fat-ass hit right now
Good evening, I've arrived to clean your pill drawer out
And talk to birds like Kilgore Trout
I shout out loud
I think that most these rappers out are probably into guys actually
'Cause they want five mics, I'd rather have five Mallories
When I write unraveled violent shades of quite contagious psycho babble
Hit me with a big steel shovel
Dig me in the white stone gravel
At the live show frazzled
Provoke the ravenous mischief the counter rhythms are rowdy
But fuck these rappers, they're bitches
Cops come with their sirens like 'wee-ooh, wee-ooh'
I'm too illegal with the ink pen
Push or click over like somebody's trying to beep in
Everyday is Saturday so baby hit the snooze button, let's sleep in
I say I'm selfish but they never listen
So I took 'em Christmas shopping and I bought myself a television
Better find the troll up hold up got a clever line to pull up
Johnny Rotten popped an Oxycontin, nevermind the bullocks, oh!
Live up in your city I'm about to steal the show
These people disagree but I don't listen to 'em though
I'll never do a stupid dance up in my video
I'm perfectly content with being crazy
(x2)
I received an e-mail from the president of a Nigerian bank
It said he had a hundred thousand dollars for me (Thanks!)
I can now invent my engine for the hard shell truth served
In the barbell-brute version of Marcel Proust words in a capsule
Attacking the vocabulary kingdom, see not everybody's cool
I got the swagger of a penguin
What you're seein is a dirty splash of Kansas City Eurotrash
Your surly-ass uncle, counting dirty cash
Cops pull me over with their sirens like 'wee-ooh, wee-ooh'
I'm driving drunk like it's the weekend
Boy I gives a fuck, me and the homie Al Swearengen chill, brandy I'll swill, taking synthetic heroin pills
I lo-lo-love the taste of hops and malted barley and beer
It makes me wanna bite who's on stage like Carlos Mencia
But I don't steal, I've had a charming career
So bring your armor and gear
Because the dope style harbingers here
Oh!
Live up in your city I'm about to steal the show
These people disagree but I don't listen to 'em though
I'll never do a stupid dance up in my video
I'm perfectly content with being crazy
(x2)
Buy me a drink I've got some craziness to kill
People spreading rumors, they ain't saying shit for real
Kansas City motherfucker, full of dangerous skill
I'm perfectly content with being crazy (Hell yeah)
(x2)
My leader told me to jump in the river
The river was deep and the weather was winter
After a sailer very kindly saved me
My leader told me, you'd better take it easy
I took it so easy my leader called me lazy
Through the lack of red meat
Everything was getting hazy
Friends looked at me and said,
Man, you gotta be crazy
Oh, oh leader
My leader said son you'd better get yourself together
Never mind the fools who know what we're getting into
But a forty mile walk would do us both a world of good
And he sat down and watched me take off down the road
Well, I walked so far my feet began to bleed
If this was good for me I just couldn't see it
A motorist picked me up and said
Look man, you must be crazy
Oh, oh leader
Oh, oh leader
My leader came to see me in a hospital bed
Well at least I really knew that my leader really cared
After giving me a second-hand roach
He said where's your donation man,
It's all for a good cause.
He left me all alone to work the riddle out
But I just couldn't make it so I began to shout
They stuck a hypodermic deep down into me
Said, look out nurse I think we got a loony
Oh, oh leader
Okay baby follow me now
Follow your leader
All right
Now here I sit in a state-run asylum
Limitless, friendless but much more together
I decided to do some good book readin'
About the art of people leadin'
Now I'm the leader and they're being led
What's the matter if they're crazy till you hear what I've said
Being the leader is really where it's at
But just how long can a good thing last
Oh, oh leader
Oh, oh leader
Now listen to this baby
This is the year of the guru
Now the thing to do is to ask yourself
What can a guru do for me?
Then you say to yourself
I gotta get a guru
There's colors on the street
Red, white, and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes
There's a warning sign on the road ahead
There's a lot of people saying
We'd be better off dead
Don't feel like Satan
But I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
There's an old street light (near a garbage can)
Near a garbage can (near a garbage can)
And now she puts the kid away
And she's gonna get a hit
She hates her life
And what she's done to it
There's one more kid
That'll never go to school
Never get to fall in love
Never get to be cool
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Truly, fuck the world,
For all it's worth,
Every inch of planet Earth,
Fuck myself,
Don't leave me out,
Don't get involved,
Don't corner me
Inside, ulcer,
Unjust bastards,
File out face first
Meet the lies and see what you are
It's forcing you down, and it's grinding against you
Let the war nerve break
For every fucking second the pathetic media pisses on me and
Judges what I am in one paragraph - Look here - Fuck you all
Expect the worse,
You bleeding heart,
But kill me first
Before it starts,
Yes my cock is getting hard,
We are born different after all
Invite mayhem,
Produce weapons,
Shoot out,
Burn down
No CNN or media now
It's forcing you down, and it's grinding against you
Let the war nerve break
All the money in the fucking world couldn't buy me
A second of trust or one ounce of faith in anything you're about
Fuck you all
Nothing is worth the sleep that I've lost
Apologies unacceptable now
A blistered revenge awaits in me
This is fucking loveless
Hate
Hate mail is not read, in jail instead
Hate
The Lord knows,
There's worse
Ignore, this curse
Hate
God gave you life
So get out of mine
And take your sorry ass
Back to florida
You're not welcome here
Ain't it perfectly clear
Take your sorry ass
Back to florida
You bring us down
Don't come around
You bring us down
You bring us down
You live a charmed life
But nothing seems right to you
Roses and wine
Thorns and vinegar
Your only delight
Is other's demise
So take your sorry ass
Back to florida
She was a girl from Birmingham
She just had an abortion
She was a case of insanity
Her name was Pauline she lived in a tree
She was a no one who killed her baby
She sent the letters from the country
She was an animal
She was a bloody disgrace!
Body
I'm not an animal
Body
I'm not an animal
Dragged on a table in a factory
Illegitimate place to be
In a packet in the lavatory
Die little baby screaming
Body
Screamin fucking bloody mess
It's not an animal
It's an abortion
Body, I'm not an animal
Mummy, Mummy, Mummy I'm not an abortion
Throbbing squirm 
Gurgling bloody mess
I'm not a discharge
I'm not a nurseing protein
I'm not a throbbing squirm
Fuck this and fuck that
Fuck it all and fuck
The fucking brat
She don't wanna baby that looks like that
I don't wanna baby that looks like that
Body

An abortion
Body

I'm not a body
 
I'm not an animal, an animal, an animal, an animal no no I ain't no animal
I'm not an animal 
Mummy!
I can remember
The very first time I cried
How I wiped my eyes
And buried the pain inside
All of my memories
Good and bad that's passed
Didn't even take the time to realize
Staring at the cracks in the walls
'Cause I'm waiting for it all
To come to an end
Still I curl up right under the bed
'Cause it's takin' over my head
All over again
Do you even know who you are?
I guess I'm trying to find
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
I want to be a star
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
Lying awake
Watching the sunlight
How the birds will sing
As I count the rings around my eyes
Constantly pushing
The world I know aside
I don't even feel the pain
I don't even want to try
I'm looking for a way to become
The person that I dreamt up
When I was 16
Oh, nothing is ever enough
Ooh, baby it ain't enough
For what it may seem
Do you even know who you are?
I'm still trying to find
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
Everybody wants to be...
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
No
Sorry girl
Tell a tale for me
'Cause I'm wondering
How you really feel
I'm a lonely girl
I'll tell a tale for you
'Cause I'm just trying to make
All my dreams come true
Do you even know who you are?
Oh yeah, yeah
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
Oh, I wanted to be a star
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell, I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
I guess not, oh, I guess not
Do you even know who you are?
Oh, I'm trying to find
A rising dream, or a falling star?
Oh, I have all these dreams
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
Oh, no, no
-Fades-
Do you even know who you are?
A rising dream, or a falling star?
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
So you start with your powertrip
You think I've lost my mind
But you might be the one who's lost my mind
And me wasting my time
I don't think so
Fucking beautiful screamer walks in with that look on his face that says
He thinks I've got no time
Left before he raises his fist to smash all the lies he thinks I've told him
But I don't I don't think so
Because this is not my trip
Why are you so sick
Why are you falling. falling
Because this is not my trip
Why are you so sick
Why are you falling. falling
Now you've grown into quite the man who beats his kids and slaps his wife
Because you've got no soul
And everything that you touch in this life will simply crumble and dissolve
Because I'm not yours
Because this is not my trip -
Why are you so sick
Why are you falling, falling
Because this is not my trip -
Why are you so sick
Why are you falling, falling
I ask you how many fucking times
Do I have to walk into that room
And see that look on your face
That says I have about one second left
And you think so you're so fucking right
But you know what I don't I don't think so
Well one day you will look back on your life with just complete disgust
Because you've got no time
Left to take back all the mistakes you've made
Your life is an apology
I don't think so
But this is not my trip -
Why are you so sick why are you falling - falling
But this is not my trip -
Why are you so sick why are you falling - falling
For this one I don't think so
Yeah ! Kpone inc come on!

Down in Vineland there's a clubhouse,

Do you go to the temple tonight?
Oh no, I don't think so
Do you not go to the palace of answers with me Marie?
Oh no, I don't think so, no
See when they offer me book of gold,
I know soon still that platinum is coming
And when I look inside of your temple
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man,
And when he beckons his finger to me,
Well, I move in another direction,
I move in another dimension
I move in another dimension oh oh oh
I spin, I spiral, and I splatter
Hand of God, I feel the finger,
Hand of God, and I start to whirl
And I whirl, and I whirl,
Don't get dizzy, do not fall now,
Turn, God, God (strange)
Go, go on, go like a dervish,
Turn, God, (strange) make a move

I'm asking my friend I need you again
Can you do something for me
Time it just passed and we had some laughs
Maybe it's just about greed
You'll always need me much more
Than I need you
You'll always need me much more
I need you
I'll ask you again but I don't think you've changed
You never did nothing for me
I wonder sometimes if you're looking down
On everything that you see
With all of your gold stories all told
Some things just aren't meant to be
You live in the past shadows don't last
This time it's all about me
You'll always need me much more than I need you
You'll always need me much more
You'll always need me much more than I need you
You'll always need me much more
I need you 
You'll always need me much more than I need you
I need you
You'll always need me much more
I need you
I need you
(Feat. Ozzy Osbourne)
(Busta Rhymes)
Just make sure them, them drums is smackin
...
This, means, WAR!
I work hard to take care of every one of my niggaz
Feel the love and appreciation from all of my niggaz
When I think meditate and contemplate for my soul
Watch the truth manifest once the story unfold
Disloyal motherfuckers I'ma BANISH you all
And celebrate all in your absence once I get rid of y'all
Sometimes I can't describe the wicked shit I feel in my heart
Break my silence and sporadically tear you apart
Strike with a serious vengeance and before you die
Put you through the worst and make you take a look in my eye!
So you could witness the extreme damage caused by betrayal
Make you sorry for the fact that you attempted and failed!
Make you eternally suffer, you was one of my mens
Turn your back on me, and I'ma make sure you get it back times ten
Stay TRUE -- now that's the one thing I religiously pledge
If you ain't wit me I'ma throw you WAY over the edge
This means war!
(Ozzy Osbourne)
Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
Give and you receive
Cherish every breath you breathe
Scriptures on the wall
Those who betray all must fall
(Busta Rhymes)
As I cherish every blessing and I greet you with hugs
You my peoples when I see you I embrace you with love
Yeah I be the one to come and get you out of the hole
Yeah you be the one to run and leave me out in the cold
So amazing how many times you plot and you scheme
But what you don't realize, you'll never conquer my dream
Though devilish karma can't penetrate the steel in my armor
Time passed, my oppression got you living with drama!
Paranoid of my retaliation, living in fear
Disloyalty will have me kill my brother, sheddin a tear
Such a shame how you could easily get trapped in a zone
And have to go to war with FAKE niggaz standin alone
Until I get with all my loyal niggaz goin' the length
Don't matter how hard you try you never weaken my strength!
Now I'm with all of my loyal niggaz, breakin the bread
And if you diss the code of honor we takin' your head;
This means war!
(Ozzy Osbourne)
Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
Give and you receive
Cherish every breath you breathe
Scriptures on the wall
Those who betray all must fall
Nobody helps them
Now he has his revenge
(Busta Rhymes)
Whatchu gon' do? Whatchu gonna do?
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!
I'ma BE the best to show love let's co-operate
Disloyalty is somethin' that we won't tolerate
Deal with these niggaz, let's put them where they properly go
On the Island far away in a place where NOBODY know
So long fightin the bullshit for so many years
Watchin the danger and niggaz double crossin they peers
Yes I always fight for what is right and put my foot down
Disrespect my love, I'ma be LAYIN YOU DOWN
This means war!
(Ozzy Osbourne)
Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
Give and you receive
Cherish every breath you breathe
Scriptures on the wall
Those who betray all must fall
I want it to be like it was before.
Kill Kill Kill Kill
To feed the need to feel the need to feed the need to bleed.
To feel you squirm
Ill make you feel just like a lowly worm
To feed the need to feel the need to feed the need to bleed.
To feel the pain
Liquid bliss
I need a fix
Self-medicate
Well I'm feeling great
To feel this pain
The pain...
The pain...
The pain junkie
Pain junkie
Pain junkie
Just a pain, pain junkie.
I just get little confused sometimes...
To feel the need to feed the need to feel the pain to feel the cut to tear my flesh With a razor blade
Feel the burn
Feel like a worm
Liquid bliss
Well I need a fix
Pain junkie
It will be weeks before they find her dead body
Lying in bed
The smell is intense
All the maggots made
A human flesh feast
Just a pain...
Pain junkie
Pain junkie
Losing a whole year
Losing a whole year
I remember you and me used to spend
The whole goddamned day in bed
Losing a whole year
Hiding in your room we'd lay like dogs
And the phone would ring like a joke that's left unsaid
Losing a whole year
Rich daddy left you with a parachute
Your voice sounds like money and your face is cute
But your daddy left you with no love
You touch everything with the velvet glove and
Now you want to try a life of sin
You want to be down with the down and in
Always copping my truths
I kind of get the feeling like I'm being used
And now I realize that you never heard
One goddamned word I ever said
Losing a whole year
Losing a whole year
I took your stuff and put it in the basement
When I found out what the smile on your face meant
I've seen you pop that check, babe
Craning your neck at the car wreck
And it always seemed the juice used to flow
In the car, in the kitchen, you were good to go
Now we're stuck with the tube
A sink full of dishes and some aqua lube
And I remember you and me used to spend
The whole goddamned day in bed
Losing a whole year
Hey, why... 
Losing a whole year
If it's not the defense then you're on the attack
When you start talking I hear the Prozac
Convinced you've found your place
With the pierced queer teens in cyberspace
When you were yourself there it tasted sweet
Sours into a routine deceit
Well this drama is a bore
And I don't want to play no more
Why, why
Why, why
Losing a whole year
I remember you and me used to spend
The whole goddamned day in bed
Hey, why
Hey, why
Little bitch wants money to burn
Little bitch got a lesson to learn
Little bitch try's to sing and dance
Make it big by showin some ass
Little bitch wants to live in her own delusions
Little bitch is the queen of the virtuous mask
Little bitch got lost in her own confusions
Little bitch ain't a genie in a bottle of glass
And when it all comes down
You'll be lost at the bottom
And when the fad dies out
You'll be long and forgotten
And when it all comes down
And when the smoke clears away
And when the fad dies out
You'll be nothing
A Pre canned star for mass production
A cookie cutter pop icon construction
A shallow little ass-kiss art disaster
The paychecks grow but respect dies faster
Little punk wanna be a big star
Little punk wanna get real far
Little punk did it all for the nookie
And that little punk did it all for the cookie
Little punk needs to be inside the public eye
Little punk wants to thrive on the industry lie
Little punk is the product of an inflated market
Little punk is the bull's-eye of the industry target
And when it all comes down
You'll be lost at the bottom
And when the fad dies out
You'll be long and forgotten
And when it all comes down
And when the smoke clears away
And when the fad dies out
You'll be nothing
A Pre canned star for mass production
A cookie cutter pop icon construction
A shallow little xxx kiss art disaster
The paychecks grow but respect dies faster
Opps you did it again, your 15 minutes is up
Oops you did it again, your 15 minutes is up
Oops you did it again, your 15 minutes is up
You little fucker
Oops you did it again, your 15 minutes is up
You little fuck
A Pre canned star for mass production
A cookie cutter pop icon construction
A shallow little xxx kiss art disaster
The paychecks grow but respect dies faster
Instrumental
Every fucking morning is the same bullshit
Drag my ass out of bed and stagger off to work
Working for shit another eight hours gone
My life is fucking pointless I'm getting nothing done
Fucking worthless parasite do your own fucking work
I'm not going to be a slave for the rest of my life
Fuck that fuck you I won't give in
I won't submit to your self destructive lifestyle
I would rather be miserable fo the rest of my life
Than be a happy idiot in your happy little world
And so a third of my life is gone with nothing to show
Just to get up and do it all again
I hate everything I fucking hate it all
I hate everyone I fucking hate them all
It's hard to live in a world when you fucking hate it all
Everyone and every thing you see makes you fucking sick
Right wing left wing sitting on a fence
Stupid fucking people think your going to change the world
That's the thing that fucks the most I know for a fact
Nothing is ever going to change it's going to stay the same
No matter what I do no matter what I say
It's all a fucking waste of time it's getting nothing done
I can yellscream and small all I want
But it doesn't fucking matter I'm playing a losing game
I live like a dog in a house full of shit
The best part is I get to pay for it
Sunday morning it's the same bullshit
Mindless apethetic fuckers flocking to church
Jerking off with god trying to run peoples lives
I don't need your ignorance get he fuk out of my face
Fucking fat pig drive around in your car
Who the fuck do you think you are to have power over me
With your gun, nightstick, and mace come on be a man
Beat the shit out of someone so you can get paid
Worthless white power piece of nazi fucking shit
Five on one come on and show me
How white you fucking are and how you can fight for your race
You don't scare me I won't turn my back
There's a broad river winding
Through this African lowland
The moon is held up orange and big
See it raise its hands
And the last ferry's pulling out
With no place left to stand
For the mines of Mozambique
There's a wealth of amputation
Waiting in the ground
But no one can remember
Where they put it down
If you're the child that finds it there
You will rise upon the sound
Of the mines of Mozambique
Some men rob the passersby
For a bit of cash to spend
Some men rob whole countries dry
And still get called their friend
And under the feeding frenzy
There's a wound that will not mend
In the mines of Mozambique
Night, like peace,
Is a state of suspension
Tomorrow the heat will rise
And mist will hide the marshy fields
The mango and the cashew trees
Which only now they're clearing brush from under.
Rusted husks of blown up trucks
Line the roadway north of town
Like passing through a sculpture gallery
War is the artist
But he's sleeping now
And somebody will be peddling vials of penicillin stolen out of all the medical kits sent to the countryside.
And in the bare workshop they'll be molding plastic into little prosthetic limbs
For the children of this artist
And for those who farm the soil that received 
His bitter seed...
The all-night stragglers stagger home
Cocks begin to crow
And singing birds are starting up
Telling what they know
And after awhile the sun will come
And we'll see what it will show
Of the mines of Mozambique
They say we been
Going down and going down
Been traveling on the road to nowhere
Going down, round and round
Trying to get to the place where we started
When I was just a boy
At four years old thought the world was joy
As a kid I'd play, just create the day
As I saw it my way
But time blows by
And strips us down to the bone
Poisoned winds of woe
Teach us that we're
Alone in this world
We learned to see all the corruption and greed
All its hate, All it's pain, so
A toast to the end of our innocence
A toast to a blank generation
They say we been
Going down and going down
Been traveling on the road to nowhere
Going down, round and round
Trying to get to the place where we started
When I was seventeen
Realizing the world wasn't what she seemed
Underneath the night San Fransisco sky
I would see, too clearly
But time blows by
And strips us down to the bone
Poisoned winds of woe
Teach us that we're
Alone in this world
We learned to see all the corruption and greed
All its hate, All it's pain, so
A toast to the end of our innocence
A toast to a blank generation
So here's to our collagen lips and saline tits
To our growth hormones and antibiotics
To the Hollywood world we made out of Barbie doll hearts
After we melted them down so we could make a new start
Here's to a generation scared and always wondering why
Instead of playing doctor we play shoot each other and die
Instead of ring around the rosie, we play hide from mommy
Cause mommy's been been drinking again and we don't want to get beat
Even with all our tattoos, and all our cheap thrills
There's still a hole inside of us that may not ever get filled
So we give back a little bit of what the worlds given us
Giving back a bit of never giving a fuck
Here's to the justice never dealt, to innocent, proven guilty
Here's to bad cops turning cheeks when real cops are on the street
Here's to the "Rat-tat-n-tat" of gun shots, and your life is shattered
Here's to "Gimme your cash or your brains is gettin' splattered"
Here's to mad cow disease and all that yummy MSG
Here's to Micky D's serving all those mutant chick-a-dees
This is a toast to celebrate the end of our innocence
This is a toast to celebrate how...
We've become desensitized
If life is to grow
Some life must die
We learned to take all the corruption and greed
All it's hate, all it's pain so
A toast to the end of our innocence
Our generation
We now embrace all the corruption
And greed, all it's hate, all it's pain, so
A toast to the end of our innocence
Our blank generation
Now what sound of my DJ cuts
Terminator's back on some ol' fools track
Takes a nation of sellouts to keep us back
Flippin disco raps used to be whack
Now what you hear is what you lack
Take a lil bit of this a lil bit of dat
Who dropped the bomb on hip hop
Who got biggie and who shot tupac
What's forgot / ain't no eazy, no scott larock
Now what's rap gotta do wit what you got
For whom the bell tolls
Is that the way the story goes
85% believing all the videos
God knows / who controls the radios
Some people chose the road to be hoes
And so I rose / in the middle of all the woes
And def jam / negroes turnin' up their nose
There's one way in no way out
No doubt the body count
Gettin' headz checkin' out
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Time to make life shine again like glass
Gotta make it shine like glass
Outraged against the scene
Proofread the script
Flipped it back so I'm back in gang green
We interrupt this routine I had a dream
Da clean protein smacked the gangsta lean
Between the triple team
Wiped 'em out like a drought
Damn I'm raps tetracycline
Them lips foretold these apocalypse
Everything had a shot
And got hit wit bullshit
Twisted politics tricks I couldn't get wit
As one quits another nitwit hits
All the way crazy, shady
World turned upside down
I put it down
Why destroy what you love
Look around
Surrounded by chalk marks on the ground
Where the lost got found
Why it all come tumblin down
Why he and she gotta die
Now how dat sound
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
On and on to the break a dawn
Some the 100 meter dash I'm the marathon
Been around a long time
But the rhyme the same
Sound remains insane
Exchange the reign
Ain't that somethin'
Figure I smashed the pumpkin
So I parallel the brains of cobain
Show no shame like the pain of kane
Gettin' madd opposition hip to the game
It's that gran ol' pe ammo
Different time different channel
Funky piano
Here to witness get on up with a quickness
S1's in the house
Wit the thickness that get dis
1 2 3 4 5 attackin they frat
Griff is back got 5 on it black
The track got x on the decks
Terminators back cause a dat is whack
On the 1 and 2
Yeah go flavor
Pe hit the road gettin' set to explode
Fight the power for peace
Can't forget the war mode
Overload
There she blows
Here we go
Now you know
Damn another alamo
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain 'til it hurts
You've taken all my money
And you want more
Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies who are fools of the first division
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
Kill-joy, bad guy
Big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good, are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide?
(I think you should)
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good?
Feel good
Talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot-air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown school-boy
Let me tan your hide
Dog with disease
You're the king of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Know-All
Was the fin on your back part of the deal?
Shark
Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
(You never did, right from the start)
Insane, should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Make yourself null and void
Make me feel good
I feel good
Father Lucifer you never looked so sane
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain
Tell me that you're still in love with that milkmaid
How's the Lizzies? How's your Jesus Christ been hanging?
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
He says he reckons I'm a watercolour stain
He says I run and then I run from him and then I run
He didn't see me watching from the aeroplane
He wiped a tear and then he threw away our apple seed
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
Can't go away
Every day is my wedding day
Though baby's still in his comatose state
I'll dye my own Easter eggs
Don't go yet just don't go
And Beenie lost the sunset but that's okay
Does Joe bring flowers to Marilyn's grave?
And girls that eat pizza
And never gain weight
And never gain weight
And never gain weight
Father Lucifer you never looked so sane
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain
Tell me that you're still in love with that milkmaid
How's the Lizzies? How's your Jesus Christ been hanging?
I'll take your eyelids out
I'll fuck you in the skull
I'll shoot your useless brain out
I'll fuck you in the hole
Look at me while you still have those beautiful eyes
I'll take them out and give your new boyfriend a nice surprise
I'll bladefuck your heart baby
I'll have you while you're proned
I'll break your legs before
You suck me like a whore
Scream out loud while your throat is clean and dry
You'll look all classy with your brand new colombian necktie
You'll get bladefucked
I'll bleed you dry, I'll even fuck your soul
Bladefucked
I'll show you why I gave you the main role
Bladefucked
Your man will be here, I'll call him on the phone
Bladefucked
I'll bathe in red, I'll break his every bone
Hush now whore
Everything around you turned to silence
Hush now whore
Every touch you craved for turned to violence
(Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum)
What's wrong with me?
(Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum)
Why do I feel like this?
(Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum)
I'm going crazy now
(Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum)
No more gas, in the red, can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said, can't even speak about it
On my life, on my head, don't wanna think about it
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort
Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

(Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum)
(Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum)
(Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum)
Faded pictures on the wall, it's like they talking to me
Disconnecting on calls, the phone don't even ring
I gotta get out or figure this shit out
It's too close for comfort, oh
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind it can control you
I feel like a monster, oh
Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light

(Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum)
Release me from this curse I'm in
Trying to maintain but I'm struggling
If you can't go-o-o
I think I'm gonna ah, ah, ah, ah
Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like

Into the arms of angels
[Intro - Faez One] + (Tony Perez)
(The rage of Angels) Yeah, uh huh
Been a lot of shit that I held back
But I'ma let you know now
Blackout, it's gettin' dark in here
(Verse 1 - Faez One)
Turn on the light, let me see what's in front of me
All of a sudden, this picture I painted just turned ugly
I'm tryin' to do good, but the devil's fuckin' wit me
'Cause I ain't ever had no beef, but now I need some fuckin' heat
It seems like every time I get it I lose it
Get it, abuse it, and what I'm left with is useless
'Cause three years in a row, I felt like the world was mine
And three years in a row, I lost it all in the blink of an eye
And I believe what I do'll come back one day
But why am I still losin'? I can't take the pain
Am I to blame? Please excuse me for my rotten ways
I'm just tryin' to do what I gots to do so I get paid
Get down and pray to the souls from up above
And hopefully my guardian angel will show me some love
Forgive me for my sins and all the shit that I did
And hopefully she won't let it reflect onto my kid
[Chorus - Faez One and Crypt The Warchild] + (Tony Perez)
(The rage of Angels)
They say, "One day here, it'll make sense"
That's why we get high and stay bent
Even the rose grows from the pavement
Tell 'em, Tone (The rage of Angels)
(Verse 2 - Crypt The Warchild)
Y'all don't know what it's like bein' born with stress against you
Only feelin' in this world is the life within you
You'd have to be damn near dead to see the nights I been through
Damn near dead to feel the wind beneath you
Envisionin' so much, my minds an open window
Where I gather all these thoughts for all your broken info
If seein' is believin', then there's more to live fo'
My only reasonin' is breathin' and I live to just hope
What you know about bein' bedside next to your girl
On poison control IV's 'cause she can't stand the world?
And what you know about no heat and no electric?
I sold my MP to pay the bills, I'm so pathetic
I wake up and go to work, back aches and my shoulders hurt
And what's it worth? I'm easily checked and don't control my earth
Still walk these hollow grounds, bein' lost but never found
Say to the Lord, "I'll die for music", but there's never sound
Screamin' in vein, everything be seemin' the same
Ask my mom, "What's the problem, why am I feelin' this way?"
Ask my pop, "Can you solve it?", this game, I'm bleedin' to stay
More then willing to give it up if I can't live it up
Hand in my clutch, gun in my lap
Doin' a buck and some change, not knowin' where the fuck I'm at
I try to maintain, the pain is unstoppable
Put my son on my back and I maneuver through the obstacles
[Chorus - Faez One and Crypt The Warchild] + (Tony Perez)
(The rage of Angels)
They say, "One day here, it'll make sense"
That's why we get high and stay bent
Even the rose grows from the pavement
Tell 'em, Tone (The rage of Angels)
They say, "One day here, it'll make sense"
That's why we get high and stay bent
Even the rose grows from the pavement
Tell 'em, Tone (The rage of Angels)
(Verse 3 - Vinnie Paz)
1988, pops died, middle of the night
Forty-six years old, middle of his life
My mother ain't have a job, poppy was on his grind
And we ain't got no money, so she lose her fuckin' mind
Lenny helped out, and that was real
But he had a little daughter to raise, and that's the deal
My other brother, I won't mention his fuckin' name
'Cause he ain't worthy of my bitterness or fuckin' pain
Me and my mother, all we needed was some love
And my brother, all he needed was his drugs
How could you look at us with a job, we was poor
It's your mother birthday, you don't give her a call?
You have two nephews and a beautiful niece
But they don't think of you as Uncle, they think you deceased
I'm so fuckin' mad that I got a slug for you
But Mommy raised me better, I got love for you
[Break - Vinnie Paz] + (Tony Perez)
(The rage of Angels)
I'll see you on the street, dog, we gonna handle it
One on one, beat you down and then hug you
Tell you I love you, daddy, but now, fuck you
[Chorus - Faez One and Crypt The Warchild] + (Tony Perez)
(The rage of Angels)
They say, "One day here, it'll make sense"
That's why we get high and stay bent
Even the rose grows from the pavement
Tell 'em, Tone (The rage of Angels)
They say, "One day here, it'll make sense"
That's why we get high and stay bent
Even the rose grows from the pavement
Tell 'em, Tone (The rage of Angels)
(Outro - Tony Perez)
The rage of Angels
Temperature's rising
Fever is high
Can't see no future
Can't see no sky
My feet are so heavy
So is my head
I wish I was a baby
I wish I was dead
Cold turkey has got me on the run
My body is aching
Goose-pimple bone
Can't see nobody
Leave me alone
My eyes are wide open
Can't get to sleep
One thing I'm sure of
I'm in at the deep freeze
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Thirty-six hours
Rolling in pain
Praying to someone
Free me again
Oh, I'll be a good boy
Please make me well
I promise you anything
Get me out of this hell
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Oh, oh, oh, oh
So I ran faster
But it caught me here
Yes, my loyalties turned
Like my ankle
In the seventh grade
Running after Billy
Running after the rain
These precious things
Let them bleed, let them wash away
These precious things
Let them break their hold over me
He said, you're really an ugly girl
But I like the way you play
And I died
But I thanked him
Can you believe that?
Sick, sick
Holding on to his picture
Dressing up every day
I want to smash the faces
Of those beautiful boys
Those Christian boys
So you can make me come
That doesn't make you Jesus
These precious things
Let them bleed, let them wash away
These precious things
Let them break their hold over me
I remember, yes
In my peach party dress
No one dared
No one cared to tell me
Where the pretty girls are
Those demigods
With their nine inch nails
And little fascist panties
Tucked inside the heart of every nice girl
These precious things
Let them bleed, let them wash away
These precious things
Let them break, let them wash away
These, these precious things
Let them bleed now, let them wash away
These, these precious things
Let them break their hold over me
Precious
Precious
Vide et silence sont de retour
Pour l'heure je l'espère, on savoure
Pour ne plus croire, pour ne plus croire encore
On le sait, on le sait
Qu'avons-nous fait de nos histoires ?
Au point de crier nos histoires
Vide et silence sont de retour
Afin de replacer nos amours
On le sait, tu le sais
Qu'avons-nous fait de nos histoires ?
Au point de crier nos histoires
Qu'avons-nous fait de nos histoires ?
Au point de hurler nos histoires
Qu'avons-nous, qu'avons-nous fait...
(Merci à go0on pour cettes paroles)
Are you going to be there
To witness the second coming?
The second coming
Call it an elite 
And you'd be right
The Second Coming
Are you gonna be there?
I'm not stopping the car until I make you cry, I'll drive it all night
Over the border and to every corner and edge of the world
Every island and ocean boiling and blue in motion
I'm not easing the gas until we both can sleep, we might as well be
Running the engine with never a mention
That we're sitting still in the garage and nodding off (a mirage)
And there's no crashing until I see this through
If it's the last thing that I'll ever do
I'll make you feel one second pass
Where I am stone and you are glass
And you are broken when I crash with you
You're not dropping me loose without a fight to hold on for my own life
Though it's a mile below, all the while
I'm digging my nails into gravity's ladder, ripping your mind and matter
You're not walking away until your heart is torn, our tears are reborn
Falling together like a ton of feathers
I'm pulling you down to the bottom where we'll be forgotten
I promise that there's no crashing until I see this through
If it's the last thing that I'll ever do
I'll make you feel one second pass
Where I am stone and you are glass
And you are broken when I crash with you
And we'll keep moving faster till you scream
Burning rubber into the end of the dream
The air is breaking around our heavenly speed
And what you fear the most is what I need
Falling together, going for forever and never ending
And spending our lives for moments that won't arrive
When you're feeling at last and reeling so fast
Because I'll finally touch what lies behind your walls, I'll make them fall
But there's no crashing until I see this through
If it's the last thing that I'll ever do
I'll make you feel my heart's affect
We're smashing now, a flaming wreck
And we are broken, we lie misconstrued
The end is spoken, long since overdue
And I am bone and you are glass
And the last is first and the first is last
All the searing smoke and the blinding flash
And the smell of hope, the taste of ash
And the gates will open when I crash with you
The gates will open when I crash with you
And you are broken when I crash with you
And you are broken when I crash with you
You will never see me cry 
You will never see me cry 
You will never see me cry 
You will never see me cry 
I'm gonna leave you, I'm gonna leave you 
When I get the strength to 
I'm gonna leave you, I'm gonna leave you 
When I get the strength to 
Black Eye 
I need sometime to find out why 
I need sometime to find out why 
I need sometime to find out why 
I need sometime to find out why 
I'm gonna leave you, I'm gonna leave you 
When I get the strength to 
I'm gonna leave you, I'm gonna leave you 
When I get the strength to 
Black Eye 
I'm gonna leave you, I'm gonna leave you 
When I get the strength to 
I'm gonna leave you, I'm gonna leave you 
Now I've got the strength to 
I don't need you, I don't need you 
Now I'm gonna leave you 
I don't need you, I don't need you 
Now I'm gonna leave you 
Black Eye 
Want you to apologise 
Don't want you to apologise 
Don't want you to apologise 
Don't want you to apologise 
Don't want you to apologise 
Don't want you to apologise 
Cause you will never see me cry 
You will never see me cry 
You will never see me cry 
You will never see me cry 
Black Eye
Caminho em silêncio
Distraído por um pensar
Que me turba o andar
Penso que penso
E fico a ouvir-me a pensar
Que penso que penso
Este pensamento
Torna-se um tormento
Penso que penso
Que penso que penso
Sempre o mesmo a dobrar
Como vozes a segredar
Penso que penso
Que penso que penso
Que ainda vou flipar
Flipar
ESTOU FARTO DE MIM ESTOU FARTO DE MIM
ESTOU FARTO DE MIM ESTOU FARTO DE MIM
Já não posso mais andar
Com tanta voz a murmurar
Levado pelo vento
Penso que penso
Que penso que penso
Que penso que penso
E se penso em parar
É mais um pensamento
Que me fica a ecoar
Outra voz a segredar
Outra voz a murmurar
Murmurar...
Murmurar murmurar murmurar murmurar murmurar murmurar
murmurar

We got the mother and her kids
We got the guy and his date
We all get mad
We all get late
Looks like somebody forgot about us
Standing on the corner, waiting for the bus
Say hey Mr. driver man, don't be slow
'Cause I got somewhere I gotta go
Say hey Mr. driver man, drive that thing fast
My precious time keeps slipping past
Let's call the mayor, let's complain
Looks like the city's done it to us again
Tied up in traffic, what do you know
The damn city bus, it moves so slow
Say hey Mr. driver man, don't be slow
'Cause I got somewhere I gotta go
Say hey Mr. driver man, drive that thing fast
My precious time keeps slipping past
"Young man, your transfer's expired. Will you please pay full fare?"
"I just got this transfer!"
"Hey, can you open up the back door?"
"Either pay your 65 cents or you'll have to leave the bus!"
"You gotta be kidding me! I just got it!"
"Can you please open up the back door?!"
We got the mother and her kids
We got the guy and his date
We all get mad
We all get late
Looks like somebody forgot about us
Standing on the corner, waiting for the bus
Say hey Mr. driver man, don't be slow
'Cause I got somewhere I gotta go
Say hey Mr. driver man, drive that thing fast
My precious time keeps slipping past
(Feat. Joe Hooker)
I dare you
(Uh, Harlem Underworld)
To come against me
(Harlem Underworld)
I dare you
(Black Rob)
To defeat me
(Watch the whole thing unfold)
I dare you
(From 100th street)
To come for me
(To 200th)
You won't win
(Manhattan)
Nigga's got me sittin' on the roof
Eye trained, on scope, blessin' 100 proof
Hand on toes, 'bout to roast
Some kids who flash like they assassins
Picked up my dough and b-ked this honey passin'
Got the spot on lock
Taking flicks around the corner
She made it where the spot ain't hot
Like a potato, she got five-oh on the payroll
They sniffin' yeyo, I don't know what to say, yo
There they go in front of the store
Dressed in black shit
Some like theys are meaner
If they be hustlin' back, we'll fuck 'em
Can't even do one thing, assassinate 'em
That's it, that's all, solo
Single, no more, no less, stocks rang, yo
Money caught one in his Kangol
D.O.A. as his man made his run for the door
Caught 'em in the 'gaitor shoes his girl probably bought 'em
Too bad, Black ain't get the chance to extort him
'Cause Nigga's like that don't deserve to live
Word the myth
And we ain't got no love to give
For these drop shots who wanna be down
Wanna be clowns, the fail ones
I like how all that good shit sounds
And I dare one
I dare you
To come against me
I dare you
To defeat me
I dare you
To conquer me
You won't win
Nigga, I sleigh, you pray, kill that ass uptown
Dump yo' bitch ass back around your way
When I'm in one of those moods I can give a fuck
I mean cool, run and bungie jump off the fuckin' roof
I hear voices calling me, givin' me fits
Singing tonight's the night Black Rob, let's write these hits
In the halls of death, you get left, I'm in the top 10
Even Rocky trainer and his wife said you can't win
Scream battle, but you never fought
That's like me sayin' I got five, never ran a full court
Stab the devil in his belly, took his Pelle Pelle
Blew the spot down and slid straight to the tele
I see envious eyes, envious guys, different states
Mad we seen 'em, different cake
Rob me, tear that asshole out of place
'Cause in the end I'm the head case you gotta face
And I dare one
I dare you
To come against me
I dare you
To defeat me
I dare you
To conquer me
You won't win
It feels good not to be dealin' with petty cash
Me and D-Dot all we seein' now is ready cash
And ready ass, splash in the Jacuzzi
Honey from the movies, south notch cutie
Used to go to Harrah with D after the homecomin'
On my way from Kakalaka
Me and Merse was gun running
Musta done something all conspicuous
Eye of the tiger, I know these cats are sick of this
Ridiculous sayin' these cats don't love Black
This is Bad Boy, I puttin' it where it 'posed to be at
Lemme know where to put your rosary at
My enemies, I let 'em get a load of me gat
Fine, you don't believe Black real official
Playa way, get your ma's cake, and kiss you
You leavin', wasn't part of this plan
Understand it's all about the Bengi's man
And I dare one
I dare you
To come against me
I dare you
To defeat me
I dare you
To conquer me
You won't win
I dare you
To come against me
I dare you
To defeat me
I dare you
To come for me
You won't win
I dare you
To come against me
I dare you
To defeat me
I dare you
To conquer me
You won't win
Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are gunning us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?
Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio (Four dead)
Four dead in Ohio (Four)
Four dead in Ohio (How many?)
Four dead in Ohio (How many more?)
Four dead in Ohio (Why?)
Four dead in Ohio (Oh!)
Four dead in Ohio (Four)
Four dead in Ohio (Why?)
Four dead in Ohio (Why?)
What's wrong you're always crying lately
What song this isn't a song really
Shut up and stop your playing around
The subject right now is what's wrong...
What's wrong with this immaculate
What song is this immaculate song of love
What's wrong with this immaculate
What song is this sacred cow of love
Love makes me want to melt down
It can be really dangerous
If I make love to you now
I'll have a gigantic sacred cow
What song reminds you of when
Life was home on the dangerous
Which side of the tracks are you on
Both sides because the world is round
Sacred cows are headed for the slaughter
Sacred chickens pecking cement
Making unknown nuggets for the miners
So they can make cement excrement
Building buildings taller than the mountains
Digging tunnels deeper than the sea
How I' d like to fly in an airplane
So I can pump entertainment in me
Let's put this work horse in gear
Can't wait to see where it goes
One, two, look back, this is where it all begins
Three, four, and more, to make it happen
Five, six, give it all it takes to get me there
Loading in all the gears to get me there
Giving up everything to get me here
All I ever wanted was to be like you
And all I ever needed was to fall with you
All I ever wanted was to be like you
And all I ever needed was to fall right through
Oh how you could make me smile
And how you could make me laugh
I felt so safe
I loved you more with each breath
But how things have changed now
The way you pushed me out
Its time to come back around
Its time to let you know that
I hope you hurt as much as me
This love turns to hate
I watch you make the same mistakes
Now that I've pulled through
I hope it all comes back to you
When you're cut wide open
When you're feeling broken
Maybe then you'll see
Just how much you fucked with me
It's 6 AM
It's another end of another working day...
...And the orange glow from the street lamps
And the fog rolls in on the highway
Dirty secrets, dirty secrets
Dirty secrets well hid
The blood is on your hands
In this promised land called home
Promised land called home
Many will come here
And they'll leave in a bodybag
How did I end up here
Just living on the streets
Living from hand-to-mouth
Just to make ends meet
Is this what you want for your children?
Sex toys for the perverted freaks?
On this highway
On this highway
And who cries for the nameless whores
Who rarely makes the news
Do you give a god damn
Well, do you?
The blood is on your hand
This promised land
Called home
Promised land called home
Many will come here
And they'll leave in a bodybag
"I never saw my friend alive again
She got into a truck
I never saw my friend alive again"
On this highway
On this highway
Highway 99
Highway 99
Who cries for the nameless whores
Who rarely makes the news
Do you give a god damn
Well, do you?
The blood is on your hand
This promised land
Called home
Promised land called home
The red gash runs through this land
Called home
"She went into a convenience store
On this highway
Never saw her again"
On this highway
On this highway
On this highway
On this highway
Highway 99
What if I tried, would you then
Consider my time as well spent
Would you put me on trial, consider who's fit
To brand me insane, so I won't ever have to deal with it
What have I done, your only son
They spit on my name, and now I have a gun
Running 'round in circles, kids come out to play
But I can't remember what it was that made me
Feel this... hate
All my pictures on display here
What's that you said, you were my friend
I can't recall, say it again
This isn't a game, but I will pretend
Look at me now, 'cause I win
I would be faking, I didn't know
These idle hands don't know their worth
I've covered them in blood, but this
Still fucking hurts
HATE!
HATE!
Well, you can have him, I don't want him,
He didn't love me anyway.
He only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay.
Well, you get stuck with the wrong man
There's only one thing that you can do:
Just dig a hole and jump right in it,
And pull the ground right over you.
Well, you can have him I don't want him I don't
Want him,
He didn't love me anyway anyway.
He only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay.
The boy I love, he, up and left me,
He ran away with my best friend.
Comes home at night just for an hour
When day light comes he's gone again.
Life without love is mighty empty,
But confessions good for the soul.
I'd rather have love that I can cling to
Than have the world and all of it's gold.
You can have him, I don't want
Him,
He didn't love me, anyway.
He only wanted some one to
Play with
Oh! 
Was love to stay 
Oh!
You can have him
I don't want him
He didn't love me anyway anyway
He only wanted someone to play with someone to play
With
But all I want
All I want
All I want
All I want
Shoulder gives way and the ice breaks
A rivers drying up the heart beat of god
Simple to say you're moving on like a train
Drowning out the constant nonsense
I say, I said
But never to your face
So I'll just say it to myself
I say, I said
But never to your face
So I'll just say it to myself
So I'm left here seedless, mindless, careless
My emotions more fear than rebellion
Coming out of the shadows of the web I weave
Not close enough to you, not close enough to you
I say, I said
But never to your face
So I'll just say it to myself
I say, I said
But never to your face
So I'll just say it to myself
I say, I said
But never to your face
So I'll just say it to myself
I say, I said
But never to your face
So I'll just say it to myself
If there were no darkness
There would be no light
If there were no rain
There would be tears in my eyes
I am life I am death
Before you see the light
You must take your last breath
I don't feel what I am supposed to feel
I don't dream what I am supposed to dream
I don't say what I am supposed to say
I don't see what I am supposed to see
Dead but dreaming
You make me strong and I make you weak
The perfect mismatch and disharmony
Tired are the feet
That crossed the floor
Hell's doing great but I am serving no more
If there were no heaven
There would be no hell
If I couldn't feel
I would probably hurt myself
I open my eyes but I cannot see
The people I looked up to are not for real
Lonely is the soul empty are the eyes
Vague is the flame that used to burn in your eyes
Knocking before passing through the doors
The love that used to live here
Lives no more
Dead but dreaming, memories remain
The flesh summons pain and I do the same
Silent Anguish and silent scream
She screams for more and that is not a dream
Waking up again
To the same old thing
To the same old songs
To the same old pain
Cocooned in this world
Where every single thing hurts
Bones broken up inside
Look at the boredom in my eyes
We talk the same
We are the same
We just can't walk anymore
We love these days
These Groundhog Days
We just don't feel like before
I felt the sunset overland
And it made me fight again
But tomorrow came to quick
And I went back to bed again
Cocooned in this world
Where every single thing hurts
Bones broken up inside
Look at the boredom in my eyes
We talk the same
We are the same
We just can't walk anymore
We love these days
These Groundhog Days
We just don't feel like before
Like before
Is this what you do with eternity?
I killed myself so many times
I don't even exist any more
So I surrender to impulse
But still so numb
So make some time
So make some time
Wake up feeling like a Messiah
Totally fucked, five minutes later
My body a temple falling to pieces
Chocolate or Coke
My needs are artificial
Unintentional, forsaken for what?
All in search of our personal gods
Anymore
These Groundhog Days
Like before
Waking up again
To the same old thing
To the same old songs
To the same old pain
I'm not underdressed, you're overdressed
Spend my days with chauvinists
In studios, conference rooms think they're smooth, but no finesse
My mom dealing with Oakland stress
The world like cold as shit
Missed the boat on the perks I'm supposed to get
Mai tais on a white beach, coconuts bitch
Like so depressed
Sprite and some jamo to cope with it
Rationalize the lies and the hurt, that it's all worth it, sure hope it is
Ah my mind going next, sucker punch solar plex
Think that you got the world figured out, right? Wait till you're older kid
Gotta focus in on what we're choking on
Soak it in, coke and rum, bank account overdrawn
Got hand me downs but honey no Vuitton
And every time I try to see the bright side, shit gets dark
Just like babies killing babies girls assaulted in some park
Same routine, nothing new
America, make a buck or two
Common people like prostitutes
They fucked us all 'cause they wanted to
So while my neighbor's buying diapers at the sav on
Can't help but wish that life was like a Drake song
Irrelevance my nemesis, creeping up like an embolus
Seeping into my sentiments, impetus for my pensiveness
Best estimate, straight blacked out for the rest of it
Face pumped straight full of Restalyne every bitch in the room just Hester Prynne
That's the impression that I get
Buy this car to drive to work and work until you're fucking dead
Nervous wreck but I'm but I'm trying to ball
Catch me counting all day like a clock on the wall
List of things I'd like to change, waking up's like frightening
College guys try to spike your drink, they wanna fuck a chick like Tyra Banks
Feel my soul just siphoning, make a girl wanna hibernate
Days alone that type of thing, gotta get better, what I'd like to think
Shine my shoes, ain't got the time
New excuse, ain't thought of mine
Missed the bus I'm pissed as fuck need fifty bucks got lots to find
Bums grubbing down Mickey D's on 51st
You got a sad tale, buddy somebody got 50 worse
Choking on a broken sentence
Bike spokes with a blown suspension
Living in a world full of cokeheads, butchering jokes, wanting all your attention
Gotta pay my rent check, gonna keep repenting
Over and back and below and around again baby how I'm bending
Strange men wanna know my name, sweet girls oughta play their part
New day but it's all the same, what a motherfucking basic art
If the heat don't make me drop, you better bet something will
Just a chip off a broken block
Got a pack of Kools and a buzz to kill
Put the bottle down, finally got somethin' to say
Take another look around and find someone else to play
(Needless to say) That you've got problems
(There's no fuckin' way) That I'm gonna solve them
(It's never the same) Every time you slip
Then you fall down, down, down
Ever wonder what I've been thinkin' about?
I been thinkin' 'bout throwin' you out
I'm so happy about you
(I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I'm so happy now we're through
(I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I was so afraid, now you're gone away
Sent you packin', look who's laughin' now
I'm so happy that I feel this way
I'm so happy that I threw you away
Put your problems down and pick up what's left of the pain
Take a good look at yourself and see who's really to blame
(Needless to say) You've got issues
(There's no fuckin' way) That I'm gonna fix you
(It's never the same) Ever since you went fallin' down, down, down
Ever wonder what I've been thinkin' about?
I been thinkin' 'bout throwin' you out
I'm so happy about you
(I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I'm so happy now we're through
(I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I was so afraid, now you're gone away
Sent you packin', look who's laughin' now
I'm so happy that I feel this way
I'm so happy that I threw you away
I'm so happy about you
(I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I'm so happy now we're through
(I'm fed up, so get up and get out)
I was so afraid, now you're gone away
Sent you packin', look who's laughin' now
I'm so happy that I feel this way
I'm so happy that I threw you away
What are you hiding from
Who are you pretending to be
3000 miles of separation, you're still real to me
Turn the lights down low
Shut off the phone
Living life through the words you hear on the radio
You and your other side have a choice to make
You're either one or the other
Heads or tails, toss the coin
You're either one or the other
Who are you hiding from
Two faces one man
Trying to decide the better of the two
Behind a plastic wall
Your secrets finally out
It takes a wall for the real you to break through
You and your other side have a choice to make
You're either one or the other
Heads or tails, toss the coin
You're either one or the other
(Musical)
You and your other side have a choice to make
You're either one or the other
Heads or tails, toss the coin
You're either one or the other
You and your other side have a choice to make
You're either one or the other
Heads or tails, toss the coin
You're either one or the other
One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna win ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya
One day, maybe next week
I'm gonna meet ya, I'm gonna meet ya, I'll meet ya
I will drive past your house
And if the lights are all down
I'll see who's around
One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna win ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya
One day, maybe next week, I'm gonna meet ya
I'll meet ya, ahh
And if the lights are all out
I'll follow your bus downtown
See who's hangin' 'round
One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip
A slip of the hip or another
I'm gonna lose ya, I'm gonna trick ya, I'll trick ya
One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna trick ya, trick ya, trick ya, trick ya
One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip
I walked down the mall
Stand over by the wall
Where I can see it all
Find out who ya call
Lead you to the supermarket checkouts
Some specials and rat food
Get lost in the crowd
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way or another
If the wife and me is fussin', mister that's our right
Me and that sweet woman got a license to fight
Why don't you mind your own business
Hey mind your own business
If you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine
There's a woman on our party line, a nosy thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
Why don't you mind your own business
Hey mind your own business
Cause, if you mind your business, then you sure won't be mindin' mine
I got a little lady wears her hair up high,
All the boys whistle when she walks by.
Why don't you mind your own business
Hey mind your own business
If you mind your business, then you sure won't be mindin' mine
If I want to honky tonk around till two or three
That's my headache brother, don't you worry 'bout me
Just mind your own business
Hey mind your own business
Cause, if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine
Mindin' other people's business seems to be high-toned
I got all that I can do just to mind my own
Why don't you mind your own business
Hey mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your business, you'll stay busy all the time
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else 
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride, is broken
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)
You love the things I say I'll do
The way I hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life, my pride, is broken
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)
Yo, yo
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else 
Takes you out of the frame
Puts your name to shame
Cover up your face

The pace is too fast
You just won't last

A social alliance, are you in distress?
Just contact me and I'll do my best
She said "I'm a person, so don't abuse me
You know I am a Doctor of the third degree"
A Doctor of the third
Don't miss the sensation
It's never too late
If you think you're ready
There's no need to wait
Can your mind take it?
Do you really care?
We're part of a structure
That needs no consent
You think you're the same
When we're all different
Jean lives for fashion
And I live to fight
Before life was easy
Now we're creatures of the night
We're creatures of the night
We're creatures of the night
We're creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
A social alliance, are you in distress?
Just contact me and I'll do my best

I've seen so many faces, and always left my mark
I've kissed so many faces, lips smooth, just like a shark
I have no friends, I hope that's understood
I take what I can take, when the taking's good
It's not for love but I'll gladly take your money
I can pretend to be so sad or funny
You'll just love the way I move when I dance
My young hips, they know how to entrance
Nevermind him, he's not here now
It's really not my problem anyhow
An angel of love is what I may appear
Your lonely ache, I can make, disappear
Yes, take me deep inside so I can heal your pain
No angel of love takes another man's gain
You want to keep me held inside your cage
You best remember, you're twice my age
You think I'll wan't you for evermore
It's only been two weeks, and you're such a bore
I can see you're new to this, you don't know the rules
You're just another one in a long line of fools
Can you be happy for one moment in your life
It doesn't bother you you're someone else's wife
An angel of love is what I may appear
What I really am is really not so clear
I don't live for love, you sticky bitch
All I care about is if you're rich
You decide if you still want to play this game
The price to you for this is nothing will ever be the same
Don't go knock on my door
Don't go knock on my door
Time is up
No more cheat n' lie
No more tears to dry
You and I, we're like so, "Bye bye"
Finally
I am over you
Totally unblue
And I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you
Stronger than ever and I
I'm tellin' you now
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back
Don't go knockin' on my door
I can see
It's no mystery
It's so clear to me
What we had is all history
It's okay
I can sleep at night
It will be alright
I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you
Stronger than ever and I
I'm tellin' you now
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back
Don't go knockin' on my door
Don't go knockin' on my door
Don't go knockin' on my door
Do what you want as long as you don't come back
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
And now I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back
Don't go knockin' on my door
Gotta stay away for sure
You say you miss me like crazy now
But I ain't buyin' that
You better get off my back
Don't go knockin' on my door
Moooooove! Ask the angels who they're calling, 
Go ask the angels if they're calling to thee 
Ask the angels while they're falling 
Who that person could possibly be 
And I know you got the feeling, 
You know, I feel it crawl across the floor 
And I know it got you reelin' 
And honey honey the call is for war 
And it's wild wild wild wild. 
Everybody got the feelin' 
You know the feeling and it's stronger each day 
Everybody wants to be reelin' 
And baby baby I'll show you the way 
And I know it's hard sometimes, 
You got a piece and hit across the sky 
And I know it's hard sometimes 
And world war is the battle cry 
And it's wild wild wild wild 
Across the country through the fields 
You know I see it written 'cross the sky 
People rising from the highway 
And war war is the battle cry 
And it's wild wild wild wild. 
Armageddon, it's gotten 
No savior jailer can take it from me 
World ending, it's just beginning 
And rock and roll is what I'm born to be 
And it's wild wild wild wild 
Wild wild wild wild X3 
Ask the angels if they're startin' to move 
Comin' in droves in from L.A. 
Ask the angels if they're starting to groove 
Lightning as armor and it's today 
It's wild wild wild wild 
Wild wild wild wild X3
You never told me from the first time
I had to beg you not to leave
You never seemed to care the first time
Now is the last time you are walking out on me
You've done enough for me to hate you
Expecting me to forgive you
I don't believe you'll change
I don't know where I went wrong
You only want me when I'm gone
You're not that smart, you're not so strong
You only want me when I'm...
Gone,
It's over, all over, so over
You'll never know
What does it take to make you believe
How did we ever start?
You deserve a broken heart
Cry me a river we're so through
People Change and I forget you
The light dims and still you
Like a ghost that I can't shake
I feel so stupid when I look back
All the things that you lack
Reflected onto me
I don't know where I went wrong
You only want me when I'm gone
You're not that smart your not so strong
You only want me when I'm...
Gone
It's over, all over, so over
You'll never know
What does it take to make you believe
How did we ever start?
I don't deserve this broken heart
Cry me a river we're so through
You never told me from the first time (You said you were my friend)
I had to beg you not to leave (I thought you were my friend)
You never seemed to care the first time (You never were my friend)
Now is the last time you are walking out on me
It's over, all over, so over
You'll never know
What does it take to make you believe
How did we ever start?
I don't deserve my broken heart
Cry me a river we're so through
Cry me a river we're so through
Cry me a river we're so through
I cried and now I'm over you
Drugs, liquor, drugs
I love to smoke crack
I love to shoot smack
I love to fuckin' drink

What has it done to me
Street lobotomy
My brain - melted - down
Brain - melted - down - lobotomy
Need some more dope man

Any acid dude
Got any ludes
Drugs, liquor, drugs?
I love to do blow
That's the way to go
You got some PCP?
How 'bout some LSD?
I'm havin' lots of fun
I might as well use a gun
Don't even ask my why
Maybe I wanna die
Love, at least we agree (?)
All the kids agree, yeah
Where the hell you creed (?)
All the kids agree, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
All the world are fools
There are silly rules
I sussed easily
All the kids agree, yeah
So says our elite
All the kids agree, yeah

Black or frigid feet (?)
All the kids agree, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Looking for a place
Bullet in your face
I like to feel this abuse I'm tucked away fucked and used it's trapped away in my mind unseen alone undefined this desiccation implied my fucking mouth so fucking dry
We have a struggle of wills all for black swollen pills the semiconcious thin lines my fucking truth so fucking blind
I like to feel this abuse I'd like to give some to you I'll steal the tears that you cry my fucking eyes so fucking dry
You're stripped, vulgar-your pulse points none
Useless talent-deprecate us from your talent
Take your broken pride, exhaust your basic quote
You lying thief, you're stripped to the bone
Morality by all means, a favor to us all
So heal, and show us how
Out of shape, out of mind and out of time
Morality by all means, a favor to us all
Go reach your purity
Take off all your clothes
I'd like to see who you really are, again
Force the pace, ignore the speed limits
I know you hate who I become
So do I, sweetheart.
Don't write home about it
You're stripped, vulgar-your pulse points none
Draining your pathetic body for energy
Out of shape, out of mind and out of time
Draining your body for energy
The fluid acid end up being no good
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Rather then be on tape and make my own song this messed up
So uh instead of me sitting up here doin' a little dance for ya and singing "On a Monday I'm Waiting"
I'm gonna like you know, I'm gonna prove that it's my own voice
Just because uh... I don't know
Let me just a pick a cover uh
Lets pick ugh that kelly clarkson song for example
Their's no way I'm gonna be able to sing that song without
Re-constructive sergury if you know what I'm talking about
But I'm a gonna try.
Here's the thing
We started out friends
It was cool but it was just pretend
Yeah, Yeah
Since you've been gone
You dedicated,
You took the time...
It Wasn't long till I called you mine...
Yeah, Yeah
Since you've been gone gone gone
That's why you'd never hear me say
"I just wanna be with you.."
'Cause I never hear you say...
But since you've been gone!
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on
Yeah Yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get
What I want!
Since you've been gone
W (e gotta get jam hard)
How can I put it?
You put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah Yeah!
Since you've been gone
Gone gone ...
That's why I'd never hear you say
"I just wanna be with you"
That's all I wanna hear you say
But since you've been gone!
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on
Yeah Yeah!
Thanks to you!
Now I get...
What I waaaant...
(Since you've been gone!)
WAIT!
They don't love you like I love you
WAIT!
They don't love you like I love you
WAIT!
They don't love you like I love you
-They don't love you like I love you
Whoa...!
Butch walker won kelly clarksons hero.
Push shove you're always in my face
You've never shown me love
I've never felt your grace, understand!
Leave me alone
You have enough problems of your own
Don't try to make them mine
I'm human just like you
With my own existence to define
This one is mine
Burned by your kind too many times
And I am dry
I've seen the scars
Your life can do
I've know the damage
I am the damage
Samples:
'It's healthy for you to express your anger.'
'I don't know how all this started'
'Wait for him but don't do this!'
'I don't know how all this started but in my religion,
When something happens that makes the world go to a
Better place then it was before,
And I know that God had something to do with it.
I don't ask him questions. In my religion too Mr Harris.'
Quiet little mousy
Never participate
Living in your own world
Living without hope
You never share opinions
No one knows your name
Always the third wheel
Always the idiot
Never been kissed
Never been loved
Never been hated
Introvert [X4]
Treated like a joke
Everyone ignores you
Still you tag along
Like a sad little dog
No personality
You get no respect
Open your mouth
And show me who you really are
Never been kissed
Never been loved
Never been hated
Introvert [X5]
Show me who you really are
Show me who you really are
Show me who you really are
Never been kissed
Never been loved
Never been hated

You say I'm wrong I say I'm right
You say I'm gone I say I'm fine, boy
You say I will I say I won't
Just don't know how I'm supposed read into your convoluted mind
You say I'm sick not so to speak
You got this grip right over me, boy
You say I'm trapped up in a shell
Go fuck yourself, well I'm real sorry that you sacrificed your time
Tell me what it takes to keep your trust
Tell me what you want to love, in me
Guess I didn't cut you deep enough, to bleed, to bleed, to bleed, oh I see
You say I'm cruel I say I'm kind
You say you're free I say you're mine, boy
You wrote it out, in blackened ink
You seem to think that I can't read between the calculated lines
You lie alone, I try to join
Fight on your own, that's not the point, boy
You said your peace for forty minutes like at least
I'm barely breathing now you got me by the spine
You got this power over me, ah
And I can't help myself, should let it go, wanna believe
But see when I've got a bit of heartache in my system
Know it's bad for me but I'm calling you
And you're crawling back baby that's a given
Try to focus, can't discern anything but the motion
Back and forth, say I'm a piece of shit, well that's duly noted
Crazy talk, I fucking love it
Regardless of your motives
I remain under your spell
And all the while I know you know it
Fingertips and I'm fastening
25th and like Madison
Try to make me move, but only half an inch
Gonna take your phone and I'm smashing it
I don't do this for my health, I do it so I feel like hell
I hate a man like you!
I hate the things you do;
I had a yen for you that was oh, so strong!
Your people warned me we would never get along,
'Cause you're bad right through and don't know right from wrong,
I hate a man like you!
I hate a man like you!
I just can't stand the things you do;
When we got married, I knew it wasn't right
When you stayed away from me on that very first night!
Is that a way to treat a lovin' woman right?
I hate a man like you!
I hate a man like you!
I just can't stand the things you do;
I knew you was wrong for me
When you took a fist and knocked me down on my knee!
Nothing but a divorce can set me free
>From a no-good man like you!
I hate a man like you!
I just can't stand the things you do;
Your big-talkin' man friend came round to my home,
Told me about the places where you used to roam,
I felt in your pocket and found your sweet woman's comb!
I hate a man like you!
I hate a man like you!
I just can't stand the things you do;
Always tellin' me I go with other men,
Smilin' at my face and winkin' at my best friend,
Soon as my back is turned you're like a rooster at a hen!
I hate a man like you!
I hate a man like you!
I just can't stand the things you do;
I know it's your child I'm carryin' in me,
That don't change my feelin's in the slightest degree,
You fill my whole life with misery,
I hate a man like you!
I just can't stand the things you do;

You know how people have these little habits that get you down?
Like Bernie. Bernie liked to chew gum.
No, not chew: pop!
So I came home this one day and I am really irritated
And I'm looking for a bit of sympathy
And there's Bernie, lyin' on the couch
Drinkin' a beer and chewin'
No, not chewin': poppin'!
So, I said to him,
I said, "You pop that gum one more time..."
And he did.
So I took the shotgun off the wall
And I fired two warning shots
...In-to his head.

He had it coming

I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago
And he told me he was single
And we hit it off right away.
So, we started living together.
He'd go to work, he'd come home,
I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner.
And then I found out,
"Single" he told me?
Single, my ass.
Not only was he married, oh no
He had six wives; one of those Mormons, you know.
So that night, when he came home,
I fixed him his drink as usual.
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic.
(all)
He had it coming (Pop, six, squish)
He had it coming (uh-uh, Cicero, Lipschitz)
He took a flower in its prime (Pop, six, squish)
And then he used it, and he abused it (uh-uh, Cicero, Lipschitz)
It was a murder but not a crime! (Pop, six, squish)
(Uh-uh, Cicero, Lipschitz)

Now, I'm standing in the kitchen, carvin' up the chicken for dinner,
Minding my own business,
And in storms my husband Wilbur in a jealous rage.
"You been screwin' the milkman," he says.
He was crazy and he kept screamin',
"You been screwin' the milkman."
And then he ran into my knife.
He ran into my knife ten times
(all)
If you'd have been there
If you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same!

Mit keresek, én itt?
Azt mondják, hogy a híres lakem lefogta a férjemet én meg
Lecsaptam a fejét.
De nem igaz, én ártatlan vagyok.

Probáltam a rendõrségen megmagyarázni de nem értették meg.
(Roxie) Yeah, but did you do it?

My sister, Veronica and I had this double act
And my husband, Charlie, traveled around with us.
Now, for the last number in our act
We did 20 acrobatic tricks in a row
One, two, three, four, five, splits, spread eagles,
Back flips, flip flops, one right after the other.
So this one night we were in the hotel Cicero,
The three of us, boozin', havin' a few laughs
And we run out of ice, so I go out to get some.
I come back, open the door
And there's Veronica and Charlie
Doing Number 17: the spread eagle
Well, I was in such a state of shock
I completely blacked out, I can't remember a thing.
It wasn't until later,
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead.
(Veronica (echoed by all))
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along (they had it coming all along)
I didn't do it (she didn't do it)
But if I'd done it (but if she'd done it)
How could you tell me that I was wrong?
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along (they took a flower in its prime)
I didn't do it (and then they used it)
But if I'd done it (and they abused it)
How could you tell me (it was a murder)
That I was wrong? (but not a crime)

I loved Alvin Lipschitz more than I can possibly say
He was a real artistic guy
Sensitive, a painter
But he was always trying to find himself
He'd go out every night looking for himself
And on the way he found Ruth
Gladys
Rosemary
And Irving
I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences
He saw himself as alive
And I saw him dead

From Tierra del Fuego to Ungava Bay
The history of betrayal continues to today
The spirit of Almighty Voice, the ghost of Anna Mae
Call like thunder from the mountains -- you can hear them say
It's a stolen land
Apartheid in Arizona, slaughter in Brazil
If bullets don't get good PR there's other ways to kill
Kidnap all the children, put 'em in a foreign system
Bring them up in no-man's land where no one really wants them
It's a stolen land
Stolen land -- but it's all we've got
Stolen land -- and there's no going back
Stolen land -- and we'll never forget
Stolen land -- and we're not through yet
In my mind I catch a picture -- big black raven in the sky
Looking at the ocean -- sail reflected in black eye --
Sail as white as heroin, white like weathered bones --
Rum and guns and smallpox gonna change the face of home
In this stolen land...
If you're like me you'd like to think we've learned from our mistakes
Enough to know we can't play god with others' lives at stake
So now we've all discovered the world wasn't only made for whites
What step are you gonna take to try and set things right
In this stolen land
Stolen land -- but it's all we've got
Stolen land -- and there's no going back
Stolen land -- and we'll never forget
Stolen land -- and we're not through yet
Countrier Than Thou, Countrier Than Thou
You weren't raised in a shack so you better not act so
Countrier Than Thou
Some people just don't understand it
If you come from where the kudzu grows
They think the south is like a planet of peckerwoods and bozos
When I was young I picked some tubers
Even took a swig of moonshine
But I never saw so many goobers
Until the day I crossed that line
Countrier Than Thou, Countrier Than Thou
You wasn't born in a cave so you better not behave so
Countrier Than Thou
Down at the bar a-spinnin Haggard he wore a Johnny Reb tattoo
Overalls he spat and swaggered, lord he was a Boston Jew
He loved bluegrass oh, brother when I said Shania he sneered
"That's a word I wouldn't know of
We like to keep it down-home up here"
Countrier Than Thou, Countrier Than Thou
You ain't never read your bible, tell me why's your vibe all
Countrier Than Thou
Home is nice and Dixie's nice
And everyone likes a thing that's nice
But everybody likes you better by far
When you are what you are
Not a hillbilly dilletante, fair weather hick,
Demi-something (clyde, clod), faux po'folks, well-readneck
Robert-E.-come-lately hayseed wanna-be undercover Yankee
Mississippi Ph. D., Alabamateur,
50% less Tarheel armchair Arkansan
He's got a ranch he wears a Stetson
He's a hip-shooting ex-oil king
He even talks like Buddy Ebsen
But he's sitting in the West Wing
Frankenstein I'm well aware of
But won't somebody please explain
How you get a county sherrif walking with a fratboy's brain
Countrier Than Thou, Countrier Than Thou
Well you went to Andover What's the banjo fer?
Countrier Than Thou
Angriffslust und die Sehnsucht nach Betäubung
Den Moment zerstreut und ein kleines Glück geraubt
In Schlangenlinien durch die Fleiß- und Preisgesellschaft
Graue Leute suchen Wege für die Ewigkeit
Und wenn ein großer Sturm kommt und alles fort weht
Der alles verschlingt und nichts versteht
Lebenslust und pure Energie
Ich werde nicht fragen
Denn ich will es nicht verstehen
Die Fabrik hat keine Türen aber dunkle blinde Fenster
Explosive Geschichten hört man aus der Nachbarschaft
Überall Bilder mit beklemmender Atmosphäre
Alltagstragödien in benzinhaltiger Luft
Und wenn ein großer Sturm kommt, der mich von hier fortträgt
Der alles verschlingt und nichts versteht
Lebenslust und pure Energie
Ich werde nicht fragen
Denn ich will es nicht verstehn - Nimm mich mit
Verzehrende Leidenschaft - autistisches Vergnügen
Und dann wieder der Absturz in die Wirklichkeit
Und ich spüre jeden Tag was ich verliere
Eine kranke Seele schwört mir Treue ins Gesicht
Und wenn ein großer Sturm kommt und alles fort weht
Alles verschlingt und nichts versteht
Lebenslust und pure Energie
Ich werde nicht fragen
Denn ich will es nicht verstehn
I don't care what the critics say or saving for a rainy day
I don't care for Mother Nature, Lady Luck or brotherly love
I don't care for the I.R.A., U.V.M., or U.D.R.
I don't care for E.E.C. or C.F.C.s or the latest disease
I don't care for the ozone layer, the way people wear their hair
I don't care for "Have a nice day", the American way or the man on the moon
I don't care for making ends meet, getting on or reading books
Making lists, sell-by dates or being rich
And the reason why I don't care 
Is because nobody else does
I don't care
No, I don't care
You see, I don't care at all
No, no, no, no, I don't care
I don't care for anarchy, equality or honesty
I don't care for the small community or the do-gooder vigilante
Democracy, happy-go-lucky, being free in peaceful times
All is fair in love and war, and love thy neighbour as thyself
I don't care for journalists, politics or sponsorship
I don't care for charity or sympathy
I don't care what Sinead has to say or K.L.F., E.M.F., E.L.O.
M.F.I., S.P.U.C., P.C.P., D.D.T.
And the reason why I don't care 
Is because nobody else does
I don't care
You see, no, I don't care at all
No, no, no, no, I don't care
No, no, no, no, I don't care at all for anything
I don't care for the government, neighbourhood watch or health warnings
I don't care for the weatherman, the promised land or shaking hands
I don't care for ignorance, indifference or tolerance
Diligence, negligence or arrogance
And the reason why I don't care 
Is because nobody else does
I don't care
I don't care
No no no no I don't care
No no no no I don't care at all
And I never did
There's holes up in the sky
The Devil punched down to the monkeys
And now they've got drive through
And a video store where there used to be real live actors
Used to ride around here
Up on my high horse
With all the other good little butcher boys
A plagiarist of course
So roll over sweet thing
Like a nuclear reprisal inbound from outer space
There's a comparison here I'm trying to swing
God damn it's deafening!
Wish you'd shut up about everything
The future is X-rated
There's holes up in the sky
And no one's seen your son in days
And things just keep getting weirder and weirder
And now Christmas is for shopping
And the Shopping God is everything
So roll over and lose it
'Cause power's just another one of those things, baby
It's pointless if you ain't gonna use it
God damn it's deafening!
Wish you'd shut up about everything
The future is X-rated
Okay, I'm taking my clothes off, are you ready?
Mmm, oh yeah, oh baby
Ooh, you want me to take my pants off?
You're a saucy little monkey boy!
Used to ride around here on my high, high horse
(Moaning)
God damn it's deafening!
Wish you'd would shut up, you'd shut up, you'd shut up
The future is X-rated
The future is X-rated
The future is X-rated
The future is X-rated
(Moaning)
Okay I don't know what else to say
Born to refuse, and raised to exclude
Fed myths to disprove by post-colonial prudes:
The city was evil, some country was evil, the hippies were evil, the writers were evil, the homeless were evil, the workers were evil, the summer was evil, independence was evil
Grown and released with the heart of a thief
Wanting only to seek the very gentlest of streets where
Nobody's evil, nobody's evil...
So easy to hate
Just look at the face
The nose in the clouds
The bulge in the brow
And the head on backwards
The need to escape all visible space
Continuous drift to depend and dismiss
And the head on backwards
(Evil, evil, weak and now feeble, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, we who would kneel, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, man we'll get even, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, we all know the reason, evil, evil) Evil man!
Here comes the fun
Blink and it's gone
See what you've won
The end's just begun
I am the demon, I am the demon...
The morning is hell
The night full of blood
Each sickening smell announces a flood
In a human holiday
No wall at the back
No light on the map
No fiction, no fact
No fibre now... chaff
In the human holiday
(Evil, evil, weak and now feeble, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, we who would kneel, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil demon, quit while you're even, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, we all know the reason, evil, evil) Evil man!
I'm clearing my desk
It's time for a rest
Tomorrow is dead, so the worms have been fed
With the head on thatwards
The washing of hands
The kissing of feet
The failure which brands
Nightmare without sleep
To any fool with a grievance, it's open season!
(Evil, evil, weak and now feeble, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, we who would kneel, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, quit while you're even, evil, evil) Evil man!
(Evil, evil, we all know the reason, evil, evil) Evil man!
I hear gunfire, see the blood run, feel the rage,
I see a black man, see a coloured man in a cage,
The sweat of miners digging diamonds,
Digging graves to feed the boss-man, to feed his family, to feed his slaves,
Men are cursing, women praying for release, but when a white man kills one of "them" no one sees,
From Cape Town to Pretoria, to Johannesburg, there is a crying of people dying that can be heard,
I hear the gunfire, see the blood run, smell the fear,
You lock your minds up, shut the curtains, you close your ears.
Forget the black man, neglect his baby, ignore his hell,
We need apartheid to keep the animal in his cell,
You sweep the pavement, shine the buildings, display the maid,
You say "Republic", I say, "Blind man, it's a cage,"
God makes the colour, but the colour doesn't make you God,
Oh, and in the judgement, he will remember the ones you've robbed,
Without the Lord's love this injustice will prevail,
Until Jesus is the only master we'll never break the bars of this jail.
Watch the skies light up Libya tonight
Last whispers come bleeding from lips
They stole your freedom for military might
Prostituted like the whores of the apocolypse
Reagen plays the liar - power's his desire, there's nothing for the world we can do!
Reagen plays the lyre - the flames are burning higher, while the world burns down around you!
They say they're telling us the honest truth,
Then they stab us in the back and lie to our face.
They say they're building a new free world,
But it's just the empire of a new master race.
They say "It's not our policy to kill civilians,
But it's to make the world safe for democracy..."
The fact they're still lying while our children are dying
Only stands as proof of man's insanity.
Do you wave the flag, can you support a man
Who'd rather arm the world than give it food.
As the new master twists the nuclear screw,
He laughs as Kiev burns on the six o'clock news.
They say they're telling us the honest truth,
Then they stab us in the back and lie to our face.
They say they're building a new free world,
But it's just the empire of a new master race.
They say "It's not our policy to kill civilians,
But it's to make the world safe for democracy..."
The fact they're still lying while our children are dying
Only stands as proof of man's insanity.
Reagen plays the liar - power's his desire, there's nothing for the world we can do!
I'll never fall again, never fall again
Never fall again, never fall again...
Face and embrace.
When decisions lead up to consequence.
I force down the drain
Any remnants left I let slip away.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all.
Give it some time. Mulling it over.
Pulling down the shades till the nerves recover.
You wanna know what's really bothering me?
I'm not passive aggressive, but I had to leave.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all the things I should have said.
Because of all.
Give it some time.
Mulling it over.
Pulling down shades
Till I can settle the score.
Closer, a little more.
Closer, a little more...
Face and embrace.
When decisions lead up to consequence.
I force down the drain
Any remnants left I let slip away.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Give it time, just a little closer.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Build it up just a little more.
Because of all the things I should have said to you.
Give it time, just a little closer.
Because of all the things I should have said to you.
Because of all.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Lashing out
At frustration
Chorus :swing harder/ is that the best you can do
I'm still standing here on my feet, God won't you just/ knock me to my knees, please.
Don't you hesitate now,
Break me down just to build me back again
Temper temper
Always remember
Your temper temper
You could've been so much more to me
I hope you feel better, I don't, I will not not recover
From this bliss this dull joy un-victory
You must always remember
I made this for you
Wave by at you with my broken hands
Goodbye dad time to make amends to me but you don't see me
I know you have no idea
I tried, we'll drown ourselves in misery tonight
I lied, you've worn out all your dancing shoes this time
Just give us war, worn lipstick by the purifying flame
These eyes have had too much to drink again tonight
Black skies, we'll douse ourselves in high explosive light
Just give us war, war, I've been calling you all week
For my shotgun
Pick up the phone
Pick up the phone fucker
I wanna see what you're insides look like
I bet you're not fuckin' pretty on the inside
I wanna see what you're insides look like
I wanna see em
Well you don't say
And well I can't explain what happened to my face
Late last night
I'm sleepin' in empty pools and vacant alleyways
And what I'm goin' through, shot lipgloss through my veins
And well I can't complain
With the falling rain
C'mon
I wanna save your heart
I wanna see what your insides may be
Sisters joined at the hip,
Throats choking on a kiss,
Legs splayed---penetrated
By a bar through the ribs.
Spinning till they hit the ground
-Undaunted.
Dancing while the blood runs out
-You watch them...
Dance pretty marionettes,
Mouths open wide
-So their tongues can attach
Gracefully curved
-While hinged at the knee.
Malevolent in their Symphony.
I know you think it's sweet
-How they fall to their knees,
When the needles go through,
-How they DIE just for you.
Spinning till they hit the ground
-Undaunted.
Laughing as their blood runs out
-You watch them...
Dance pretty marionettes,
Mouths open wide
-So their tongues can attach
Gracefully curved
-While hinged at the knee.
Malevolent in their Symphony
There's a shiver in my thighs whenever you're around me
And it fills me with an ache that circles and surrounds me
There's an angel in your smile, a demon in your kisses
If I gave you all my heart you'd send it back in pieces
Everything you do's gonna come back to you
Everything you say's gonna turn on you (in some way)
Everything you've done's gonna bite you back (in some way)
Everything you do's gonna come back to you
There's a darkness in your soul demanding imperfection
And every finger that you point will turn in your direction
I hate the way I love you and I love the way you hate me
When you can barely tolerate me
Try to figure why you always seem to
Find another fault of mine you can scream to
Kicking me, pushing me, biting me, bruising me,
Putting me and keeping me down
It's always this and it's aways that
And it's always something else
But anything you do to me
You ultimately do to yourself
There's a shiver in my soul each time you try to break me
If I don't run you'll drive me crazy
I am - your - friend
I am so eloquent
So don't you speak
Just listen up instead
You close your eyes
And I get paid for it
I'm getting near
You won't get out of here
I'm about to rip
Your stupid life apart
Then you can leave
Welcome back to the start
Psychiatrists play god - I know
(That's what you ought to know)
Decide what's right or not - I know
(That's what you ought to know)
So we can sing the sorrow
(Sing it, sing it)
Medication time tomorrow
(Take it, take it)
Of course you're right
This isn't sane anymore
The world we know
Is rotten to the core
We're motiveless
But irresistible
And you my friend
You can still have it all
Psychiatrists play god - I know
(That's what you ought to know)
Decide what's right or not - I know
(That's what you ought to know)
So we can sing the sorrow
(Sing it, sing it)
Medication time tomorrow
(Take it, take it)
In the center of the earth
I'm holding this world
Together with the breath I take
And with a heartbeat
In the center of the earth
I'm holding this world
Together with the breath I take
Psychiatrists play god - I know
Decide what's right or not - I know
So we can sing the sorrow
Medication time tomorrow
That's what you ought to know!
Psychiatrists play god - I know
(That's what you ought to know)
Decide what's right or not - I know
(That's what you ought to know)
So we can sing the sorrow
(Sing it, sing it)
Medication time tomorrow
(Take it, take it)
(4x)
Psychiatrists play god

Jij moet niet zeuren over vroeger
Hoeveel vriendjes je wel had
Je weet dat ik dat liever niet wil horen
Die verhalen ben ik zat ja echt zo zat
Nee ik praat toch ook niet over vrouwen
Die ik heb gekend
Je weet dat ik er maar van een kan houden
Je weet dat jij dat bent
Refrein 2x
Ja dat ben jij en dat weet je
Jij koos voor mij ik voor jou
Dus stop met al die verhalen
Je bent geen kind meer maar vrouw
Af en toe moet ik nog aan je wennen
Dan begrijp ik jou soms niet
Is 't echt of zit je me te jennen
Jij bent favoriet
Refrein 2x
I beat that bitch with a hit
I beat that bitch with a hit
I beat, I beat, I beat, I beat
I beat that bitch with a hit
Hey...
Excuse me, hey
You mind to...
Pump?
What you're gonna do for me
Compress me or undress me
Equalize me, finalize me
Pump me, pimp and untie me
Show me, oh, show me
How you dig that shit
And beat this bitch with a hit
I beat that bitch with a hit...
Bon Iver:
I shoot the lights out
Hide till it's bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?
Rick Ross:
Bitch, I'm a monster, no good blood sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example
Kanye West:
Gossip gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster

Oh, the best living or dead hands down, huh?
Less talk more head right now, huh?
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm bout to take it to another level bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assist
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now
This that goose and malibu, I call it Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with the new style
Throw that motherfucker, "Well, whatchu gon' do now?
Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh it's cool now"
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you will never get on top of this
So mommy best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
I put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruise her esophagus
Head of the class and she just want a swallowship
I'm living the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass
Kanye West:
Gossip gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hand
Jay-Z:
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Lochness
Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage a village, women and children
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles heel is?
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood suckers
All I see is these niggas I've made millionnaires
Milling about, spilling there feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
Kanye West:
Gossip gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hand
Nicki Minaj:
Pull up in a monster automobile, gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
First things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a muthafucking monster do
Hairdresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50k for a verse, no album out
Yeah my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
Hotter than a middle eastern climate, find it
Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties, when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, 'cause she's fake
She's on a diet but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfucking monster
Bon Iver:
I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide, cide
I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide, cide
I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide, cide
I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I have a dream of a scene between the green hills
Clouds pull away and the sunlight's revealed
People don't talk about keeping it real
It's understood that they actually will
And intoxicated and stimulated emcees
Staring in the trees, paranoid, are gone in the breeze
Watch them flee, hip-hop heads
Take a walk with me and what you'll see
Is a land where the sand's made up of crushed up wax
And the sky beyond you is Krylon blue
And everybody speaks in a dialect of rhyme
And emcees have left materialism behind them
Meanwhile I just grip my mic
And hope me and my team make it through alright
Because say what you will, and say what you might
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night
Because this is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same
And dedicated to the people advancing the game
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun
I've seen a lot of shit
I've talked to a bum out on Sunset Strip
He asked me "How would you feel if everybody acted like you didn't exist"
You'd lose your grip, probably eventually flip
So let it be known, the only reason that we do this
Is so you can pick it up and just bang your head to it
While emcees fight to see who can be the commonest
We float overhead like a space odyssey monolith
Over-seeing the game, over being part of the same ol' thing
It's all gonna change in a hurricane of darkness and pain
And acidic rain and promises that you won't do it again
Meanwhile I just grip my mic
And hope me and my team make it through alright
Because say what you will, and say what you might
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night
Because this is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same
And dedicated to the people advancing the game
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide
This is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same
And dedicated to the people advancing the game
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun
This is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same
And dedicated to the people advancing the game
What's real, everybody who doesn't feel safe
What's real, everybody who knows they're out of place
What's real, anybody with nowhere to run
Who hides in the shadows waiting for the sun
Amidst a sea of white houses
A train wreck maze of dirty pictures
Lies on the floor
Underneath the thick make-up
Laughs a face of a girl who just got paid for
All the pretty things that she can do with
What she's got and what she's given
It's just another scary story to me
And you just can't help but question
If she ever listened to Mother
Because all the most vital lessons
Went in one ear and out the other
Artificial - pre-conceived
Hey, deceiver - I'm relieved I am
Now raise your head from the floorboard
Poster children of the nineties your time has come
Set your sights to the scoreboard
Trailer park-channel-surfing monkey
Who's side you on?
She could be a Queen but now
She's selling her crown to Montel Williams
Now what kind of life is that to lead
Artificial - pre-conceived
Hey, deceiver - I'm relieved I am
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying
Well, I look over yonder to that burying ground
Look over yonder to that burying ground
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying but
I hate to leave my children crying
There's a black smoke rising, Lord
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed
I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Fixing to die, fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying
How come I didn't see
You were making fun of me
How dare you change the rules
You made me look a fool
Well now you're gonna see
The last laugh's not on on me
What am I gonna do
To get my revenge on you
You're goin' down, goin' down
Was it just another lie
Or did I just breathe a sigh
What else can I do
I was so into you
With all this bad luck I've had
My karma must be bad
You've played your little games
Oh what a shame
You're goin' down, goin' down. Goin' down
I'm singing it loud and I don't care
I'm singing it proud everywhere
I feel no remorse
My life is back on course
From this little hitch
I have become a super-bitch
But don't be afraid
By that confession I've made
I am not a whore
I have gone hardcore
You're goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down...
I'm singing it loud and I don't care
I'm singing it proud everywhere
I'm singing it loud and I don't care
I'm singing it proud everywhere
Ha - ha - ha
You're goin' down, goin' down
You're goin' down, goin' down
Ha - yeah
She wore out the feeling
With a tender killing
She paid for the blackout
I saw it rolling in
Was I, was I
Watching over you
Or watching you fall apart
Did I, did I
Lend a hand to hold you down
Or just a hand to hold
Did I, did I
Pull the wool over your eyes
Or keep you from the cold
She came with a warning
She left with the morning
An eye on the doorway
A scar in the early light
Was I, was I
Hanging on a word
Or was I just the messenger
Did I, did I
Lend a hand to hold you down
Or just a hand to hold
Did I, did I
Pull the wool over your eyes
Or keep you from the cold
In every look upon your face
There was an element of grace
Did I read between the lines or erase?
Did I, did I
Lend a hand to hold you down
Or just a hand to hold
Did I, did I
Pull the wool over your eyes
Or keep you from the cold
If I don't get what I want x3
I'm gonna... x3
I wanna cook,
And I wanna slave
I wanna drive them,
Into their graves
I wanna ride in the bat mobile,
I want the world,
I want the stars
My own space shuttle,
And a track to mars
Sleep in a warm bed
Repeat from beginning x1
Well lady and gentelman, boys and girls, you know what'll happen next, I've got my prince, and few weeks of beautiful happiness, and then the prince got ill and die of colon cancer. Fuck. I found love, and it got cancer. So I gonna hang around the shithole called no more, boys and girls. I'm gonna kill myself like you will, and I'll take that bitch stepmother with me.
Well it's happy ever after that's what we want
But the prince got colon cancer fate takes a dump
Wel it's living in a palace having tea with the queen
Luxury youth and eternity that's the dream
Life's a cunt
Life's a cunt
Well it's happy ever after as the sheets turn shit-brown
The prince mumbles expletives like a moronic clown
Well he might have been the richest now fear is in his eyes
Now he sobs like a baby in agony does cry
Life's a cunt
Life's a cunt
Well it's happy ever after in our little ivory tower
Mahalma Gandhi cut crystal and having lots of showers
Intellectual artistic seriously
The prince opens his mouth he vomits shits and pees
Life's a cunt
Life's a cunt
Well, the prince he died screaming he showered me with shit
He screamed you fucking crack whore called me a fucking bitch
Now I don't live with a prince no tea with the queen
There's only one thing I can say this life is fucking mean
Life's a cunt
Life's a cunt
My mother died of cancer, prince died of cancer, that was the end for me. I just wanna to kill that motherfucking stepmother, kill myself, and kill all you. And fucked of the cancer then. I just wanna to be with my prince and my mother. God, life's a cunt.
Life's a cunt
Life's a cunt
Look around you, is this what you want
Look for a compromise and all you get is laughter
This is not what anyone deserves
This is not culture
Crawl against the stream
Traffic jam of dreams
Your nose is bleeding
Fudge along, a ticking bomb
Take me down the alley of dreams
Where the future is free, the dope is clean
And now please let me in
Take me down the alley of dreams
Where the future is clean, the dope is free
So please let me...
Look around you, is this what you want
Look for a compromise and all you get is laughter
This is not what anyone deserves
This is not your culture
Comprehensive, a wide screen TV of nails
Aspire the atomistic spines
Aggro-culture, apprehensive for and to majorities
Look around you, is this what you want.
Look for a compromise and all you get is laughter
This is not what anyone deserves
Discrete the gravity
Take me down the alley of dreams
Where the future is free, the dope is clean
And won't you please let me in
Take me down the alley of dreams
Where the future is clean, the dope is free
So please let me...
Feel my heart
Do you think that it's cold?
'Cause something inside me
Is rearranging
Not again
Who am I with today
I won't remember
It doesn't matter
This is not the life I wanna live
This is not the man I wanna be
Help me stand
Otherwise I might fall
And tell everyone here
I'm not always like this
There's still time
I'll explain later
I know you won't
You never do
Oh but I'll leave after this
(I wanna feel)
I don't want to
(I wanna feel)
I don't want to think
SeedMC verse 1
I'll give you one chance to answer (answer)
These rhymes don't seem to match up (match up)
You'd better go and call for backup (backup!)
Cause this shit's gonna publicly crash your systems and isms and formulaic flows
Every day it goes to try and get votes but don't know the correct tactics
You think you're immaculate
In fact you think yourself apt at it but you're just crap at it
You're inaccurate, hotheaded like a Capulet wanker
Check my slant on it, give me a beat and I'll dance on it while you act robotic
Just another puppet
Now I'm no prophet, but the rhymes you vomit
Are the uranium deposits and the genocides you closet
Old growth forests, first you go and log it
Then you get your planes and with napalm you bomb it
And in the meantime take an indigenous culture and rob it
Now as a citizen, I've asked you to stop it
But you haven't so now I grab this vocal and just cock it
So draw your weapons (woop)
Too late there we go
I send you back with my raps banging in your stereos
Fuck you
And your long list of isms
You, and the holes you put pigins
Me, and my own inhibitions
And fuck you and you and in addition
You and your patriotism
You and your religionisms
You and your criticisms
And if you don't like it then don't fucking listen
Joelistics verse 2
Fuck you and that horse you rode in on
That high horse you get on from bullshit you where fed on
This rap is the kick back from toes you tread on
The people that you pick on
What? Because there different from you?
Check you attitudes those narrow views are bound to be the death of you
Swing back at you and hit you up black and blue
And we'd all been better off if you'd been born mute
You step up to talk and you start to go on
It's question time, listen I've got my suspicions
Ignorance plagues up this planet that we live on
You might think this song is about rappers, you're wrong
It's about people who use power to trip on
My aim is dead on from my room with a view
It's too true we all have some flaws to admit to
So fuck it, guess what, this rap is about me
I'd rap this sonnet in the senate if I could
If I thought for a second it would do any good
Well take a look, take a walk, read a book
Let's burn down the parliament and watch the flag cook
I'm using bogon and I'll take on all comers
You sexist, racist, homophobic fuckers
The dull, the dumb, the dirty and the dumber
My friend from overseas said this countries got the dumbest
Pull back the covers, read the newspapers
Listen to talk back radio, watch Neighbours
Talk to a politician or to a cop
Talk to Pauline in her fish and chip shop
I'm proud I'm Australian, whatever that means,
Probably bad dreams if you're a refugee
I love our sunburnt country, I love it a lot
It's just a pity about all the redneck fucks!
Fuck you
And your long list of isms
You, and the holes you put pigins
Me, and my own inhibitions
And fuck you and you and in addition
You and your patriotism
You and your religionisms
You and your criticisms
And if you don't like it then don't fucking listen
The only thing going "bling-bling"
When I defeat you weak kings
Is the sound of the bell at the side of the ring
Bringing the legendary
Strike men
The Mighty mythical
Invincible
Titan with tight lyricals
The principles that I'm built upon
Will dominate your thought
And leave my song standing longer than the Parthenon
Revolutionary Renaissance
Moving the masses
From military to mic clashes
Class is in a session of regression
Mentioning words to smite you
I could rip your rhyme with a haiku
Because I don't like you
Or what you're doing
I'm on the mic
In your face, ready to ruin
Like city states of ancient humans
Or like a statue of Stalin after the fall of the Soviet Union
Moving in
And taking over
Atom rocks with thoughts
That blows up spots like Supernova
-------
Prepare, for me to dominate your mentals
"If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to"
Who needs a rhyme
I can beat your crew with instrumentals
"If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to"
Saw me once, saw me again got your pistol
"If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to"
Atom'll rip a rhyme, and devastate a mind with 3 lines
That's the Essential
"If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to"
Potential
How do I have it?
I'm potentially the illest lyricist upon the planet
I take it for granted that I
Could rock your show single handed
You've been abandoned
To my consortium
MCs I be warning them
That I'm
A philosophical historian
Who orders men
Like Julius Caesar seizing control of the Praetorium
... A gladiator on mics
I'm known to strike like a Hittite
Fighting an Anakite
Mic demagogue
The artist with heart darkness
I ain't a democrat
I'm a straight up monarchist
Hostile takeover
Like the colonists did to Americas
Consolidating your urban areas
For those feeling that what I said offends you
If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to
To the punk MC
Spitting vanity
Claiming he can handle my mic mastery
Nigga, you couldn't handle half of me
It's sad to see
A wack MC that still raps
MCs are like women
They're all thinking they're fat
When in fact they're not
But that's aight
I'ma keep mine tight
Yo
And let you know tonight
That on a PH-scale
We got opposites of lyrics
Your style's "basic" while my rhyme remains "acidic"
Storing energy in my lyrics like photosynthesis
Exist
Before the first fossilized Australopithecus
Lyricist
I write tight with mic inferences
Invincible before the due time
Like Two Witnesses
The difference is we're unequal
Nigga, you couldn't get signed if you talked to deaf people
I'm better on the mic
Say it ain't true
Ain't saying I'm the best
I just said I'm better than you.
This one's for you
Nasty teenage film
So blue
So blue
(If you're ready)
Once in a life
You can look down one road
I realized I was Dad
I realized all this writing was for you
But every word you wrote
It's now my turn to drive
I'm ready
(I really am)
Once in a life
You can look down one road
I realized I was Dad
I realized all this writing was for you
Once in a life
You can look down one road
I realized I was Dad
I realized all this writing was for you
(We get it)
This one's for you
Nasty
Teenage film
I saw you
(If you're ready)
I saw you
(If you're ready)
(We get it)
Once in a life you can look down one road
I realized I was Dad
I realized all this writing for you
Once in a life you can look down one road
I realized I was Dad
I realized all this writing for you
It's payback
Get outta my face
Get outta my pocket
Get off of your free ride
And get, right out of my sight
It's payback
Get off of my case
Get off of my lady
Get into your fat Mercedes
And right outta my life
It's payback
Get outta my face
Get outta my pocket
Get off of your free ride
And get, right out of my sight
It's payback
Get off of my case
Get off of my lady
Get into your fat Mercedes
And right outta my life
You walk in, right into my world
Right into my backyard
I give to you all that I got
You gave to me jack
And then you pretend
To be my friend
My trust you're earning
When all of this time, you're turning
A knife in my back
And now,
It's payback
Get outta my face
Get outta my pocket
Get off of your free ride
And get, right out of my sight
It's payback
Get off of my case
Get off of my lady
Get into your fat Mercedes
And right outta my life
How does it feel to be down on your knees
Tell me, how does it feel for ya
How does it feel to be down on your knees
Tell me, how does it feel for ya
I'm chilling with the boys from the south
Better make a run cause you know it's gonna go down
I'm sick of everything that you say
And by the way did you say that you couldn't make a better day
Better leave real quick cause you know me
Everything I do, everything I think
Its payback, and it's all
Take a listen to the words of the song
It's payback
Get outta my face
Get outta my pocket
Get off of your free ride
And get, right out of my sight
It's payback
Get off of my case
Get off of my lady
Get into your fat Mercedes
And right outta my life
You say you're sorry now
That you feel bad about it
You make it up to me
There ain't no doubt about it
You must think I'm a fool
That I was born yesterday
Some kinda simple sucker
There's nothing you can say
You stupid motherf-*****
Payback
Payback
Payback
It's payback
Get outta my face
Get outta my pocket
Get off of your free ride
And get, right out of my sight
It's payback
Get off of my case
Get off of my lady
Get into your fat Mercedes
And right outta my life
How does it feel to be down on your knees
Tell me, how does it feel for ya
Right outta my sight
How does it feel to be down on your knees
Tell me, how does it feel for ya
Right outta my life
It's Payback
Politically erect romanticizing
About ancestral innocense
Conscience easing curiosity pleasing
Slum teasing
Lab rat is crude ego food
Ain't no afro or halo can pick the cotton out
Your conscience
Inside the petting zoo (was it good for you?)
Can't hide me in dark nicht places ('cause in the spaces)
Curious is the luxury (to be wrong)
White wrong still belong all my jungle come out
Curious white boy when am I gonna meet yo mama
(Met yo daddy already)
Another housekeeper fantasy afrodite
Coffee colored remedy for yo hangover from history
I know your daddy and your brothers too well
And his friends made me swear I wouldn't tell
What you so mad about
Always gotta scream and shout
Find a difference point it out
Spread your legs shut your mouth
My virginity hanging from your family tree
Why you so angry
They just crowned mammy
Miss America
I can feel your body
When I'm lying in bed
There's too much confusion
Going around through my head
And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?
Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home
I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
It's just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel
And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame will always burn
I'll never get over
I know now that I'll never learn
Don't sing me lullabies
I won't close my eyes,
I can't close my eyes
It's true,
I'm doomed
'Til dawn
Shines through
Got too many things to do
Got friends to see,
I can't miss a thing
It's true,
I'm through
I'm screwed,
Unglued
I won't close my eyes, I can't close my eyes,
I never close my eyes
You see, they're always there with funny hair,
Oh, I'm so scared
It happens to me every night
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me
They always want to take a bite
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me
And if you think this isn't real
I'll show you wounds that never heal
To them I'm just a happy meal
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me
Make the coffee black as night
Help me through the night
I know their appetite for me
I'm meat
But I'm sweet
As can be
And if I do too much booze
I begin to snooze
I hear the big old floppy shoes
It's true,
I'm stew,
Unchewed
I won't close my eyes, I can't close my eyes,
I never close my eyes
See, they're always there with that funny hair,
Oh, I'm so scared
It happens to me every night
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me
They always want to take a bite
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me
And if you think this isn't real
I'll show you wounds that never heal
To them I'm just a happy meal
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me
There's a look on your face I would like to knock out
See the sin in your grin and the shape of your mouth
All I want is to see you in terrible pain
Though we won't ever meet I remember your name
Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to God I think of a nice thing to say
But I don't think I can so fuck you anyway
You are scum, you are scum and I hope that you know
That the cracks in your smile are beginning to show
Now the world needs to see that it's time you should go
There's no light in your eyes and your brain is too slow
Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to God I can think of a nice thing to say
But I don't think I can, so fuck you anyway
Bet you sleep like a child with your thumb in your mouth
I could creep up beside put a gun in your mouth
Makes me sick when I hear all the shit that you say
So much crap coming out, it must take you all day
There's a space kept in hell with your name on the seat
With a spike in the chair just to make it complete
When you look at yourself do you see what I see
If you do why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me?
There's a time for us all and I think yours has been
Can you please hurry up 'cause I find you obscene
We can't wait for the day that you're never around
When that face isn't here and you rot underground
Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to god I can think of a nice thing to say
But I don't think I can so fuck you anyway
So fuck you anyway
So fuck you anyway
So fuck you anyway
...
As soon as you're born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
But you really can't function you're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
There's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to live like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor

Hey, go, hey, go, hey, go, hey, go
No more secrets
Yeah I mind what you do
I hope you die
Yeah you're such a fucking liar
Well I'll cut your tongue
Then I'll let you die
You think it's my fault
Wait... Hey wait for me
Wait... Hey wait for me
Wait... Yeah wait for me
Wait... Hey wait for me
And now I see stars
Yeah, oh yeah
Man I tried to do your stepdad
And it starts and it's true
Suffer always
Hey your blood is showin' through
This time I win
Wait... Hey wait for me
Wait... Hey wait for me
Wait... Yeah wait for me
Wait... Hey wait for me
And now I see stars
Now that I made it through
Yeah you, yeah you
And I start watching
Suffer always
Man I'll molest you
Like it like it
Oh way oh
I am not worth this
Oh you take what is not yours to take
Oh way oh
Does it hurt now
She's not you this is not the end
And I am what you want
And I do
And I ask you
Why don't you lie down
She would never tell,
These secrets don't keep to themselves, 
I'm more than a man,
I'm the ghost that grew from the ground, 
I turn light into sound, 
Nothing can compare to the way she would say to me "Darlin' You know I'm gonna beg,"
This echoed compassion, it covers your eyes, 
So sing for the moment, 
She's caught in a lie,
You married disaster, it ended your life, 
So sing for the moment,
And something survived,
One move and you're dead, 
I live with this guilt in my head, 
I found you alive, but the ghost is helpless inside, 
It's hardly intimate, falling to pieces, out comes demons,
Something survived 
This girl's getting caught in a lie, 
This echoed compassion, it covers your eyes, 
So sing for the moment, 
She's caught in a lie,
You married disaster, it ended your life, 
So sing for the moment,
And something survived,
I lost you once, I won't lose you tonight,
Something survived,
Something survived,
???
Something Survived,  
This echoed compassion, it covers your eyes, 
So sing for the moment, 
You married disaster, it ended your life, 
So sing for the moment,
It ends tonight,
I lost you once, I won't lose you tonight,
I lost you once, I won't lose you tonight,
So sing for the moment, 
So sing for the moment tonight
Would you expect any less from the people at the top?
Taking lives in their hands, stringing all the losers up.
For the beats, beats that go with losing any war,
While the winners write the history books defeated die poor
Cold and alone, dead and disintegrating,
More bereft of life than an old jackson pollack painting
I can get with this and I can see it all now
Before the hail of bullets there is silence, the pow
It's not funny 'cause when you think you're on the a-tip you slip
It must be this fucking dark winter weather, I torture myself too much anyway
It's like when I'm feeling happy then I'm jealous of me
Well, people say I hold out like a holden caulfield
You said you didn't like my voice so I kept my jaw steeled
It's too much I shook my head spa-spa-spazmatically
Fat mama cass it was hip automatically
I erase the lines that you mend, "I've done it before", I said, "I'll do it again"
I erase the lines that you mend, "I've done it before", I said, "I'll do it again, do it again"
Don't point that thing at me unless you want to use it
Bark out abuses to the weakest at the back of the line
It's open season on the meek and the useless
Squint, think and squeeze when you can see me and the whites of my eyes
But now you're staring out the TV with a smile on your face
Predicting armageddon all over the place
And we're really sorry for all the mistakes we made
It's easy to control us if you keep us all afraid
But now even if you could eat your own words you'd start a hunger strike
Kick sand up in my face like I'm a wheel guard on your dirt bike
The sicker the quicker, thicker, the fatter watch 'em all scatter
But here's the kicker, it doesn't matter
Heaven is a joke and hell is a lie, pay attention son 'cause these are words to live by
I've got my tongue in my cheek so far it makes me mute
Now watch me kick in the teeth of the track like my mind was a steel toe boot
I erase the lines that you mend, "I've done it before", I said, "I'll do it again"
I erase the lines that you mend, "I've done it before", I said, "I'll do it again, do it again"
Don't point that thing at me unless you want to use it
Bark out abuses to the weakest at the back of the line
It's open season on the meek and the useless
Squint, think and squeeze when you can see me and the whites of my eyes
The indescribable is up for discussion
The undeniable is all about consumption
And anyone around and all the people in the street
They're pointing fingers and they're whispering discreetly
"Who is that man? what's he done for his homeland?"
He knows their hopes will fade without the strength of his hand
They all can see him, they know where he's going
He feels so damn obvious that he must be glowing
He is ready for his sneak attack, he's gonna go do this shit and not look back
"I have the answers for the questions y'all been asking me,
I will relieve you of the burden of your six figure apathy,
I am the dynamite, I am the glue,
I never underestimate the enemy that's what you do
I never underestimate the enemy that's what you do
I never underestimate the enemy that's what you do
Don't point that thing at me unless you want to use it
It's open season 'cause it's good, good, good.
Don't point that thing at me unless you want to use it
Bark out abuses to the weakest at the back of the line
It's open season on the meek and the useless
Squint, think and squeeze when you can see me and the whites of my eyes
Don't point that thing at me unless you want to use it
Bark out abuses to the weakest at the back of the line
It's open season on the meek and the useless
Squint, think and squeeze when you can see me and the whites of my eyes
Hey Alice, I'm caving in
I'm caving in
I know it's not allowed
But sometimes I fantasize
I'm peeling off my skin
Enough to fill it up again
Hey rabbit
Into the pavement
I'm caving in
Mother told me be something
So I'm afraid
Enough to stay wide awake
So wide awake, wide awake
Hey rabbit, I came to win
I came to win
I know it's not allowed
But sometimes you might find
It feels like nothing is
And it's everything you've been
Hey Alice
Into the pavement
I'm caving in
Mother told me to be something
So I'm afraid
Enough to stay wide awake
So wide awake, wide awake
Mother told me to be something
So I'm afraid
Mother told me to be something
Enough to stay wide awake
This ain't real, baby
Got a better excuse for myself
This ain't real, baby
Got a better excuse for myself
This ain't real, baby
Got a better excuse for myself
I'm always here
I'm always here
I'm always here
I'm always here
Won't you let her leave today inject the holy spirit in her
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your mercy inside
Won't you let her taste herself
And sterilize the sickness
Won't you let her breathe today inject the holy spirit in her
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your mercy inside
She goes down, she goes down
She goes down in suite 304
She goes down, she goes down
She goes down, the sacred whore
As the skycrape imge cies, in neon lights it peaks itself
Won't you let her breathe a recipe for drugs to see clear
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your grace inside
Won't you let her breathe today inject the holy spirit in her
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your needle inside
Won't you let her taste her sins
And sterilize the sickness
She goes down, she goes down
She goes down in suite 304
She goes down, she goes down
She goes down, she bows in neon lights
(Music: Weston/Smail)
(Lyrics: Lawrence)
You pretend to be my friend
But you can't make that which isn't real 
You fill your mind with facts 
But you will never get the feel 
It's not quite right 
You're not what you seem 
One part false 
Two parts obscene 
Back stabbing hypocrite
Won't let you scandalize my name
You want my confidence 
But no two things you say are ever the same
You're not quite right
It's not what it seems 
Social status
Human obscene 
Yours is no sacrifice
It's all a worthless slice 
Of conversation for the day 
Mine is paradise
Upon which there is no price 
Of that you mock and betray 
And you're telling me 
What it is I need
I don't have a clue
How can you? 
I know what's real 
Or at least I can feel 
Vengeance is mine 
In due time
Back in the days of shock and awe
We came to liberate them all
History was the cruel judge of overconfidence
Back in the days of shock and awe
Back in the days of "mission accomplished"
Our chief was landing on the deck
The sun was setting on a golden photo op
Back in the days of "mission accomplished"
Thousands of bodies in the ground
Brought home in boxes to a trumpet's sound
No one sees them coming home that way
Thousands buried in the ground
Thousands of children scarred for life
Millions of tears for a soldier's wife
Both sides are losing now
Heaven takes them in
Thousands of children scarred for life
We had a chance to change our mind
But somehow wisdom was hard to find
We went with what we knew and now we can't go back
But we had a chance to change our mind.
I know you've been lying boy
Every single word you say
It's the way your lips shake
When you're...
Getting down and dirty baby
Don't you ask me how I know
And why it's time for you to go
'Cause you should've known better
Before you were...
Getting down and dirty baby
I know I ain't supposed to cry
But I can't keep it inside
Cheater!
Thinking you could get away
But you don't know who you're dealin' with
All the love we had is gone
You gave it to the other ones
You're neve gonna find a love like mine
The way I'm...
Getting down and dirty baby
Now you're crying on my phone
You should've done that months ago
And now it's time for me to get...
Getting down and dirty baby
I know I ain't supposed to cry
But I can't keep it inside
Cheater!
Thinking you could get away
But you don't know who you're dealin' with
No!
You don't!
I let you buy just a little time
So I could find a way to say... goodbye
A little more time before I slam the door in your face
So tired of the heartache and the nights I lie awake
I know I ain't supposed to cry
But I can't keep it inside
Cheater, yeah!
Thinking you could get away
But you don't know who you're dealin' with
Cheater, yeah!
Thinking you could get away
But you don't know who you're dealin' with
Cheater!
Cheater, yeah!
No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy
No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy
No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy
No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy
No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy
Goodbye baby
No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy
Bye bye bye bye
No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy
No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy
I need someone, a person to talk to
Someone who'd care to love
Could it be you?
Could it be you?
The situation gets rough, and I start to panic
It's not enough, it's just a habit
And, kid, you're sick
Well, darling, this is it
Well, you can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time, do it all the time
I hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record!
Oh, yeah? Well, don't get so distressed
Did I happen to mention that I'm impressed?
I take one, one, one 'cause you left me
And two, two, two for my family
And three, three, three for my heartache
And four, four, four for my headaches
And five, five, five for my lonely
And six, six, six for my sorrow
And seven, seven for no tomorrow
And eight, eight, I forget what eight was for
But nine, nine, nine for the lost gods
Ten, ten, ten, ten for everything, everything, everything
Well, you can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time, do it all the time, do it all the time
Kocham i nienawidzę być sam,
Kocham, bo nienawidzę tych dam,
Zabierają mi wolność którą mam,
Którą tak cenię, o którą tak dbam,
Nienawidzę bo nie udało się nam,
Choć mieliśmy tak pięknie skrojony plan,
Nie otworzymy już zamkniętych bram,
Po raz kolejny praktyka teorii zadała kłam,
A w teorii mieliśmy być wolni,
Razem i osobno chyba jesteśmy niezdolni żyć,
Niezdolni by, jakoś to ogarnąć,
Wiem w życiu nie ma nic za darmo,
Za każdą decyzją ukryte są koszty,
Z dnia na dzień staliśmy się sobie obcy,
Wiem, jestem swego losu panem,
Ale to wyzwanie jest jak podróż w nieznane,
I widzę same znaki zapytania,
Czy potrafimy żyć bez zaufania,
Ja odpowiem Ci bez zawahania,
Ale najpierw odpowiedz sobie sama.

Jestem facetem, czasem wzrok ucieka w bok na inną kobietę.
Ale przy Tobie czuję się najlepiej..
Jesteś jedyną wśród setek, tysięcy.
Coś niezwykłego jest między nami,
Znaliśmy się na wylot, dzieliliśmy niemal każdą chwilą,
Chyba dobrze nam ze sobą było,
Czy to miłość, czy tylko zażyłość,
Nie wiem -- ważne że to się zdarzyło,
I chyba nam odbiło, to się na nas odbiło,
To prawie nas zabiło, serce mocniej zabiło,
Była adrenalina, było ostro,
I chyba nas poniosło to chyba nas przerosło,
Dziś chcę zaufać Ci -- jak kiedyś,
Wspólne chwile razem znów przeżyć,
W każde Twoje zdanie znów wierzyć,
Robić razem znów to co należy.

I can show you how it goes how it goes is how you make it
Does it go how you would like it does it go how you do make it
And I know things could be so much better yet why don't we just give everything up
What are you questions I know you have them
Who's to say I am the same
The same I've been these years before I knew you, I knew you
Please don't tell me you're not perfect
Yeah I know that no one is
I know that no one is
Why have we let it get to this
Why have we let it go this far
Lets give it all up and live
Who's to say I am the same
The same I've been these years before I knew you, I knew you
I'm maybe someone you've never met from across oceans changed over night
I don't think so, I don't think so
A long drawn out year and I see now why
The things that were said make all the sense in the world
Can you see the light above your head lighing the room
So you can see the faces of everyone
Looking back at the words you said
Taking back all the words I said you
Act like you aren't new to this
And talk like you're a pro at this
It's so good to see you on your feet again
You act like you're aren't new to this
And you talk like you're a pro at this
Take a look around the city is lit tonight
It's lit it's lit tonight
One more chance to be yourself to prove yourself again
Tonight to be the one you knew you were
To show yourself you really were
Have you ever been kicked to the curb
When the party finally ends
Just when I thought that you left me for dead
You dust me off again
Maybe you thought you could throw me away
Like a shoe that doesn't fit
But you've created your Frankenstein
And now you've gotta live with it
And here I am
Thought I'd turn and walk away
Guess this ain't your lucky day
Too bad if you think I'm leavin'
I'm here to put you through hell
Too bad if you don't believe it
You've done it to yourself
Too bad if you think I'm leavin'
Who cares if you hate my dog
Maybe I'll get another
Just to piss you off
I don't mind tying up the phone
And sleepin' in real late
Haven't you noticed me fillin' the fridge
With all the foods you hate
And here I am
Thought I'd turn and walk away
Guess this ain't your lucky day
Too bad if you think I'm leavin'
I'm here to put you through hell
Too bad if you don't believe it
You've done it to yourself
Too bad if you think I'm leavin'
Who cares if you hate my dog

I recall a friend of mine.
With a tear in my eye,
I stand all alone here at the altar.
He's out,
I'm left with a problem now.
I'm here on earth,
left with the pain.
Look what you've done,
you should have called.
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin
Yeah, heads I win,
tails you loose.
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin
Yeah, heads I win,
tails you loose.
Sorry I couldn't help.
take it back, sorry it didn't help.
Well f*** you, you could have called
What about us?
What about me?
what about the years I spent pampering your ass?
Running here, running there
"Oh I'm so great, I'm so great, I'm fine, I'm fine"
You lied
You promised to give your family a break
from your blows
Look at the sad faces you've left behind now
I let you down?
No, you let me down
I got a family to feed
You got a little kid yourself now
You know what I mean?
You were supposed to stay
No one gave you the right to take your life that way!
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin
Yeah, heads I win,
tails you loose.
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin
Yeah, heads I win,
tails you loose.
Halle, halle, halle
Halle, halle, halleluya
Halle, halle, halle
Halle, halle, halleluya
I feel hate, I feel pain
I feel cold, I feel ashamed
Where's the father you should have been to your daughter?
Sad news, sad days, where are you now? 
Talk to me, come on, talk to me
I know you can hear me!
Why brother, why?
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin
Yeah, heads I win,
tails you loose.
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin
Yeah, heads I win,
tails you loose.
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin
Yeah, heads I win,
tails you loose
Flip a coin, flip a coin, flip a coin
Yeah, heads I win,

Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces,
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons,
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is,
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things,
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it,
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it,
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me.
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be,
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty,
There has to be some type of change for this day and age,
We gotta rearrange and flip the page,
Living encaged like animals and cannibals,
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five,
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
Peace of mind's so hard to find.
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout,
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now
Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces
A war is taking place.
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality.
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living.
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning,
But we live to see the dawn.
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds.
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light,
And the love in our hearts will shine.
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other
Whatever happened to protecting each other
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure,
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever.
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted,
Family values are contradicted.
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough.
Deeply I scream from within
That I surrender 'cause I've been searching
For a clue that I'm alive
I'm like a goldfish swimming in a plugged in blender
The water's peaceful with a view from the inside
But somebody must've already broken my wings
'Cause I couldn't fly, not to mention
How this broken down machine pretends to try
If I was the sun
And you were the mother earth
I'd still revolve around you
You print the label that turns me outside-in
So peel it off, or get within
In you there's always a someday,
With that there's nothing I fear,
But what if there's never a someday at all
But sometimes I wish the world would stop
And let me off for just awhile, just sometime
To retreat from my losses so I can smile
If I was the sun
And you were the mother earth
I'd still revolve around you
Why is it so surprising, no on'es compromising
If we're all born dying, can't we just start trying
To build a life worthin living, if you're
Tired of giving, lend the tools to rebuild my life
If I was the sun
And you were the mother earth
I'd still revolve around you
If I was the sun
And you were the mother earth
I'd still revolve around you
Revolve around you
How does it feel to know that your going to burn
Feel the flesh fall off on to the floor
There's a chance you can make it
There a chance you could die
Long before the time of never
Is your choice to wonder why
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So long, so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So long, so long, so long
Well, there's a lady that knows
All that glitters is not gold
She said, "Don't play that awful song
Don't play that awful song", she said
"'Cause then we'll know the party has gone on too long"
I said, "This stairway ain't to heaven
This one's to oblivion"
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So long, so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So long, so long, so long
She said, "You get too drunk, you get too high
Oh tell me why
Sod this, I'm going home on my own
Goodbye"
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So long, so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So long, so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So long, so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So long (so long)
The party is too long
You get too drunk, you get too high
Oh no
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So long, so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
(So long)
You get too drunk, you get too high
Tell me why
Oh, this stairway ain't to heaven
This one's going all the way to oblivion"
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So long, so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So long, so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So long, so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye
So, so, so
Goodbye, so long
Don't play that awful song
There's a lady who knows
All that glitters is not gold
She said
I'll make my way up to heaven
All the way up there
Someday when I'm old and tired
I pull up a flag - A white flag
Over the rain and storm
With a smiling face
I step on the bridge
Where heaven is waiting for
Take away my body
Rip away my fears
Mr. White Flag
Mr. Smiley Face
History - Death - Tomorrows
All around
I need to kiss before I get fucked
I pull up a flag - A white flag
Over the rain and storm
With a smiling face

I'm so happy
I have lost my edge
So happy
I have lost my edge
So happy
I have lost my edge
'Fuck you, man'
Don't mean nothin' anymore
'Fuck you, man'
Don't mean nothin' anymore
I played it out, out, out, out
(Ooh) I played it out, out, out, out
I made it up to make up for all that I never really did
I made it up to make up for all that I never really did
I'm so happy
I have lost my edge
Shut the fuck up, the beatdown on the verge (what?)
Me never jackoff without writing the verse (when?)
I put the balls on the money divulge in (where?)
The hope that they virgin (why?), jam it up their pussy
'Hey, fuck you, man'
Don't mean nothin' anymore
'Fuck you, man'
Don't mean nothin' anymore
I played it out, out, out, out
(Ooh) I played it out, out, out, out
I made it up to make up for all that I never really did
I made it up to make up for all that I never really did
Me carte blanche
Me ghetto tight
'Hey, fuck you, man'
Don't mean nothin' anymore
'Fuck you, man'
Don't mean nothin' anymore
I played it out, out, out, out
(Ooh) I played it out, out, out, out
I made it up to make up for all that I never really did
I made it up to make up for all that I never really did
I made it up to make up for all that I never really did
I made it up to make up for all that I never really did
I see dying people
Wracked by guilt on slick machines
Flesh riddled with religion
Disease of enfeebled dreams
A police pig in every head
Stands guard over stifled screams
Our demons will never pardon
Eden was born a torture garden
I've been trying to think about life, trying to come up with some sort of flawless system that explains it all, you know, just something that makes it all make sense, preferably one that comes in a nice easily digestible sound bite, quick and easy and without too much effort, because life can be quick and easy and without effort, and I realize the only one thing that brings me any sort of joy is anger and hate. Rage is the only thing that brings me what one might call contentment, rage is the only thing that even begins to satisfy my need for fulfillment and then I realize that I have been wasting my rage on bullshit, on things that didn't deserve it. This one gift of mine was being squandered on things that weren't worthy of it, and this angered me, I'm not going to slut off my rage to everything and anything any longer, but rather now wish to save it for something really special, save it for something noble that really deserves it. I wanted to hate what I respected and I don't respect anything. I long to hate something worthy of the emotion. I can't hate incompetence, I can't hate the pathetic. The pathetic demeans my hate. I want my hate to represent my purpose, to become my purpose. I want it to be worthwhile and looking at you, thinking about you, knowing what you are I realized that to hate you would be a crime, it would be like hating a stain, like hating a pimple, a zit. I can dislike things all I want, they are a nuisance, a bother, but hating them would drag me down, drag me down. How could I build up energy for this? How could I really care? I'm tired of having my hate watered down by irrelevant bullshit. There is nothing worse than wasting the beautiful energy of unrestrained anger, of uninhibited fury, on something like this, some impotent meaningless blur. And then a calm overcomes me. Nothing can bother me now because nothing is worth the trouble. Underneath this emotionless surface boils the true essence of unrestrained anger, I now walk through life like a ghost, like a zombie, for I have reached a transcendental state of bliss, and by bliss I mean rage, because I know that what I now hate is the core of everything, I don't hate your trivialities, you bullshit, your irritants, I hate the essence, I hate truth, I hate the very fundamentals of it all.
Well, the fields belong to the farmers
And the forests belong to the king
These days our pleasures are all behind fences
We have to pay for everything
So turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Well, the cities are teeming with people
And the highway is jammed up with cars
And the airport is a nightmare in season
But you don't have to go that far
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Well, they take all the flags down in the evening
And the soldiers stand guard at the keep
But the beaches are always open
'Cause the ocean, she never sleeps
So turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free
So turn around and come on down
The beach is free
Just turn around and come on down
The beach is free
I wish I would've met you
Now it's a little late
What you could've taught me
I could've saved some face
They think that your early ending was all wrong
For the most part, they're right
But look how they all got strong
That's why I say 
Hey man, nice shot
A good shot, man
That's why I say
Hey man, nice shot
A good shot, man
A man has gun
Hey man, have fun
Nice shot
Now that the smoke's gone
And the air is all clear
Those who were right there
Got a new kind of fear
You'd fight and you were right
But they were just too strong
They'd stick it in your face 
And let you smell what they consider wrong
That's why I say 
Hey man, nice shot
A good shot, man
That's why I say
Hey man, nice shot
What a good shot, man
A man has gun
Hey man, have fun
Nice shot
A man has gun
Hey man, have fun
A nice shot, man
A nice shot, man
I wish I would've met you
I wish I would've met you, oh
I wish I would've met you
I wish I would've met you
I'd say nice shot
As I redefine love for this century of loneliness
I try hard to teach myself. I've got to pass the test.
Can I make it? Can I fake it? Can I overcome it all?
The biggest challenge is that I've got to write the perfect song.
You and me. Far beyond control.
We'll be breaking free 'cause we're far beyond control.
Far beyond control.
We'll be breaking free 'cause we're far beyond control.
A term so used and so abused and still so wonderful.
A million love songs could't save the world how hard they tried.
Can I make it? Can I fake it? Can I overcome it all?
I wrote this anthem for on person. Not so same them all.
You and me. Far beyond control.
We'll be breaking free 'cause we're far beyond control.
Far beyond control.
We'll be breaking free 'cause we're far beyond control.
You and me. Far beyond control.
We'll be breaking free 'cause we're far beyond control.
Far beyond control.
We'll be breaking free 'cause we're far beyond control.
Love me or stay the fuck away from me
Love me or die, tell me, did you ever open up?
Tell me when the lies are going to stop
Nothing is what I get from you, nothing
Just give me something to hold on to
Silence when I try to talk to you
Silence, no communication
Give me just a little to hold on to
Gimme me some fucking feedback
Fuck you for making me waste my time
Fuck you for all the shit you dragged me through
I care but I am close to the edge
I care but now I'm standing on a ledge
Fuck you for letting me love you
Damn you for trying to fuck this up
I know that you got it in you
You know it's your last chance
No sleep, no tears
He creeps up into your ear
Sulfur time bomb ticking
With a tiny hand you're picking
The time is near
Fight to death
You're in denial
Cradle robbing
Fuck it
Talk about lovers
They're both young and very pretty
They're in love but he betrays her
He says he's sorry and so she wants
To believe him that is why
He's got her on his hooks
What you do to me I can do to you
Babe set me free then I'll let you be
Come on, come on now don't you
Fool around
Cause your hurting me won't you
Let me be
You got me on your hooks
You're a bastard
You got me on your hooks
You're a bastard you know it's true
You got me on your hooks (oh no)
You got me on your hooks
You're a bastard
You got me on your hooks
You're a bastard you know it's true
You got me on your hooks
Then one day he decides to marry her
She doesn't want to
Because she doesn't believe him
I saw you kissing that girl last week
But I still think you love me
That's why you got me
What you do to me I can do to you
Babe set me free then I'll let you be
Come on, come on now don't you
Fool around
Cause your hurting me won't you
Let me be
You got me on your hooks
You're a bastard
You got me on your hooks
You're a bastard you know it's true
You got me on your hooks (oh no)
You got me on your hooks
You're a bastard
You got me on your hooks
You're a bastard you know it's true
You got me on your hooks
I know it's crazy but I know it
Won't be long
I know it's crazy but I know
I will survive lalala lalala
What you do to me I can do to you
Babe set me free then I'll let you be
Come on, come on now don't you
Fool around
Cause your hurting me won't you
Let me be
You got me on your hooks!
Saw some guy on the TV yesterday
He's selling poison by the ton
"How can you do such a thing?" a woman asked
And he replied, "Well, the secret is to hook 'em young
Look, I'm not responsible for the lessons children learn
I'm just responsible for giving my investors some return."

The sponsors of 'The Johnny Carcinogenic Show'
The sponsors of 'The Johnny Carcinogenic Show'
Well, you'd never believe how much effort goes into
Adding some glamor to the brands
To distract you from the damage that they do
Putting their product in your hand
What other industry could ever get away
With contaminating their best customers this way?
Here's a message from

The sponsors of 'The Johnny Carcinogenic Show'
Here's a product that promises to do nothing
But take your money and your soul
Poverty is toxic, everybody knows
No need to help it take its toll
Who will profit from the misery they sow?
Not the grandchildren that you will never know

Part I: The Death of St. Jimmy
My heart is beating from me, I am standing all alone
Please call me only if you are coming home
Waste another year flies by, waste a night or two
You taught me how to live...
In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust
What the hell's your name?
What's your pleasure, what is your pain?
Do you dream too much?
Do you think what you need is a crutch?
In the crowd of pain
St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says we're fucked up but we're not the same
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame
Jimmy died today
He blew his brains out into the bay
In the state of mind
It's my own private suicide
Part II: East 12th Street
Well, nobody cares, well, nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well, nobody cares, well, nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on East 12th Street
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world and he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
He's life's on the line with anxiety now
She had enough and he had plenty
Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here
So far away, I don't want to stay
Get me out of here right now
I just wanna be free, is there a possibility?
Get me out of here right now
This life-like dream ain't for me
Part III: Nobody Likes You
I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After ten cups of coffee and you're still not here
Dreaming of a song, but something went wrong
And you can't tell anyone 'cause no one's here
Left me here alone
And I should have stayed home
After ten cups of coffee, I'm thinking
Where'd you go?
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you (where'd you go?)
They're all out without you
Having fun (where'd you go?)
Everyone left you
Nobody likes you (where'd you go?)
They're all out without you
Having fun
Where'd you go?
Part IV: Rock 'n' Roll Girlfriend
Jeez...
I got a rock and roll band
I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend
And another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house
I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out of the drums
And I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York
I got a kid in the Bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothing in over twenty-two days
So get off of my case, off of my case, off of my case
Part V: We're Coming Home Again
Here they come marching down the street
Like in desperation, murmur of a heartbeat
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
The time has come and it's going nowhere
Nobody ever said that life was fair now
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat
The world is spinning around and around, out of control again
From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letterbomb and visit me in Hell
We're the ones going...
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
I started fucking running as soon as my feet touched ground
We're back in the barrio and to you and me that's Jingletown
That's home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They're all out without you
Having fun
Oily hands wag a finger
In a hypochrist tirade
Greasy palms rubbed in delight
As bombs light an Arabian night
Diamonds are Fuhrer's best friend
They sparkle in his earrings
Crocodile tears join to flood
Gallons of spilled African blood
Cloaked by the blood spattered banner
Stamping feet in Union Jack-boots
Goose-step bravely on every face
War is peace with brutal mace
Poisonous seeds of bad apples
Cannot be allowed to pollute
So sure is peachy to torture and shoot
Rebels for United Fruit
Cloaked by the blood spattered banner
Stamping feet in Union Jack-boots
Goose-step bravely on every face
War is peace with brutal mace
Globe-trotting giants rape and pillage
Smash and grab in each village
Sugary fascists are still sour
Some of the image but all of the power
On loyalty the victims choke
As politicians rot the vote
Finger-length maggots chew on remains
And the world is a rotisserie of pain
Come and make me a part of your story. She has a name (an old word) she has a name fantastic and utterly unknown, for it is old: the first word strangled from the void was never spoke again. Whether right is right or wrong, she'll turn you to the empty parts, she'll fill your belly with regrets, old manacles are faithful yet. She wounds, she wounds, she has a name. She is the beating drum that marks her by the bodies she collects. She is always, she is ever, she is the scourge of kings and devourer of light, she is the lust to dine on flesh, oh she'll watch as you perform, for her you'll die to speak to her once more. Give me a love that makes me real, hold down my breath for me--another lonely world to fall in--give me a love that makes me real, I would write it on my arms: your misery's a gift, your plague--a comedy
Tortured and I am betrayed
I am elusive and I will be unheard
I'll take you and I'll play with you
Stand in lines Rape you 
I want to destroy you
I want to rape and kill you
Operation operation
Operation on the wasteland 
No rights and no one ever tells
I will sedate you
And rape your children now 
I want to destroy you
I want to rape and fuck you
Operation operation
Operation on the wasteland
I'm a chicken hawk, huntin' for a chicken
Get paranoid when you hear my Glock clickin'
Speakin' to the punk that's tweakin'
With the bitch-ass styles I hit you like Deacon
Jones house, cough without the bones
I rolled ya up and smoked you like cones
Split the seed and grow you like clones
Don't start-me-up, 'cause I'm not the Rolling Stones
But a head start with a little help from a friend
With the giblick, then I passed around back to B (B-Real) again
I can make you famous like Amos
Same as the last punk, when I stuck the gatt up his anus
Hear me growl eh! Howl!
I got the night vision like the wise old owl
I'm comin' ta fetch ya
Yeah homes I'm wit' ya
Bury them bones
Under my home and
Cock the hammer!
Cock the hammer, it's time for action!
Cock the hammer!
Cock the hammer, it's time for action!
Take my weapon, step into a whole new realm
And step back, as I take up the helm
On the pirate ship I'm steerin'
Droppin' the gearing
Best realize what you're hearin'
The cannon sounded
That's my companion: surrounded
As my crew comes pounding
As the captain
Afro-America
Whole lotta gattin'
With the loc'ed out latin
Busted!
Yo, I'm red beard with a musket
Better duck quick 'cause ya might get dusted
Your gatt looks rusted, disgusted
Oh look away, look away boy as I rush it
Yes I know that you can't withstand it
Watch that ass cause punk I'll brand it
With a steel-toe, how you feel though
When my boot stuck in that ass like a dildo
Cry on a pillow, weeping-ass willow
The Hill got the skill for the static like brillo
Hmmm, what you talkin' 'bout punk?
Gimme room as I light up the boom
Cock the hammer, wave the white banner
Ever heard a Glock go 'click' like a camera?
Cock the hammer!
Cock the hammer, it's time for action!
Cock the hammer!
Cock the hammer, it's time for action!
Cock the hammer!
Cock the hammer, it's time for action!
Cock the hammer!
Cock the hammer, it's time for action!
I came down to see you
But you were never there
You were always lonely somewhere
I came donw to love you
But you were never there
But you're always parting somewhere
Hold on, don't leave me lonely
Hold on, don't leave me lonely
Hold on, don't go without me
Tell me what's the game now
'Cause I'm feeling kind of jealous
You're going out with friends now somewhere

I think I'm going crazy, beware
Hold on, don't leave me lonely
Hold on, don't leave me lonely
Hold on, don't go without me
I'm gonna let nobody, gonna let nobody love you
Gonna let nobody love...

But you were never there
You just left me lonely somewhere
Hold on, don't leave me lonely
Hold on, don't leave me lonely
Hold on, hold on...
Hold on, don't leave me lonely
Hold on...
I'm gonna let nobody, gonna let nobody love you
Gonna let nobody love you...

If you got a lady and you want her gone
But you ain't got the guts
She keeps naggin' at you night and day
Enough to drive you nuts
Pick up the phone, leave her alone
It's time you made a stand
For a fee, I'm happy to be
Your back door man, hey
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
(Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap) Yeah

Dirty deeds

Done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds
Dirty deeds, dirty deeds
Done dirt cheap, yeah
Hello sun, hello blue sky 
Here we are 
You'll be here when I'm gone 
Will you remember me? 
Somebody said each day's God's masterpiece 
I only hope there will be more for me 
If I knew the answer 
Making me understand 
I'm counting the hours 
Counting the happy days 
There's so much more I want to say 
Can anyone save me? 
I don't want to fade away 
Hello spring, I'm like you 
But feel like autumn 
It's too soon to let go 
Too late to change it all 
Somebody said each day's God's masterpiece 
I only hope there will be more for me 
If I knew the answer 
Making me understand 
I'm counting the hours 
Counting the happy days 
There's so much more I want to say 
Can anyone save me? 
Save me, save me? 
Anyone save me? 
Can anyone save me? 
Can anyone save me? 
Can anyone save me? 
I don't want to fade away - away 
I don't want to fade away, away, away 
If I knew the answer 
Making me understand 
I'm counting the hours 
Counting the happy days 
There's so much more I want to say 
Can anyone save me? 
Save me? 
If I knew the answer 
Making me understand 
I'm counting the hours 
Counting the happy days 
There's so much more I want to say 
Can anyone save me? 
Save me, save me? 
Save me... 
I don't want to fade away
I've seen alotta women from all around the world
Different situations all different kinds of girls
No matter who you are and no matter were you live
Keep your head up you gotta think possitive
I know life feels like a struggle some times
Multiple senareos, playin' wit' your mind
Whether you are rich, whether you livin' poor
Where women of the world and that's for sure
Free stance in my eyebrows my dedication
To the women of the world
They say more independence, more
He's stupid
I'm smarting
He's stupid
I'm smarting

There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
Rose white, rose red
Rose up in my head
Rose white, rose red
She lost all her innocence
Gave it to an abscess
She lost all her innocence
She said, "I am not a feminist"
It's not yours - fuck you!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!

Some guys never gonna argue, never gonna bet you're never gonna change
Just one thing to say to you-goodbye, goodbye
I had this letter written to you long ago but never sent it out
I had my speech prepared, my kiss-off lines rehearsed
But I backed out
Why did it take so long for me to take the lead
And realize that you got nothing that I need
This message will be brief-there's nothing much to tell
My heart is signing off-direct from AOL
So simple and elegant don't ever ask me why
I've got just one thing to say to you (Goodbye)
You think that you're God's gift to life that we should fall
Right at your feet-I don't think so - no
And when you break our hearts you toss it out and never miss a beat
But now the tables turned-I won't be hurt again
Does it feel backwards to be on the losing end?
This message will be brief-there's nothing much to tell
My heart is signing off-direct from AOL
So simple and elegant don't ever ask me why
I've got just one thing to say to you (Goodbye)
Some guys never gonna argue, never gonna bet you're never gonna change
I'm through cryin' for you, no more lyin' for you
Won't be caught up in your game
Don't really feel the need to argue this and that
Your time is up-so glad we had this little chat
This message will be brief-there's nothing much to tell
My heart is signing off-direct from AOL
So simple and elegant don't ever ask me why
I've got just one thing to say to you (Goodbye)
How shall I put this?
I've got just the thing -Goodbye
Just one thing to say to you...-Goodbye, Goodbye...
Some guys never gonna argue, never gonna bet you're never gonna change
You had me blinded
But I triggered the light, triggered the light
And you stole the show
When I said I was open minded
What did I know, what did I know, what did I know?
You, you take so long to know
There's something wrong
I'm giving up
I'm gone, gone, gone
Well, I don't lose but this ain't winning
Take me back to the beginning
I've just about had, just about had, just about had enough
Don't call me when you're under the weather
I'll only say, "Pull yourself together"
I've just about had, just about had, just about had enough
No, thank you, no
Really don't plead, really don't plead
"It was just bad luck"
So I'm indisposed
So it shall be, so it shall be every time you call me up, up, oh
You go click, click, click
And I feel sick, sick, sick
I know I will get over it
Yeah, I don't lose but this ain't winning
Take me back to the beginning
I've just about had, just about had, just about had enough
Don't call me when you're under the weather
I'll only say, "Pull yourself together"
I've just about had, just about had, just about had enough
Lord won't you buy me a millionaire
Who doesn't have a wife or a girlfriend in a closet somewhere?
Well, I don't lose but this ain't winning
Take me back to the beginning
I've just about had, just about had, just about had enough
Don't call me when you're under the weather
I'll only say, "Pull yourself together"
I've just about had, just about had, just about had enough
Don't call me boy, don't call me, I've just had enough now
Don't call me, don't you call me, I've just had enough now
Don't you call me, don't you call me, boy, boy, boy
Idon'twantanythingfromyou
You only want me when you're high
You try to heal but you crucify
It's the same shit / different day
You say sorry like it's supposed to change everything
And everything's okay
But everything you gave to me you went and gave away
To anybody else
With a dick
I don't want anything from you
I don't want anything from you
I don't want anything from you
Sorry baby but I can't join your party
And I liked you better the way you were
You're a sad little cliche, you say sorry
Like it's supposed to change everything and make it go away
And everything you gave to me I want to give it back to you
On a stick
I don't want anything from you
I don't want anything from you
I don't want anything from you
(I wonder how it got to be) You lied
You happy with your little freak show?
(I wonder how it got to be) You lied
Baby you were just so so
(I wonder how it got to be)
I don't hate you!
I don't hate you!
I don't hate you!
I don't want anything from you
I don't want anything from you
I don't want anything from you
You don't care 'bout me any more
That's why you, you wanna break my heart
Into pieces on the floor
If you don't care 'bout me any more
Why do you, you wanna break my heart
Into pieces on the floor
You don't care 'bout me any more
That's why you, you wanna break my heart
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
But now I'm, now I'm, now I'm just cold inside
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
But now I'm, now I'm, now I'm just cold inside

Distrust is my middle name, self hate is all the same
Maybe somewhere along the road I accidentally sold my soul (for what?)
Pardon me if I'm too intense, just tired of common sense
All the crap is building up, my mouth is open and just won't shut
Used to believe in revolution, realized I was the only one
Question everything they say, besides whose life is this anyway
Confusion washing me, drenched with indignity
Belligerent authority, bloodied by the right to be
Throw it away, it away, it away
Tactiq
I'm feeling twice my age and treated half the same
I don't hate my loss of luck, I just hate feeling so washed up (for what?)
My life's become a phase, rushing past me in a daze
Taught me how to speak my mind without making it up in time
Nobody is against me, I'm my worst enemy
Tired of wasting all my time to take back what is mine
Confusion washing me, drenched with indignity
Belligerent authority, bloodied by the right to be
I've always listened to what they told me, never gave in with a fight
No one took time to comprehend me, or even ask me what was right
All that's left of my decisions be they only white or black
Have all been filled with "You're nothing", I finally want to take them back for me
Now I'm restless here, can't seem to part with fear
Feeling like I'm drowning and feeling all dried up (for what?)
Spit out and sucked back in, the reason's getting thin
No cash to buy their lies, just the rage behind my eyes
I keep waiting for the day that I can give it all away
Get this monster out of my head and stop wishing that I was dead
Confusion washing me, drenched with indignity
Belligerent authority, bloodied by the right to be me
Let it all go.
If you live in the eternal now you're a ball in hand
Never believed in luck a benefactor of the damned
Lost your rhythm and your stealing' fire breather bringing smoke
Whose got the church key more of that Claymore dope?
You wouldn't go decafe you said Jesus was a laugh
Now whose is that in the body?
In the neighborhood you thought about repenting
But you' rather take from them be the one whose given
You better know the house rules to finish in this life
'Cause you'll learn the difference if you Dog the Nine

The warehouse getting smaller skitzing played yourself
Versace on your back sideways and il
You were left behind you weren't watching' you were sleeping
Now your mother's squatted down alone and she's weeping.
You might not think its phat to apply the cross
The blood of Christ was shed to save your soul
It's all about the sin that you're compiling
Cast salt into your violence stop freestyling
You better know the house rules to finish in this life
'Cause you'll learn the difference if you Dog the Nine

(I tell you how to get it)
Yeah, yeah
You got the right to remain silent or freedom to speak your peace
Straight up with the truth I give you liberty
Why you wanna live out of bounds with a riot in your veins
Hoodlum can't find no peace only trauma in the grave
You need a designated driver for your hostility
Spiritual habitation for your responsibility
Effectual fervent prayer touches the throne of God
Your self inflicted mass suicide die with the mob
You better know the house rules to finish in this life
'Cause you'll learn the difference if you Dog the Nine

The agonies will come after you been lit up
The All Stars amped out bender got corrupt
Behind the eight ball nothing but flimm flamm
You been hawged and your souls been damned
Shot out to the curb with no place to go
Drink plenty of water and best walk slow
Started as ice cream then a joy ride
You can't stop coasting cause vanity is high
Too tired to fall for that
Hate them with a perfect hatred
Too tired to fall for that
Too tired to fall for that
Hate them with a perfect hatred
Too tired to fall for that
Plexin and panic oppression and pride
Fear and a snare hell has eyes
Gnaw on the bones Fata Morgana
How'd you get so far from the garden?
Duckets out the window ends on the street
And you medicate intravenously
Profit is worshiped smells like stale ghost
Forgiveness is unnatural with legal loopholes
Too tired to fall for that
Hate them with a perfect hatred
Too tired to fall for that
Too tired to fall for that
Hate them with a perfect hatred
Too tired to fall for that
Out there bad count the dead
Died with their mouth wide open
Started with a gateway you've been had
At Jesus Second Coming
When there's no one left to pardon your sins
The wicked are estranged from the womb
Will you still be standing in your disease?
Are you ready to face the Doom?
Too tired to fall for that
Hate them with a perfect hatred
Too tired to fall for that
Too tired to fall for that
Hate them with a perfect hatred
Too tired to fall for that
Too tired to fall for that
Hate them with a perfect hatred
Too tired to fall for that
Too tired to fall for that
Hate them with a perfect hatred
Too tired to fall for that
I want to break free with my heart 
With my soul with my hands 
I'll do it all with my hands 
With my will there's a way 
Oh there's a way 
Oh there's a way 
Life is hard and beautiful 
That's why I wanna break free 
When it's hard I break the ice 
When it's nice it turns fire 
Oh burning fire 
Oh burning fire 
I was gone and I was dreaming 
That nobody liked me anymore 
All alone under the water and I knew 
My heart was still there
I was gone and I was dreaming 
That nobody liked me anymore 
All alone under the water and I knew 
My heart was still there
I want to dance free till I fly 
With my soul with my hands 
I won't stop smiling for my treasure 
Family and me
Oh burning fire
Oh burning fire
Oh burning fire
Oh burning fire
All right
You say that I cannot leave you
You say that you cannot leave
You say your hands are burning
That is just because you will rescue me
I say that I'm in a nightmare
I wish that I could leave
I say my head is hurting
That is just because I can't stop thinking
Stop this murder
Every day everything gets shorter
Step right on up
The circus has begun, now take your cut
Stop this torture
Every day everything gets harder
Step right on
The circus has begun, now take your cut
I am living torture
I am living torture
I am living torture
I am living
What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams?
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade, but then
I just end up getting hurt again by myself
(Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself (Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself
I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in
If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blind leaves you senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
And if I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself
(Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself (Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself
I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in
How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid, I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?
Don't you (Know?)
I can't tell you how to make it (Go)
No matter what I do, how hard I (Try)
I can't seem to convince myself (Why)
I'm stuck on the outside
Don't you (Know?)
I can't tell you how to make it (Go)
No matter what I do, how hard I (Try)
I can't seem to convince myself (Why)
I'm stuck on the outside
I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in
I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking...
Wake up every morning
In the breaking heart of town
On the half of couch
I can't be bothered to fold down
Here's the thought that gets me
Out of bed and to the bong
What if when I said
I could do better I was wrong?
'Cause there's no one for me
No one for me
And lonely's such an awful thing to be
Every night before I sleep
I wish upon a star
Someday that I might see things
The way they truly are
Here's the thought that gets me
Out of bed and to the bar
Running out of safety nets
And you're the best so far
And there's no one for me
No one for me
And lonely's such an awful thing to be
We could start all over
And pretend we're meeting cute
Skip the idle chatter
And the ritual pursuit
Here's the thought that gets me
From the bar on to the floor
Could've been the one true love
I learned to settle for
But there's no one for me
No one for me
And lonely's such an awful thing to be
You talk to me like I am something more
Something more than I am and I am afraid
I'm afraid that I can't live up to your expectations
I need your wars body in my arms
In my arms and I will never set you free, set your free
I love you, oh, I love you almost too such
Do you know that I exist for you alone? You alone
And do you know that you are saving me
From all the evil I possess? It's almost too much
Wired on the slam of crank
Don't you hang up the phone!
Internal conflict riddles my brain
Think I'll blow my head off
Wired with a meth cook
9 mm inoculation
Lift me higher take my breath
Who'll deliver me from this body of death?
Using me up to the bitter end
Using me up to the bitter end
Death is naked before God
Destruction lies uncovered
Brings all things to the light
Over and over and over
Paranoid and lab aware
Butane Tunnel Red phosphorous glow
Fist full of bees watch the children change
Don't anybody speak English in the grave
When you come to collect my body
Watch for the trip wires cyanide loaded
Cristina baby I'm sittin' on a bomb
I'm the Crypto boy in the mutant mob
Using me up to the bitter end
Using me up to the bitter end
Death is naked before God
Destruction lies uncovered
Brings all things to the light
Over and over and over
How do you like me now?
Bet you wish you stayed near the cross
As long as I have life in me
Got to get off that movie star stuff
Wired on the slam of crank
Don't you hang up the phone!
Internal conflict riddles my brain
Think I'll blow my head off
Using me up to the bitter end
Using me up to the bitter end
I'm a God with spoon and syringe This is where the pain ascends
I'm a God with spoon and syringe The world of darkness where death begins
I'm a God with spoon and syringe Chalk one up and let's pretend
I'm a God with spoon and syringe Oh' sweet Jesus be my friend
No body's getting in, nobodies getting' out
We got a live bomb and were going to blow the house
AK-47 thanks be to Kalashnikov
Bang, bang bang and were going to get off
Ghetto bird be flying heat wave to bail out
Somebody get the bank cause the berries round about
One last blast then we'll gauge hardcore
Everybody lights out like a Nyquil score
We going to knuckle up cause the Jakes bring war
Cause the wrecking crew come knock'n down the door
Following the cloud for foo foo stuff
It ain't no secret we be headin' for a bust
Whose that humming upon my blindside
Better drop the sack chaser only there for the ride
Somebody getting' killed from that sewer in her vein
She was a thirst monster now she's gothic insane
How can I reveal Jesus livin' in me?
How can I reveal?
Can't take another dusting cause the egg is going to crack
Devil's got dandruff got her nose to the grind
She's in the boneyard with the dead presidents
Somebody get a shovel and find out where she went
If she's with the funky drummer we need an exorcist
GTA---MPV Alpine bliss.
She says OH Sweet Jesus don't need no Holy Oil
Been a bumrush dreamer while taking her stroll
Her author babysat with a B-40 lit.
Show and prove no grease couldn't scrap a lick
I know the the PJ's the plats and the plays
'Cause I met'm in Sweden right behind the stage
63 Impala speckled for explosion
Dippin' to the get off house, three wheel motion
Top Fuel buck 50 with a finger on the trigger
Hop on the side of the free world grave diggers
How can I reveal Jesus livin' in me?
How can I reveal?
Kick Artist jump the knocker nothing but a shife
He ain't no trill he just quacking 'bout a knife
Junkie give me just a minute to make a long story short
Widow makers zeroed at the basketball court
No body had been capped no body had been killed
And in the end there was no blood spilled
Chillin' with the clique got the mad hops jaming
Psychin' out the gangstas with the base line slamin
Who is that punk with the three point shot?
It's the reverend from the church sultan of swish and swat
He had come correct he was reel to reel
He had been redrum in his past life devil
Now he be preachin' to get men saved
The Word stopped the game they begin to pray
Down on their knees at the half court line
They accepted Jesus for they ran out of time
How can I reveal Jesus livin' in me?
How can I reveal?
Get down for me,
He died as me
Get down for me,
He died as me
Get down for me,
He died as me
Get down for me,
He died as me
Get down for me,
He died as me
Get down for me,
He died as me
Get down for me,
He died as me
Get down for me,
He died as me
Voting doesn't work, 1-2-3
It's time you know your enemy
I won't pledge allegiance to hypocrisy
Your democracy, is not for me
So when we try to change this place
Courtroom pulls an about face
Fantasies of the master race
Our elections they erase
See once upon a time we were all free
When we lived in tribal societies
Peace, peace and harmony
And everything for the good of family
Yeah cancer people can't smoke weed
People voted to be free
But the fascist rule decree
Pigs arresting you and me
Voting doesn't work. why?
When they don't like what we say, then they stop it in the courts

President this, president that
Represent the ruling class
One says this (this) one says that (that)
Sounds the same, what choice is that
See, voting doesn't work 1-2-3
Coming from the nation of the Cherokee
How can you choose when you don't have a choice
How can you choose when you don't have a voice
Yeah, interest games, their interest rates
Secret power fueled by hate (hate)
Fear for cash
Cash for fear
Greenspan is the ruler here
Yeah, a pig is a pig
And they took it away
And I don't give a fuck about the things they say
It don't mean shit to me
Voting doesn't work it's easy to see that
Voting doesn't work. why?
When they don't like what we say, then they stop it in the courts

When they don't like what we say, then they stop it in the courts
Voting doesn't work I have seen
Along with piles of broken treaties
Your reality produces poverty, spiritually in a nation of greed
Well, who is working, who is not
Think votes count, well I think not
Doesn't matter what we say
Things will always go their way
Power to the people is just a fantasy
And they sell to us as an American dream
Power to the people is just a fantasy
And they sell to us as an American dream
Well your vote counts 1-2-3
Living in democracy
Everybody here is free
'Cause it's built for you and it's built for me
Voting doesn't work, why
When they don't like what we say they stop it in the courts

I been wounded by ambition
Promised the impossible dream
Lied to me with pen and ink
Criticized for ministry
Reach out for the lost Manipulated
By my friends
The heart is desperately wicked
Who are the Born Again?

Incarcerated in mortality
Until we give up the ghost
Languishing over morality
The flesh we love the most
The soul incased in prison
Encircled within our minds
The conscience strains to listen
The ticking hands of time
Expression, confession I can't wait
War
Expression, confession I can't wait
War
Incriminated abandoned
Upon the blasted plains
Without hope in this life
God in the flesh came
Justice and the law
Established to condemn
Holy Spirit sent
To convict the heart of sin
Expression, confession I can't wait
War
Expression, confession I can't wait
War
I swear you live your life
Like your going to live forever
Actions of a natural man
We all meet there together
I never put any faith in this life
And the countdown begins
The Day turns to Night
Voices from the earth
Say don't come to this place
Don't come to this place
Don't come to this place
Expression, confession I can't wait
Fifty ways and maybe more,
To the tree of life to come up short
The narrow road is the way go
In a trumped up 70 Super Sport
Truth and lies has consequence
Depending upon ones competence
The fearful losses confidence
The world sees no difference
Come home from the California sunshine
Recycled Angel tears
Flat blues in the headlights
Back breakers Don't Come back here
Come home from the California sunshine
Recycled Angel tears
Flat blues in the headlights
Back breakers Don't Come back here
And it makes little sense
To suffer through the politics
No one drank the new wine
Flushed in their list of crimes
Time for me to elaborate
The good and bad will separate
You heard about the judgement day
I hope you don't miscalculate
Come home from the California sunshine
Recycled Angel tears
Flat blues in the headlights
Back breakers Don't Come back here
Come home from the California sunshine
Recycled Angel tears
Flat blues in the headlights
Back breakers Don't Come back here
Come home from the California sunshine
Recycled Angel tears
Flat blues in the headlights
Back breakers Don't Come back here
Come home from the California sunshine
Recycled Angel tears
Flat blues in the headlights
Back breakers Don't Come back here

Once, once is really something twice
It's just a tease for a little more
One more time I've gotta ask you
Come over here 'cause I got something I'd like to say
Once, once is real easy then
Twice, your just begging for a little more
One more time I've gotta ask you, come over here
'Cause I've got something I've gotta say
It may seem easy for you to penetrate what you
Intend to deny, but when it comes back around
Is death the only way to get attention?
Once, once is real early but twice came back
And it got a little rough,
And there I stand in the middle, and I was
By myself like before,
Yeah once, once is real conniving, it's easy now,
When your conniving with me.
You step in my way, well now I have a little more to say.
It may seem easy for you to recognize
What you intend to ignore, but when it cuts back round,
Well death is a sick way for attention
I think there's a little more to be said.
They cut the cord, it cuts everything that's living in me,
Well it all dies anyway
I thought that that might disappear but you penetrate
The will to deny and I'm standing in the dark all over again,
Oh lie on me, that's all I want is you to lie on me,
Why did I see the birds an the sidewalk today,
Split open inside and why do I hear the birds when they're
Squawking over my head, don't let me down
Don't come down on me,
'Cause I just want to know, I need just a little
More time to explain myself.
Once, once is real easy, then twice,
*
Just ??? for a little more.
*
One more time I've gotta ask you,
Come over here, sit down, I've got somethin'
That's just begging to get out
Once, once is real conniving,
And twice, you're just begging for a little more
One more time, I'm gonna need you, I can tell
It may seem easy for you to penetrate
Your will to ignore, but when it cuts back round
Death is the sickest way for attention.
I wasn't ready for this
It isn't something you'd miss
I'm gonna spit every word
So that my hate can be heard
It's for the M.B.L.A.
I wish them cancerous decay
That puts an end to their days
You know I wish them all
Dead
I wish them all dead
You know these fucks have the balls
To use municipal halls
To bring their shit into light
It's time to pick up a knife
Or any weapon you like
To put an end to their lives
Pick on someone your own size!
You know I wish them all
Dead
I wish them all dead
Go
Go find relief in your graves
Yours are not lives I would save
What will they ask of us next?
You know I wish them all 
Dead
I wish them all dead
You know I wish them all dead
You know I wish them all dead
Go
(Oh my god, someone kill me.)
Keep looking for some thing sweet,
By the way your the one I need
Tell me you got a place to go,
I'm thinking your the one to know.
Not going, let's do it,
Get it on we gotta make some magic.
You walking, I'll look at,
Get it on you gotta let me have it
Uh-ha your give it all yet
Nu-uh not stopping now
Take it easy, take it hard
Feel my with for I am the dark
Heads up but your pants are down,
Had a girl but you came around
Not leaving, not talking
Get it on you gotta nu-uh
We're going, let's do it,
Get it on we gotta make some magic
Uh-ha your give it all yet,
Nu-uh not stopping now,
Uh-ha I got my mindset,
Nu-uh 'cause I know how
There are things I got, there are things you're not (repeat)
Wanted by the U.S. Government.
The lord god almighty, creator of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen.
For the creation and cultivation of the plant marijuana on the planet earth.
It is a plant, not a demon.
It is a teacher, it is a healer
Roots within our mother's skin
One who gives freely.
Who are you, so full of lies?
I am human, I'm alive.
Who are you to dictate rights?
What you see is not our sight.
God made it, men use it, governments put people in cages for it.
Shiny green, above to sky,
I see her and she looks so nice.
I feel her, and I ask you why?
Who are you to dictate rights?
Who are you, so full of lies?
I am human, I'm alive.
Who are you to dictate rights?
What you see is not our sight.
God made it, men use it, governments put people in cages for it.
Wanted by the U.S. Government
The lord god almighty
Creator of heaven and earth
Of all that is seen and unseen
For the creation and cultivation of the plant
Marijuana on the planet earth
Once upon a time, there was an unseen field of energy spun into form by
The higher one, the creator, everything has a purpose and everything was
Inter-connected. Then one day one of the created decided to question the
Integrity of the creator, and question the interconnectedness, and
Question the purpose, it was a very sad day.
I know you like me 
I know you do
That's why when I come around
She's all over you
And I know you want me too
It's easy to see
And in the back of your mind
You know you should be on with me
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha?
Don't cha, baby? Don't cha?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha?
Don't cha, baby? Don't cha?
Fight the feeling
Leave it alone
'Cause if it ain't love
It just ain't enough to leave my happy home
Let's keep it friendly
You have to play fair
See I don't care but I know
She ain't gonna wanna share
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha, baby? Don't Cha?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha?
Don't cha, baby? Don't cha?
I know she loves you
I understand
I'd probably be just as crazy about you
If you were my own man
Maybe next lifetime
Possibly
Until then old friend
Let's just see if you can hang with me
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha?
Don't cha, baby? Don't Cha?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha?
Don't cha, baby? Don't Cha?
The fence is long and high where we love
You can't see the other side where they live
I've spied with my little eye
And I've sighed with my little sigh
But it seems I've given all that I can give
Every hour I have to count to ten
And a thousand times I've thought again
But it seems I've given all that I can give
Is there anyone there
Here is the fence that they built {Over there}
This is the fence that hate built
Is anyone there {Over there}
This is the fence that turns one into two
I want to break through but I'm though if I do
I've tried with my little try
And I've cried with my little cry
But it seems that the gate holds the only clue
Every hour I have to count to ten
And a thousand times I've thought again
But it seems I've given all that I can give
Is there anyone there
Here is the fence that they built {Over there}
This is the fence that hate built
Is anyone there {Over there}
(Brilliant Solo From "Stan the Man")
Every hour I have to count to ten
And a thousand times I've thought again
Is there anyone there
Here is the fence that they built {Over there}
This is the fence that hate built
Is anyone there {Over there}
Is there anyone there
Here is the fence that they built {Over there}
This is the fence that hate built
Is anyone there {Over there}
But it seems I've given all that I can give
Is there anyone there
Here is the fence that they built {Over there}
This is the fence that hate built
Is anyone there {Over there}
We livin' in a mean time and an aggressive time
A painful time, a time where cynicism rots the vine
In a time where violence blocks the summer shine
Lifetimes, go by in a flash
In the search for love, in the search for cash
Everybody wanna be some fat tycoon
Everybode wanna be on a tropic honeymoon
Nobody wanna sing a little bit out of tune
Or be the backbone of a rebel platoon
It's too soon to step out of line
You might get laughed at you might get fined
But do you fear me when I say I feel pain everyday
When I see the way my friends gotta slave
And never get ahead of bills they gotta pay
No way no way!
Some make a living doing killing Colombian penicillin
Some are willing to play the villain they just chillin'
To pass the time, pass the information
Or pass the wine
Pass the buck or pass the baton
But you can't pass the police or the pentagon
The I.R.S. or the upper echelon
I think it's time to make a move on the contradiction
Bom-Bom, rock the nation
Take over television and radio station
Bom-Bom the truth shall come
Give the corporation some complication!
This is the dawning of our time I say it one more time
To emphasize the meaning of my rhyme
To rise above all the dirt and grime
Add the right spice at the right time
Fuck the constitution
Are we part of the solution or are we part of the pollution
Sittin' by and wonderin' why,
Things ain't the way we like to find them to be, to be
For you and for me the people over there and the ones in between
Check our habitation are we a peace lovin' nation
Peace lovin' nation
I have a reasonable doubt I think I'll just spell it out
There's no need to scream or to shout
The N.R.A. just bought a man's soul
Then he jumps up and shouts gun control
The government says that killin's a sin
Unless you kill a murderer with a lethal syringe
So I ask again "are we peace lover's then"
Some of them slang guns when they six years old
Some of them end up in some six foot hole
This whole damn place seems to, lost control
So I raise my voice before I lose my soul
This is the way I'll express my feelings
Vibe revealed and revolved spinnin on a record y'all
Try to confiscate take what I communicate with
It's ancient gift of the lip steady creating
Activating passion vocal vibrations to the blind plus the seeing
Human doesn't mean just being
Be coming don't believe it just belife it
Belongings or beloved rehearse it or recite it
While shining drop your guns and move your tongues
Battle motivation in no time lyrics come
Sometimes fun others run their mouth or away
My mind comes beaming like an early sunray
One day we'll get the picture and all combine
Less the talking bout mines is mine and become one mind
Every piece of the puzzle has its place
To build the piece of the puzzle called the human race
Taking it long enough we crush the formal journalistic
Dyslexic critters talk backwards to rap words
I'm sure raising my hands with questions and demands
Statements and a plan with a map of the land
They say it's coming
Do you know when?
I've got sympathy
But then again
All of my thoughts
Are closing in
They might be wrong
They might begin
They might begin
And in the morning
It's drying out
I've heard stories
But what about?
Is it my fault
You're not around?
Did I fuck up?
Did I let you down?
Did I let you down?
Did I let you...
They says it's coming
Do you know when?
I've got sympathy
But then again
All of my thoughts
Are turning 'round
Did I fuck up?
Did I let you down?
Did I let you down? (x7)
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Can I get an encore
Do you want more
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for (Chester)
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
Get em Jay
(Jay-Z)
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin' me rap is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him with
Cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS
Can I get an encore
Do you want more
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for (Chester)
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
Now what the hell are you waitin' for (Chester)
(Jay-Z)
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea, yea)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearin' the 4-5
It ain't to play games witchu
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereeens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing (Mike))
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So muh'fucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore
(Chester)
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the under toe, just caught in the undertow) (Mike)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the under toe, just caught in the undertow) (Mike)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you
Become so numb
(Mike, Jay-Z)
Can I get an encore
Do you want more (more, more, more)
I've become so numb
(Mike, Jay-Z)
One last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar
Flyin down the highway fast lane throw away
Thought she had an inn there she's a stowaway
Comatose emotion overdose
She's comatose dead on 'er feet victim of sin
Comatose emotional od trapped in machinery
Comatose wanna get out wanna get in
Been loved to lied to been a bride to a death wish
Picked up thrown down used abused and not even missed
Burned out turned out lookin' for a handout no use
Streetwise paid the price never enough nothin' to lose
Comatose emotion overdose the girls
Comatose dead on 'er feet needin release
Comatose emotional od lost in misery
Comatose gotta get out gotta get in
Hair trigger reflex heart full of defects
Everybody knows she's the number one suspect
Can't face facts needs a way back
No doubt girls all out of whack
Girls on a free ride to an open grave
Head on the handrail feet can't reach the brake
Somethin' gotta come down gotta change now
Gotta break break through somehow
Comatose emotion overdose the girls
Comatose dead on er feet needin release
She's comatose emotional od lost in misery
Comatose gotta get out gotta get in
Comatose, comatose
I am the assassin, with tongue forged from eloquence 
I am the assassin, providing your nemesis 
On the sacrificial altar to success, my friend
Unleash a stranger from a kiss, my friend
No incantations of remorse, my friend
Unsheathe the blade within the voice, my friend
Who decorates the scarf with the fugi knot 
Who camouflaged emotion in a thousand yard stare
Who gouged the notches from the family tree 
Who hypnotised the guilt in career rhythm trance
Assassing, assassing, assassing, assassing
Listen as the syllables of slaughter cut with calm precision 
Patterned frosty phrases rape your ears and sow the ice incision  
Adjectives of annihilation bury the point beyond redemption 
Venomous verbs of ruthless candour plagiarise assassins fervour 
Apocalyptic alphabet casting spell the creed of tempered diction
A friend in need is a friend that bleeds
Let bitter silence infect the wound
You were a sentimental mercenary in a free fire zone 
Parading a Hollywood conscience 
You were a fashionable objector with a uniform fetish
Pavlovian slaver at the cash till ring of success 
A non com observer - I assassin the collector - defector 
So you resigned yourself to failure, my friend
And I emerged the chilling stranger, my friend
To eradicate the problem, my friend
Unsheathe the blade within the voice
I am the assassin
I am the assassin
And what do you call assassins who accuse assassins anyway, my friend?
Process me, produce the proper symmetry to put me in charge of reinventing the mute. Put me in party to the scheduled lie and give me your right hand but live by your left, make me murder every mountain and remove every paradise
There are evil voices in my head
(They tell me the improbable arithmetic of closing my eyes and counting the cards (keep 'em busy by counting the cards))
See how this wears me out? How close am I (now) to another dull mystery: are we the graveyard or the ghost? I have a motive. My motivations are a matter of fault--all your fault
There are evil voices in my head
They say, "You're wrong" again. Every bit as wrong as you were before, when you first divined your word for love, now you wear it on your tongue, saturate your lips and kiss someone. You're beautiful
Poison, be my guide. Prepare me for my proudest work: prostitute for my bride. Nothing'll heal me but the severed limb, nothing will cure me like the cancer borne. Fail me, fail, fail me fail me not, I suffer every eager infection
There are evil voices in my head
They say, "You're wrong" again. Every bit as wrong as you were before, when you first divined your word for love, now you wear it on your tongue, saturate your lips and kiss someone. You're beautiful
Cut my skin, it makes me human
Scorn your mind
Just feel the pain
'Cause it's what makes us human
It keeps us all the same
You lose your head on your chosen trip
The sight of your blood will lose your spit
And a broken heart will turn to sin
But when the wound is open
We're all the same
Cut my skin, it makes me human
Scorn your mind
Just feel the pain
When you're lookin' at pain you're lookin' at truth
Nothin' like pain to make us all the same
I see you each day get up nine-to-five
You rush in a game of lies for need
But you enver seem to recognize
You're no better or worse than me
I dare you once just to make it hurt
How many times can you race around
With the world running faster faster then...
I never expect to catch up
Cut my skin, it makes me human
Scorn your mind
Just feel the pain
When you're lookin' at pain you're lookin' at truth
Nothin' like pain to make us all the same
Ah yeah
Cut my skin, it makes me human
Scorn your mind
Just feel the pain
'Cause it's what makes us human
It keeps us all the same
You lose your head on your chosen trip
The sight of your blood will lose your spit
And a broken heart will turn to sin
But when the wound is open
You're all the fuckin' same
Cut my skin it makes me human
Scorn your mind well just feel the blow
'Cause when you're lookin' at pain you're lookin' at truth
Nothin' like pain to keep us all the same
Cut my skin, it makes me human
Scorn your mind
Just feel the pain
'Cause it's what makes us human
It keeps us all the same
Candles burning
Incense lit
I put you on a shrine
An altar
You made this little hell I love
You wore that cross so well
I want you
I will have you
Just to possess
We are all sick...
Things done at night
My skin cold as ice
Tampering with our spirits
They're tampering with our minds
We realize, we realize
That we know our kind
A little love rhyme...
A little love crime
Die for me
I would die for you
My pretty little thing
Androgynous
All dressed in your black
You know what drives me
We are all crazy
Smoke swirls
The many images of your pleasures
I'm grinning at the breaking
Of your spirit
Come
My body's numb

About the mess your clothes made
Who will love you when I'm gone?
Only the righteous kiss those lips
Too much guessing, too much "need to believe" 
This is madness!
(Madness!)
Why should I suffer when I can't see your eyes?
Whose truth is your truth?
What brain can you pick?
What bones?
This is madness!
When did living start being a sin?
If this is today - well, what the fuck's tomorrow?
Whose fashion is your fashion?
What passion can you buy?
When you know God is dead
And you are God?
This is madness!
Introducing the reverend Hellacious Boom Boom! So good of you to come, I call on the priests, the saints, the dancin' girls and the God-damned reprobates! Our decisions must be final, restoration is impossible. To the ignorant members of the misguided populace, book ends to nothing! Good times on bad times, free us of the modern idiot, cast away the bogey men, detonate your hate bombs! Pick your victims! But take good care of yourselves... Hallelujah!
I have seen every mountain I'm expected to
Climb, but they're not mine.
I have seen everything in this light before,
Change every light bulb in the house.
I have heard, I have listened, I have
Understood for my own good?
I have seen everything in this light before,
Change every light bulb in the house.
Caught looking at the man in the mirror
Well, he doesn't want to look back
He wants too turn his back on your sorry face, and run away with someone else's reflection
Haven't you had enough? have you come back for more? return to that plane of glass to remember what you look like and remember that you don't like what you see
On the otherside, things are simple
There's no such thing as passions or wants or desires
There's no such thing as space or time
If only things were that simple here
Bind, torture and kill
So pretty, so frail
I watch your body turning pale
So fragile, so weak
I didn't want to be this creep
Soul stripper, soul ripper
I bind her legs, excruciate her
Start bleeding, stop breathing
I take your life, I am defeating
Bind, torture and kill
So pretty, so frail
I watch your body turning pale
So fragile, so weak
I didn't want to be this creep
Soul stripper, soul ripper
I bind her legs, excruciate her
Start bleeding, stop breathing
I take your life, I am defeating
Bind, torture and kill
If you thought that I was afraid, well have no doubts. The trouble is, you cannot figure me out. And you've too many reasons--you want to know my dis-ease, huh? Well, that's just the nature of fools (that is the prize for the rules): get me to report, but never recognize
Keep killin' me baby, put your feelings aside, keep solving me slow with your skin, tell me, who am I?
You'll never really ever get enough and you broke my heart. But I'm weakest when I am up and you have always owned the weakest part of me. And you've too many reasons-- you want to know my dis-ease, huh? Well that's just the nature of fools (that is the prize for the rules): get me to report, but never recognize
Keep killin' me baby, put your feelings aside, keep solving me slow with your skin, tell me, who am I?
I'm not ready, but have I gone too far? Get stuck in a lie and all you'll hear is "let it go away"
They smiled so much and waved their flags
As she saluted to the military band
Most of the people failed to see
She had a broken bottle in the other hand
And she took them by surprise
When she took them by the throat
And said "My friend you're not allowed to vote"
But they shook it all off
With a nervous laugh and cough
"Next time," she said "I'll let those people choke"
The people who grinned themselves to death
Smiled so much they failed to take a breath
And even when their kids were starving
They all thought the queen was charming
She polished all upon the wall
And ran her hands right through her hair
So if the lady took the time to call
All the houses on the street would not compare
And she thought it really funny
That she hadn't any money
But those she looked up to, they had
But they shook it all off
With a nervous laugh and cough
And when they took her riches it was sad
The people who grinned themselves to death
Smiled so much they failed to take a breath
And even when their kids were starving
They all thought the queen was charming
Midwest love affair, I bend when I am bored
Late-night-liquor-blue will lead me to the floor
Can we fake it, can we make-believe?
I'm so full of love it deeply sickens me
But all I could do was close my eyes and cross my arms and hope to die
'Cause you don't fucking listen when I'm around
The least you could do is take it back, all the vicious remarks and verbal attacks
'Cause I can't fucking stand it when you're around
Midwest aftermath, the rumors start to rise
Did I truly do the things that you've described?
They must hate me, every single one
It just sickens them what I consider fun
But all I could do was close my eyes and cross my arms and hope to die
'Cause you don't fucking listen when I'm around
The least you could do is take it back, all the vicious remarks and verbal attacks
'Cause I can't fucking stand it when you're around
But all I could do was close my eyes and cross my arms and hope to die
'Cause you don't fucking listen when I'm around
The least you could do is take it back, all the vicious remarks and verbal attacks
'Cause I can't fucking stand it when you're around
No, I can't fucking stand it
When you're around
No, I can't fucking stand it
When you're around
There's a base viciousness that nourishes my spine
There's a deep wickedness that makes me your strychnine
Do you know you are a filthy thing?
Throw yourself upon my mercy
Throw yourself at my feet
Show me where you cut yourself
I wanna see you when you bleed
Do you know you are a filthy thing?
Throw yourself upon my altar
Throw yourself at my fur
Show me where the needles punctured
I wanna see you when you're high
When the wizard said
Poison their well
I smiled
I am so corrupt (I am so)
I am so corrupt (I am so)
I am so corrupt (I am so)
I am so corrupt
Do you know you are a filthy thing?
Do you know you are a filthy thing?
I wanna see you when you bleed
I wanna see you when you're high
When the wizard said
Poison their well
I said
Purify the dirty things
Just leave me one
Purify the dirty things
Just leave me one to play with
Wash away the dirty things
Just leave me one
Wash away the filthy things
Just leave me one filthy one
Just leave me one to defile myself with
Do you know you are a filthy thing?
I am so corrupt (I am so)
I am so corrupt (I am so)
I am so corrupt (I am so)
I am so corrupt
I am so corrupt (I am so)
I am so corrupt (I am so)
I am so corrupt (I am so)
I am so corrupt
There's a base viciousness that nourishes my spine
There's a deep wickedness that makes me your strychnine
There's a base viciousness that nourishes my spine
I'm a deep wickedness, I am your strychnine
Do you know you are a filthy thing?
Do you know you are a filthy thing?
They drill them to the ground,
They take away their rights,
They're making martyrs out of little children.
Give a kid a gun, take away her Mum,
They teach them how to kill when they hunger.
Kill that man, kill that girl, kill anyone you want today.
Blood is on the ground, they're shooting all around,
They got an army bigger than D-day.
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go.
We're living in a time where loving is so hard,
I can't even help my little brother,
But silence is a crime when someone needs your help,
GOD have mercy on me today.
War is money, war is power,
Blood is the river of the century.
Leave them now, let them go,
Set all the children free!
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go.
This song is also dedicated to all the kids living in this society
Who are being deprived of their basis rights,
The right to a peaceful home,
The right to an education,
The right to innocence,
The right to health and food,
To love and to be loved,
The right to a joyful youth.
And my heart goes out especially to my nephews
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go.
I grip my mind around an existence of liquid
That seems to invade my lungs and mind like salt.
I hold on
Losing ground to the things that matter
Over contemplating all this scatter.
That blurs like an answering machine
That won't pick up
And the fax fucking rings and rings
Hyperventilating in my ego
Can't find a libido
There's nothing more than this block
That somehow sucks me in again.
Can't you see that
I have a problem with reality
Can't you hear me
I keep calling but nobody listens
Can't you feel me
I keep clawing from the inside
Can't you hear me
I keep calling but nobody hears me.
All these contemplations, and then I reaching... I
Everything is pulled into you.
I want to rewind every frame from this moment.
I can't believe that I'm drowning.
Falling down...
All this water...
You can look but you can't touch
I don't think I like you much
Heaven knows what a girl can do
Heaven knows what you've got to prove
I think I'm paranoid
And complicated
I think I'm paranoid
Manipulated
Bend me, break me, any way you need me
All I want is you
Bend me, break me, breaking down is easy
All I want is you
I fall down just to give you a thrill
Prop me up with another pill
If I should fail, if I should fold
I nailed my faith to the sticking pole
I think I'm paranoid
Manipulated
I think I'm paranoid
And complicated
Bend me, break me, any way you need me
All I want is you
Bend me, break me, breaking down is easy
All I want is you
I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid
Bend me, break me, any way you need me
All I want is you
Bend me, break me, breaking down is easy
All I want is you
Steal me, deal me, any way you heal me
Maim me, tame me, you can never change me
Love me, like me, come ahead and fight me
Please me, tease me, go ahead and leave me
Bend me, break me, any way you need me
As long as I want you, baby, it's all right
Bend me, break me, any way you need me
As long as I want you, baby, it's all right
He set up a man of straw with an authoritarian aura 
And everybody thinks he's some kind of warrior for the Lord 
Stepping on some toes that he does not know 
And calling down fire on what he don't understand 
Straw men, straw men 
Set them up for a fall when you can 
Straw men, straw men 
Everybody loves to knock down straw men 
He sees the masses dancing so he sternly reprimands them 
A reduction of their stance to some kind of earthly hell 
He don't know how to be tender can't appreciate beauty or gender 
It's this pious anhedonia that he loves so well 
Straw men, straw men 
Set them up for a fall when you can 
Straw men, straw men 
Everybody loves to knockdown straw men 
If true communication were ever to bless this congregation 
And everyone knew just what it's like to be somebody else 
And no words were hasty and all thoughts were thought through 
Might our anger not find a better target than ourselves? 
Straw men, straw men 
Set them up for a fall when you can 
Straw men, straw men 
Everybody loves to knock down straw men
You see me drinkin' there every night
Because I'm awful and the mood is right
You'll come and go but I'm a permanent sight
Pretty Baby, don't you start a fight
I get home and it's the same old sound
Drunk again and all the lights are down
I'm feelin' Pretty Baby, don't you shout
That's right woman, let your guard down
Go ahead! Walk away
Just watch out what you say
'Cause I don't need new problems today
And I got a habit of gettin' my way
Take your time coming back
If you should leave, well that's a drag
'Cause I'm in no mood to hold back
I'll be here, you'll be exactly the same
You know I'm sorry darlin' don't you cry
But morning's coming and my sleight is dry
Believe me Pretty Baby, I don't lie
I'll take it easier next time
Life's not easy being dealt this hand
I don't complain and I don't take a stand
But you, you're nothing, you just need a dad
I just want a Pretty Baby to be her man
Go ahead! Walk away
Just watch out what you say
'Cause I don't need new problems today
And I got a habit of gettin' my way
Take your time coming back
If you should leave, well that's a drag
'Cause I'm in no mood to hold back
I'll be here, you'll be exactly the same
And she's shakin', breathless, holds her tongue
But I'll be right before I'm done!
Go ahead! Walk away
Just watch out what you say
'Cause I don't need new problems today
And I got a habit of gettin' away
Take your time coming back
If you should leave, well that's a drag
'Cause I'm in no mood to hold back
You'll be here, I'll be exactly the same
Too much complainin' gotta fix my head
My temper's burnin' and my face is red
My hands look Pretty Baby 'round your neck
But you'd look even better in my bed
My heart is empty and my head is wild
I'm spinnin', fixin' for a real rough time
She says, "Now wait a minute, I'm with child!"
Well it's a Pretty Baby, I don't really mind
Go ahead! Say your peace
Just make sure before you leave
That there ain't no more breath in me
If I ain't dead, well then you're soon to be
And Take your time, before you judge
'Cause she came back. She claimed love
I never asked her not to run
And I never bought all that shit on love anyway
The tears still fall
The birds still sing
And life is bittersweet
With a schizophrenic ring
The sun still shines
The darkness still falls
We must see both
If we see them at all
Schizophrenia
Beauty and the beast
Man from dust to dust
The best among the worst
Schizophrenia
Gazing on the stars
And walking in the dust
Schizophrenia
So much to love
So much to hate
So much to represent
With chalk and slate
We see the expression
Of the original face
And the mask that hides it
We're a schizophrenic race
The one-eyed man
Still has one good eye
Blind man must have something
He can be thankful for
And the sweetest child
Still carries scars
From the ancient collapse
In the falling of stars
Long ago
Just like the hearse, you
Died to get in again
We are
So far from you
Burnin' on
Just like a match, you
Strike to incinerate
The lives
Of everyone you know
And what's the worst to take
(Worst you take)
From every heart you break?
(Heart you break)
And like a blade you stain
(Blade you stain)
Well I've been holdin' on tonight
What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Came a time
When every star fall
Brought you to tears again
We are
The very hurt you sold
And what's the worst you take?
(Worst you take)
From every heart you break?
(Heart you break)
And like a blade you stain
(Blade you stain)
Well I've been holdin' on tonight
What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend?
To leave, and then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide
What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
So I wanna be a member and I wanna be a name
And I wanna be a local face and play the social game
Dancing through a time warp in your dinosaur trends
The limit of your mind is what they're counting on all ends
Listen to the media present it as a fact
Fall in your orders 'cause you don't know how to act
Travel on estranged 'cause you don't know your own way
They'll get you in the end then you'll pay
'Cause o.c. life is not the life for me
Stupid little chicks and, egotistic boys
O.c. life is not the life so free
Pressures on my back
And artificial joys ... for you girls and boys
Wanna be a member, wanna have some fame
Fighting to stay ahead a part of the game
Combat authority but don't get out of line
Or they'll put you in the slammer you'll be doing some time
714 tattooed on my head
I find myself labeled that I'm a victim instead
I fight all the rules I don't see the way
I'd rather be dead then pay the price that they say
'Cause o.c. life is not the life for me
Stupid little girls and egotistic boys
O.c. life is not the life for free
Pressures on my back
And artificial joys ... for you girls and boys
Put the plastic back in the machine
(Intro: L-Boy)
Let me tell y'all niggas a little motherfuckin' story real quick
Once upon a time, there was this group of dusty ass motherfuckers
Create a little group for themselves, they call themselves Odd Future
The motherfuckers made a motherfucking tape, Odd Future Tape Volume 2
You know, that ugly ass nigga Tyler with his bitch ass
I should fuck that nigga up when I see him
Nappy ass hair
Left Brain, that nigga ugly as fuck, big ass nose
Syd gay ass, puttin' her clit on other bitches nipples and shit whatnot
Matt big ass, big ass nigga with some small ass earrings, bald
Mike G, crusty ass
My nigga Earl ugly as fuck, let's have a moment of silence for that nigga real quick
Fuck silence, fuck that
My nigga Jasper, dirty fatass, that nigga boxers stink
My nigga Frank. Fuck, fuck Frank, nigga, fuck him
Taco, oh, young bitch ass, I should, I, fuck, I hate all these niggas
And you know, that little short gay light-skinned nigga and that fatass nigga Domo
Let me just...
I take one step forward
But then I take two steps back
What is it that, what is it that I lack
I just can't get my head straight
I just can't get my life straight
One foot in heaven
But I got one foot in hell
Sometimes I just, I just can't tell
I just can't get my head straight
I just can't get, my life straight
This dark hole, is so deep
This dark hole, is so deep
Oh oh uh ohuhoh
Oh oh uh ohohoh
I feel like I'm on the edge
Just about to fall down
I feel like I'm on the edge
The edge of happiness
The edge of happiness
Do I need therapy, or do I need a good kick in the ass
Do I need prayer, I've got too many things to ask
I just can't get my head straight
I just can't get my life straight
This dark hole, is so deep
This dark hole, is so deep
Oh oh uh ohuhoh
Oh oh uh ohohoh
I feel like I'm on the edge
Just about to fall down
I feel like I'm on the edge
The edge of happiness
The edge of happiness
Where am I going? Where have I been?
I've been out searching, won't someone let me in?
I am listening, listening to the wind
My mind is focused, my thoughts are disciplined
Is there more to this than I can comprehend?
Simply reality, my dearest friend
Life is for the living, love is for the giving
Time is worth taking, love is worth making
Where am I going? Where have I been?
I've been out searching, won't someone let me in
Life, love, time, love
Life is for the living, love is for the giving
Time is worth taking, love is worth making
Unbreakable, unbreakable, unbreakable
I've got you trapped under my claws
There's no escape now
You know that I'm not ruled by laws
You made me suffer for so long
But now I'm laughing
I'm gonna force you to bend
Bring in the pain
Bring in the pain
Drinking coffee from a cup three days old
Looking for an antibody, toxin a miracle drug
The life inside has lost human rights
It's a legal crime it's an issue of life 
It's the beginning of the end
It's the beginning of the end
WHAT? Your body is the temple (Everybody listen got to tell you something)
WHAT? You are not your own (Everybody listen got to tell you something)
HOPE! Maketh not ashamed (Everybody listen got to tell you something)
I KNOW! For He dwells in me (Everybody listen got to tell you something)

WHAT? You are not your own (Everybody listen got to tell you something)
HOPE! Maketh not ashamed (Everybody listen got to tell you something)

Politics are assassins doctors dig the graves
Partial birth abortions my Jesus saves
He came to give life give it abundantly
Activist abuse freedom executes liberally
It's the beginning of the end
It's the beginning of the end
WHAT? Your body is the temple (Everybody listen got to tell you something)

You label them embryo call them fetus 
Practice of a humanist made in his image
Hardness of the heart reprobate mind
Malignant intentions bingeing on the lie
It's the beginning of the end
It's the beginning of the end
WHAT? Your body is the temple (Everybody listen got to tell you something)
WHAT? You are not your own (Everybody listen got to tell you something)

Your episodic aphorisms plague me like the poor decision to play the disinterested listener. I'm like the old child that's grown an earache--full of manipulated tones, tired pragmatics that practice spitting verbs at their perfect prisoner. And you navigate that skill with an aristocratic arm, yeah, you brew your toxic fantasy with predatory charm, you are an a-theatric amateur who drools over every word but can't memorize one single part. And you'll get what can't be got, ain't gonna never be received. If you turn your back, boy, then you'll never leave
You're a product of my ministry, you are crushed on open arms, you will drown in open air prepared to heal your anemic heart. Old vulture, gnarled nemesis, old cavity re-tooled I want to drive a nail through your eyes so I can get a better view. A part of me longs to wash the past, yeah that part of me is weak, a part of me works to find the faults that part of me won't seek. Carry me home, you improbable ghost, I would rot by your flesh, I will gnaw on your bones--are you calling out my name? Elutriate and evanesce. I would gorge myself on praise if you praise this
How do you smile? You are a mystery to me. You taught me by moving slow, you do not so quickly proceed. Still you're warm and gray, a quilted memory, you market yourself by the faded company you keep. And you were already here--a shadow on my tongue--yeah, you were already here and all alone like me. You are a blister from too much sweet, you're an ulcer from too much wine. You are dead, I know that you're dead, were you ever really alive?
(Verse 1: Hodgy Beats)
I'm a lotta narcotics, flow aquatic atomic
The way I rhyme in Islamic promises, ignorance is common sense
Straining my bowels, fucking hungry hippopotamus
You niggas are in the bottom pit, of nauseousness
Is what I was raised around as a child
I'd rather chuck up my middle finger than give a bitch a smile
Hostility fertile like my mule and 40 acres
In my Stacy Adam gators, where's that mothafuckin' stapler?
Uh, you hear that shit?
Ay, run that shit back
Yeah, that shit hot, nigga
Hostility fertile like my mule and 40 acres
In my Stacy Adam gators, where's that mothafuckin' stapler?
Good grades on the wall, niggas hate to see me do it major
I'm just a leader of my team and I ain't afraid of traitors
Lacing my shoes, we the MellowHype jews
We controlling the crews, drinking Belgium booze
We animals out the zoos, with a fuse abused
Bitches brewing in our stews, on they knees like the pews
Sock a buster in his jaw
Fuck the police, break the law
Twist your fingers up, grip your balls
If you ain't got heart you ain't got shit at all
Where your homies at? They'll get fucked up too
Where your grandma at? She'll get fucked up too
Where your bitch at? She'll get fucked up too
Where the roof at? We'll stomp that bitch through
Here we go negero, I'll sing figueroa, figueroa
Chucking up [?] burning bodies in a [?]
Aww, mothafucka wanna see you shine and I got my gold on
Clancy said I'm late for my flight, well he better hold on
Can't wait till I fuckin' buy me a jet, there gon' be some hoes on it
Just blow O's on it, count dough on it
Smoking in the sky, damage the ozone, don't it?
Shit, I'll take a life for my moment's moment
Contract your own sale, fuck a deal, you're in a option
Turn the bass up, get mothafuckas to go shit
Rappers nowadays are all phased when it comes to soft shove
If niggas saying your flow weak, you shoulda bought one
You call this brand new, to me it's Santa Cruz
Don't find HB the man to lose, you ain't a bruise
Catch me on MTV or your local channel news
In London recording to Fuse, I'm the man that confused
I'm fucking crazy, need slavery to be alien gravy
But I ain't saying it to your mothafuckin' brain, skull
Hodgy:
Okay, welcome to my 12 bar
The beat, wears it like a kevlar
As I smoke my tree, medlar, South African
Coughing till there's pains in my fucking abdomen
I spit negative just like a halogen
My breeze more of a fucking masculine
The rascals win, killing them all with a javelin
Snakes, I'm just rattling, suit taylor never taddling
You niggas a bunch of squares, Madison
As far as real niggas, bitch nigga my battle's sick
On top of being talented, bitch I'm fucking passionate
I'm a golden curse, call me treacherous, treasure chest
Better yet, I'll build on to the beat like tetris
Remember me, forgetfulness, I am your correctionist
I stitched odd and future together like a leather vest
You fucking sweater neck, feather peck, rosetta checks
I put together decks and push for beef, If head for less
I'm headed out to Sydney Australia with Tim Donnelly
He gets caught up at security, the TSA don't follow me
Tea parties are the shit, forty mags by the scones
I'm fighting for gun rights to shoot a nigga in his dome
Click your fucking heels, there's no place like home
Cock back and blast off written on the tombstone, ain't that a bitch
Tyler:
Let's see, what's wrong with me might be my fucking tourett sy-
I need a vacation cause all this shit got me stressing
So after the showers with Sandusky, me and Sean Kingston went and rented a couple jet skis
Lionel rolled the blunts up, so meanwhile me and Lucas getting fucked up
You can smell us coming like a faggot when he hicks up
Listening to Common's last album to get pumped up
So finally asked [scratch] when I can get my dick sucked
You know Casey Anthony, was handling
Dropping her kids off so she could come out and dance with me
Wine in the pantry, wrestling on my trampoline
Learned some new chords while you uncreative were sampling
I'm wolf, I spit flow-y partly
As retarded as the sound of deaf people arguing
You hold the future of the kid you daughter's gargling
Me, I have the odd future motherfucking sargeaning
(Tyler calm the fuck down)
No, I'm the fuck now
My poppa didn't give one, that's why I'm like this now
I'm still down to cut throat
And if another fan asks for a photo while I'm snacking on my pizza lunchable
I'm 'a fucking snap like Berman when he acts right
Then have a mental breakdown and proceed to use a crack pipe
OF will be done for, niggas will be dumb poor
Don't believe me, ok be right back, I'm headed to the gun store
M-16's and them 16's came out of nowhere like your kid's wet dream
What you mean old news, Oh you
Will you need us to fucking show you that we're harder than finding a fucking snickers bar in whole foods
In a black hoodie, nose bruised and a gold tooth
Hoping the security guard doesn't hold you in custody
But luckily had a couple of guns with me
Like gay step mom, none of you motherfuckers can fuck with me
Your episodic aphorisms plague me like the poor decision to play the disinterested listener. I'm like the old child that's grown an earache--full of manipulated tones, tired pragmatics that practice spitting verbs at their perfect prisoner. And you navigate that skill with an aristocratic arm, yeah, you brew your toxic fantasy with predatory charm, you are an a-theatric amateur who drools over every word but can't memorize one single part.

You are a blister from too much sweet, you're an ulcer from too much wine. You are dead, I know that you're dead, were you ever really alive?
Imaginary walls surround me
And the silence embraces all my weeps
All the images turn into shadows... of myself
I'm breeding memories... I will not cry... again
Infinite voices... why they drown me here
All the words I hear are for sure... pure reality
Voices... controlling my feelings
Eternal kiss, touched my face
Voices... healing my pain
I am lost without you...
Lights touched my eyes and petrified my tears
Your last caress that I've been waiting...
Am I dreaming or is this your hallowed place
Because I'm feeling the cold of a last farewell...
Voices... controlling my feelings
Eternal kiss, touched my face
Voices... healing my pain
I am lost (without you...)
Fading faces-angels crying beside me
Guiding voices-where I will find you
Where I will find myself...
I am lost... where I will find myself?
I am lost... where I will find myself?
I am lost... where I will find myself?
Where I will find you?
Where I will find you?
Where I will find you?
So where I will find myself...
Ecstasy is all you need
Living in the big machine now
Oh you're so vain
Now your world is way too fast
Nothing's real and nothing lasts
And I'm aware
I'm in love but you don't care
Turn your anger into lust
I'm still here but you don't trust at all
And I'll be waiting
Love and sex and loneliness
Take what's yours and leave the rest
So I'll survive
God it's good to be alive
I'm torn in pieces
I'm blind and waiting for
My heart is reeling
I'm blind and waiting for you
Still in love with all your sins
Where you stop and I begin, and I'll
I'll be waiting
Living like a house on fire
What you fear is your desire
It's hard to deal
I still love the way you feel
Now this angry little girl
Drowning in this petty world
And I'm who you run to
Swallow all your bitter pills
That's what makes you beautiful
You're all or not
I don't need what you ain't got
I'm torn in pieces
I'm blind and waiting for
My heart is reeling
I'm blind and waiting for you
I'm blind and waiting for you
I'm blind and waiting for you
No I can't believe it's coming true
God it's good to be alive and I'm still here waiting for you
No I can't believe it's coming true
I'm blind and waiting for you
Whisper under my breath
Say a little prayer
Same as I do every time
I step into the sun's bright glare
I am just a farm boy
Lived up on the hill
Wanted to get away
Now the army pays my bills
And I'm just dreaming of the time that I can go home
I'm just dreaming of the time that I can go home
Here comes a captain
Take his anger out on me
Calls down fire upon
My country's enemies
Wants me to pick our targets
But all that I can see
Is farmers and their families
And a whole lot of misery, mmm yeah
'Cause I'm just dreaming of the time when I can go home
I'm just dreaming of the time when I can go home
Say a little prayer now
Second one today
Oh, sweet Jesus
Won't you take my sins away?
I'm dreaming of the time that I can go home
I'm just dreaming of the time when I can go home
Yeah, I'm dreaming of the time when I can go home
I'm just dreaming of the time that I can go home
Doctor doctor!
I'm in bed
Achin' head
Gold is lead
Choke on bread
Underfed
Gold is lead
Jesus bled
Pain is red
Are goon
Grow go
Greasy spoon
You swoon
June bloom
Music seems to help the pain
Seems to cultivate the brain
Doctor kindly tell your wife that
I'm alive - flowersthrive - realize - realize
Realize
I'm just so sick and tired of playing the game. Forever meting and deleting all the simple mistake. Here I am, god, help me I am slave to a name not possible or possibly the person that I'll became. See, everybody's borne in battles but I'm trying to breed out, by never doubting that in doubting I've created the doubt: if I'm about the best bred to lead the canon'ed devout then can I realize and factualize my fictional account of how I'm born again? Forgive this life loving friends and friends don't give a damn for damning is the means to end. I've been trained to live lost in a hole, where poison could equate to control, is controlled by my hand, here it is, here I am
Dn dah
What we don't know yet we'll never find in our books. So let's spread our legs and all take a look at truth for once where wants are wound by how we're pound for pound bound to like to fuck. I believe in what the conscience has ruled: credulous a must, allow my heart be fooled. Just as well, I'll be stuck to sell my delight in licking sweat to swallow hell, oh well. I'm born, again, I'll build a life fucking friends and friends won't give a fuck for fucking is the latest trend. I'll give my statue a shell, trust my unconscious is well and controlled by my hand, here it is, here we am
Dn dah
Don't pin me up. Don't you know my cross you'll never carry?
Don't nail me up. Why don't you buy my cross? You'll never bear it
When I'm the god of failure you'll love me later, and heaven dissolves for me
(Big V)
Fuck that motherfucking bullshit
(MC Lyte)
Kiss my motherfucking ass
(Verse 1: Big V)
People call me Strokes, a.k.a. you know the Iceman
When it comes to sex, you know my motto yes I can, can
Never will I front, pass it up or let it walk by
And if I don't get that ass, well at least I did try
I know the games p.m.s. must run through you.
You set it up so no man will ever do you
But when you need your weave done, honey read my lips
You can beg all you want but you gets jack shit
I don't play, I work hard for my money
5, 6, 7 days a week, shit ain't funny
Now if sex is old fashioned and you're not selling out
If you're giving it up, you better spit that gum out
(Verse 2: MC Lyte)
You wanna what? You must be bugging
A minute and a half of having sex, that ain't loving
You couldn't please me if you had his dick
That meaning you heard means you were making me sick
So don't front and lie like you were all that in bed
When I rolled your fat ass over you were nervous and scared
Mr. love man, you ain't shit
You better get your homies to suck your own dick
(Verse 3: Big V)
When it comes to sex you get mo better
'Cause I was on your shit even when you had the jetta
It's '93 now and all that shit done passed
So stop frontin' miss 'cause I want that ass
(Verse 3: MC Lyte)
What you what you can't get so step off
There's no room
You want a zoom zoom?
Not in this poom poom
So let me tell you something Mr. Why-you-can't-quit
Save what you can do 'cause that's some bullshit
So go and tell your friends, you know, the ones you got gassed
To take a cold shower 'cause you get no ass
Oh, baby, its gonna die
Oh, baby, I got to fly
Oh, Got to try to find a way
Oh, Got to get away
Don't you know I gotta get away from you
Yeah, hey
Oh, baby, the rivers red
Oh, baby, its in my head
Oh, There's a funny feelin goin on
Hey, and I don't think I can hold out long
Oh, I gotta get away from you
*And I'm still awake at 3AM
Oh, I don't know just who I am
Oh, now how do you feel?
When you live in your mind
And think that its real?
Oh, baby you're killin me
Oh, baby you're all I see
You're in my dreams and in my mind
Oh, and I used to think that you were my kind
And I'm still awake at 3AM
And I don't know just who I am
Oh, tell me how you feel
When you're livin in your mind
And you think that its real
Oh, I see you in my mind
And I used to think that you were my kind
Oh, you know how to smash a dream
Oh, you know how to take a spine and snap it
Oh, you know how to take a man and crush him
Oh, its what you do
Oh, its what you do
Oh, you fill my dreams
You fill my dreams
The policemen broke my door down
Dragged me from my bed
I asked them what was happening
They just ignored the words I said
They waved their guns in my face
Kept screaming out my name
Something terrible had happened
And somehow I was to blame
O freedom, what liberties are taken in thy name
In thy name
O freedom, what liberties are taken
What liberties are taken
What liberties are taken in thy name
My accusers formed a jury
The judge and the defense
The charges were made known to me
But not the evidence
There was no guilty verdict
Yet, still I was detained
Flown to another country where
Their methods are less constrained
O freedom, what liberties are taken in thy name
In thy name
O freedom, what liberties are taken
What liberties are taken
What liberties are taken in thy name
In our determination
To defend democracy
We must not destroy the safeguards
That underpin our liberty
For who will pay the price if
Injustice such as this
Turns our protectors to oppressors
And angry men to terrorists?
O freedom, what liberties are taken in thy name
In thy name
O freedom, what liberties are taken
What liberties are taken
What liberties are taken in thy name
Another world, another time
In the age of wonder
Another world, another time
This land was green and good 
Until the crystal cracked
Once more
They will replenish themselves
Cheat death again
The power of their source
The crystal
The crystal
The crystal
The power of their source
The crystal
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best 
Uh I want you to trip like me,
I want you to have fun
Me and you
Oh my God this is the best
Uh, I want you to trip like I do
Oh my God
Oh my God this is the best
Oh my God this is the best
I want you to trip like I do
Oh my God
I want you to trip like I do
I want you to trip like I do
I want you to trip like I do
An American flag he hung down from the roof
And he hung it askew
He laid down on it in a drunken stupor
And dreamed about his daddy how his daddy used to do
Sleeping on an old cot out in the barn
Working through the heat out in the yard
Kicking back a whiskey 'til the sun come up
And showing up to church half drunk
Playing poker all night long
And playing the accordion that same old song:
Who loves you more than me?
Who loves you more than your family?
Yeah, he remembers it
Lookin' through the crack between the blanket and the wall
He sees his daddy bash a phone into his mamma's skull
Over and over and over again
And his rage and her shame flow through him
Well it's a strange little custom in the family
And the branch never falls too far from the tree
Now some may call that a natural thing
But I call it a good old-fashioned tragedy
'Cause it's an old-fashioned dream to plant a family tree
Mix blood on blood in a family recipe
And it could be so good, it's the oldest story in the book
She sees her stepdaddy comin' and her knees get weak
Just one touch she passes out on the street
But she covers up the bruises so her mamma won't see
'Cause what have you got without your family?
Yeah his mamma beat him just like that too
And now these two lay together in a drunken stupor
She's crying 'cause of what he might do
Now how can two of a kind create something new?
Yeah what's the good of forgiveness if the sinners go free
And come back to haunt you in your time of need to say:
Who loves you like I do?
Who else is gonna be there to see you through?
Because vengeance is such a waste of energy
And you get poisoned fruit from a poisoned tree
So let's pull it out by the roots
Let's chop it up and put it to a brand-new use:
It's fuel for the fire of a family tree
Who is this irresistible creature
Who has an insatiable love for the dead?
(Living dead girl)
(What are you thinking about?)
(What are you thinking about?)
(The same thing you are)
Ow, rage in the cage
And piss upon the stage
There's only one sure way
To bring the giant down
Defunct the strings
Of cemetery things
With one flat foot
On the devil's wing
Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living dead girl
Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living dead girl
(What are you thinking about?)
(What are you thinking about?)
(The same thing you are)
Ow, raping the geek
And hustling the freak
Like a hunchback juice
On a sentimental noose
Operation filth
They love to love the wealth
Of an SS whore
Making scary sounds
Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living dead girl
Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living dead girl
(What are you thinking about?)
Ow, Cyclone Jack
Hallucinating hack
Thinks Donna Reed
Eats dollar bills
Goldfoot's machine
Creates another fiend
So beautiful
They'll make you kill
Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living dead girl
Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living dead girl
Blood on her skin
Dripping with sin
Do it again
Living dead girl
Blood on her skin
Dripping with sin
Do it again
Living dead girl

Our country and all its people could be in danger of nuclear attack in minutes by enemy missiles and hours by enemy aircraft
Our cities, our farms, our factories
Prime target would be our airbases
All our aircraft on the ground, we might face another and infinitely more costly Pearl Harbor
The time has come to scorch the earth
And to start again clean
Bend the people to our will
With propaganda machines
Reconstruct the hierarchy
Revolution starts right here
Nihilistic anarchy
Obedience achieved through fear
We all have our victory
This is our democracy
It's one for you and two for me
Just trust in us, we know what's best
Violence and civil unrest
Infiltrate the battle zone
Lost soldiers coming home
Be a king or be a slave
Honor lies in an unmarked grave
 
Every man must choose his path
Will you fight or will you run?
It's us or them, just do the math
Stand up and be someone!
Just something you should understand
Before you come to invade my home
Justice stings like the back of my hand
So you better not come alone
This is our democracy
It's one for you and two for me
Just trust in us, we know what's best
Violence and civil unrest
Infiltrate the battle zone
Bring our soldiers home
Be a king or be a slave
Lay your flowers on our grave
This is our moment
We have never been stronger
People are violent, yes, but if we show them the way, they will buy us power!
We all have our victory
This is our democracy
It's one for you and two for me
Just trust in us, we know what's best
Violence and civil unrest
Infiltrate the battle zone
Lost soldiers coming home
Be a king or be a slave
Honor lies in an unmarked grave
Democracy
Two for me
Democracy
We all have our victory
I find you here on judgement day
A trail of tears upon your face
Your armor cold, your time run out
To make believe, to ease your doubt
Were you strong inside yourself,
Or did you cry for someone else?
Set free your fear, it's a perfect day
The sun has come to wash your pain away
When the bells start ringing
And you've reached the end
What did you stand for?
What would you die for?
Will you die for the perfect war?
The angels singing
In the skies again
What did you live for?
What would you die for?
Will you die in the perfect war?
So live your life, you've only one
Your thoughts and deeds can't be undone
Set free your fear, it's a perfect day
The sun has come to wash your pain away
I'm becoming less defined as days go by
Fading away, well you might say I'm losing focus
Kind of drifting into the abstract in terms of how I see myself
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
Sometimes I can see right through myself
Less concerned about fitting into the world
Your world that is
'Cause it doesn't really matter anymore
(No, it doesn't really matter anymore)
No, it doesn't really matter anymore
None of this really matters anymore
Yes, I am alone, but then again I always was
As far back as I can tell, I think maybe it's because
Because you were never really real to begin with
I just made you up to hurt myself
I just made you up to hurt myself
Yeah, and I just made you up to hurt myself
I just made you up to hurt myself
Yeah, and I just made you up to hurt myself
And it worked
Yes it did
There is no you, there is only me
There is no you, there is only me
There is no fucking you, there is only me
There is no fucking you, there is only me
Only
Only
Only
Only
Well, the tiniest little dot caught my eye
And it turned out to be a scab
And I had this funny feeling
Like I just knew it's something bad
I just couldn't leave it alone
I kept picking at that scab
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut
But I climbed through
Now I'm somewhere I am not supposed to be
And I can see things I know I really shouldn't see
And now I know why now, now I know why
Things aren't as pretty on the inside
There is no you, there is only me
There is no you, there is only me
There is no fucking you, there is only me
There is no fucking you, there is only me
Only 
Only
Only
Only
Only
Only
Only
Only
The moon is pulling at me,
The moon is pulling at you
You swear to me it's the sun
That's shining through
It's hard to push for the truth
When lies are easy to find
I'm left with, I'm left with
This trouble in mind
I'm left to counting the days
While my life drifts away
Cause you come and go again like the tide
While on the shoreline I stand washed of my pride
And the truth I keep pushing aside
Is that it's time to walk away
Big guns are pointed at me,
Big guns are pointed at you
Everybody's waitin' to see
What we're gonna do
You spin around and disappear
Under the floor where I stand
I'm left with, I'm left with
A bag in my hand
I'm left to counting the days
While my life drifts away
Cause you come and go again like the tide
While on the shoreline I stand washed of my pride
And the truth I keep pushing aside
Is that it's time to walk away
Night closes in,
But I hear the water rush in
To his song I'm a slave
I start to sink where I stand,
I become part of the sand
He covers me like the sea,
Like a wave
Oh-oh
The road is turning for me,
The road is turning for you
The light is red like a fire,
But you drive on through
I stay behind and hear you call
"You should have known this from the start"
I'm left with, I'm left with
A piece of my heart
Cause you come and go again like the tide
While on the shoreline I stand washed of my pride
And the truth I keep pushing aside
Is that it's time to walk away
You come and go again like the tide
While on the shoreline I stand washed of my pride
And the truth I keep pushing aside
Is that it's time to walk away
It's time to walk away
It's time to walk away, yeah
It's time to walk away
I'm walking away, yeah
I'm walking away
Out of the shadows... blistering lights...
Through the hallways of a sleepless night...
Every time I turn around, it's there...
Take a piece of our lives, didn't think we'd care?
Take away... the chore...
Take all of that, and more...
And now we're crying...
It's no fair...
Through the shadows, blistering lights
As the dreams of your darkness died
Every time I turn around you're there...
Take a piece of our lives, didn't think that we would care...
Now it's, no it's no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair...
Take a piece
Of our lives!?
Didn't think that we would care?
Now it's, no it's no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair...
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
That he not busy being born is busy dying
Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying
So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma
I'm only sighing
As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all, except hatred
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred
While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked
And though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma
I can make it
Advertising signs that con
You into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you
You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy, insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to
But though the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma
To live up to
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Cultivate their flowers to be
Nothing more than something they invest in
While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society?�s pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he?�s in
But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it?�s alright, Ma, if I can?�t please him
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares, propaganda, all is phony
While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows their minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say, "Okay, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma
It's life, and life only
(GZA)
Okay... the GZA
Tony Touch classic, knowhatI'msayin?
We gonna bang y'all, in the head one time
Blaze up on y'all one time real fast (Do the mix and all that shit)
Knamsayin, word up (Make it make it a record real quick, do yo' thang)
Throw ya seatbelts on, ahhight?
(Yeah, hook it up, make it a record, get down yo)
I take y'all niggas straight, +Beneath the Surface+
To the core, if it ain't raw its worthless
Pentab professional, hold the ink
While river rats fall off the raft and sink
Tony let a brother Touch, twenty bar rush
The way we push through equivalent to rocket thrust
Allah just, I lay it for the mix tapes
Quick to quake a label-mate
The sound came outta rusted crate
Surrounded by cobwebs
Beat smooth enough to slide through like bobsleds
On a cold white snow, plus with the right flow
Wu-Tang niggaz they shine and make the mic glow
(Masta Killa)
We killin' all gorillin with all that screwfacin
Pacin' back and forth looking savage, stop it
(RZA aka Bobby Digital)
Whether plugged in or plugged out
Iron drill mugged or thugged out
Blood in or blood out, son was bugged out
Might look at you and slice you
Buck fifty face stupid and say but run Nike swoop
Who the fuck you think let y'all wild niggas in
Allowed you to put down ya guns, and raise ya pen
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig, we don't fuck with no pig
We teach the kids, you rather have a bullet or a word to your wig
Murder rates increases, bullet holes the size of fifty cent pieces
Don't worry about the weed or pussy, I read books
I'm liable to mate'cha king with three rooks
You see the Wu W raised in black fists
Maybe Tony Touch, Concord needle will scratch this
The ice cube link you bough, from the Jew for 80 G's
Was only appraised at forty-two
Gazed upon by the eyes of multitude
Of people, who would trade gold for food
I heard boar's head killed more than nuclear's warhead
Or street serfs who walk around dressed in all red
Bobby Digi said if you ever encounter Allah beef
Break my sons Doc Doom and Crisis wit a nice piece
(Masta Killa)
Penetrate on mix tape, with the legislation
Illustrate constant elevation
Spark friction, Shawshank Golden Arm Redemption
Endorsed my the Masta inscription signature
(Inspecta Deck)
Off top my unorthodox style of attack
Is like Hannibal rollin' on elephant's backs
Pack a long barrel, bustin' off strong ammo
My light so vast I cast twenty foot shadows
First family, fifth cappo, micro to macro
Load it in ya head play it back slow
Act like you know, this is no drill
Murderous rap revealed goin' for kill
On these New York city sidewalks we walk
Camoflauge, dodgin the eyes of the hawk
Kani Sport, totin the fifth, slidin off
My live source movin across with brute force
Bloodsport, anymore heads face the blade
Fakers must fade, the stakes are now raised
Words of murder, suspense, and intrigue
Make major league niggaz show signs of fatigue
My Killer Bees span wider than seven seas
Squeeze on MC's, with bullet train speed
Tony's Touch create more gold than Midas
Ya highness, all in ya head, like ya hair stylus
(Ghostface Killa)
Frosty mug, big ring leaders top secret thug
Lampin in cheaters or in thaw with the murder glove
Boat of the town, devilish grin look peculiar
Swung on this faggot, knocked the windows outta Silvia's
Timb's got scuffed up, my ankles got sprained, that's my word
To ever single seat I smack flames
Staten Island's bayside of teachers of Elijah
Thrown out the temple, non-calodic wit the father
Nickname's Pudding, Clarence 13X before the Will Smith's
And the limelights of Cuba Gooding
Lost in the cosmos, explodin through a quasar
Be duckin pulsars, organic stay still be the Gods
Tony Touch, Tony Touch
Word up
Big Face Ghost in effect
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can...
See right through me
Freddie Mercury!
When you hear a sound
That you just can't place
Feel somethin' move
That you just can't trace
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can...
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can...
See right through you
John Deacon!
Now I'm in your room
And I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life
And I'm in your head
Like the CIA
Or the FBI
You'll never get close
Never take me alive
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can...
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can...
See right through you
Hah hah hah - hello
Hah hah hah - OK
Hah hah hah hello hello hello hello
Never had a real good friend -
Not a boy or a girl
No one knows what I've been through -
Let my flag unfurl
So I make my mark
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
Brian May! Brian May!
Now I'm on your track
And I'm in your mind
And I'm on your back
But don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
But I'll never get caught
You can't shake me, shake me, dear
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can...
See right through me
Watch me now!
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can...
See right through you
Look at me, look at me!
Roger Taylor!
Shake you, shake you, shake you, dear
I'd like to be what some of the fuss is all about
Excuse me, Mother, while I scream and shout
Pass me the key
I'd like to let myself out and go
Excuse me, Mother, I am only bleeding
Is that a family manual you are reading?
Don't you think that it's a little bit too late
'Cause I'm already the consequence of somebody else's fate
So I go
I'll do it all day long
It's a mundane experience living with Mother and I
I'd rather catch something controversial and die
And don't you know that she's making me see red
And I'd have doubt it if she's heard a single word that I've said
I'll do it all day long
No one's asking to go dancing it's not like that anymore
It's romantic if they mean it when they shut your fingers in the door
It's a gory sort of story that's been told a hundred times before
It gets tricky don't be picky if the slipper fits you wear it whore
How many tips can I take home tonight without them getting mad
How many stitches do you think it takes to fix a cut that bad
How many minutes until midnight and you get your eyesight back
Not to knock it I've been off it never moving very much at once
It's been awkward I still offer it when it's that time of
Other girls shower but I give out flowers
To curious strangers who throw dollars at my feet
How many crimes can I try spotting dry before it leaves a stain
How many times say that I love you till it doesn't mean a thing
How many fittings must I sit through with my big feet blistering
How many times until it strips me and my big mouth strikes again
I'm not asking to go dancing I'm not that dumb anymore
It's exhausting to keep smiling when your toes are bleeding on the floor
It's a gory sort of story that's been told a hundred times before
Don't be sorry just ignore me because honestly
I'm too sore from fitting exactly to ride into setting suns aching to
Stand on my own two feet
How many wishes do I still have left to fix the way it ends
How many princes do you think
It takes to put a girl like this back together again
How many instances can you point out where I was less than kind
How many happy endings do you need to change your fucking mind
And how much time do we have left before it's midnight and
You see that I was never the right size?
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To stop me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To stop me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten but twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me?
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
Merry Christmas
I wrapped it up and send it
With a note saying "I love you"
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to stop me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
I am not a pretty girl
That is not what I do
I ain't no damsel in distress
And I don't need to be rescued
So put me down, punk
Wouldn't you prefer a maiden fair?
Isn't there a kitten stuck up a tree somewhere?
I am not an angry girl
But it seems like I've got everyone fooled
Every time I say something they find hard to hear
They chalk it up to my anger
And never to their own fear
Imagine you're a girl
Just trying to finally come clean
Knowing full well they'd prefer you were dirty 
And smiling
And I am sorry
But I am not a maiden fair
And I am not a kitten stuck up a tree somewhere
And generally, my generation
Wouldn't be caught dead working for the man
And generally I agree with them
Trouble is you gotta have yourself 
An alternate plan
And I have earned my disillusionment
I have been working all of my life
And I am a patriot
I have been fighting the good fight
And what if there are no damsels in distress
What if I knew that and I called your bluff?
Don't you think every kitten figures out how to get down,
Whether or not you ever show up?
I am not a pretty girl
I don't really want to be a pretty girl
No, I want to be more than a pretty girl.
I was down the glen one Easter morn
To a city fair rode I.
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by.
No pipe did hum, no battle drum did sound its loud tattoo.
But the Angelus Bells o'er the Liffey swells rang out in the foggy dew.
Right proudly high in Dublin town
Hung they out a flag of war.
'Twas better to die 'neath that Irish sky
Than at Sulva or Sud el Bar.
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's huns with their long range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew.
Their bravest fell and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide in the
Springing of the year.
While the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men but few.
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew.
And back through the glen
I rode again.
And my heart with grief was sore.
For I parted then with valiant men
Whom I never shall see n'more.
But to and fro in my dreams I go
And I kneel and pray for you.
For slavery fled the glorious dead
When you fell in the foggy dew.
I'm a very busy man
So please don't waste my time kid
(Time kid)
Don't tell me what you're gonna do or what you wanna do
Tell me what you already did
(Tell me what you already did)
(What you already did, what you already did)
Tell me what you already did
(Tell me what you already did)
(What you already did, what you already did)
Tell me to hear about your plans
Just give me the bottom line kid
(Line kid)
Don't tell me what you could've done or what you should've done
Tell me what you already did
(Tell me what you already did)
(What you already did, what you already did)
Tell me what you already did
(Tell me what you already did)
(What you already did, what you already did)
I need results, I need straight answers
If I wanna fancy fool, look I would've hired a dancer, oh
I don't think you understand
A break like this is hard to find kid
(Find kid)
Don't tell me what you're gonna do or what you wanna do
Tell me what you already did
(Tell me what you already did)
(What you already did, what you already did)
Tell me what you already did
(Tell me what you already did)
(What you already did, what you already did)
Tell me what you already did
(Tell me what you already did)
(What you already did, what you already did)
Tell me what you already did
(Tell me what you already did)
(What you already did, what you already did)
Tell me what you already did
Step out the front door like a ghost into the fog
Where no one notices the contrast of white on white
And in between the moon and you, angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right
Well I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again, where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying, through the door I hear her crying
Why? I don't know
Round here, we always stand up straight
Round here, something radiates
Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walked along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous
Round here, we're carving out our names
Round here, we all look the same
Round here, we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
Round here, she's slipping though my hands
Oh, sleeping children better run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning
She says, it's only in my head
She says, shhh, I know, it's only in my head
But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says, man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?
Then she looks up at the building
Says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something
Round here, she's always on my mind
Round here, hey man, I got lots of time
Round here, we're never sent to bed early
And nobody makes us wait
Round here, we stay up very, very, very, very late
I... I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
Oh, you catch me if I'm falling
You catch me if I'm falling
You catch me 'cause I'm falling down on you
I said I'm under the gun, round here
Oh man, I said I'm under the gun, round here
And I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
We're leaving together
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back to earth, who can tell?
I guess there's no one to blame
We're leaving proud
Will things ever be the same again
It's the final countdown!
We're heading for Mars
And still we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us
And welcome us all
With so many light years to go
And things to be found
We're sure we'll all miss her so
It's the final countdown!
We break our enemies with fear
And we've seen how the tears come around
We built our confidence on wasteland
We've seen how the walls come down
Life burns!
A man dies like a butterfly
Life burns from the touch of the reaper
All things must pass
One love is a crooked lie
The world lies in the hands of evil
And we pray it would last
Life burns!
We have no sympathy for the lost souls
We've chosen the path of disgrace
We give this life to our children
And teach them to hate this place
A man dies like a butterfly
Life burns from the touch of the reaper
All things must pass
One love is a crooked lie
The world lies in the hands of evil
And we pray it would last
A man dies like a butterfly
Life burns from the touch of the reaper
One love is a crooked lie
The world lies in the hands of evil
The world lies in the hands of evil
The world lies in the hands of evil
The world lies in the hands of evil
The world lies in the hands of evil
A man dies like a butterfly
Life burns from the touch of the reaper
All things must pass
One love is a crooked lie
The world lies in the hands of evil
And we pray it would last
A man dies like a butterfly
Life burns from the touch of the reaper
All things must pass
One love is a crooked lie
The world lies in the hands of evil
And we pray it would last
Life burns!
Life burns!
Life burns!
I'm not the one who made the world what it is today
I'm not the one who caused the problems started long ago
But now I deal with all the consequence that troubles our times
I carry on and never once have even questioned why
I'm innocent
The weight of the world is on my shoulders
I'm innocent
The battles started are far from over
We're not the ones who leave the homeless in the streets at night
We're not the ones who've kept minorities and women down
Still we grow and then the problems they become our own
We carry on without even realizing why
We're innocent
The weight of the world is on our shoulders
We're innocent
The battles left us are far from over
We're innocent
The weight of the world is on our shoulders
We're innocent
The battles left us are far from over
We're innocent
The weight of the world is on our shoulders
We're innocent
The battles left us are far from over
We're not the ones whose pollution blackened our skies
And ruined our streams
We're not the ones who made the nuclear bombs
That threaten our lives
We're not the ones who let the children starve in faraway lands
We're not the ones who made the streets unsafe to walk at night
And even if we try and not become so overwhelmed
And if we make some contribution to the plight we see
Still our descendants will inherit our mistakes of today
They'll suffer just the same as we and never wonder why
So Sgt. Pepper took you by surprise
You better see right through that mother's eyes
Those freaks was right when they said you was dead
The one mistake you made was in your head
Tell me, how do you sleep?
Tell me, how do you sleep at night?
You live with straights who tell you you was king
Jump when your mama tell you anything
The only thing you done was Yesterday
And since you've gone, you're just Another Day
Tell me, how do you sleep at night?
Tell me, how do you sleep at night?
Ah, how do you sleep at night?
A pretty face may last a year or two
But pretty soon, they'll see what you can do
The sound you make is Muzak to my ears
You must have learned something in all those years
Ah, how do you sleep, brother?
Ah, tell me, how do you sleep at night?
Brooklyn, we go hard
We on the look for the advantage, we work hard
And if we seem to rough it up a bit
We broke but we rich at heart
Pull ourselves up now we won't choke
It's our time, put the lights on us
War tactics, they make me sick
Reel your heart in, run away with it
Smile in your face, undermine your back
Got guns for the strength they lack
So if you know another way
You can't look the other way
You know another way
Tell them so right to their face
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
I pay for what's called eccentricity
And my wish to evolve
I hear them all say that I got heart
But not everything that it takes
Taint my mind but not my soul
Tell you I got fire
I won't sell it for no payroll
Let 'em hold me down
I know if I know another way
I can't look the other way
I know another way
I'll tell them so right to their face
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
Entirely, totally
Bring it all together, I want everything
Fill till this feels like hot gossip
Demand a recount, you poor folks
Waiting on a trickle with your hands out
I got to laugh at you, you call it luck 
Because it wasn't due to you don't mean I'm paying dues, you stupid fuck
I'm on your mind for reaching things that you can't
Just know I'm doing something you ain't
Simple and plain
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine
We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine

Sharissa where you at
I was just about to say I'm sorry for being late,
But I can't say nothing
The accusations you gripe ad you complain,
You always mad about something.
You'd be wilding out if you knew I had packed my things,
But I ain't saying nothing.
The decision of a lifetime I'm having second thoughts about you for the last time.
Maybe it's all good that it's come down to this
(Maybe it's all good yeah)
Before we bought the house the cars before we had any kids
(Don't need to bring no kids into this mess)
Knowing this is a big mistake that I'll regret much later
(For you to think out)
What it takes for you to be my lover
If you gonna love me
Love me all the way completely
Baby no half stepping
Give me give me what it takes
To make me feel
If you gonna leave me baby leave today
Ain't got no time
To waist this love on no one
Who don't need it
Don't know what to do with it.
You checkin' my pagers scrolling down my caller Id
Like trust ain't a factor
When all the while baby you were cheating on me
Did you regret the morning after?
Even though you had these tendencies from the start of this thing
I thought I could change you
You made it easy to decide there's no way that I could never be your wife
Maybe it's all good that it's come down to this
(Maybe it's all good_
Before we bought the house the cars before we had any kids
(Don't need to be taking no children into this abuse no no no)
Knowing this is a big mistake that I'll regret much later
(Boy you ain't the one that I wanna take)
What it takes for you to be my lover
If you gonna love me (if you gonna love me yeah)
Love me all the way completely (yeah yeah)
Baby no half stepping (no half stepping)
Give me give me what it takes (give me this love to make me feel it's real yeah)
To make me feel
If you gonna leave me baby leave today (if you leaving, leave)
Ain't got no time
To waist this love on no one (no half of you)
Who don't need it
Don't know what to do with it.
Uh

Sanction to a dirty sow
I'm not your s*** box
Sanction to a dirty sow
It is different!
You are fat maggots!
When was the last time you talked to me?
Seriously
I feel like I don't even know you
And I would rather me leave
Than stay and watch you make a fool of me
You might as well leave
You might as well let me know now
You might as well go, go, go
I never wanna see your face round here anymore
'Cause it's a breakdown, a breakdown
Where do we go from here?
It's a breakdown, a breakdown
Looking at me lying
If I said I wasn't getting quite bored of you yet
And your consistent nagging
And your constant state of panic
Is unnecessary stress for me
You're the tip, tip, tip-top of the charts
You're the best thing I've ever done
And the reality is that I wrote this song for you
You might as well leave
You might as well let me know now
You might as well go, go, go
I never wanna see your face round here anymore
'Cause it's a breakdown, a breakdown
Where do we go from here?
It's a breakdown, a breakdown
When wood floors meet high heels
And shadows form from chandeliers
When wood floors meet high heels
And shadows form from chandeliers
You might as well leave
You might as well let me know now
You might as well go, go, go
I never wanna see your face round here anymore
'Cause it's a breakdown, a breakdown
Where do we go from here?
It's a breakdown, a breakdown
Give me some antiseptic
To wash this headache away
Give me a syringe
To inject the pain
Give me something pretty I hope I'll never be
I'd rather be creepy and very strange
Give me a cake that I can mix and bake
In a Betty Crocker oven that I will break
Bake it up and we will
Stab Stab Stab
Come on, don't be afraid
We will make you
Stab Stab Stab
My world is evil but American made
Give me something easy that I can complicate
Something healthy that I can infect
Give me a mate in a crippled state
With Halloween teeth that I can break
Bake it up and we will
Stab Stab Stab
Come on, don't be afraid
We will make you
Stab Stab Stab
My world is evil but American made
Momma's apple pie got a cockroach in it
Burn the flag with a fag
Momma's apple pie got a cockroach in it
Burn the flag with a fag
Momma's apple pie got a cockroach in it
Burn the flag with a fag
Momma's apple pie got a cockroach in it
Burn the flag with a fag
Bake it up and we will
Stab Stab Stab
Come on, don't be afraid
We will make you
Stab Stab Stab
My world is evil but American made
American made
American grave
In an American grave
I believe that reality's gone
Disillusion's real
I believe that morality's gone
And there's nothing to feel
If you take the sacred things
The things that we hold dear
Empty promise is all you'll find
So give me something
Something to believe in
I believe in a changing of the guard
Put our feet on the ground
See it happen in your own backyard
Everything breaks down
Do you accept what you are told
Without even thinking
Throw it all and make your own
And give me something
Something to believe in
Where they lead
You will follow
Well I guess that's just the way it goes
And if you look away
You'll be doing what they say
And if you look alive
You'll be singled out and tried
If you take home anything
Let it be your will to think
The more cynical you become
The better off you'll be
I'm never coming back
I'm never giving in
I'll never be the shine in your spit
I disconnect the act
I disconnect the dots
I disconnect the me in me
You're mistaken
It's you that's faking, living, breathing, dying too
This message is for anyone who dares to hear a fool
You can't bring me back
You can't bring me back 'cause I give it all back to you
Through sacred alleys, the living wrecks, yeah, wreak their havoc upon this world
The disenchanted, the romantics
The body and face and soul of you is gone down that deep black hole
Destroy the mind, destroy the body but you cannot destroy the heart
Destroy the mind, destroy the body but you cannot destroy the heart
And you, you make it so I need to disconnect
And you make it so real, I don't need your love to disconnect
To runaround kids in get-go cars
With vaseline afterbirths and neon coughs
Galaxies full of nobodies giving us the farewell runarounds
And I took a Virgin Mary axe to his sweet baby Jane
Lost my innocence to a no-good girl
Scratch my face with anvil hands
And coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouth
And I give it all back to you
I give it all back to you, yeah
I give it all back to you
And for you
No way, I don't need it, I don't need your love to disconnect
And you make it so real, I don't need your love to disconnect
No way, no way, no way, yeah yeah, to disconnect
And you make it so real, I don't need your love to disconnect
No way, no way, no way, yeah yeah, to disconnect, yeah

This girl didn't know what happened
When she knocked upon my door
The things you had, the life you lived
All the dreams you had before.
Your eyes were facin' your heart and soul
You know they said it all
What happened on that day back then
The moment hurt us all
Now you can see the reason why not everyone's the same
And you don't have to please them, or try hard to save your name
They said you'd never get anywhere,
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, and I know better.
They said you'd never get anywhere,
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, and I know better.
(Yes I do)
Well the days go by and you wonder why, "is this really true?"
Your heart says "No" but your feelings show the poor baby never knew
But you and I, we knew deep down, that ain't really you
We always knew that it'd work out right and we could start anew
Now you can see the reason why not everyone's the same
And you don't have to please them, or try hard to save your name
They said you'd never get anywhere,
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, and I know better.
They said you'd never get anywhere,
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, and I know better.
Well things ain't always what they seem
So wake up and get outta your dreams
Things ain't always what they seem so wake up!
Well things ain't always what they seem
Wake up man, you're in my dreams!
Things ain't always...
Oh now you can see the reason why not everyone's the same
And you don't have to please them, or try hard
They said you'd never get anywhere,
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, and I know better.
They said you'd never get anywhere,
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, and I know better.
They said you'd never get anywhere,
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, and I know better
A one, two, three, four, they said you'd never get anywhere,
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
You're never gonna get anywhere
That's what they tell me
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never gonna get anywhere
They don't care, and that's not fair!
They said you'd never get anywhere
They don't care and it's just not fair
That you know, and I know (better
Escobar season has returned...
It's been a long time
Been a long time comin'
Its life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turning back now.
This is what makes me.
This is what I am.
Hear me, lets go
Chorus: Puffy
You can hate me now (QB)
But I won't stop now (Real Niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now You gonna hate me I'ma hate you too
'Cause I can't stop now Simple as that
You can hate me now Die motherfucker die motherfucker die
You can hate me nooow You don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
About anything that's about to go down
Do it now, Do It now, weak, jealous motherfuckers,
Do it now Fuck y'all
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I dry
Close your eyes, picture me rollin',
Sixes, money foldin
Bitches honeys that swollen
The riches, nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed pulitzer prize winner
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators bring aside try watchin my paper
Almost a decade quite impressive
Most of the best N' the sss's
For this rap shit that I stand for
Expanding more to the big screen
Bill gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail
With state dreams
Want me off the scene fast
But good things last
Like your favorite m.c. still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque
Back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest
I suggest
Money is power motherfucker
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch
Do it now
Chorus I won't stop
Can't stop
You gon'hate me
I hate you too
You can hate me now
You can hate me now
Do it now, I told you do it now lets go
You wanna hate me then hate me
What can I do?
But keep gettin' money
Funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up
Until I made it
Now y'all sayin' that's a clever nigga
Nothing to play with
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood
But can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes
Give 'em to you?
Here's my car and my house
You can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets
Hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that
What you expect hoe
Nickname esco
Took this game to its threshold
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest
But who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that
Cause niggas feel this right
You think I'm gonna come this far and let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too
Do it now
I like this, I like the way this feels
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates
I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Jammin up the border to this game stop
And I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause
While driving, niggas shot out my doors
Plottin, I'm sure to catch me
With they glocks to my jaw
Try stickin me up but I
But I flipped on these ducks You tried
Instead of me
Ambulances were picking them up That's what you get
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer
Guess its just inferior man
Became a monster, atop of the world
Never fallin'
I'm as real as they come
From day one, forever ballin
C'mon
Hey y'all can't see a nigga like me, never in your life
And that's what you can't understand
(Do it now, do it now)
(Do it now, do it now)
(C'mon)
(Hate me now, hate me now)
(C'mon niggas, c'mon niggas)
(Do it now, get the shit over with)

Call my name
Answer me where I stand
Call my name
Answer me where I stand
Here's a story of the way I wasn't meant to be raised
Bright yellow sun that fades away to black and blue every place
There's a bottle in the shape of your love for me
Now the clouds are twisting higher blinding arrows away
Piercing the darkness of these streets with my electricity
Cold shatters the sky
This is the first day of the rest of our lives
'Cause no one truly lives or dies
Call my name
(When did this storm begin?)
Answer me where I stand
Call my name
(When will this story end?)
Answer me where I stand
Every night you drink the money left to pay all the bills
No food for us but there's another fucking bottle of pills
Here's your trophy on my face, it's just an eye anyway
Now the clouds are twisting higher blinding arrows away
Piercing the darkness of these streets with my electricity
This will go no further. I swear it dies today
Your nights will stay forever if you dare once more touch me
Call my name
(When did this storm begin?)
Answer me where I stand
Call my name
(When will this story end?)
Answer me where I stand
Where I stand
*Girl cries*
Call my name
(When did this storm begin?)
Call my name
(When will this story end?)
Call my name
(When did this storm begin?)
Call my name
Down in Vineland there's a clubhouse,
Girl in white dress, boy shoot white stuff
Oh, don't you know that anyone can join
And they come and they call and they fall on the floor
Don't you see when you're looking at me
That I'll never end transcend transcend
Ain't it strange oh oh oh
Ain't it strange oh oh oh
Come and join me, I implore thee,

Do you go to the temple tonight?
Oh no, I don't think so
Do you not go to the palace of answers with me Marie?
Oh no, I don't think so, no
See when they offer me book of gold,
I know soon still that platinum is coming
And when I look inside of your temple
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man,
And when he beckons his finger to me,
Well, I move in another direction,
I move in another dimension
I move in another dimension oh oh oh
I spin, I spiral, and I splatter
Hand of God, I feel the finger,
Hand of God, and I start to whirl
And I whirl, and I whirl,
Don't get dizzy, do not fall now,
Turn, God, God (strange)
Go, go on, go like a dervish,
Turn, God, (strange) make a move
Turn, Lord, (strange)
I don't get nervous
Oh I just move in another dimension
Come move in another dimension

Oh no, I don't think so, no
We'll go to the pagoda
The palace of answers with me, Marie
Oh no, I don't believe so, no
See when they offer me book of gold,
I know soon still that platinum is coming
And when I look inside of your temple
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man
And when he beckons his finger to me,
Well, I move in another dimension
I move in another dimension
I move in another dimension oh oh oh
Oh-oh-oh-ow
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone; let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention the reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
(Oh-oh-oh-ow)
You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know how your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
Into the abyss will I run!
Oh
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone; let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention the reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
Into the abyss will I run
I can't let you go
Yes I am stricken and can't let you go
You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do to me
'Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
Niggas commin' out worse off than when they went in
Over tha years I done alot of growin' up
Getten drunk thrown' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harassed me I just might go psycho
And when I gettem
I'll hittem with tha bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
They got me trapped...
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
Can barely walk tha city streets
Without a cop harassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
Bang bang, down another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
Who do you blame?
It's a shame because tha man's slain
He got caught in tha chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day I'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me?
I couldn't find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that
It's time I lett'em suffer tha payback
I'm tryin' to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Now I'm trapped and want to find a getaway
All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use tha phone
'Cause I'm sure someone is tappin in
Did it before
Ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
But now he's tha devils friend
Too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was tha ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin' Damn homies is dissin you
I fired my weapon
Started steppin' in tha hurricane
I got shot so I dropped
Feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin' for my getaway
Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today
Trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldn't see tha light
Thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
What do I do?
Live my life in a prison cell
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
They got me trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
Saw some guy on the TV yesterday
He's selling poison by the ton
"How can you do such a thing?" a woman asked
And he replied, "Well, the secret is to hook 'em young
Look, I'm not responsible for the lessons children learn
I'm just responsible for giving my investors some return."

Well, you'd never believe how much effort goes into
Adding some glamor to the brands
To distract you from the damage that they do
Putting their product in your hand
What other industry could ever get away
With contaminating their best customers this way?

Lately you've been acting in a role that's unbecoming
Of the girl who taught me there was so much in this world worth living.
The part that you've been playing has me dazed and missing you.
But now you're gone, gone, gone.
The promise never harvested in fallow fields shall lie.
In a shallow grave of stubble field and half-remembered lies.
A burning heart deceived me and you really put me on,
But now you're gone, gone, gone.
The memories are bittersweet;
The taste you leave is still stuck in my mouth.
I want to touch you, want to breathe you,
Say, "Fuck you I don't need you - get out... right now."
We were strangers when we met
And we were strangers when you left
Into a shadow world of painted girls and marionettes.
Used to pride myself on living a life without any regrets,
But now that's gone, gone, gone.
How can such sweet kisses come from such a poison tongue?
How can a bed of roses hurt so much to lie upon?
It was the thorn beneath the flower that I wasn't counting on.
And now you're gone, gone, gone.
The memories are bittersweet;
The taste you leave is still stuck in my mouth.
I want to touch you, want to breathe you,
Say, "Fuck you I don't need you - get out... right now."
The city's not the same,
But all the streets they know your name.
They ask me all about you, but my answers pull up lame.
I'm staggering in last night's clothes and it's starting to rain.
And you are gone, gone, gone.
If parted by a river that was running deep and wide,
I'd build a boat to get to you or else I'd drink it dry.
Could fill it back up right now as the tears fall from my eyes.
And you are gone, gone, gone.
The memories are bittersweet;
The taste you leave is still stuck in my mouth.
I want to touch you, want to breathe you,
Say, "Fuck you I don't need you - get out... right now."
Babe if we should meet again way on down the road.
Do me this one favor and pretend we never knowed.
I'll say that you remind me of a girl I knew so long ago,
But now she's gone, gone, gone

Moooooove! Ask the angels who they're calling, 
Go ask the angels if they're calling to thee 
Ask the angels while they're falling 
Who that person could possibly be 
And I know you got the feeling, 
You know, I feel it crawl across the floor 
And I know it got you reelin' 
And honey honey the call is for war 
And it's wild wild wild wild. 
Everybody got the feelin' 
You know the feeling and it's stronger each day 
Everybody wants to be reelin' 
And baby baby I'll show you the way 
And I know it's hard sometimes, 
You got a piece and hit across the sky 
And I know it's hard sometimes 
And world war is the battle cry 
And it's wild wild wild wild 
Across the country through the fields 
You know I see it written 'cross the sky 
People rising from the highway 
And war war is the battle cry 
And it's wild wild wild wild. 
Armageddon, it's gotten 
No savior jailer can take it from me 
World ending, it's just beginning 
And rock and roll is what I'm born to be 
And it's wild wild wild wild 
Wild wild wild wild X3 
Ask the angels if they're startin' to move 
Comin' in droves in from L.A. 
Ask the angels if they're starting to groove 
Lightning as armor and it's today 
It's wild wild wild wild 
Wild wild wild wild X3
I want you to know
That I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but
The best for you both
An older version of me? Is she perverted like me?
Would she go down on you in a theater?
Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died? But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well
Things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well
I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face, how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name 
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died? but you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Ooh
Ahh
Ooh ah
Oh ah ah
Ooh ah
Ah ah ah oh
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?
Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You told a lie
You make up stories
You say wake up

You're goin' 'round and 'round and you're comin' around
I gotta feel you right now; comin' around
I'm on fire. I'm comin' around. I'm on fire
I got nothin' to lose
There's so much at stake, why can't I make you feel used
I see your two eyes
I need a torchlight
They say I'm on, I'm off
I got the game the ladies all want
You're comin' around
You're goin' 'round and 'round and you're comin' around
I'm goin' 'round and 'round and I'm comin' around
I gotta feel you right now; comin' around
I'm on fire. I'm comin' around
It's somethin' within
I can tell you I like good night
A kiss and a simple goodbye.

All alone and you're waitin' for that call

You're so alive
You got the good juice.

I wanna tell ya 'bout a girl
You know, she lives in Room 29
Why, that's the one right up top a mine
I start to cry, I start to cry
O I hear her walkin'
Walkin' barefoot cross the floorboards
All through this lonesome night
I hear her crying too
Hot tears come splashin' down
Leakin' through the cracks
Down upon my face, I catch 'em in my mouth
Catch 'em in my mouth
Catch 'em in my mouth
I catch 'em in my mouth
Walk 'n' cry, walk 'n' cry
Walk 'n' cry, I walk 'n' cry
From her to eternity
From her to eternity
From her to eternity
I read her diary on her sheets
Scrutinizin' ev'ry li'l bit of dirt
Tore out a page 'n' stuffed it inside my shirt
I fled outta the window
And shinning it down the vine
Outta her nightmare and back into mine
Mine!
From her to eternity
From her to eternity
From her to eternity
Cry cry cry
Cry cry cry
She's wearin' them blue stockin's I bet
And standin' like this with my ear to the ceiling
Listen, Ih know it must sound absurd
But I can hear the most melancholy sound
I ever heard!
Walk 'n' cry
Walk 'n' cry
Kneel 'n' cry
Kneel 'n' cry
From her to eternity
From her to eternity
Oh tell me why?
Oh why, why, why
Tell me why
Why the ceiling still shakes? Shake shake shake
Why the fixtures turn to serpents and snakes?
This desire to possess her is a wound
And it's naggin' at me like a shrew
But I know that to possess her
Is, therefore, not to desire her
Oh, oh, oh then ya know, that li'l' girl would just have to go
Go go go
From her to eternity (go go go)
From her to eternity
From her to eternity (cry, cry, cry)
From her to eternity
From her to eternity
Her to eternity
From her to eternity
From her to eternity
From her to eternity
From her to eternity
From her
Don't you wanna go for a ride
Just keep your hands inside
And make the most out of life
Now don't you take it for granted
Life is like a mean machine
It made a mess outta me
It left me caught between
Like an angry dream I was stranded
I was stranded
And I'm steady but I'm starting to shake
And I don't know how much more I can take
This is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now you feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks
Don't you wanna go for a ride
Down to the other side
Feels so good you could cry
Now won't you do what I told you
I remember when you used to be shy
Yeah, once we were so fine
You and I why you gotta make it so hard on me
Yeah its hard on me
And I'm sorry but it's not a mistake
And I'm running but you're getting away
This is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now you feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks
This is how a heart breaks
You're not the best thing that I knew
Never was never cared too much
For all this hanging around
It's just the same thing all the time
Never get what I want
Never get too close to the end of the line
You're just the same thing that I knew
Back before the time when I was running from you
This is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now you feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks
Yeah this is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now you feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks (ooh) (ah yeah) (ooh)
This is how a heart breaks (ooh) (ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah)
(This is it yeah yeah this is it ooh)
This is how a heart breaks
(Ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah)
(Can't take it, Can't take it, Can't take it, Can't take it)
This is how a heart breaks (Can't take it no more) (ooh)
(Ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah)
This is how a heart breaks
(I can't take it, I can't take it, I can't take it, oh no)
This is how a heart breaks (Ooh)
This is how a heart breaks
This is how a heart breaks!

Put the rope around your neck and jump my nigga!
You're all going to die down here!
Get out, get out
You can't be in here

Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore?
Do you sleep do you count sheep anymore?
Do you sleep anymore?
Do you take plight on my tongue like lead?
Do you fall gracefully into bed anymore?
I saw you as you walked across my room
You looked out the window, you looked at the moon
And you sat on the corner of my bed 
And you smoked with the ghost in the back of my head
Now I don't know and I don't care
If I ever will see you again
I don't know and I don't care
If I ever will be there
Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore?
Do you sleep do you keep me anymore?
You kick my foot under the table
I kick you back can't say that I'm able
To stand for you or fall for you ever again
Wish for a perfect setting
Wishing that I am letting you
Take me where you want me all over again
You can't give yourself
Absolutely to someone else
Now I don't know and I don't care
If I ever will see you again
I don't know and I don't care
If I ever will be there
I saw you as you walked across my room
You looked out the window -- you looked at the moon
And you sat on the corner of my bed
And you smoked with the ghost in the back of my head
Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore?
Do you sleep do you count sheep anymore?
Do you sleep anymore?
I don't know (Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore?)
And I don't care (Do you sleep do you count sheep anymore?)
If I ever will be there (Do you sleep anymore?)
Will be there
You're livin' your life without a care in the world
That's the way it should be
What's life like in a candy swirl
What's life like to me
Everyone is slowing down
Look once at life on the ground
You all are the people, they're runnin' around
Not making a sound
Total hate! Total hate! Total hate!
You're movin' along, just goin' your own way
Don't try to change
You're jumpin', you're runnin', you learn to play
Never try to rearrange
You're getting tired and starting to drag
Slowing down and that's sad
You're walkin' around, you're being a skag
Huh - well that's not my bag
Total hate! Total hate! Total hate!
You don't even know me so don't hate me
Sublime rockin' No Doubt stylie
We do it Monday and on Friday
Get back to the show 'cause it's payday
11 o'clock, roll, roll it down
Rock the city with the number one sound
Long beat, long beach and it feels so fine
Rock this shit straight back to Anaheim
Total hate, total hate
You're so fake, you make me shake
Your faded face is so irate
You share with none, you have no one
You're living your life in total hate
Total hate! Total hate! Total hate! Total hate! Total hate!
Total hate! Total hate! Total hate! Total hate! Total hate!
Bo bo bo bo bo quandbass!
In the howlin' wind
Comes a stingin' rain
See it drivin' nails
Into the souls on the tree of pain.
From the firefly
A red orange glow
See the face of fear
Runnin' scared in the valley below
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue
In the locust wind
Comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome
You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire
We see them burnin' crosses
See the flames, higher and higher
Woh, woh, bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue
Suit and tie comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colours of a royal flush
And he's peelin' off those dollar bills
(Slappin' 'em down)
One hundred, two hundred.
And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
Across the tin huts as children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
Up the staircase to the first floor
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan
Outside, is America
Outside, is America
America
See across the field
See the sky ripped open
See the rain comin' through the gapin' wound
Howlin' the women and children
Who run into the arms
Of America.
There's a girl running around my head
I know she makes me frown
She may be crazy, she maybe not be right
She makes me feel like
Like a motherfucker from hell
Around her finger
She makes me sigh
Wih a look
The girl
She made me cry
She may be crazy, may treat me bad
She makes me feel like
Like a motherfucker from hell
Like the man said its just a shot away
It happens Lord everyday
And she says it feels good
Damn I make her feel all right
And it's a damn sight better than I got from you
Damn woman she makes me oh so blue
Like a motherfucker from hell
She got me down spinning out of control
That woman
The devils own
She maybe be crazy, she may not be right
She makes me feel like
Like a motherfucker from hel
Like the man said its just a shot away
It happens Lord everyday
And she says it feeels good
Damn I make her feel all right
And it's a damn sight better than I got from you
Damn woman she makes me oh so blue
Like a motherfucker from hell
Hey man, you know I'm really OK
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
But when I'm in my car, don't give me no crap
'Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap
When I go driving, I stay in my lane
But getting cut off; it makes me insane
Open the glove box
Reach inside
Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh ooh oh
They say the road's a dangerous place
If you flip me off, I'll get in your face
You drive on my ass
Your foot's on the gas
And your next breath is your last
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
Drivers are rude
Such attitudes
But when I show my piece
Complaints cease, something's odd
I feel like I'm God
You stupid dumbshit goddamn motherfucker!
I open the glove box
Reach inside
Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
Oh oh ooh oh
Fuck tha police comin' straight from the underground
A mother fucker got it bad 'cause I'm loud
I'm not a carbon copy so police think they have the authority
To kill a minority
Fuck that shit 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk mother fucker with a badge and a gun
To be beatin' on and throwin' in jail
We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of dough and a pager
Searchin my car lookin' for the product
Yeah mother fucker, I'm sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Then me and my friends
All rollin' in a benz
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of a the slaughter
Still gettin' strong off bread and water
I don't know if they're fags or what
Searchin' me down and grabbin' my nuts
A mother fucker on the war path
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a blood bath
Of cops dyin' on my way
Yeah I got somethin' to say
Fuck tha police
Fuck tha police
Fuck tha police
Fuck tha police
Fuck tha police and I said it with authority
Cause my people on the streets are the majority
Lights are flashin' behind me
But you're a scared little faggot so you mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work I just laugh
Cause it gives 'em a hint not to step in my path
Police I'm sayin' fuck you punk
Read my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club so you stand
With a fake ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk and I'm gonna fuck you up
Make you think I'm gonna kick your ass
But drop your gat and I'm gonna blast
Takin' out a police will make my day
A mother fucker like me don't give a fuck to say
Fuck tha police
Fuck tha police
Fuck tha police
FUCK THA POLICE (3x)

Wipe these tears from my eyes
Now is the time for me to rise to my feet
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes
I've got to take my life back
One chance to make it right

And bring meaning to this life

I never thought I'd change my opinion again 
But you moved me in a way that I've never known 
You moved me in a way that I've never known 
But straight away you just moved into position again 
You abused me in a way that I've never known 
You abused me in a way that I've never known 
So break me shake me hate me take me over 
When the madness stops, then you will be alone 
Just break me shake me hate me take me over 
When the madness stops, then you will be alone 
Oh-no oh-no oh-no
So you're the kind who deals with the games in the mind

You confused me in a way that I've never known
So break me shake me hate me take me over
When the madness stops, then you will be alone
So won't you break me shake me hate me take me over

You just keep me contemplatin', that your soul is slowly fadin'

Well the beat that my heart skipped sounded like this:
Every now and then I cower and I need to find empowerment
Empowerment is paramount to how I can begin to mount
A plan that I can implement
To make a dent on ignorance
Instead of drunk belligerence
And the dissidence of miscreants
Especially in this instance
Never ending persistence
To use the words in each sentence
As if they were blunt instruments
To beat a hole in their defence
Of this beauty and her innocence
Which serves to build resistance
In spite of all my good intents
The beat that my heart skipped
This is the beat that my heart skipped
This is the beat that my heart skipped
This is the beat that my heart skipped when we first met
Now that I've heard it, it leaves me with a kind of regret
No disrespect
But we just left a lot of people upset
What we had wasn't really what we'd come to expect
This is the beat that my heart skipped when we first met
Now that I've heard it, it leaves me with a kind of regret
No disrespect
But we just left a lot of people upset
What we had wasn't really what we'd come to expect
Well "good god damn" and other such phrases
I haven't heard a beat like this in ages
To miss such a beat would have been outrageous
When your heart skips a beat it's ruthless and aimless
She caught my attention in her fishnets
And then she reeled me in expecting nothing more than kissed necks and quick sex
But that weren't the case with this platinum princess
She'd attracted my interest
So I wanted to impress
Upon her all the positive things
That come from having more than just a one night fling
But that's something easier in theory than in practice
Since pick up lines are tactics
To get prey to the mattress
And this actress
Is practiced
In shunning such theatrics
When put upon daily by tactless geriatrics
So my genuine advances are met with po-faced scepticism
Throwing compliments but she just straight elects to miss them
Her lips were put on this earth for dispersing wisdom
God forbid I suggest she lets me kiss them
But I really want to know what she thinks of me
Because I'm loving every idiosyncrasy
But I ain't one to jump through hoops to make the first impression
Been there, done that, learnt the worst of lessons
We want to be loved for who we appear to be instead of who we are
Our real selves take a back seat behind the pomp and the façade
That's as true of the rude boys, downing pints and acting hard
As of the kids shunning convention with clinical disregard
This is the beat that my heart skipped
And it went...
This is the beat that my heart skipped when we first met
Now that I've heard it, it leaves me with a kind of regret
No disrespect
But we just left a lot of people upset
What we had wasn't really what we'd come to expect
Beat that my heart skipped when we first met
Now that I've heard it, it leaves me with a kind of regret
No disrespect
But we just left a lot of people upset
This is the beat that my heart skipped when we first met
Now that I've heard it, it leaves me with a kind of regret
No disrespect
But we just left a lot of people upset
What we had wasn't really what we'd come to expect
Beat that my heart skipped when we first met
Now that I've heard it, it leaves me with a kind of regret
No disrespect
But we just left a lot of people upset
What we had wasn't really what we'd come to expect
Every now and then I cower and I need to find empowerment
Empowerment is paramount to how I can begin to mount
A plan that I can implement
To make a dent on ignorance
Instead of drunk belligerence
And the dissidence of miscreants
Especially in this instance
Never ending persistence
To use the words in each sentence
As if they were blunt instruments
To beat a hole in their defence
Of this beauty and her innocence
Which serves to build resistance
In spite of all my good intents
The beat that my heart skipped
This is the beat that my heart skipped
Ich lieg' in meiner Kotze
Keine Ahnung wo ich bin
Meine Unterhose hängt mir auf den Knien
Im Badezimmer rauscht die Dusche
Wem gehört die Frauenstimme
Warum halte ich ein Messer
Das macht doch keinen Sinn
Hat der Wahnsinn mich endlich eingeholt
Ich kann mich nicht bewegen
Mein Herz sprengt mir die Brust
Und es stinkt nach Kotze, Sex und Blut
Das klopfen dröhnt in meinen Ohren
'ne Tür wird aufgetreten
Auf dem Schrank sitzt meine Mutter
Sie betet - mein Gott, sie betet
Hat der Wahnsinn mich endlich eingeholt
Why don't you say your name
Ist es gottes Wille
Wem gehör'n die Drogen
Schreit der Mann, der aussieht wie ein Polizist
Und dann das Mädchen aus der Dusche
Mit Brüsten groß wie Basketbälle
Lächelt mich an, als wäre nichts gescheh'n
Hat der Wahnsinn mich endlich eingeholt
Why don't you say your name
Hat es zweck zu fliehen
Mit meinen blut'gen Füßen
Würde ich doch überall erkannt
Werd' lieber niederknie'n
Das Schwert in meinen Händen
Und wie ein Samurai
Auf wiederseh'n
Hat der Wahnsinn mich endlich eingeholt
Why don't you say your name
Our lives run different ways
Through the rain I see you in the sun
Our star shines anyway
If you wish upon it, we are one
One, two, three, four
Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide
I find it such a shame
Through the pain I see things as they are
We're served up on a plate
The pedestal is high enough to fall
And if in time
We can see the errors of our ways
Would anyone change it anyhow?
Our time is up... one, two, three, four
Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide
Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide
I bet you'd only run
If you saw what goes inside our own
I bet you'd lead the way
If it were up to you to decide
But it's not
Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide
Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide
Like a silver flame
Like a suicide
Like you're giving more
One, two, three, four
I only wish for snow to fall
On the palm trees in the dirt
But here the sun will always shine (It'll always shine)
Even if with the clouds it flirts
For Shangri-LA is always dry
It doesn't cry like me
In Hell-LA the sun is always there (It's always there)
Scalding the deep green sea
I'll never be a snowflake
And waltz to earth so gently
To form a perfect blanket
For someone else to walk on
I close my eyes to feel the cold
On the palm of my blue hand
But the breeze it blows straight through my hair (through my hair)
And buries in the sand
I'll never be a snowflake
And waltz to earth so gently
To form a perfect blanket
For someone else to walk on
I've lost my mind in wanderlust
My heart cannot be found
My body yearns for the warmth of snow
But the sun keep pouring down
These streets have signs that point somewhere
But there I don't belong
And there's no more use
To curl your hair
When your innocence is gone
I only wish for snow to fall
On the palm trees in the dirt
But here the sun will always shine (always shine)
Even if with clouds it flirts
I'll never be a snowflake
And waltz to earth so gently
To form a perfect blanket
For someone else to walk on
I'll never be a snowflake
And waltz to earth so gently
To form a perfect blanket
For someone else to walk on
I've got word of thanks
Thanks that I'd like to say
For the rage that I feel
The rage that I feel today
Gotta stack, gotta stack
Stack of chips on my shoulder
In everything I do
'Cause I made, I made
I made the mistake of trusting you
People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just burn
Yeah, my layers are thick
And I've got bad attitude
Yeah, that knife in my back
Has fingerprints that belong to you
Got a grudge, got a grudge
Got a grudge that I'm holding
For as long as I live
'Cause you lied, you lied
You lied to my face
And it's something that I can't forgive
People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just burn!
Is it worth it, can you even hear me?
Standing with your spotlight on me
Not enough to feed the hungry 
I'm tired and I've felt it for a while now
In this sea of lonely 
The taste of ink is getting old 
It's four o' clock in the fucking morning
Each day gets more and more like the last day
Still I can see it coming
While I'm standing in the river drowning 
This could be my chance to break out
This could be my chance to say goodbye 
At last it's finally over
Couldn't take this town much longer
Being half dead wasn't what I planned to be
Now I'm ready to be free
So here I am, it's in my hand 
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last
And I'll savor every moment of this
And won't you think I'm pretty 
When I'm standing top the bright lit city
And I'll take your hand and pick you up
And keep you there so you can see
As long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there
We'll drink and dance the night away, drink and dance the night away
So here I am, it's in my hand 
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last
And I'll savor every moment of this
Savor every moment of this
As long as you're alive 
Here I am
I promise I will take you there
As long as you're alive 
Here I am
I promise I will take you there
And won't you think I'm pretty 
When I'm standing top the bright lit city
And I'll take your hand and pick you up
And keep you there so you can see it
As long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there
As long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there
So here I am, it's in my hand 
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last
And I'll savor every moment of this
Savor every moment of this
Savor every moment of this
Savor every moment of this
Back in school they never taught us what we needed to know
Like how to deal with despair or someone breakin your heart
Twelve years I've held it all together,
But a night like this is beggin to pull me apart.
I played it quiet left you deep in conversation
I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen
I remember I kept thinking that I know you never would
And now I know I want to kill you like only a best friend could
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
As if it happening wasn't enough
I gotta go and write a song just to remind myself how bad it sucked.
Ignore the sun, covers over my head
Wrote a message on my pillow that says "Jesse, stay asleep in bed"
Don't apologize - I hope you choke and die
Search your shelf for something which to hang yourself
They say you need to pray if you want to go to heaven
But they don't tell you what to say when your whole life has gone to Hell
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
So is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
'Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in eleven-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt
And again when your head goes through the windshield
Is that what you call tact?
You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back
So let's end this call and end this conversation
And is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed
When you say "best friends" means friends forever
Is that what you call a getaway?!?
Tell me what you got away with
'Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in eleven-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt
And again when your head goes through the windshield!
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
*30 seconds of Bush news snippets*
"I understand that time is running out"
"Ooh look, it's the president! Hey Mr. President!"
"Okay, there he go. Easy, easy, don't lose sight, wait
Two, three and... NOW!"
*Gunshots, screaming*
Check it out (P Dog)
Here I go, an angry brother finna make his move (P Dog)
But can I buck him in the city so I never lose? (P Dog)
See I'm a get him the crowd with a couple heavies (P Dog)
And lay the barrel to the ground, hold the gat steady (P Dog)
And now I'm ready for my adversary, talk is cheap (P Dog)
I'm looking for a way to make a plan and keep it neat (P Dog)
And check it out and make around and pick a rooftop (P Dog)
And get a spot where the view's hot, set up shop
Cause all I wanna see is motherfucking brains hanging
Another level when it's me and Devils gangbanging
So don't be telling me to get the non-violent spirit
'Cause when I'm violent is the only time the devils hear it (P Dog)
Rat-tat-tat goes the gat to his devil's face (P Dog)
I hope he think about how he done us when he lay to waste (P Dog)
And get the feeling of the peeling from the other side (P Dog)
From guns given to my people from my own kind (P Dog)
So get with Ollie 'cause I'm probably fin to make you mad (P Dog)
I'm steady waiting for the day I get to see his ass (P Dog)
And give him two from the barrel of a black guerrilla (P Dog)
And that's real from the motherfucking Bush Killa
*Laughing* "I understand that time is running out"
Now who is able to make war with the beast?
It starts with "P"
Trumpets sound when I push the program
And set my sight on a serpent man
Swinging the sword of the righteous
Make devils drop and they just can't spite this
Genocide and the minds of men make
Brothers like me fill up with hate
I smell a skunk in the air
Cause your program still ain't fair
So who you wanna blame for the Hate That Hate Made?
When P let off and pigs get sprayed
Y'all wanna kill off the black man?
But I know your master plan
So we'll see who stops the black guerrilla
P Dog the Bush Killa
It's P Dog the Bush Killa
Tolerance is getting thinner
Cause Iraq never called me "nigger"
So what I wanna go off and fight a war for?
You best believe I got your draft card
So bad to hate somebody else
But much worse to hate yourself
Victim to the mentacide of the double-wide
Most black folks be made to die
Keeping 'em on and on
Keeping ya on and on
Now my brother down south said "Fuck the Police"
I'm saying "No Justice, No Peace"
So why'd you stick 'em like that?
Cause everybody want to get the black
But we'll see who stop the black guerrilla
P Dog the Bush Killa
"He's been shot!" "The president is dead"
Yeah, it's P Dog the Bush Killa
"Nodbody move, just stay where you are"
So where's he at? I just might wait for
His motherfucking ass on a rooftop next tour
Bucking stone 'cause I'm known to play for keeps
Lay low to the flow and keep it neat
And send his ass home belly up
Should've listened to the facts that the black's been telling ya
It's no surprise that a brother's got wise
Now rat-tat-tat-tat, it's an eye for an eye
Now I'm in it, got to die before we see
That motherfuckers don't give a damn for you or me
So wear a vest on your chest and the rest stand still
For P Dog the Bush Killa

I am what I am, so I...
Spit you out!
Do I, cut the ties? or do I, hold on tight?!
Time has come for me to realize
All those things I loved I now despise
But it's, my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's, our, time!
(To rise above!)
It's, my, life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's, our, time!
Your pictures on my wall
With this around me I don't feel it's over
I've never felt this way before
With you around me I don't feel it's over
I am what I am, so I...
Spit you out!
Can you justify how I...
Time has come for me to realize
All those things I loved I now despise
But it's, my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's, our, time!
(To rise above!)
It's, my, life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's, our, time!
Your pictures on my wall
With this around me I don't feel it's over
I've never felt this way before
With you around me I don't feel it's over now!
The end!
I know you're faking!
You try to get me back!
I know you're faking it!
The end!
(..Feel it's over..)
(..Feel it's over..)
(Bullet for my Valentine! *crowd cheering*)
(How ya doin' everyone?! *crowd cheers again*)
But it's, my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's, our, time!
(To rise above!)
It's, my, life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's, our, time!
To rise above!
I'm in the same old mess again
Another love has reached the end
You never really gave a damn
I thought you were a better man
Oh no, you got me in a headlock
Checking my alarm clock
Now there's nothing
It don't mean a thing 'cause I don't wanna mess around with a joker
And I don't really care 'cause this is my life not a game of poker
And I don't give a damn, my heart made me drunk but my mind is sober
So can you get the jist, imma make a move 'cause the game is over
I gave you 20, 000 chances
And put up with your cheating glances
So open up that prison door
'Cause I don't love you anymore
Oh no, you got me in a headlock
Checking my alarm clock
Now there's nothing
It don't mean a thing 'cause I don't wanna mess around with a joker
And I don't really care 'cause this is my life not a game of poker
And I don't give a damn, my heart made me drunk but my mind is sober
So can you get the jist, imma make a move 'cause the game is over
Oh no, I've started a war
My emotions are just cuttin' me raw
Oh no, you lowered your score
'Cause you messed up good and I cannot ignore
Oh no, tears galore
But I changed my mind 'cause he's broken the law
Oh no, I've seen it before
And your system's 'bout to crash to the floor
Crash to the floor
Crash to the floor
Crash to the floor
It don't mean a thing 'cause I don't wanna mess around with a joker
And I don't really care 'cause this is my life not a game of poker
And I don't give a damn, my heart made me drunk but my mind is sober
So can you get the jist, imma make a move 'cause the game is over
I've always said after we tear it down, burn it to the ground
That we'll dance of the ashes of this town
Our patience is wearing thin as we all drown
Home's only home till you're sick
Of the sound of the peeling ground
And we're waiting around pushing our lives down and down
Hold on for dear life / My hands are blue and I...
I've never been so cold / I've never felt this way before
You've got that look again in your eyes...
Where everything that I say could just kill it all
Unless this kills us all
Well you know that the world
Doesn't end at the end of your block
But is your life the one that feels like a ticking clock?
I think its time to cut out those envious eyes
And I wouldn't be surprised if you were utterly shocked
When this plane Crashes down there goes all our luck
When you watch the smile fade from their face...
Everything that I say could kill it all
It'll kill us all
I'm the singer, I'm the singer in the band
You're the loser, I won't dismiss you out of hand
'Cause you've got a beautiful faith
It will take you places
You kept running
You've got money, you've got fame
Every morning I see your picture from the train
Now you're an actress!
So says your résumé
You're made of card
You couldn't act your way out of a paper bag
You got lucky, you ain't talking to me now
Little Miss Plucky
Pluck your eyebrows for the crowd
Get on the airplane
You give me stomach pain
I wish that you were here
We would have had a lot to talk about
We had a deal there
We nearly signed it with our blood...
An understanding
I thought that you would keep your word
I'm disappointed
I'm aggravated
It's a fault I have, I know
When things don't go my way I have to
Blow up in the face of my rivals
I swear and I rant, I make quite an arrival
The men are surprised by the language
They act so discreet, they are hypocrites so fuck them too!
I always loved you
You always had a lot of style
I'd hate to see you on the pile
Of 'nearly-made-it' s
You've got the essence, dear
If I could have a second skin
I'd probably dress up in you
You're a star now, I am fixing people's nails
I'm knitting jumpers, I'm working after hours
I've got a boyfriend, I've got a feeling that he's seeing someone else
He always had a thing for you as well
Blow in the face of my rivals
I swear and I rant, I make quite an arrival
The men are surprised by the language
They act so discreet, they are hypocrites forget them
So fuck them too
(Puff) Bad Boy baby
(Big) Yeah... yeah...
Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah...
(Puff) Yeah... B.I.G. 2000
B.I.G. 2000 Born Again... c'mon...
Chorus: Notorious B.I.G.
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
(Notorious B.I.G.)
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace... smack the bitch in the face;
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, "The Vapors"
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Make up to break up {*singing in background*} niggaz need to wake up
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins till amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits!
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
Suckin on the tits! Had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was "Humpin Around" and "Jump-in Around"
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)
(Notorious B.I.G.)
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that... (no question)
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya till you're gushy, so please don't push... me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?
(Eminem)
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin: horse's heads,
Human sacrifices, cannibalism; candles and exorcism
Animals having sex with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fucking, meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lying, I got a nine in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dying to cock him
Who's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, red on the third;
Then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong
Chorus (to fade)
﻿Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor

Hey, go, hey, go, hey, go, hey, go
This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
Said it was blue when the blood was red
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through your head
Blasted through your head, blasted through your head
I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen, you was mesmerized
Cellular phone soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold turn you to stone before you realize
They load the clip in omnicolor
Said they pack the 9, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And motherfuckers lost their minds
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?", yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Run it
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Check-a, check-a, check it out
They load the clip in omnicolor
Said, they pack the 9, they fire it at the prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And muthafuckers lost their minds
No escape from the mass mind rape
Play it again jack and then rewind the tape
And then play it again and again and again
Until your mind gets locked in
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
Buyin' all the products that they sellin' ya
They say jump and you say how high
You brain dead? You gotta fuckin' bullet in your head?
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?", yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Uh
Yeah
Shit
What?
Standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Bowin' down to the flag
You got a bullet in your head
Standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Bowin' down to the flag
You got a bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head

You gotta bullet in your fuckin' head
Yeah
Yeah
It's just one of those days
When you don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked
Everybody sucks
You don't really know why
But you wanna justify
Rippin' someone's head off
No human contact
And if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away
Motherfucker
It's just one of those days
It's all about the he-said
She-said bullshit
I think you better quit
Lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin'
With a fat lip
It's all about the he-said
She-said bullshit
I think you better quit
Talkin' that shit
It's just one of those days
Feelin' like a freight train
First one to complain
Leaves with a blood stain
Damn right, I'm a maniac
You better watch your back
'Cause I'm fucking up
Your program
And if you're stuck up
Your just locked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away
Motherfucker
It's just one of those days
It's all about the he-said
She-said bullshit
I think you better quit
Lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin'
With a fat lip
It's all about the he-said
She-said bullshit
I think you better quit
Talkin' that shit, punk
So come and get it
I feel like shit
My suggestion
Is to keep your distance
'Cause right now I'm dangerous
We've all felt like shit
And been treated like shit
All those motherfuckers
Who want to step up
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day
Keeps goin' this way
I just might
Break somethin' tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day
Keeps goin' this way
I just might
Break somethin' tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day
Keeps going this way
I just might
Break your fuckin' face tonight
Give me stuff to break
Give me stuff to break
Just give me stuff to break
How 'bout your fuckin' face
I hope you know
I'm like a chainsaw
(What)
A chainsaw
(What)
A motherfuckin' chainsaw
(What)
So come and get it
It's all about the he-said
She-said bullshit
I think you better quit
Lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin'
With a fat lip
It's all about the he-said
She-said bullshit
I think you better quit
Talkin' that shit, punk
So come and get it
Aight, man, whatever...
Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me
And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses."
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city
Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"
And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians
Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
I want you to know
That I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but
The best for you both
An older version of me? Is she perverted like me?
Would she go down on you in a theater?
Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died? But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well
Things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well
I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face, how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name 
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died? but you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Ooh
Ahh
Ooh ah
Oh ah ah
Ooh ah
Ah ah ah oh
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?
Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
K-L-O-N, Los Angeles, KLONE Radio. We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else.
Hey, all right, it's Kip Kasper, KLONE Radio, LA's infinite repeat. How we feelin' out there? How's your drive-time commute? I need a saga. What's the saga? It's Songs for the Deaf. You can't even hear it!
Dead bull with the life from the low
I'll be massive conquistador
Give me soul and show me the door
Metal heavy, soft at the core
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Pressurize and neutralize
Deep fried, gimme some more
Space flunky, four on the floor
Fortified with the liquor store
This one's down, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Shrunken head, I love to adore
B-movie, gimme some gore
Gimme toro, gimme some more
B-movie, gimme some gore
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Nothin' suffocates you more than
The passin' of everyday human events
And isolation is the oxygen mask
You make your children breathe in to survive
But I'm not a slave
To a God who doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit
And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
You'll never grow up to be a big rock star
Celebrated victim of your fame
They'll just cut our wrists like cheap coupons
And say that death was on sale today
And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds
But I'm not a slave
To a God who doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of millions is just a statistic
But I'm not a slave
To a God who doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit
I'm not a slave
To a God who doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Don't fret, precious, I'm here
Step away from the window
(Step away from the window)
Go back to sleep
Lay your head down, child, I won't let the boogeymen come
Counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums
Pay no mind to the rabble, pay no mind to the rabble
Head down, go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums
Pay no mind what other voices say
They don't care about you, like I do (like I do)
Safe from pain and truth and choice and other poison devils
See, they don't give a fuck about you, like I do
Just stay with me
Safe and ignorant
Go back to sleep
Go back to sleep
Lay your head down, child, I won't let the boogeymen come
Count the bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums
Pay no mind to the rabble, pay no mind to the rabble
Head down, go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums
I'll be the one to protect you from
Your enemies and all your demons
I'll be the one to protect you from
A will to survive and a voice of reason
I'll be the one to protect you from
Your enemies and your choices, son
They're one and the same, I must isolate you
Isolate and save you from yourself
Swayin' to the rhythm of the new world order and
Count bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums
The boogeymen are comin', the boogeymen are comin'
Keep your head down, go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums
Stay with me
Safe and ignorant
Just stay with me
Hold you and protect you from the other ones
The evil ones
Don't love you, son
Go back to sleep

Some children died the other day
We fed machines and then we prayed
Puked up and down in morbid faith
You should have seen the ratings that day
Some children died the other day

Puked up and down in morbid faith

I met a boy wearing Vans, 501's
And a dope Beastie tee, nipple rings, new tattoos
That claimed that he was OGT
Back from '92, from the first EP
And in between sips of Coke
He told me that he thought we were sellin' out
Layin' down, suckin' up
To the man
Well now I've got some advice for you, little buddy
Before you point the finger
You should know that I'm the man
I'm the man, and you're the man, and he's the man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass
All you know about me is what I've sold you
Dumb fuck
I sold out long before you ever even heard my name
I sold my soul to make a record
Dipshit
And then you bought one
I've got some advice for you, little buddy
Before you point your finger
You should know that I'm the man
If I'm the fuckin' man
Then you're the fuckin' man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass
All you know about me is what I've sold you
Dumb fuck
I sold out long before you ever even heard my name
I sold my soul to make a record
Dipshit
And then you bought one
All you read and wear
Or see and hear on TV
Is a product begging
For your fatass dirty dollar
Shut up and
Buy, buy, buy, my new record
Buy, buy, buy
Send more money
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy

Every official that comes in
Cripples us leaves us maimed
Silent and tamed
And with our flesh and bones
He builds his homes
Southern fist rise through tha jungle mist
Clenched to smash power so cancerous
A black flag and a red star
A rising sun loomin' over Los Angeles
'Cause for Raza livin in La La
Is like Gaza on to tha dawn of Intifada
Reach for tha lessons tha masked pass on
And seize the metropolis, it's you that it's built on
Everything can change on a new year's day
As everything changed on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
And everything changed on a new year's day, come on
War within a breath, it's land or death
War within a breath, it's land or death
War within a breath, it's land or death
War within a breath, it's land
Their existence is a crime
Their seat, their robe, their tie
Their land deeds, their hired guns
They're the crime
Shots heard underground round the rapture
Tha world's eye captured at last in a Mexican pasture
Tha masked screaming land or death
Within a breath, a war from the depth of time
Who shot four puppets in a line
Who shook all tha world bankers who think they can rhyme
Shot tha landlords who knew it was mine
Yes, it's a war from tha depth of time
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
And everything can change on a new year's day, yeah
War within a breath, it's land or death

Check on two, one two
Lick off the shot my stories shock ya like Ellison
Main line adrenaline Gaza to Tienanmen
From the basement I'm dwellin' in
I cock back the sling to stone a settler
And breaks him off clean, call me the upsetter
Here comes the hands on the leashes
The cross, the capital, the pale families
The fear and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch, the cell doors crash
And the master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo
Roll right, roll call
But now we're alright, we're all calm
Roll right, roll call
And now we're alright, we're all calm
This hits like fists bomb with the left and don't miss
With the sickest stilo I spark fear like pigs in the park
Head crack, I hijack the papers
The vapors caught fire up in your mind
Come back rewind one time
Here comes the hands on the leashes
The cross, the capital, the pale families
The fear and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch, the cell doors crash
And the master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo
Roll right, roll call
We're alright, we're all calm
Roll right, roll call
We gotta take 'em to tha seventh level
We gotta take 'em to tha seventh level
For their lives and my lives were never settled
Come on, don't freeze when zero hour comes
Come on, come on, don't freeze when zero hour comes
Come on
Send 'em to the seventh level
Send 'em to the seventh level
Send 'em to the seventh level
Send 'em to the seventh level
For their lives and my lives were never settled
What I want from you, is empty your head
But they say be true, don't stain your bed
And we do what we need to be free
And it leans on me like a rootless tree
What I want from us, is empty our minds
But we fake, we fuss, and fracture the times
We go blind when we've needed to see
And this leans on me, like a rootless...
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
And all we've been through
I said leave it, leave it, leave it
It's nothing to you
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Hate me so good
That you just let me out
Let me out, let me out
It's hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
What I want from this, is learn to let go
No, not of you, of all that's been told
Killers re-invent and believe
And this leans on me, like a rootless...
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
And all we've been through
I said leave it, leave it, leave it
It's nothing to you
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Hate me so good
That you just let me out
Let me out, let me out
It's hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
It's hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out

It's nothing to you
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Hate me so good
That you just let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out

I don't care what you do

No, nothing ever shames me
Don't want a thing from you

I don't care if you're angry
Oh, oh
I'm getting out
No, nothing ever shames me

That cheating gets it faster
I'm never coming back
I'm never giving in
I'll never be the shine in your spit
I disconnect the act
I disconnect the dots
I disconnect the me in me
You're mistaken
It's you that's faking, living, breathing, dying too
This message is for anyone who dares to hear a fool
You can't bring me back
You can't bring me back 'cause I give it all back to you
Through sacred alleys, the living wrecks, yeah, wreak their havoc upon this world
The disenchanted, the romantics
The body and face and soul of you is gone down that deep black hole
Destroy the mind, destroy the body but you cannot destroy the heart
Destroy the mind, destroy the body but you cannot destroy the heart
And you, you make it so I need to disconnect
And you make it so real, I don't need your love to disconnect
To runaround kids in get-go cars
With vaseline afterbirths and neon coughs
Galaxies full of nobodies giving us the farewell runarounds
And I took a Virgin Mary axe to his sweet baby Jane
Lost my innocence to a no-good girl
Scratch my face with anvil hands
And coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouth
And I give it all back to you
I give it all back to you, yeah
I give it all back to you
And for you
No way, I don't need it, I don't need your love to disconnect
And you make it so real, I don't need your love to disconnect
No way, no way, no way, yeah yeah, to disconnect
And you make it so real, I don't need your love to disconnect
No way, no way, no way, yeah yeah, to disconnect, yeah
Spoken:
A lot of people ask me, stupid fuckin' questions.
A lot of people think that, what I say on record, or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life, or that I believe in it.
Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody that, I'm actually gonna do it, or that I believe in it.
Well shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you, you know why?
'Cause I'm a criminal
Criminal, you goddamn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah I'm a criminal
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or les
Or a homosex-, hermaph- or a trans-a-ves
Pants or dress, "Hate fags?", the answer's yes
Homophobic, nah you're just hetero-phobic 
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (Ooh!) 
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you better let go of 'em 
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em
Hey it's me Versace, whoops somebody shot me
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it, checkin' the 'male' (clicks tongue twice)
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail
Come on relax guy, I like gay men 
Right Ken, give me an amen (AAA-men!) 
Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus 
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons 
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
'Cause, I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (Duh)
And to think, it's just little ole me
Mr. Don't-Give-A-Fuck, still won't leave
I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
My mother did drugs, hard liquor cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you s'posed to grow up when you weren't raised
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee, now don't ignore me you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white blonde-haired and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die in plane crashes
And laughs as long as it ain't happen to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-
-inem and Kim combined, *kch* the maniac's in
In place of the doc, because Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place
(Mm-mm-mmm!) Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thing put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh
I'm a criminal
Spoken by Eminem, Dr. Dre, & (Teller)
Aight look... Uh huh?
Just go up in that motherfucker, get the motherfuckin' money and get the fuck up outta there. Aight.
I'll be right here waitin' on you. Aight.
Yo, Em! What?! Don't kill nobody this time! Aright!
God damn, this motherfucker gets on my fuckin' nerves.
*Whistling* (Hi!) How you doin'?
(How can I help you?) Yeah I need to make a withdrawal.
(Okay.) Put the fuckin' money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you!
(What? Oh my god, don't kill me!) I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin' around.
(Don't kill me, I have two kids at home, don't kill me.) I said I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you, hurry the fuck up!
*BOOM* Thank you!
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it, I'll hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Then fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards brats pests
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck *Clucking*
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask
I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I am a criminal
Cast the pearls aside
Of a simple life of need
Come into my life forever
The crumbled cities stand as known
Of the sights you have been shown
Of the hurt you call your own, you know, you know
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
The empty bodies stand at rest
Casualties of their own flesh
Afflicted by their dispossession
But no bodies ever knew
No bodies
No bodies felt like you
No bodies
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is, oh
Now we drive the night
To the ironies of peace
You can't help deny forever
The tragedies reside in you
The secret sights hide in you
The lonely nights divide you in two, in two, in two
All my blisters now revealed
In the darkness of my dreams
In the spaces in between us
No bodies ever knew
No bodies
No bodies felt like you
No bodies
No bodies ever knew
No bodies
No bodies felt like you
No bodies
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide

[I want to edit metadata]
And the sky was made of amethyst
And all the stars look just like little fish
You should learn when to go
You should learn how to say no
Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever
Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever
When they get what they want, they never want it again
When they get what they want, they never want it again
Go on, take everything, take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything, I want you to
And the sky was all violet
I wanna give the violet more violence
Hey, I'm the one with no soul
One above and one below
Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever
Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever
When they get what they want, and they never want it again
When they get what they want, and they never want it again
Go on, take everything, take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything, I dare you to
I told you from the start just how this would end
When I get what I want then I never want it again
Go on, take everything, take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything, take everything, take everything, take everything
I don't wanna talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue every time you come around
'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground
Blood
Blood, hoo
Hand over my heart, I swear I've tried everything
I could within all my power
Two weeks and one hour I slaved
And now I've got nothing to show
Oh, if only you'd grow taller than a brick wall
From now on, gonna start holding my breath
When you come around and you flex that fake grin
'Cause something inside me has said more than twice
That breathing less air beats breathing you at all
I don't wanna talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue every time you come around
'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground
Hand over my mouth, I'm earning
The right to my silence in quiet discerning
Between ego and timing
Good judgment is once again proving to me
That it's still worth it's weight in gold
From now on I'm gonna be so much more weary
When you start to speak and my warm blood starts to boil
Seeing you is like pulling teeth
And hearing your voice is like chewing tin foil, oh
I don't wanna talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue every time you come around
'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground
Blood
Ooh
High fives to a better judgment
By saying less today, I will gain more, gain more
Low twos to you my, my fickle friend, yeah
You, you brought the art of silent war
I don't wanna talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue every time you come around
'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground
Blood
Blood
Ever since I was young
Your word is the word that always won
Worry and wake the ones you love
A phone call I'd rather not receive
Please use my body while I sleep
My lungs are fresh and yours to keep
Kept clean and they will let you breathe
Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry?
I am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind
Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
So I sat alone and waited out the night
The best part of what has happened was
The part I must have missed
So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around
I'm not writing my goodbyes
I submit no excuse
If this is what I have to do
I owe you every day I wake
If I could I would shrink myself
Sink through your skin to your blood cells
Remove whatever makes you hurt
But I am too weak to be your cure
Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry?
I am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind
Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
So I sat alone and waited out the night
The best part of what has happened was
The part I must have missed
So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around
I'm not writing my goodbyes
I'm not letting you check out
You will beat this starting now
And you will always be around
I'm there to monitor your breathing
I will watch you while you're sleeping
I will keep you safe and sound
Does anybody remember back when you were very young?
Did you ever think that you would be this blessed?
Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
So I sat alone and waited out the night
The best part of what has happened was
The part I must have missed
So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around
I'm not writing my goodbyes
How do, how do you do?
My name is you
The flies, they all gather around me
And you too
You can't see anything well
You ask me what size it is, not what I sell
The flies, they all gather around me
And you too
Well, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
Yeah, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
But the devil's apprentice, he gave me some credit
He fed me along and I'll probably regret it
I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
Yeah, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
Everyday I wake up
Feeling this way
I take it downtown
With all the action going down
I strike a match, strike a match, cook it up
(My life) I'm feeling so sick (your life)
I feel so fucking sick (my life, your life)
On the bathroom floor
Try to get out and get right
Hustling little girls
Cheating little boys, yeah
Gotta get out
Gotta get out and get right
Gotta get out
I gotta get out no more
No more, no more
(My life) I'm feeling so sick (your life)
On the bathroom floor (my life)
And I'm feeling so sick (your life)
No more
(High life, low life)
(High life, low life)
(High life, low life)
(My life) I'm feeling so sick (your life)
And I feel so sick (my life)
No, no more (your life)
She comes along, she gets inside
She makes you better than anything you've tried
It's in her kiss, black as sea
And it runs deeper than you dared to dream it could be
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
Wave goodbye to what you were
The rules have changed, the lines begin to blur
She makes you hard, it comes on strong
You finally found the place where you belong
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
She will not let you go
Keeps on and on
She will not let you go
Keeps on and on
This time I'm not coming back
She will not let you go
This time I'm not coming back
She will not let you go
What ever poison's in this bottle will leave me broken, sore and stiff
But it's the genie at the bottom who I'm sucking at
He owes me one last wish
So here's a present to let you know I still exist
I hope the next boy that you kiss has something terribly contagious on his lips
But I got a plan (I got a plan)
To drink for forty days and forty nights
A sip for every second-hand tick
And every time you fed the line, "you mean so much to me"
I'm without you
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date, who would do anything you say
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date, who would do anything you say
And even if her plane crashes tonight she'll find some way to disappoint me
By not burning in the wreckage
Or drowning at the bottom of the sea
"Jess, I still taste you, and thus reserve my right to hate you
And all this empty space that you create does nothing for my flawless sense of style."
It's 8:45 (it's 8:45)
The weather is getting better by the hour (rains all the time)
I hope it rains there all the time
And if you ever said you missed me then don't say you never lied
I'm without you
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date, who would do anything you say
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date, who would do anything you say
Who would do anything you say
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date who would do anything you say
Tell all the English boys you meet
About the American boy back in the states
The American boy you used to date who would do anything you say
Who would do anything you say
Getting a little erratic here
And I don't know who to trust
I guess they got a way of reading my mind
I guess I gotta adjust
Got my arms they flip flop flip flop flip
Got my head on a spring
Well I thought I got you on my side
I haven't got fucking anything
I'm just a face in the crowd
Nothing to worry about
Not even tryin' to stand out
I'm getting smaller and smaller and smaller
And I have nothing to say
It's all been taken away
I just behave and obey
I'm afraid I am starting to fade away
Uh-huh
I cannot see through the cracks
When I'm pressed up on the wall
I'm not looking to stand up real high
I'd be happy to crawl
I think I'm losing my grip
But I can still make a fist
You know I still got my one good arm
That I can beat, I can beat myself up with
I'm just a face in the crowd
Nothing to worry about
Not even tryin' to stand out
I'm getting smaller and smaller and smaller
And I have nothing to say
It's all been taken away
I just behave and obey
I'm afraid I am starting to fade away
And for what it is worth
I really used to believe
That maybe there's some great thing
That we could achieve
And now I can't tell the difference
Don't know what to feel
Between what I've been trying so hard to see
And what appears to be real
Fading away
Fading away
Fading away
Fading away
My world is getting smaller everyday
(And that's okay)
My world is getting smaller everyday
(And that's okay)
My world is getting smaller everyday
My world is getting smaller everyday
And that's okay
Back in school they never taught us what we needed to know
Like how to deal with despair or someone breakin your heart
Twelve years I've held it all together,
But a night like this is beggin to pull me apart.
I played it quiet left you deep in conversation
I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen
I remember I kept thinking that I know you never would
And now I know I want to kill you like only a best friend could
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
As if it happening wasn't enough
I gotta go and write a song just to remind myself how bad it sucked.
Ignore the sun, covers over my head
Wrote a message on my pillow that says "Jesse, stay asleep in bed"
Don't apologize - I hope you choke and die
Search your shelf for something which to hang yourself
They say you need to pray if you want to go to heaven
But they don't tell you what to say when your whole life has gone to Hell
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
So is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
'Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in eleven-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt
And again when your head goes through the windshield
Is that what you call tact?
You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back
So let's end this call and end this conversation
And is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed
When you say "best friends" means friends forever
Is that what you call a getaway?!?
Tell me what you got away with
'Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in eleven-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt
And again when your head goes through the windshield!
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to...
Your world is an ashtray
We burn and coil like cigarettes
The more you cry your ashes turn to mud
The nature of the leeches
The virgin's feeling cheated
You've only spent a second of your life
My world is unaffected
There is an exit here
I say it is, then it's true
There is a dream inside a dream
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
You'll understand when I'm dead
I went to God just to see
And I was looking at me, yeah
Saw heaven and hell were lies
When I'm God everyone dies
Scar! Can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar! Scar! Can you feel my power?
One shot and the world gets smaller
Let's jump upon the sharp swords
Cut away our smiles
Without the threat of death
There's no reason to live at all
My world is unaffected
There is an exit here
I say it is, then it's true
There is a dream inside a dream
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
You'll understand when I'm dead
I went to God just to see
And I was looking at me, yeah
Saw heaven and hell were lies
When I'm God everyone dies
Scar! Can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar! Scar! Can you feel my power?
One shot and the world gets smaller
Scar! Scar! Can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Shoot, shoot, shoot, motherfucker
Shoot, shoot, shoot, motherfucker
Each thing I show you is a piece of my death
No salvation, ha ha
No forgiveness, ha ha
No salvation, ha ha
No forgiveness, ha ha
No salvation, ha ha
No forgiveness, ha ha
No salvation, ha ha
No forgiveness, ha ha
No salvation, ha ha
No forgiveness, ha ha
(This is beyond your experience)
No salvation, ha ha
No forgiveness, ha ha
Forgiveness
Forgiveness

No salvation, ha ha
No forgiveness, ha ha
I went to God just to see
And I was looking at me, yeah
Saw heaven and hell were lies
When I'm God everyone dies
Scar! Can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar! Scar! Can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar! Scar! Can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar! Scar! Can you feel my power?
One shot and the world gets smaller
Shoot, shoot, shoot, motherfucker
Shoot, shoot, shoot, motherfucker
Shoot, shoot, shoot, motherfucker
Shoot, shoot, shoot, motherfucker
Shoot

Shoot
Shoot
Farewell, goodnight
Last one out, turn out the lights and let me be
Let me die inside
Let me know the way through this world of hate in you
'Cause the dye is cast and the bitch is back and we're all dead
Yeah we're all dead
Inside the future of a shattered past, yeah yeah
I lie just to be real and I'd die just to feel
Why do the same old things keep on happening?
'Cause beyond my hopes there are no feelings
Bless the martyrs and kiss the kids for knowing better
For knowing this
'Cause you're all whores and I'm a fag
And I've got no mother and I've got no dad
To save me from the wasted, save me from myself, yeah yeah
I lie just to be real and I'd die just to feel
Why do the same old things keep on happening?
'Cause beyond my hopes there are no feelings
Everybody's lost just waiting to be found
Everybody's a thought just waiting to fade
So fuck it all 'cause I don't care
So what, somehow, somewhere we dared
To try to dare, to dare for a little more, yeah yeah
I lie just to be real and I'd die just to feel
Why do the same old things keep on happening?
'Cause beyond my hopes there are no feelings
It's not what I took from you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this, like this
The time has come to change this
To stretch the thought a mile
We've lost that kind of spirit
We want it back today
The time is right to change this
To make the life we know
They took what we were given
We'll get it back again
Somewhere someone's gun
Someone's gun is laughing
It's not what I gave to you
It's not what I sold
We are born like this (Like this)
It's not what I took from you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this
You try your best to mock me
You're always in my way
You've lost what you've been given
You'll get it back today
The time is right to change this
To make the life we know
They took what we were given
We want it back again
Somewhere someone's gun
Someone's gun is laughing
It's not what I gave to you
It's not what I sold
We are born like this (Like this)
It's not what I took from you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this
Somewhere you're floating high
You're not living, we are
Somewhere someone's gun
Someone's gun is laughing, laughing
It's not what I gave to you
It's not what I sold
We are born like this (Like this)
It's not what I gave to you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this (Like this)
It's not what I took from you
It's not what I stole
We are born like this
So impressed with all you do
Tried so hard to be like you
Flew too high and burnt the wing
Lost my faith in everything
Lick around divine debris
Taste the wealth of hate in me
Shedding skin succumb defeat
This machine is obsolete
Made the choice to go away
Drink the fountain of decay
Tear a hole, exquisite red
Fuck the rest and stab it dead
Broken, bruised, forgotten, sore
Too fucked up to care anymore
Poison to my rotten core
Too fucked up to care anymore
Broken, bruised, forgotten, sore
Too fucked up to care anymore
Poison to my rotten core
Too fucked up to care anymore
In the back, off the side and far away
Is a place where I hide, where I stay
Tried to say, tried to ask, I needed to
All alone, by myself, where were you?
How could I ever think it's funny how
Everything that swore it wouldn't change is different now 
Just like you would always say, we'll make it through 
Then my head fell apart and where were you?
How could I ever think it's funny how
Everything you swore would never change is different now
Like you said, you and me will make it through 
Didn't quite, fell apart, where the fuck were you?
I tried to sneak myself through, tried to get to the other side
I tried to patch up the cracks and the holes that I have to hide
For a little bit of time even made it work okay
Just long enough to really make it hurt
When they figured me out and it all just rotted away
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Go on, get back to where you belong
You better take a good look 'cause I'm full of shit
With every bit of my heart I have tried to believe in it
You can dress it all up you can try to pretend
(You can try to pretend, you can try to pretend)
But you can't change anything
You can't change anything in the end
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Go on get back to where you belong
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Don't you fucking know what you are? (go on get back to where you belong)
Don't you fucking know what you are? (go on get back to where you belong)
Don't you fucking know what you are? (go on get back to where you belong)
Don't you fucking know what you are? (go on get back to where you belong)
I'll never be the same, break in decency
Dummy tree chopped off all my living roots
I've been humming too many words, got a weak self-esteem
That's been stomped away from every single dream
But it's something else that brought us feast
Keep it all inside till we feel we can't unleash
But I think that you made it up, I think that your mind is gone
I think you shouldn't have glorified, now you're wrong
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
They fuck in my head
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck it,
Pig
You and me out here alone
Face flat along the edge of the grass
Well I'm not here to preach, I'm just sick of looks
My parents made me strong to lift up that glass
So why should I try, act like I'm a little pissed off
With all that shit that needs to stay back in the shelf
Your punk ass made it up, or your fucking mind was gone
Should've never glorified, now you're wrong
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
They fuck in my head
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck
Pig
Shut up you don't know me, shut up, you don't know me
Squeal like a pig when you beg forgive pig fucking ape
But I'm thinking about my
Blown stack what's coming back Jack, we'll turn back
Curse, for in their words tell them that you fucking heard
I think they know that's what's coming nigga, just bring up
A bit of this stuff but not it, it moves anybody
So I'm thinking to bring my 9 but you grab it
And like you think about who I am 'n' shit
I'm below, will it be
'Cause we can not give back those lives
Resist to cease, understand
That odd hates blacks shades and other players
Mr. P.I.G., could I fuckin' see?
Show how ya done crushed all of my brothers' dignity
And to the jury carry your turns on my skin this color
Does that mean I'm burnt?
'Cause your punk ass made it up? your fuckin' mind was gone
Should've never glorified, wrong
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
They fuck in my head
Suck, suck, suck, suck

Suck, suck, suck, you pig
Butt
* 7 words = (You have the right to remain silent)
Fuck you
I can't say what I want to
Even if I'm not serious
I can't say what I want to
Even if I'm not serious
Things like
"Go fuck yourself.
Go fuck yourself.
You piece of shit.
Why don't you just go and kill yourself?"
I said, I can't say what I want to
Even if I'm not serious
I can't say what I want to
Even if I'm just kidding
People tell me what to say
What to think and what to play
I said, people tell me what to say
What to think and what to play
I said,
"Fuck yourself.
Fuck yourself.
You piece of shit.
Why don't you just go and kill yourself?"
I said, I can't say what I want to
Even if I'm not serious
I can't say what I want to
Even if I'm just kidding
Go fuck yourself
Go fuck yourself
You piece of shit
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
People tell me what to say
What to think and what to play
I said, people tell me what to say
What to think and what to play
Just kidding

She didn't wanna be, she didn't wanna know
She couldn't run away 'cause she was crazy
She gave it all away, she saw her baby break
And in the air it hung that she was dull razors
And I said I wanna fill you up, I wanna break you, I wanna give you up
From one another, another one should come to one another
No one should come between us
Still I was lonely and she was by my side, my one and only
Knows that she could never hide
I couldn't feel her and it was just a game 'cause I was lonely and she was crazy
Rat-tat-tat, ka-boo-boom, now take that and just a bit of this
'Cause I'm a watcher and I'm a doer of none
Come to save you 'cause you're all mine
I hurt where I can't feel, I feel where I can't hurt
I know where I can't know, I bleed for me and mine
Ka-boom, a rat-tat-tat and some good ole bliss
I'm a sister and I'm a motherfuck
I am made of shamrocks, I am made of stern stuff
I am never enough, I am the forgotten child
And I said I wanna fill you up, I wanna break you, I wanna give you up
From one another, no one should ever come in between us, between us and our love
Mary had a little lamb, her face was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went, I was sure to go
Now Mary's got a problem and Mary's not a stupid girl
Mary's got some deep shit, Mary does not forget
And this is how Mary's garden grows, this is how Mary has her ghosts
And in the eyes of the jackal I say ka-boom
Now we begin descent to where we've never been
There is no going back, this wasn't meant to last
This is a hell on earth, we are meant to serve
She will never learn
She will never learn, ah, bye
No
No, no
Bye bye, baby goodbye, bye bye
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you
And all the children sing
We hate love
We love hate
I am so all-American, I'd sell you suicide
I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the animal who will not be himself
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Hey victim
Should I black your eyes again?
Hey victim
You were the one who put the stick in my hand
I am the ism, my hate's a prism
Let's just kill everyone and let your god sort them out
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Everybody's someone else's nigger
I know you are so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side
I better, better, better, better not say this
Better, better, better, better not tell
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the idiot who will not be himself
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Everybody's someone else's nigger
I know you are so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side
America cannot see anything
America cannot see anything
America cannot see anything
History was written by winners
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck fuck fuck
Everybody's someone else's nigger
I know you are so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side
She's got the kind of look 
That defies gravity 
She's the greatest cook 
And she's fat free 
She's been to private school 
And she speaks perfect French 
She's got her perfect friends 
Oh, isn't she cool? 
She practices Tai Chi 
She'd never lose her nerve 
She's more than you deserve 
She's just far better than me 
Hey, hey
So don't bother, I won't die 
Of deception 
I promise you won't ever see me cry 
Don't feel sorry
And don't bother, I'll be fine
But she's waiting 
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine 
So don't bother, be unkind 
I'm sure she doesn't know 
How to touch you like I would 
I beat her at that one good 
Don't you think so? 
She's almost six feet tall 
She must think I'm a flea 
I'm really a cat, you see 
And it's not my last life at all 
Hey, hey
So don't bother, I won't die 
Of deception 
I promise you won't ever see me cry 
Don't feel sorry
Don't bother, I'll be fine
But she's waiting 
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine 
So don't bother, be unkind 
For you, I'd give up all I own 
And move to a communist country 
If you came with me, of course 
And I'd file my nails so they don't hurt you 
And lose those pounds and learn about football 
If it made you stay, but you won't, but you won't 
So don't bother, I'll be fine
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine 
Promise you won't ever see me cry 
And after all I'm glad that I'm not your type 
Promise you won't ever see me cry 
Don't bother, I'll be fine
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine 
Promise you won't ever see me cry 
And after all I'm glad that I'm not your type
Not your type, not your type, not your type 
Promise you won't ever see me cry
My god sits in the back of the limousine
My god comes in a wrapper of cellophane
My god pouts on the cover of the magazine
My god is a shallow little bitch trying to make the scene
I have arrived and this time you should believe the hype
I listened to everyone now I know that everyone was right
I'll be there for you as long as it works for me
I play a game it's called insincerity

I have become
Aww, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big? Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down bitch, you move again I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay)
Don't make me wake this baby, she don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do
Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?
Oh, what's the matter Kim, am I too loud for you?
Too bad bitch, you're gonna finally hear me out this time
At first, I'm like "Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine"
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine
How could you let him sleep in our bed, look it Kim
Look at your husband now (No), I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?
(Why are you doing this?) Shut the fuck up!
(You're drunk, you're never gonna get away with this)
You think I give a fuck? Come on we're going for a ride bitch (No)
Sit up front (We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up)
We'll be right back, well I will, you'll be in the trunk
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
You really fucked me Kim, you really did a number on me
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then Kim, I was only eighteen, that was years ago
I thought we wiped the slate clean, that's fucked up
(I love you) Oh God, my brain is racing
(I love you) What are you doing? Change the station
I hate this song, does this look like a big joke? (No)
There's a four year-old little boy laying dead with a slit throat
In your living room, ha-ha, what, you think I'm kidding you?
You loved him didn't you? (No)
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you asshole, yeah, bite me
Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me? You think I'm ugly, don't you?
(It's not that) No, you think I'm ugly (Baby)
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
I hate you, I hate you, I swear to God, I hate you, oh my God, I love you
How the fuck could you do this to me? (I'm sorry)
How the fuck could you do this to me?
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
Come on get out (I can't, I'm scared)
I said get out bitch (Let go of my hair)
(Please don't do this baby, please I love you)
(Look, we can just take Hailie and leave)
Fuck you! You did this to us, you did it, it's your fault
Oh my God, I'm cracking up, get a grip Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up and he walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut (Oh my God)
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should've known better when you started to act weird
We could of - hey, where you going? Get back here
You can't run from me Kim, it's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha ha, got ya, go ahead, yell
Here I'll scream with you, "Ah, somebody help!"
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed bitch, bleed!
bleed bitch, bleed!
Bleed!
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
Silence, here I am
Here I am, silent
Bright and clear, it's what I am
I have died
Mother
Mother
Mother
Mother
Death with violence
Excitement right here
Died, go to hell
Here I am right here
No mas
No mas
No mas
No mas
Death is what I am
Go to hell, go to jail
In back of that crime
Here I am, take a chance
Dead!
Die!
Some kind of evidence
Some kind of reason
Why I can't find a way
To be in my life
Somewhere in this dying day
If I could only find a way for my escape
I find it hard to concentrate with all my past mistakes
To be in my life
I can't feel my faith
Can't recall my crime
I think I sealed my fate
Along the way I may have lost my mind
I guess we're all damaged in our own way
Alone in our own way
Distant headlights
Desolate highway
I can't feel my faith
Can't recall my crime
I think I sealed my fate
Along the way I may have lost my mind
I guess we're all damaged in our own way
Alone in our own way
Distant headlights
Desolate highway
Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall
Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall
With eyes wide open
(Can't recall my crime
I think I sealed my fate)
I can watch my world evolve
(Alone in our own way
I think I sealed my fate)
Nothing left to die for
(Can't recall my crime
I think I sealed my fate)
Thoughts inside can make me crawl
(I think I sealed my fate)
Make me drop down on my knees
Break me down until I question me
Darkness can't destroy my drive
Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall
Sun doesn't rise at all
Welcome my downfall
Sun doesn't rise at all
Somewhere in this dying day
As I plan my great escape
I find it hard to concentrate
While you maintain control
I fold and falter empty altar
All I gave I pray it makes me whole
I think the brinks around the corner
And there's an error in my soul
I can't feel my faith
Can't recall my crime
I think I sealed my fate
Along the way I may have lost my mind
I guess we're all damaged in our own way
Alone in our own way
Distant headlights
Desolate highway
Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall
Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall
I can't feel my faith
Can't recall my crime
Damaged in our own way
Alone in our own way
Desolate highway
I was in Heaven, I was in Hell
Believe in neither but fear 'em as well
This one's a doctor, this one's a lawyer
This one's a cash fiend taking your money
Back of the Metro, ride on the Greyhound
Drunk on the Amtrak, please shut up
Another rider, he was a talker
Talking 'bout TV, please shut up
This one's a crazer, daydreaming disaster
The origin of junk food, rutting through garbage
Tasty but worthless, dogs eat their own shit
We're doin' the cockroach, yeah
Doin' the cockroach, yeah
Doin' the cockroach, yeah, yeah
Alright, not bad
Doin' the cockroach, yeah
Doin' the cockroach, yeah, yeah
Alright, not bad
Doin' the cockroach, yeah
Doin' the cockroach, yeah, yeah
Alright, not bad, not bad at all
One year, twenty years, forty years, fifty years down the road in your life
You'll look in the mirror and say, "My parents are still alive"
You move your mouth, you shake your tongue, you vibrate my eardrums
You're saying words but you know I ain't listening
You're walking down the street
Your face, your lips, your hips, your eyes, they meet, you're not hungry though
Well, late last winter down below the equator
They had a summer that would make you blister
Oh, my mind is all made up so I'll have to sleep in it
Well, late last winter down below the equator
They had a summer that would make you blister
Oh, my mind is all made up so I'll have to sleep in it
Well, late last winter down below the equator
They had a summer that would make you blister
And oh, my mind is all, oh, my mind is all
Oh, my mind is all made up so I'll have to sleep in it
Don't tread the water, just stay still 
I'll not be bothered by you until 
I'm picking sides and pulling the strings
I'm living lies and shedding the skin 
I'm open wide and letting you in
I'm wronging rights
Believe
I don't care what you want, I just want mine
Shut up, smart little bitch, I don't need lies
I don't care what you want, I just want mine
Get up, force it to fit
Confined inside
Don't pull me under into the deep
I often wonder how it should be
I'm picking sides and pulling the strings
I'm living lies and shedding the skin 
I'm open wide and letting you in
I'm wronging rights
Believe
I don't care what you want, I just want mine
Shut up, smart little bitch, I don't need lies
I don't care what you want, I just want mine
Get up, force it to fit
Confined inside
I don't care what you want, I just want mine
I don't care what you want, I just want mine
My dead eyes
Tie yourself to me
No one else
No, you're not rid of me
Hmm you're not rid of me
Night and day I breathe
Ah hah ay
Hey, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
I beg you, my darling
Don't leave me, I'm hurting
Lick my legs I'm on fire
Lick my legs of desire
I'll tie your legs
Keep you against my chest
Oh, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
I'll make you lick my injuries
I'm gonna twist your head off, see
Till you say don't you wish you never never met her?
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her?
I beg you my darling
Don't leave me, I'm hurting
Big lonely above everything
Above everyday, I'm hurting
Lick my legs, I'm on fire
Lick my legs of desire
Lick my legs, I'm on fire
Lick my legs of desire
Yeah, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
I'll make you lick my injuries
I'm gonna twist your head off, see
Till you say don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her
Don't you don't you wish you never never met her

Lick my legs I'm on fire

Lick my legs I'm on fire
Lick my legs of desire
It's funny how your worst enemies always seem to
Turn out to be all of your best friend's best friends
But I folded and I told
These are the things I saved to sink you
But I fold, I told
So draw or throw and I will explode
It's time for you to choose the bullet or the chapstick
"Oh, you are far too cute" or whatever he said
Every time I hear it I am wishing I was great I wished her
Past tense, my best friend
But I folded and I told
These aren't things I say to save me
But I folded, I told
I hope she's caught in the explosion
It's time for you to choose the bullet or the chapstick
"Oh, you are far too cute" or whatever he said
It's time for you to choose
The bullet or the chapstick
This is me in his room X...
Red, gold, I told
We don't play fair
Red, gold, I told
We never stand too close
So I update this almost every single day for you
I begin to hate you for your face and not just the things you do
Go tell him how my wrist is sore from pulling at your insides all night
Nothing that you do is new to anything or anyone but you
Made a mistake, I made a mistake
I wear the scars to show my shame
Made a mistake, I made a mistake
I wear the scars to show my shame
What should I do? What should I do?
When I'm the one who can't get through
What should I do? What should I do?
When I'm the one, hey, I'm the one to blame
I can't see past
This chance for us to reconcile these doubts
They've all gone on for far too long
Yeah, it goes on, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
Made a mistake, I made a mistake
I wear the scars to show my shame
Made a mistake, I made a mistake
I wear the scars to show my shame
What should I do? What should I do?
When I'm the one who can't get through
What should I do? What should I do?
When I'm the one, hey, I'm the one to blame
Just not built for
This role and all the time much better spent
But it all drags on for far too long
And it drags on, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
Made a mistake, I made a mistake
I wear the scars to show my shame
Made a mistake, I made a mistake
I wear the scars to show my shame
What should I do? What should I do?
When I'm the one who can't get through
What should I do? What should I do?
When I'm the one, hey, I'm the one to blame
I wish I was someone better
I wish I was someone better
I wish I was someone better
I wish I was someone better
I wish I was someone better
I wish I was someone better
I wish I was someone better
I wish I was someone better
I wish I was someone better
I wish I was someone better
I wish I was someone better
I wish I was someone better
Made a mistake, made a mistake
Made a mistake, made a mistake
Made a mistake, made a mistake
Made a mistake, made a mistake
Made a mistake, made a mistake
Made a mistake, made a mistake
Made a mistake, made a mistake
Made a mistake, made a mistake
You wanna make me sick;
You wanna lick my wounds,
Don't you, baby?
You want the badge of honor when you save my hide
But you're the one in the way
Of the day of doom, baby
If you need my shame to reclaim your pride
And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists
I never did anything to you, man
But no matter what I try
You'll beat me with your bitter lies
So call me crazy, hold me down
Make me cry; get off now, baby--
It wont be long till you'll be
Lying limp in your own hands
You feed the beast I have within me
You wave the red flag, baby you make it run run run
Standing on the sidelines, waving and grinning
You fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun
And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists
I never did anything to you, man
But no matter what I try
You'll beat me with your bitter lies
So call me crazy, hold me down
Make me cry; get off now, baby--
It wont be long till you'll be
Lying limp in your own hands
I cashed in all my chips tonight
Combed my hair to look just right
'Cause I've been thinking about you and me girl
And we've got something going on
You told me you can't wait to see me
But you didn't bother to even show up
This whole situation is incredibly typical
I should have seen it all along
(I should have seen it all along)
I should have seen it all along
It's girls like you that make me think I'm better off...
Home on a Saturday night
With all my doors locked up tight
I won't be thinking about you... baby
You called me on the phone
But you don't even wanna talk
You're staring at me from across the room
But you turn your back when I walk up
We got inches away
And I never even got close
Your lipstick at home
Don't pick up the phone
Don't bother to look in my direction
It's girls like you that make me think I'm better off...
Home on a Saturday night
With all my doors locked up tight
I won't be thinking about you... baby
Home on a Saturday night
With all my doors locked up tight
I won't be thinking about you... baby
This isn't high school
This isn't high school
This isn't high school
This isn't high school
This isn't high school
This isn't high school
This isn't high school
This isn't high school
Forget everything you think you know about me
I'm better off...
Home on a Saturday night
With all my doors locked up tight
I won't be thinking about you... baby
Home on a Saturday night
With all my doors locked up tight
I won't be thinking about you... baby
Home on a Saturday night
With all my doors locked up tight
I won't be thinking about you... baby
One, two, three, four
So you wanted to take a break?
Slow it down some and have some space?
Fuck you too
Give me my money back
Give me my money back, you bitch
I want my money back
And don't forget
And don't forget to give me back my black t-shirt
I wish I hadn't bought you dinner
Right before you
Dumped me on your front porch
Give me my money back
Give me my money back, you bitch
I want my money back
And don't forget
And don't forget to give me back my black t-shirt, hey hey
So you wanted to take a break?
Slow it down some and have some space?
Give me my money back
Give me my money back, you bitch
I want my money back
I want my money back
And don't forget
It feels good to say what I want
It feels good to knock things down
It feels good to see the disgust in their eyes
It feels good, and I'm gonna go wild
Spray paint the walls
I don't want to see the plan succeed
There won't be room for people like me 
My life is their disease
It feels good, and I'm gonna go wild
Spray paint the walls
It feels so good to say what I want 
It feels so good to knock things down
It feels good to see the disgust in their eyes
It feels good, and I'm gonna go wild
Spray paint the walls
It feels good, and I'm gonna go wild
Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset
Swiftly go the days
Sunrise, sunset, you wake up then you undress
It always is the same
The sunrise and the sun sets
You're lying while you confess
Keep trying to explain
The sunrise and the sun sets
You realize then you forget
What you've been trying to retain
But everybody knows it's all about the things
That get stuck inside of your head
Like the songs your roommate sings
A vision of her body as she stretches out on your bed
As she raised her hands in the air
Asked her 'When was the last time you looked in the mirror?
'Cause you've changed, yeah you've changed'
The sunrise, the sun sets, you're hopeful and then you regret
The circle never breaks
With a sunrise and a sunset, there's a change of heart or address
Is there nothing that remains?
For a sunrise or a sunset, you're manic or you're depressed
Will you ever feel ok?
For a sunrise or a sunset, your lover is an actress
Did you really think she'd stay?
For a sunrise or a sunset, you're either coming or you just left
But you're always on the way
Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet
They are really just the same
To the sunrise or the sunset, the master and his servant
Have exactly the same fate
It's a sunrise and a sunset, from a cradle to a casket
There is no way to escape
The sunrise or the sunset, hold your sadness like a puppet
Keep putting on the play
But everything you do is leading to the point
Where you just won't know what to do
And that moment you will laugh
But there is someone there who will be laughing louder than you
So it's true, the trick is complete
You've become everything you said you never would be
You're a fool, you're a fool
Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset
The sunrise and the sun sets
Sunrise, sunset, the sunrise, the sun sets
The sunrise, the sun sets
Sunrise, sunset, go home to your apartment
Put the cassette in the tape deck
And let that fever play
Sunrise, sunset, where are you, Arienette?
Where are you, Arienette?
Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
And he's gonna start a war
He's gonna start a war
And he hops in his pickup, puts his pedal to the floor
And says, "I got mine but I want more"
Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He drove to the desert, fired his rifle in the sky
And said, "God, if I have to die, you will have to die"
Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He didn't move to the city, the city moved to me
And I want out desperately
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Don't know, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Standing in the tall grass
Thinking nothing
You know we need oxygen to breathe
Oxygen to breathe
Standing in the tall grass
Thinking nothing
You know we need oxygen to breathe
Oxygen to breathe
Every time you think you're walking, you're just moving the ground
Every time you think you're talking, you're just moving your mouth
Every time you think you're looking, you're just looking down
Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He hops in his pickup, puts the pedal to the floor
And says, "I got mine, but I want more"
'Cause Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He goes to the desert, fires his rifle in the sky
And said, "God, if I have to die, you will have to die"
Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He didn't move to the city, the city moved to me
And I want out desperately
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
No, no, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Yeah, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Smiling in their faces
While filling up the hole
So many dirty little places
In your filthy little worn out, broken down, see-through soul
Baby's got a problem
Tries so hard to hide
Got to keep it on the surface
Because everything else is dead on the other side
Teeth in the necks of everyone you know
You can keep on sucking till the blood won't flow
When it starts to hurt it only helps it grow
Taking all you need (but not this time)
No, you don't
And just for the record
Just so you know
I did not believe
That you could sink so low
You think that you can beat them
I know that you won't
You think you have everything
But no, you don't
No, you don't
No, you don't
No, you don't
No, you don't
No, you don't
No, you don't
No, you don't
No, you don't
There's a look on your face I would like to knock out
See the sin in your grin and the shape of your mouth
All I want is to see you in terrible pain
Though we won't ever meet I remember your name
Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to God I think of a nice thing to say
But I don't think I can so fuck you anyway
You are scum, you are scum and I hope that you know
That the cracks in your smile are beginning to show
Now the world needs to see that it's time you should go
There's no light in your eyes and your brain is too slow
Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to God I can think of a nice thing to say
But I don't think I can, so fuck you anyway
Bet you sleep like a child with your thumb in your mouth
I could creep up beside put a gun in your mouth
Makes me sick when I hear all the shit that you say
So much crap coming out, it must take you all day
There's a space kept in hell with your name on the seat
With a spike in the chair just to make it complete
When you look at yourself do you see what I see
If you do why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me?
There's a time for us all and I think yours has been
Can you please hurry up 'cause I find you obscene
We can't wait for the day that you're never around
When that face isn't here and you rot underground
Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to god I can think of a nice thing to say
But I don't think I can so fuck you anyway
So fuck you anyway
So fuck you anyway
So fuck you anyway
...
How many times
Do I have to say
To get away- get gone
Flip your shit past another lass's
Humble dwelling
You got your game, made your shot
And you got away with a lot, but I'm not
Turned on
So put away that meat you're selling
'Cause I do know what's good for me
And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting
And yet I'm sitting
Singing again
Sing, sing again
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth goes out
That he don't give a shit about me
'Cause I do know what's good for me
And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting
And yet I'm sitting
Singing again
Sing, sing again
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth goes out
That he don't give a shit about me
How many times can it escalate
Till it elevates to a place I can't breathe?
And I must decide
If you must deride
That I'm much obliged
To up and go
I'll idealize and realize
That it's no sacrifice, because the price is paid
And there's nothing left to grieve
Fuckin' go
'Cause I've done what I could for you
And I do know what's good for me
And I'm not benefiting
Instead I'm sitting
Singing again, singing again, singing again
Sing, sing, sing again
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth goes out
That he don't give a shit about me
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth goes out
That he don't give a shit about me
Always the same old taste, just new injury
Well, I'll wear the claws if you'd like that
Yeah, if you'd like that, we can ride on a black horse
A great new wave Hesparian death horse
I can call you when I get back
Yeah, when I get back I will call
Don't speak, don't say nothing
In case we ever do meet again
Something's wrong with you
Well, I hope we never do meet again
You always sharpen your teeth 'cause you're like that
And you're like that every time you pull heart back
And her compact's carving deeper in your lap
I would call but I forget where the phone is at
Guess I'll talk to you when I get back
Yeah, when I get back I will talk
But don't speak, don't say nothing
In case we ever should meet again
There are some things wrong with you
I hope we never do meet again
I hope we never do meet again
I hope we never do meet again
Something's wrong with you
And I hope we never do meet again
Something's wrong with you
And I hope we never do meet again
Something's wrong with you
And I hope we never do meet again
Don't speak, don't say nothing
But in case we ever do meet again
Something's wrong with you
Well, I hope we never do meet again
And I hope we never do meet again
And I hope we never do meet again
And I hope we never do meet again
And I hope we never do meet again
And I hope we never do meet again
And I hope we never do meet again
And I hope we never do meet again
And I hope we never do meet again
And I hope we never do meet again
I'm holding out, and I'm holding on 
To every letter and every song
I wrote myself out of the day we ever had to meet
Are you through with me?
So...
And when it all goes to hell 
Will you be able to tell 
Me you're sorry with a straight face?
And when it all goes to hell 
Will you be able to tell 
Me you're sorry with a straight face?
I'm all ears, and I'm all scars 
To hear you tell me, "Boys like you try too hard 
To look not quite as desperate"
And I'm hanging on, but I still know the way to make your make-up run
So...
And when it all goes to hell 
Will you be able to tell 
Me you're sorry with a straight face? 
And when it all goes to hell 
Will you be able to tell 
Me you're sorry with a straight face?
And when it all goes to hell 
Will you be able to tell 
Me you're sorry with a straight face?
And when it all goes to hell 
Will you be able to tell 
Me you're sorry with a straight face?
(Take this to your grave, and I'll take it to mine)
And when it all goes to hell
And when it all goes to hell
And when it all goes to hell
And when it all goes
Here I am
Laid bare at the end of my rope
I've lost all hope so long
Molly Connelly just broke up with me
Over the revealing nature of the songs
You goddamned kids had best be gracious with the merch money you spend
'Cause for you
I won't ever have rough sex with Molly Connelly again
Here I am
Laid down at the end of my rope
Wishing I had not been born
Now I've spewed too much
I can never shut it up
I thought you should be warned
I implied black skies took a needle to my eye
Sucked out all its glow Whoaoh
Molly Connelly ruined my life
I thought the world should know Ho!
I can't stop thinkin' bout what she did wrong to me
Just can't figure out what I did wrong
I kill myself thinkin' bout things that you do to me
Molly Connelly
I can't stop thinkin' bout what she did wrong to me
Just can't figure out what I did wrong
I kill myself thinkin' bout things that you do to me
Molly Connelly
I'm coming into your town
Night is falling to the ground
But I can still see where you loved yourself
Before he tore it all down. April 12th
With nobody else around; you were outside the house
(Where's your mother?)
When he put you in the car
When he took you down the road
And I can still see where it was open
The door he slammed closed
It was open, the door he slammed closed. It was open, long ago
But don't lose me now, don't lose me now
Though I know that I'm not useful anyhow
Just let me stick around
And I tell you, like before
You should say his name the way that he said yours
You don't want to say his name any more
Oh, Cynda Moore
Baby daughter on the road
Wrapped up warm in daddy's coat
Well I can still see the cigarette's heat
Can't believe all that you're telling me
What is cutting like the smoke through your teeth as you are telling me "forget it"
But if I could tear his throat
Spill his blood between my jaws
And erase his name for good, don't you know that I would?
Don't you realize I wouldn't pause
That I would cut him down with my claws
If I could have somehow never let that happen?
Or I'll call, some black midnight, fuck up his new life where they don't know what he did
Tell his brand-new wife and second kid
And I tell you, like before
You should wreck his life the way that he wrecked yours
You want no part of his life any more
Oh, Cynda Moore
Don't lose me now, let me help you out
Though I know that I can't help you anyhow
When I watch you I'm proud
When I tell you twice before
You should wreck his life the way that he wrecked yours
You want no part of his life any more
Oh, Cynda Moore
It'll never be the way it was before
But I wish that you would let me through that door
Let me through that door
Let me through that door
Let me through that door, baby
It's like I'm in this dirt digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You could just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
Well, I've never recovered but tonight betcha that whatcha
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying "let it go, fuck this"
Heart's saying "I will once I bury this bitch alive.
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"
I flee the scene, like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
Follow me I run, I run, follow me, follow me
I just hate to be the bad guy
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshiped? Shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, knit wit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed?
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long
That I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through
?
Feelings I harbor, all this pent-up resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
I flee the scene, like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
Follow me I run, I run, follow me, follow me
I just hate to be the bad guy
I've been driving around your side of this town
Like nine fricking hours and forty-five minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived and my mouth is fulla saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But I ain't here for your empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low then
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag almost hacked up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung
Stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony's spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it, we're in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's the sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
Well, how's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God, police, ah)
Hope Fox Trot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot
New plan Stan
Slim "chauvinist pig, drove in this big, Lincoln Town Car"
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge, ha ha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go, all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds, toilets clogged
Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lotta shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, "I am your lack of a conscience"
I'm the ringing in your ears, I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on ya every woman you insult
Batter but the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mathers the rappers persona's half a facade and
Matthew and Stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you have till it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, I told you so
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away
I'm every guilt trip the baggage you have
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Less it makes an impact then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
'Fore it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh, as we pick up where the last Mathers left off
This feeling haunts me.
Behind these eyes
The shell seems so empty.
Though I wonder if anything lives inside?
I want to live
I wish I was dead
My heart aches to bleed.
I'm cheated from what I see.
Freedom holds a double-edge for me.
I look in your eyes and see...
I want to live.
I wish I was dead.
I don't want to think.
I'm stuck here and I know it.
I don't want to see.
Make me close my eyes.
I want to live.
I wish I was dead.
Life's cold.
Every thing's inside.
I need to feel,
But turn my mind off.
The desperation begins.
From the start I see the end.
Not right, I'm not right, you're not right.
I've got to close my eyes.
I look in your eyes
And see it's always this way.
Live the lie and take a dive
Just to make it die.
I want to live.
I wish I was dead.
I've just got to close my eyes.
I've got to close my eyes.
I've got to close my eyes.
Gave up trying to figure it out
But my head got lost along the way
Worn out from giving it up
But my soul, I pissed it all away
Still stings these shattered nerves
Pigs, we get what pigs deserve
I'm going all the way down
I'm leaving today
Come, come, come on, you've gotta fill me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you
Come, come, come on, you've gotta fix me up
Come, come, gotta let me get inside you
Still feel it all slipping away
But it doesn't matter anymore
Everybody's still slipping away
But it doesn't matter anymore
Look through these blackened eyes
You'll see ten thousand lies
My lips may promise
But my heart is a whore
Come, come, come on, you've gotta fix me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you
Come, come, come on, you've gotta fill me up
Come, come, gotta let me get through to you
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right
I know it's all getting away
And it comes to me as no surprise
I know what's coming to me
Is never going to arrive
Fresh blood through tired skin
New sweat to drown me in
Dress up this rotten carcass
Just to make it look alive
Come, come, come on, you've gotta fill me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you
Come, come, come on, you've gotta fix me up
Come, come, gotta let me inside of you
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right now
This isn't meant to last
This is for right
I want you to make me
I want you to take me
I want you to break me
I want you to throw me away
I want you to make me
I want you to take me
I want you to break me
I want you to throw me away
I want you to make me
I want you to take me
I want you to break me
I want you to throw me away
In the shadows where the heads hang low 
You hear the voices as the wind blows 
Asking can't you see? 
Reminding you to breathe
It's only time before it catches up 
To you and all your broken luck 
I've found a better way 
To get even with my memory 
In the darkness where the angels cry
Give us water, give us back our lives
Our bed's this concrete floor
And it's all we have left to live for
A day we'll never face, we're only
Second-handed, sick, and lonely
Fighting back the tears
And every urge to Van Gogh both our ears
That's it, we've had enough
Please turn that fucking radio off
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the despair we feel
NO!
In the shadows where the heads hang low
You hear the voices as the wind blows
Asking can't you see?
Reminding you to breathe
It's only time before it catches up
To you and all your broken luck
I've found a better way
To get even with my enemies
That's it, we've had enough
Please turn that fucking radio off
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the despair we feel
That said, We've had enough
Put "Walk Among Us" on and turn it up
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the hatred we feel
NO!
This is our biggest fear 
The only tunes that we hear 
Come via antenna to your car radio
Oh no, no, no
That's it, we've had enough 
We've had enough
That's it, we've had enough 
We've had enough
I still remember a year ago
The times we spent
I think that I'm happier now
Up from the down
By all means
It's strange 'cause I feel the same way
I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes like
Same strange
Said it's strange 'cause I feel the same
Still remember what it tastes like
What it felt like
Makes me ill
I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes like
I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes, taste
Still remember what it tastes like
What it felt like
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
When all is said and done
And dead does he love you
The way that I do
Breathing in lighting
Tonight's for fighting
I feel the hurt so physical
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around come around no more
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around no more
She spreads her love
She burns me up
I can't let go
I can't get out
I've said enough
Enough by now
I can't let go
I can't get out
Wait till the day you finally see
I've been here waiting patiently
Crossing my fingers and my t's
She cried on my shoulder begging please
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around come around no more
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around no more
She spreads her love
She burns me up
I can't let go
I can't get out
I've said enough
Enough by now
I can't let go
I can't get out
What is it you really want?
I'm tired of asking
You come wasted
When I showed up and he was there
I tried my best to grin and bear
And took the stairs but didn't stop at the street
And as we speak I'm going down
'Cause she spread her love
And burnt me up
I can't let go
I can't get out
I've said enough
Enough by now
I can't let go
I can't get out
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around come around no more
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around no more
Shit! 
Nothing makes sense, so I won't think about it. I'll go with the ignorance. 
Eat, sleep, fuck and flee; in four words, that's me. 
I am full of indifference. 
What do the old people teach us but how to die (die) die (die) 
And what do those hissy fits teach you except how to cry, pussy, cry? 
Yeah the futile, the futile, it outweighs the beautiful.
Futile, the futile, it outweighs the beautiful.
Futile, the futile, the futile so (the futile, the futile)
Taste. I have no taste. 
I don't like these tiny portions with your artful abortions of sound, 
Sealed with a kiss, slathered in the sauce sarcastic. 
So go choke on your irony. 
What do the old people teach us but how to die (die) die (die) die
And what do your hissy fits teach you except how to cry, pussy, cry? 
Yeah the futile, the futile, it outweighs the beautiful.
Futile, the futile, it outweighs the beautiful.
Futile, the futile, the futile so
I'm eating rat poison for dinner. 
Pull the cord from the phone. I am dining alone, 
Tonight, rat poison for dinner. 
Pull the cord from the phone. I am dining alone, 
So goodnight.
Love! I shall not love, yet I'll still sing about it. 
I hope it covers the ocean in slime, the drama and drool. 
I'm leaking the blood of a fool. (I'm full of it, I'm full of it, I'm full.)
Rat poison for dinner, 
Pull the chord from the phone. I am dining alone.
Tonight. Rat poison for dinner, 
Pull the chord from the phone. I am dining alone. 
Tonight. 
Oh I am dining alone. 
Tonight. Tonight. Tonight.
I could liken you to a werewolf
The way you left me for dead
But I admit that I provided a full moon
And I could liken you to a shark
The way you bit off my head
But then again
I was waving around a bleeding open wound
But you are such a super guy
Till the second you get a whiff of me
We are like a wishing well
And a bolt of electricity
But we can still support each other
All we gotta do's avoid each other
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
The lava of a volcano
Shot up hot from under the sea
One thing leads to another
And you made an island of me
 
And I could liken you to a chemical
The way you made me compound to compound
But I'm a chemical too
Inevitable you and me would mix
And I could liken you to a lot of things
But I always come around
'Cause in the end I'm a sensible girl
I know the fiction of the fix
But you are such a super guy
Till the second you get a whiff of me
We are like a wishing well
And a bolt of electricity
But we can still support each other
All we gotta do's avoid each other
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key

Alone, you support, and embrace

Sucess, we unfold, clutching firm
Letting me panic for sure
Say it, say it, that it's done
I want it, want it, need it done
Say it, say it, that it's done

Selfishly walking through killing the angles

I can in every way 
Mistake the pain I feel inside
It comes at me 
Evil thoughts is creeping through my mind
Who are you to say that I can't speak what's on my mind?
It runs away 
It's so predictable
I can in every way 
Feel the stress that tangles up inside
Too blind to see
Emptiness and the sorrow of their lives
You run away 
To the cover of their pointless ties
You ask me
It's so predictable
I'm gonna try
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna try
Another day
Silence overwhelms my mind
Who's to say if I have the time or why?
Should I pray for all the hate to go away?
Another day
I can never break free
You wait for me
I crawl up to you
Another day
I'll live forever
Why should I?
I'm gonna try
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna try
Oh
Fuck

"Far away from any road
Grows my heart in solitude
Where no passer-by can see
On life's highway, God with thee
Knowing when all else doth fail,
Thy compassion shall be free
Oh let it be, let me be
On life's highway, God with thee"

We need vices (Oh)
Where's all my hope and my marriage license?

Those days are dead (Forgive me)
We need vices at fifty thousand degrees

She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
And jumped
I got creative (Oh no)
To try to kill the major
Where is my shrink and my mind eraser
(We sing that sad song)
And that forest burned (You see smoke)
That forest burned (A halo)
That forest burned (The radio)
We need ten years on rewind so we can return
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground

We need vices (Awwww)
We need vices (Oh?)
We've done nothing to brandish our disguises
Those days are dead (Forgive me)
'Cause those days are dead (Forgive me)
'Cause those days are dead (Forgive me)
We need vices to wave to the funeral days
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground

I wouldn't sell my belt to industry
So they carded me and they carted me off
Naked but that belt around my waist
It was my father's once, I still see his face
I said whoa, they carted me off
Yeah, whoa, they carded me
But I managed to escape the good gendarme
I fled through field and farm, stripped of natural charm
Naked but that belt I wear so well
Past the pyramids and the liberty bell
I said whoa, they carted me off
Yeah, whoa, they carded me
Hey, this is something I have to do for myself
Yeah, this is something I have to do for myself
I have to for myself
I have to for myself, yeah, yeah
I ignored the sheep and shepherds on my way
What can their small words say when they say them that way?
Bathed in sweat, feathered as a crow
I laid a beating on the sleet and snow with my frostbitten toes
I remained unrecognized in my hometown
Beneath my monstrous gown of feather and down
But I gathered up an army made of those
Who aimed to shake them from their repose
And we took up weapons, yeah
And we took off our clothes
And we took up weapons, yeah
And we took off our

Yeah, this is something I have to do for myself
I have to for myself

So what say you and all your friends
Meet all of my friends in the alley tonight?
What say you and all your friends
Step up to my friends in the alley tonight?
"Wow", said the broken Californian, down
On the beach that used to be by the beach
Town hasn't moved but it's getting closer, losing ground
Making better views and close relaxing sounds
Ground sure don't like the way it's treated, so now
It's moving back to the sea
Plan to hitch a ride with the river
'Cause deep down plumbing life is too cramped for me
I got wood legs and bow legs, and no legs at all
Damn, would you take a collect call?
Oh no, I don't understand
I got poor eyes and sore eyes, and no eyes at all
Damn, would you like to take the fall?
Oh no, I don't like this plan
It was a staple of brass tacks and wax backs
Oh yeah, a message left on the forehead of God
Sent sealed and signed by the saints
Who sang this song, this song
This song
We're going union like they say
We'll buy the congregation
Then one day, you'll find us sitting in your chair
With big ideas of stocks and shares
We're going union
We're going union like they say
We'll buy the congregation
Then one day, you'll find us sitting in your chair
With big ideas of stocks and shares
We're going union
Was losing all my friends
Was losing them to drinking and to driving
Was losing all my friends
But I got 'em back
I am on the mend
At least now I can say that I am trying
And I hope you will forget
Things that I still lack
Yeah, yeah
Is it in you now
To bear to hear the truth that you have spoken
Twisted up by knaves
To make a trap for fools
And is it in you now
To watch the things you gave your life to broken
And stoop and build 'em up
With worn-out tools
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Nothing gets so bad
A whisper from your father couldn't fix it
He whispers like a bridge
It's a river spanned
Take all that you have
And turn it into something you would miss if
Somebody threw that brick
To shatter all your plans
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
It takes a while to grow anything
Before it's coming to an end, yeah
Before you put my body in the cold ground
Take some time and warm it with your hands
Before it's coming to an end, yeah
Do you miss the blend
Of color she left in your black and white field
Or do you feel condemned
Just for being there
I am not your friend
I am just a man who knows how it feels
I am not your friend, I'm not your lover
I'm not your family
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
It takes a while to grow anything
Before it's coming to an end, yeah
(The Game: Laughing, smoking)
Lemme put you on game (gunshot)
Lemme put you on game
Don't you know that I run this place,
And I've begun this race,
Must I rerun this pace?
I'm the reason its become this way
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised
(Lemme put you on game)
They love my darkness,
I make them heartless,
And in return, the have become my martyrs,
I've been in the poem of many a poet,
And I reside in the art of many a artist
(Lemme put you on game)
Some of your smartest have tried to articulate
My whole part in this
But they're fruitless in their harvest
The drow grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow,
I am the one that they march with
(Lemme put you on game)
Through the back alleys
And the black markets,
The Oval Offices,
The crackhouses and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens,
The pages of the sages
And the Chambers of The Kings
(Lemme put you on game)
Through the veins-es of the fiends,
A paper chaser's pager,
Yo, I'm famous on the scene
One of the oldest, most ancient-est of things
Speak every single language on the planet, kna'mean?
(Lemme put you on game)
I am the American dream,
The rape of Africa
The undying machine,
The overpriced medicine,
The murderous regime,
The tough guy's front,
And the one behind the scenes
(Lemme put you on game)
I am the blood of this city,
It's gas, water, and electricity,
I'm it's gym, and it's math, and it's history,
The gunshots in the class
And you can't pass if you're missin', G.
I taught them better than that
I taught them aim for the head
And hope they never come back
I'm glad your daddy's gone, baby,
Hope he never comes back,
I hope he's with your mother,
With my hustlers high in my traps
(Lemme put you on game)
I hope you die in his trash,
I can't help it all I hear when you're crying is laughs
I'm sure somebody find you tied up in this bag,
Behind the hospital little baby,
Crack addicts had
(Lemme put you on game)
Then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper,
A welfare-receiving prostitute
And gold digger,
You can watch on TV,
How they should properly depict you,
The rivers should flow with liquor,
Quench your thirst on my elixirs,
(Lemme put you on game)
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader,
The number one defender,
And from a throne of their bones I rule,
These fools are my fuel
So I make them Cool
(Lemme put you on game)
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool,
And feed 'em from the table that held the Corleone's food,
If you die, tell 'em that you played my game
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name,
'Cause I'm the... (gunshot)
Lets have a bachelor party
With chicks
And boose
And guns
And firetrucks
C'mon, baby
There's something about the way we fit
There's something about this psycho trip
There's something about the way we groove
Something's got me and I just can't seem to choose
I want you
But I hate you
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
So I contemplate
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
There's something about the way we slide
There's something about this psycho ride
There's something about the things we do
Something's got me and I just can't seem to choose
I want you
But I hate you
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
So I contemplate
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
One, two, fuck you
Never say no
Ready to go
We're out of control
But I can't let you ' can't let you go!
There's something about the way we fit
There's something about this psycho bitch'
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
The one I love I hate
And I could suffocate
The one I love I hate
But the sex is great
I love to hate you,
You know I love to hate you,
You know I love to hate you,
You know I love to hate you,
Hate you,
Hate you,
Bitch.
Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he said
"Tell you who you are if you nail me to my car"
Boy
Thanks for hesitating
This is the kiss off
Boy
Thanks for hesitating
You'll never know the real story
Just a couple of dreams 
You get up and sleep
You can buy god it's Monday
Slither down the greasy pipe
So far so good no one saw you
Hobble over any freeway
You will be like your dreams tonight
You get up and sleep
You get up and sleep

Went to the bar, yeah yeah
A couple of dreams and he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car tell you who you are"
You get up and sleep
The wind blows on your check
The day laughs in your face
Guess you'll buy a gun
You'll buy it secondhand
You'll get up and sleep
Joe the lion made of iron (repeat ad inf.)
We'll rise above this
We'll cry about this
As we live and learn
A broken promise
I was not honest
Now I watch as tables turn
And you're singing
I'll wait my turn
To tear inside you
Watch you burn
I'll wait my turn
I'll wait my turn
I'll cry about this
And hide my cuckold eyes
As you come off all concerned
And I'll find no solace
In your poor apology
In your regret that sounds absurd
Keep singing
I'll wait my turn
To tear inside you
Watch you burn
And I'll wait my turn
To terrorize you
Watch you burn
I'll wait my turn
I'll wait my turn
A Promise is a promise
A Promise is a promise
A Promise is a promise
A Promise is a promise
And I'll wait my turn
To tear inside you
Watch you burn
I'll wait my turn
I'll wait my turn
A broken promise
You were not honest
I'll bide my time
I'll wait my turn
Looking back at yourself 
(Go with it)
Is it turning you on? 
(Go with it)
I'll be sitting right here
(Go with it)
When the time is right 
(I'll stick it)
Licking your own skin, so trippy
Squeezing your own ass, so pretty, except the way that it's used for shitting
When did you finally come? So pretty
Bitch, we have got a problem, it's not enough to be hitting it
Getting off, I'm getting off, keep getting off, keep getting off
I'm getting off, I'm getting off to you
It's not enough, it's not enough, and more can never be enough
I'm getting off, I'm getting off to you
Dip your hands right in 
(Go with it)
Come on it's not a sin 
(Go with it)
You can let me in 
(Go with it)
Wondering where I've been 
(I'll stick it)
Licking your own skin, so trippy
Squeezing your own ass, so pretty, except the way that it's used for shitting
When did you finally come? So pretty
Bitch, we have got a problem, it's not enough to be hitting it
Getting off, I'm getting off, keep getting off, keep getting off
I'm getting off, I'm getting off to you
It's not enough, it's not enough, and more can never be enough
I'm getting off, I'm getting off to you
Hold my knees, lick your treat
Fuck, I'm coming

Licking your own skin, so trippy
Squeezing your own ass, so pretty, except the way that it's used for shitting

Getting off, I'm getting off, keep getting off, keep getting off

I'm broke as hell, my attitude is no good
Like working for white people after watching Rosewood
So I'm a mercenary, I don't care how I get richer
Like American companies that did business with Hitler
Get the picture nigga, I'm the best of both worlds
Without the hidden camera, and the 12 year old girl
Let's face it you're basic, you aren't half the man that I am
I'll throw your gang sign up, and then I'll spit on my hand
Give me a hundred grand, give me your watch, give me your chain
That's your girl? Bitch get over here, give me some brain!
I'll bust off on her face, and right after this segment
She'll probably rub it in her pussy, trying to get herself pregnant
I said it I meant it, that's the way I deal with enemies
Like pro-lifers, that support the death penalty
And don't talk about war, when niggas know that your puss

And I'll jump off with a rope that's wrapped around your head

The safety's off nigga, so get the fuck out my way
Obnoxious nigga, murderous lyrics, I know that you hear it
Now that I'm getting closer and closer I know that you feel it
You eating off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick
Niggas said hip hop was dead, but I invoking the spirit
We're taking it, back in the day to the Golden Age
When whack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage
Immortal Technique, I made this the bump in your ride
Or burn it off the Internet, and bump it outside
Nigga, we keeping it live, we keeping it live
We keeping it live, we keeping it live
Burn it off the fucking internet, and bump it outside
Look motherfucker, my words damage and slaughter
A raging alcoholic like the President's daughters
Disgusting flows like third world country tap-water
But before I hit the border, someone give me a quarter
'Cause I'm a prank call, Cop-Shot, just for kicks
Pay back, for every time that they called me a spic
And Puerto Rican chicks tell me that I fuck like I'm loco (crazy)
And Dominican women call me the rompe toto (pussy destroyer)
They call me osioso (obnoxious), I'd rather get fired than quit
I get unemployment, you work and we making the same shit
How dare you niggas criticize, the way that I spit
You coffee shop revolutionary son-of-a-bitch
But you know what the fuck I think is just pathetic and gay
When niggas speculate, what the fuck Pac would say
You don't know shit, about a dead man's perspective
And talking shit will get your neckbone disconnected
Disrespected, niggaz don't "show no love"
Why you trying to be hardcore, you fucking homo thug
And don't be sensitive and angry at the shit that I wrote
'Cause if you can take a fucking dick, you can take a joke
I'll choke your friends in front of you, to prove that you be falling off
And you won't do shit about it, like the Church during the Holocaust
Kalashnikov machine gun flow that I fire
Obnoxious until they shoot me on the day I retire
Obnoxious nigga, murderous lyrics, I know that you hear it
Now that I'm getting closer and closer I know that you feel it
You're eating off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick

We keeping it live, we keeping it live
Burn it off the fucking internet, and bump it outside
Daaaaamn homie, in high school I beat the shit out of you and your man homie
Your girl wanna blow me and don't even know me
She lonely and she think you a phony
I'll take a piss on a development deal from Sony, or Def Jam
Cause you like, all of the rest man
This ain't a verse, this shit talk at the end of the song
And you can suck a dick, if you think I ended it wrong
Fuck you and I'm gone, fuck y'all niggas!
Piece to the strong hold, EO dub
Word-A-Mouf, Forbidden Chapters
IAK niggas, westpoe killing you slow
The plague; I murder a show, you don't even know
Yeah, foul play nigga
Harlem!
Despite your pseudo-bohemian appearance
That vaguely leftist doctrine of beliefs
You know nothing about art or sex
That you couldn't read in any trendy New York underground fashion magazine
Prototypical non-conformist
You are a vacuous soldier of the thrift store Gestapo
You adhere to a set of standards and tastes
That appear to be determined by an unseen panel of hipster judges (Bullshit!)
Giving a thumbs up or thumbs down to incoming and outgoing trends and styles of music and art
Go analog baby, you're so post-modern
You're diving face forward into a antiquated past
It's disgusting, its offensive don't stick your nose up at me
Yeah, what do you have to say for yourself
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You spend your time sitting in circles with your friends
Pontificating to each other forever competing for that one moment of self aggrandizing glory
In which you hog the intellectual spotlight
Holding dominion over the entire shallow pointless conversation
Oh, we're not worthy!
When you walk by a group of quote unquote normal people
You chuckle to yourself patting yourself on the back as you scoff
With the same superiority complex
Shared by the high school jocks who made your life a living hell
And makes you a slave to the competitive capitalist dogma
You spend every moment of your waking life bitching about
Yeah, what do you have to say for yourself
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
And I say yeah, what do you have to say for yourself
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
'Cause I'm proud of my life and the things that I have done
Proud of myself and the loner I've become
You're free to whine, it will not get you far
I do just fine, my car and my guitar
Proud of my life and the things that I have done
Proud of myself and the loner I've become
You're free to whine, it will not get you far
I do just fine, my car and my guitar, yeah
Well let me tell you this, I am shamelessly self-involved
I spend hours in front of the mirror, making my hair elegantly disheveled
I worry about how this album will sell
Because I believe that it will determine the amount of sex I will have in the future
I self medicate with drugs and alcohol to treat my extreme social anxiety
You are a faker (admit it)
You are a fraud (admit it)
Yeah, you're living a lie (yeah) living a lie (yeah) you're life is living a lie
You don't impress me (admit it)
You don't intimidate me (admit it)
Why don't you bow down, get on the ground, walk this fucking plank
Yeah, what do you have to say for yourself
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
And I say yeah
I'm proud of my life and the things that I have done
Proud of myself and the loner I've become
You're free to whine, it will not get you far
I do just fine, my car and my guitar, guitar go!
I'm drift drift drift drifting yeah
I'm drift drift drift drifting yeah oh
And I am done with this
I wanna taste the breeze of every great city
My car and my guitar
So you come to me, made of these, urgent unfulfilled
Oh no no no no no
I have when I'm dead I'll rest
But that's away still
When I'm dead I'll rest, I'll rest
Keep me alive
Only you can do it
If not you'll die too
And I'll see to it
It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it
Keep me alive
I can't accept my fate
I need help
Before it's too late
It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it
I need to belong
I need to hang on
I need, need
Keep me alive
Feelings I must obey
Can't turn my eyes from the past
This crisis is the last
It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it
Keep me alive
I rely on your judgement
I've got none left of my own
Don't know what I'm doing
It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it
I need to belong
I need to hang on
I need, need
Keep me alive
Only you can do it
Keep me alive
Only you can do it
It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it
I need to belong
I need to hang on
I need, need
The record goes from blue to gold, so thank you for all your help
I know you want to jump around, but try to contain yourself
You always struck me as the type to take it lightly
But now you're gonna have to shut your mouth and fight me
Oh backstabber, backstabber
You're all alone. You're all over the popular magazines
Oh, will never care. What do you care? You're down with the Japanese
But you've got no right to sit there saying I abuse it when you only sleep with girls who say they like your music
Oh backstabber, backstabber, backstabber, backstabber
Backstabber
Backstabber, backstabber
Backstabber 
Backstabber, hope grabber, greedy little fit haver. God, I feel for you, fool
You shit lover, off-brusher, jaded, bitter joy crusher. Failure has made you so cruel, you
Rotten to the core. Rotten to the core
Rotten like a crackwhore, begging out the backdoor. Show us what you're good for, post it to the noise board
Come on join the bloodsport, show us some support. Still working at the drugstore
Is it because you're a fucking 
Backstabber, hope grabber, greedy little fit haver. God, I feel for you, fool
You shit lover, off-brusher, jaded, bitter joy crusher. Failure has made you so cruel, you
So don't tell me what to write, and don't tell me that I'm wrong
And don't tell me not to reference my songs within my songs
Oh oh, you backstabber! Hope grabber! 
Backstabber greedy fucking fit haver! 
Backstabber!

Why do you care what people think?
Are you hooked up to their leash?
You know anklebiters ate up your personality
Try to remember how it felt
To just make up your own steps
And let anklebiters chew up, spit out someone else
Fall in love with yourself
Because someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Why you wanna please the world and leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
What do you actually expect?
A broken mirror to reflect?
You know anklebiters gave you a false perception
And why do I defend your ignorance?
Oh, why do I defend the state you're in?
You should fall in love with yourself, oh again
Fall in love with yourself
Because someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Why you wanna please the world and leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Anklebiters
Anklebiters
Someday you're gonna be alone
Anklebiters

I tried an idea for no reason 
Keep the sun of my shoulders 
Crawling back to 
A black out 
Touching new life 
Face down 
Set the pace again 
Set the pace again 
The drive the idea still existing 
Sat and shuddered broke the pattern 
Falling inward 
In and down up and out 
Let it go fall away back 
Call it off any day anyway 
Make you feel this 
A Black out 
Touching new life 
Face down 
Set the pace again 
A Black out 
Touching new life 
Face down 
Set the pace again 
Don't take the fall 
We'd hate to see 
That's entertainment 
Get some 
Eyes on the goal 
Last one to get 
Is passed over looked over 
Never rehearse 
They've spiked the water 
It's in the blood 
Get some 
We've underestimated 
How can I 
Get some 
How can I 
How can I 
How can I 
Get some 
How can I 
How can I 
How can I 
Get some 
A Black out 
Touching new life 
Face down 
Set the pace again 
A Black out 
Touching new life 
Face down 
Set the pace again 
A blackout 
Could this be the one 
A blackout 
Could this be the one 
A blackout 
Could this be the one 
A blackout 
Could this be the one
Oh you're divine
Oh you're divine
Oh Oh Oh did I tell you you're divine
Oh Oh Oh Oh did I ever when you were alive
Did it hurt when you bled?
Did it, oh lover boy, oh fever head?
I'll bet you never thought I'd try
Your mouth, my love, was open wide
Singing oh you were going to be my life
Dammit!
Oh Oh Oh Oh you were going to be my life
Did you sing "Oh happy day"?
Singing it
Sing it that time I went away?
Got to ease my aching head
Do you know
No other way cut off your legs oh
Hey oh
Did you ever wish me dead
Oh lover boy, oh fever head?
No you must, no you must not go away
How will you ever walk again?
And I, I might as well be dead
But I could kill you instead...
Quit acting so friendly 
Don't nod, don't laugh all nicely
Don't think you'll up-end me
Don't sigh, don't sip your iced-tea 
And don't say, "It's been a while..." 
And don't flash that stupid smile
Don't ask me, don't ask me, don't ask me
Ask me, ask me how I've been 
Don't think I've forgotten 
You never liked that necklace 
So cordial, so rotten
Kiss, kiss, let's meet for breakfast 
Don't show up so on-time
And don't act like you're so kind 
Don't ask me, don't ask me, don't ask me
Ask me, ask me how I've been
Don't ask me, don't ask me, ow!
So don't sit there and play just 
So frank, so straight, so candid
So thoughtful, so gracious 
So sound, so even-handed
Don't be so damn benign
And don't waste my fucking time
Don't ask me, don't ask me, don't ask me
Ask me, ask me how I've been
Don't ask, hey
Don't ask, hey
Don't ask, hey
Don't, don't, don't ask me
Don't, don't, don't ask me
Don't, don't, don't ask me
Don't, don't, don't!
Don't ask me, don't ask me, don't ask me
Don't ask me, don't ask me, don't ask me
Ask me, ask me how I've been
Who the fuck do you think you are
Get out of my hair
Who the fuck do you think you are
Comin' round here
Who the fuck who the fuck
Who the fuck do you think you are
Get your comb out of there
Combin' out my hair
I'm not like other girls
You can't straighten my curls
I'm not like other girls
You can't straighten my curls
No!
Who the fuck you tryin' to be
Get your dog away from me!
What the fuck you doing in there
Get your dirty fingers out of my hair
Who who who who
Fuck fuck fuck you
I'm free, you'll see
I'm free, you'll see
Infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio on
And how could anyone?
You are in my dreams
Half human, half machine
You with someone else that I have felt and seen
I cannot rest, or my consciousness contest
Looking right through the lens
From winter brings the spring again
And infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio on
And we fall asleep again with ties to mend
So please let the cleaning begin with evolution
Hold my breath 'til communication is only just a test
Hold my breath 'til communication is only just a test
Hold my breath 'til communication is only just a test
You are in my dreams
Half human, half machine
Looking right through the lens
From winter brings the spring again
And infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio on
Infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio
She wants to know, wants to know where I've been
She's got the gloves on, she's got the gloves on again
She's thinks she's smooth, thinks she's smooth and now I'm saying
That I'm not going down, I'm not going down (I'm not going down)
You say this ain't the end of me
Fall down, pull the rug under me
Feels like I'm falling, but I tell you I'm not going down
One day you'll be the end of me
Go blind, pull the wool over me
Feels like I'm falling, but I tell you I'm not going down
Because you push me, push me over the edge
Tired of wasting my time, tired of wasting my breath
Because you push me, push me over the edge
Tired of wasting my time, tired of putting me through this again
Through this again
She wants to fight, wants to fight and I've been drinking
We put the walls up, we put the walls up again
I know she's right, know she's right, God I'm drifting
But I'm not going down (I'm not going down)
You say this ain't the end of me
Fall down, pull the rug under me
Feels like I'm falling, but I tell you I'm not going down
One day you'll be the end of me
Go blind, pull the wool over me
Feels like I'm falling, but I tell you I'm not going
Because you push me, push me over the edge
Tired of wasting my time, tired of wasting my breath
Because you push me, push me over the edge
Tired of wasting my time, tired of putting me through this again
Because you, never did try, never did look to see that I'm all right (whoa, whoa-whoa)
Because you, always right, gotta fight, always wanna know (whoa, whoa-whoa)
Because you, never did try, never did look to see that I'm all right (whoa, whoa-whoa)
Because you (you, you, you...)
Because you push me, push me over the edge
Tired of wasting my time, tired of wasting my breath
Because you push me, push me over the edge
Tired of wasting my time, tired of wasting my breath
(Because you push me) you push me, you push me
(Because you push me) you push me over the edge
(Because you push me) you push me, you push me
Why do you do it?
You're putting me through this again
Through this again
Through this again
(Through this again)
What can I say
I think I had enough
I think you keep playing to play
Knowing that I feel sick
C'mon just say it
Just say you like to play
This game
Just to drive me wild
I let
You pretend
But you know
Truth is that
I love you to death
Like you love this game
This time
There's a common thread
And so I sit
And watch you play dumb I'd like to see
You play with the odds
On your plate instead
Come on just say it
Just say you like to keep this pace
Just to drive me wild
I let
You pretend
But you know
Truth is that
I love you to death
Like you love this game
It keeps me hanging tight
What can I say
I think your head's fucked
Go on drive me wild
This time
There's a constant theme
This time
There's a common thread
That keeps me hanging tight
And it
Tells me something's right
What can I say
I fuckin' had enough
I think you just play what you play
Knowing that I feel sick
C'mon just say it
Say you like to play this game
'Cause it drives me wild
How fucking romantic
All the stars are out
Twinkling twinkling twinkling
And fluttering about
What a tacky sunset
What a vulgar moon
Play another charming
Rogers and hart tune
How fucking romantic
Must we really waltz?
Drag another cliche
Howling from the vaults
Love you obviously
Like you really care
Even though you treat me
Like a dancing bear
Toss your bear a goldfish
As he cycles by
Don't forget to feed your
Bear or it'll die
Midwest love affair, I bend when I am bored
Late-night-liquor-blue will lead me to the floor
Can we fake it, can we make-believe?
I'm so full of love it deeply sickens me
But all I could do was close my eyes and cross my arms and hope to die
'Cause you don't fucking listen when I'm around
The least you could do is take it back, all the vicious remarks and verbal attacks
'Cause I can't fucking stand it when you're around
Midwest aftermath, the rumors start to rise
Did I truly do the things that you've described?
They must hate me, every single one
It just sickens them what I consider fun
But all I could do was close my eyes and cross my arms and hope to die
'Cause you don't fucking listen when I'm around
The least you could do is take it back, all the vicious remarks and verbal attacks
'Cause I can't fucking stand it when you're around
But all I could do was close my eyes and cross my arms and hope to die
'Cause you don't fucking listen when I'm around
The least you could do is take it back, all the vicious remarks and verbal attacks
'Cause I can't fucking stand it when you're around
No, I can't fucking stand it
When you're around
No, I can't fucking stand it
When you're around
Speak, I'm listening
Baby, I'm your sweet thing
Believe what I'm saying
God's truth, I'm not lying
I lie steady
Rest your head on me
I'll smooth it nicely
Rub it better till it bleeds
And you'll believe me
Caught out again
I'm calling you weak
Getting even
And I, I was joking
Sweet babe, let me stroke it
Take, I'm giving
God's truth, I'm not lying
And you'll believe me
I, I, I'm calling you in
And I'll make it better
I'll rub till it bleeds
I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it until it, hey!
I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it until it, hey!
I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it until it
I'll rub it until it

The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
(Notorious B.I.G.)
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace... smack the bitch in the face;
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, "The Vapors"
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Make up to break up {*singing in background*} niggaz need to wake up
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins till amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits!
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
Suckin on the tits! Had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was "Humpin Around" and "Jump-in Around"
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)
(Notorious B.I.G.)
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that... (no question)
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya till you're gushy, so please don't push... me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?
(Eminem)
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin: horse's heads,
Human sacrifices, cannibalism; candles and exorcism
Animals having sex with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fucking, meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lying, I got a nine in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dying to cock him
Who's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, red on the third;
Then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong
Chorus (to fade)
I can taste your innocence
Young and sweet like mother made you
Everything froze into ice
These motherfuckers just got wicked
I can't explain this little man
Taken over
Can't explain the way that I feel
I can't explain this little man
Taken over
Can't explain the way that I feel
Everyone got twisted up
Everyone got behind my back and broke it
'Cause it's my world
Everyone got twisted up
All your friends got behind my back
And broke it
'Cause it's my world
Everyone got twisted up
Everyone got behind my back and broke it
'Cause it's my world
Everyone got twisted up
Everyone got behind my back
And broke it
'Cause it's my world
1, 2, 3 here I come with the wicked
I can't explain this little man
Taken over
Can't explain the way that I feel
I can't explain this little man
Taken over
Can't explain the way that I feel
You are the love I never found
You are the love I never found
I can't explain this little man
Taken over
Can't explain the way that I feel
I can't explain this little man
Taken over
Can't explain the way that I feel
I can't explain the way that I...
I can't explain the way that I...
I can't explain the way that I...

Just a few seconds away (Away!)
From everyone... From everything
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
A second of your time and an inch of my own space!
Silence, quiet... Need a little peace of mind
After all this... After all that you do
Shut it up, zip it... Need a little time to think
Without all this... Without all that you do!
Keep it, don't want it... Think I'll just go away
Away from here... From you
Time out, walk it off... Think I need to throw a flag
Just a little break from the games that you play!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
From everyone... From everything!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
All I want, from all of you:
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
Away from this... It's never ending!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
A second of your time and an inch of my own space!
Beat up, whip it... Topped with a little scream
All that you are, for all that you do
Crush it all, kill it... Calling out my enemy
Don't want anything... I want nothing from you!
Dry it up, baby... Turn around and walk away
Cry your tears, pussy!
Lift it up, destroy it... Build it up to tear it down
All the little things that make me run away!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
From everyone... From everything!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
All I want, from all of you:
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
Away from this... It's never ending!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
A second of your time and an inch of my own space!
Stop talking... Stop botherin' me
Just walk away... I've had enough today
I have a life too... I've had enough of you
Feel like screaming... So go the fuck away
Go away!... Go away!... Go away!... Go away!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
From everyone... From everything!
Just a few seconds away (Away!)
All I want, from all of you:

Look what you've done to your arms
I see you don't care who you harm
I understand
You've never been the girl next door
But now you're worse than before
Self destruct
Self... destruct
Life's miseries pain is deep
Does it matter what anybody cares?
Can there be another outlet?
Nobody gets close, nobody dares
Self destruct
Self... destruct
I understand your problems
I can figure out the reasons why
But I can't help what I feel
I can't accept what I see
Self destruct
Self... destruct
There's got to be a way to get out
Rrrroah, go!
Where was God when I needed a friend?
And where was God when I came to an end?
Where was God when I lost my mind?
Where was God when I couldn't find?
I don't wanna be up or down
Don't wanna be up or down
Don't wanna be up or down
I don't wanna be up or down
Where was love when I felt like hate?
Where was hate when I felt like love?
Where were you when you said you'd be there?
Where was the fear, when I said I was scared?
I don't wanna be up or down
Don't wanna be up or down
I don't wanna be up or down
I don't wanna be up or down... Why?
Tell me what you believe (Tell me what you believe)
I'll tell you what you should see (I'll tell you what you should see)
I don't know who to trust (Tell me what you believe)
My heart is filled with disgust
('Breathing'... "Speak")
('Breathing'... "Speak")
('Breathing'... "Speak")
... Whoa!
I can't take this now!
Tell me what you believe (Tell me what you believe)
I'll tell you what you should see (I'll tell you what you should see)
I don't know who to trust (Tell me what you believe)
My heart is filled with disgust (I'll tell you what you should see)
Tell me what you believe (Tell me what you believe)
Tell me what you believe... Ah-ah...
Ah-ah-ah-oh... Oh-oh-oh... Ah-ah-ah-oh
"Ladies and Gentlemen..."
"May I have your attention?"
"Are you ready for the joke?" ['laughter']
"Are you ready for the great deception!?"
God! (Tell me what you believe) God!
God! (Tell me what you believe) God!
Whoa! (Tell me what you believe)
Ah-ah (Tell me what you believe) Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah (Tell me what you believe) Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah (Tell me what you believe) Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah... Ah-ah-ah-ah...
Ah-ah... Ah-ah-ah-ah...
"Ladies and Gentlemen tell me what you believe" played backwards
You're not who they say you are
They made you the enemy
(CHRIST-jah flesh; CHRIST-light within; CHRIST-Beginning and the end)
Taken something so beautiful
Painted a new picture that makes me sick
(CHRIST-Witness; CHRIST-Living one; CHRIST-First and last)
Feed our minds confusion
Sweeten the taste of pollution
(CHRIST-Word life; CHRIST-Resurrect; CHRIST-Everlasting jah)
Some people call you father
Maybe you could set me free
These people hate each other
But you've always been there for me
I refuse to be like you
Without my life, caving in
(CHRIST-Jah flesh; CHRIST-Light Within; CHRIST-Beginning and the end)
I surrender, giving up all that is me
Yielding to you
(CHRIST-Witness; CHRIST-Living one; CHRIST-First and the last)
Shape me in my brokenness
Empower me forever
(CHRIST-Word life; CHRIST-Resurrect; CHRIST-Everlasting jah)
Some people call you father
Maybe you could set me free
These people hate each other
But you've always been there for me
Some people call you father
Maybe you could set me free
These people hate each other
But you've always been there for me
Some people call you father
Maybe you could set me free
These people hate each other
But you've always been there for me
I know you will complete this work started in me
I need you more than ever now that I know who you are
I know you will complete this work started in me
I need you more than ever now that I've come so far
I know you will complete this work started in me
I need you more than ever now that I know who you are
Carved in hate, carved in hate
War is insane
Everywhere, everywhere
Blood and disgrace
Look around, look around
Apocalypse now!
Terminate, terminate
With extreme hate
Bring it
Bring it
Bring it
Bring it
Who da cap fit, who da cap fit
You know what I mean
All your envy, all your envy
I'll make you bleed
Why don't you go away, why don't you go away
And never come back no more
Cut throat, cut throat
Fuck off!
Why don't you go away, why don't you go away
Never come back no more
Cut throat scum
You don't have a soul...
Fuck off
And now I finally see that the further we go
We're only treading ground that we already know
I could write you a song, send you a note
Or empty out your trash
And buy a bucket full of diamonds, but 
Even the most beautiful of all...
Roses must someday crumble to dust and fade away
It's certain tragedy
So it's on into the lonely nights 
And all the rest of it
The empty space between me and the sunken walls
And feeling someone's hand around my neck
Choking away the life that I have left
And I can finally see that the further I go
I'm only treading ground I don't wanna know
I'll probably hang upside down from wooden rafters in my home
And look at old photos of you
So it's on into the lonely nights 
And all the rest of it
The empty space between me and the sunken walls
And feeling someone's hand around my neck
Choking away the life that I have left
I miss the warmth of the summer
When we were on our own
But now it's winter, my bones
Are cold
And now I finally see that the further we go
We're only treading ground that we already know
I could write you a song, send you a note
Or empty out your trash
And buy a bucket full of diamonds, but 
Even the most beautiful of all...
Roses must someday crumble to dust and fade away
It's certain tragedy
I used to think that this was perfect
And wish that it was never ending
But those days are gone forever
It's something I'm not missing
There's a force there's a voice, in my head
Telling me to think
About the times that you were cruel and mean
And I don't care if you walk away
I'm here to stay and you need to hear
You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only one
You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only one
I have to take advantage, before the moment passes by
It's so hard to manage, the ups and downs of your life
Someone help, someone speak, before I start to scream out
Anything to break the silence
You're holding me back, confined by doubt
You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only one
You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only one
'Cause I need you
'Cause I need you here with me
When it falls through
And I'm down upon my knees
There's a force
There's a voice in my head
Telling me to think about everything
Last time I believed
Now I realize!
You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only one
You make me sick!
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick!
And I can't be the only one
Sick! Sick! Sick! Sick!
You make me sick!
You make me sick!
You make me sick!
You make me sick!
You make me sick!
You make me sick!
You make me sick!
You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain 'til it hurts
You've taken all my money
And you want more
Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies who are fools of the first division
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
Kill-joy, bad guy
Big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good, are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide?
(I think you should)
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good?
Feel good
Talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot-air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown school-boy
Let me tan your hide
Dog with disease
You're the king of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Know-All
Was the fin on your back part of the deal?
Shark
Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
(You never did, right from the start)
Insane, should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Make yourself null and void
Make me feel good
I feel good
Sweep the black super market! Sweep it up with your teeth!
Put your feather in a box! (Take off! Take off!)
Send it off to me!
I smell oxygen, precious. Bareback on your horse.
Gallop off course, get off! (Get off! Get off!)
Filled with fury's force.
There's a fire in the peach pit, a blaze in the snake pit.
(Hey) You erased it but we saw you fake it.
There's blood on the good book, love in the bad brook.
Suck out all the nerve and make it yours!
There's a fire in the peach pit (3x)
Saw you fake it...
You brought me to my knees.
Your art, it brought me to my knees.
You're so perfect to please us! You make all the right noise!
Get the business clothes off! (Take off! Take off!)
And strip down to your voice!
We will show you your future and choke the air from your world. (Choke, choke, choke)
You can be our once-twice-thrice-four times then goodbye girl!
There's a fire in the peach pit, a blaze in the snake pit.
(Hey) Erased it but we saw you fake it.
There's a crack in the blank stare, back in the black raised hair.
It's not fair.
There's a fire in the peach pit (3x)
You brought me to my knees.
Your art, it brought me to my knees.
I don't know who told you that (who told you that)
I don't know who told you that but it's a lie.
Believe me.
I swear, I shall not deceive thee. (Yeah!)
I don't know who sold you that but it's a fake.
I don't know who sold you that baby but it's a fake.
Remind me.
My eyes see straight behind me.
I've never killed nobody.
I promise you're my first;
You always remember your first.
(Okay, here we fuckin' go!)
You brought me to my knees.
Your art, it brought me to my knees.
"Now I can taste the war that I've been fighting.
Start to fall but I'm still standing here behind the wall of dying faith.
I can't forget the fight that's growing stronger.
Face to face with hopes of longer days to build on something we should save.
I stand alone.
I'm on my own.
My hands will bleed. (my hands will bleed)
I'm holding on to what is gone.
What's left of me?
I'm fallingdown.
But I should find my strength in this:
A light that burns to reconnect my heart for what it's meant to give.
Walk. Fall. Stand again so I can..."
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you that sets the test
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
"I gave Them life, I gave Them all
They drained my very soul dry
I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts to be free?
Words of strength and care and sympathy
I opened doors that would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me"
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you that sets the test
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream
Where all is God and God is just a word
"We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood, we planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers, sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yeah, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor on slogans such as
'Wish You Could Hear'
'Love Is All We Need'
'Kick Out The Jams'
'Kick Out Your Mother'
'Cut Up Your Friend'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'
And We know the Flag of Love is from above
And We can force you to be free
And We can force you to believe"
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
"I believe in the Power of Good.
I Believe in the State of Love.
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right.
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right."
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I Want to believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to believe
There's a light shining through somehow
And I want to believe
And you want to believe
And we want to believe
And we want to live
Oh, we want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
Live
Live
Live
It echoes in my brain
...I didn't mean it...
Pulses through my veins
...I didn't mean it...
I'm the one to blame
...I didn't mean it...
Did too much cocaine
...I didn't mean it...
Slackerbitch, fag hag, whore
Looks real cute, her lips are sore
Slackerbitch, fag hag, whore
Always comes back for more
Your memory will fade
...I didn't mean it...
You've always had it made
...I didn't mean it...
I know you feel betrayed
...I didn't mean it...
I just wanted to get laid
...I didn't mean it...
Slackerbitch, fag hag, whore
Looks real cute, her lips are sore
Slackerbitch, fag hag, whore
Always knocking on my door
You come across impure
...I didn't mean it...
You're goddamn immature
...I didn't mean it...
You act so insecure
...I didn't mean it...
You hate me now, I'm sure
...I didn't mean it...
Slackerbitch, fag hag, whore
Looks real cute, her lips are sore
Slackerbitch, fag hag, whore
Dripping sex from every pore
Slackerbitch, fag hag, whore
Looks real cute, her lips are sore
Slackerbitch, fag hag, whore
Such a motherfucking bore
C, A, P, S, I, Z, E
All the way home
I'm gonna tilt a while
M, I, S, S, M, E
All you want
You're gonna wait a while
C, A, P, S, I, Z, E
All the way home
I'm gonna tilt a while
M, I, S, S, M, E
All you want
You're gonna wait a while
C, A, P, S, I, Z, E
All the way home
I'm gonna tilt a while
Oh oh oh
Momma turned her back on me
Daddy left when I was three
Go tell sis I'm out the door
I won't need 'em anymore
We can settle by the sea
Trouble's gonna bury me
Leave my sorrows in the sand
I see water, I see land
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh~
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh~
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh

C, A, P, S, I, Z, E
All the way home
I'm gonna tilt a while
M, I, S, S, M, E
All you want
Come closer now
I know your desire is to be desired
Steal a kiss, yeah, and call us friends
Distance is a thief in which you conspire
Turn and time and time will tell
Time will tell or tear us apart
You're miles and miles and miles away
Silence reveals where we really are
You only stayed to break my heart
I can tell it by the way you run away,
Runaway girl
You only stayed to break my heart
I can tell it by the way you run away,
Runaway girl
Runaway, runaway girl
It's clearer now
You're nowhere into giving
Giving into, giving into me
It's your fault
You're like a rare disease
I know you're in love
With love I believe
Turn and time and time will tell
Time will tell or tear us apart
You're miles and miles and miles away
Silence reveals where we really are
You only stayed to break my heart
I can tell it by the way you run away,
Runaway girl
You only stayed to break my heart
I can tell it by the way you run away,
Runaway girl
Run away, runaway girl
Do you expect me to wait here?
(All alone in my thoughts and fears)
My whole life could flash before your eyes
(Hope one day that you realize)
This isn't the way it's supposed to be
(This is who I crown, now without me)
Your regrets from us built up inside
(Great space for you, love buried alive)
Buried alive
You only stayed to break my heart
I can tell it by the way you run away,
Runaway girl
You only stayed to break my heart
I can tell it by the way you run away,
Runaway girl
Run away, runaway girl
I only stayed to break your heart
You can tell it by the way I walk away,
Runaway girl
I only stayed to break your heart
You can tell it by the way I run away,
Runaway girl
Poetry is no place for a heart that's a whore
And I'm young and I'm strong
But I feel old and tired
Overfired
And I've been poked and stoked
It's all smoke, there's no more fire
Only desire
For you, whoever you are
For you, whoever you are
You say my time here has been some sort of joke
That I've been messing around
Some sort of incubating period
For when I really come around
I'm cracking up
And you have no idea
No idea how it feels to be on your own
In your own home
With the fucking phone
And the mother of gloom
In your bedroom
Standing over your head
With her hand in your head
With her hand in your head
I will not pretend
I will not put on a smile
I will not say I'm all right for you
When all I wanted was to be good
To do everything in truth
To do everything in truth
Oh I wish, I wish, I wish I was born a man
So I could learn how to stand up for myself
Like those guys with guitars
I've been watching in bars
Who've been stamping their feet to a different beat
To a different beat
To a different beat
I will not pretend
I will not put on a smile
I will not say I'm all right for you
When all I wanted was to be good
To do everything in truth
To do everything in truth
You bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody
I will not pretend
I will not put on a smile
I will not say I'm all right for you
For you, whoever you are
For you, whoever you are
Ha ha ha, I love this shit
Well
Well
Well
Well
We spun like birds on fire
Right down towards the residence
And I, I took all that I desired
Even crooks have to pay the rent
We swam like rats on fire
Right, right down the reservoir
We took all that we could carry
But we tried to carry more
And you know, you know, you know it all went wrong
And you know, you know, you know it was all wrong
We choked on street tap water
Well, I'm going to have to try the real thing
I took your laugh by the collar
And it knew not to swing
Any time I tried an honest job
Well, the till had a hole in it
We laughed about paying rent
'Cause the county jails they're free
And you know, you know, you know it all went wrong
And you know, you know, you know it was all wrong
Deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll as you would, child
Well, deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll as you would, child
Oh, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again
I said it looks it's time to use my feet again
Well, I just spent my last one hundred dollars
God, I'll pay my bill again
Oh, I don't care
Oh, I just don't care
Deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll shaken and shy
Deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I went down like a burned out rag of a child
Well, King Rat has me on his list again
I can never be on the fence again
I found out it's all loud open like an organ and it
Talk, talk, talk, talk again
He promised me that when I cheated him
But I could open my eye, well
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again
Deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I got fed like a fish full of open smiles
Blue water, deep water, senseless denial
I got fed like a fish on the cardboard smiles
Well, well
What do you have to say for yourself?
I said well, well, well
I said well, well, well, well, well
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again
I hardly knew I should use my feet again
What do you have to say for yourself?
What do you have to say for yourself?
On the morning of the first eviction
They carried out the wishes
Of the landlord and his son
Furniture's out
On the sidewalk
Next to the family
That little piggie went to market
So they're kicking out everyone
Talking 'bout process
And dismissal
Forced removal of the people
On the corner
Shelter
And location
Everybody wants somewhere
The elected are such willing partners
Look who's buying all their tickets
To the game
Development wants
Development gets
It's official
Development wants this neighborhood gone
So the city just wants the same
Talking 'bout process
And dismissal
Forced removal of the people
On the corner
Shelter
And location
Everybody wants somewhere
(Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere!)
(Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere!)
(Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere!)
(Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere!)
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere!
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere!
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere!
Everybody wants somewhere!
Process
And dismissal
Process
And dismissal
Shelter
And location
Everybody wants somewhere
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere!
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere!
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere!
Everybody wants
I should have seen it coming, I should have fucking known
How could I let you play me, I don't even know
I should have seen it coming, I should have fucking known
How could I let you play me, I don't even know
I'm such a fool I can't believe I let you in my life
You broke the rules but I should have known you do it all the time
Though we were cool but then again who am I kidding
It's every players favourite crime, to make you feel
Like it's all real, when it's a lie
And I should have known
I should have known, my family they never did pretend
My mama felt, she never liked you neither did my friends
And when you blamed it all on me I should have known
That's what liers always try to do, it wasn't me, 
It was you, you're the fool
And I should have known
If your heart was simple just like mine is, then you would know just how it feels
When someone takes advantage of your kindness, you think you're never gonna heal
If your soul was deep just like mine is, then you would known not to give up
Keep my faith even through the darkness, yeah I still believe in love.
I still believe...
Passing slowly though a vector
Damp with fog the bog that grows the former business sector
With my laugh, my lone companion.
Only I can save the lives that blink within this canyon
Whoa
We're passing slow, passing slow. Slow, Slow
Drink the colors of the night time
If you were wrong then I was right and this will be the right time
I'll display my disaffection (you grind me up, yeah, you spit me out)
Out across the city
Loud and proud in your direction
Whoa
We're passing slow, we're passing slow. Slow, Slow.
Whoa
We're passing slow, we're passing slow. Slow, Slow.
But when I get to your apartment I climb the rail outside the building
A band of them were in your apartment
They tied you up unwound, unwilling
I watch them cut, watch them touch, watch them do what they came to do
And in I come to lick it up
Clean up what is left of you
Ha ha ha show me what you got
I'll remember it
And Dublin in a rainstorm
And sitting in the long grass in summer
Keepin' warm
I'll remember it
Every restless night
We were so young then
We thought that everything
We could possibly do was right
Then we moved
Stolen from our very eyes
And I wondered where you went to
Tell me when did the light die
You will rise
You'll return
The phoenix from the flame
You will learn
You will rise
You'll return
Being what you are
There is no other Troy
For you to burn
And I never meant to hurt you
I swear I didn't mean
Those things I said
I never meant to do that to you
Next time I'll keep my hands to myself instead
Oh, does she love you
What do you want to do?
Does she need you like I do?
Do you love her?
Is she good for you?
Does she hold you like I do?
Do you want me?
Should I leave?
I know you're always telling me
That you love me
Just sometimes I wonder
If I should believe
Oh, I love you
God, I love you
I'd kill a dragon for you
I'll die
But I will rise
And I will return
The Phoenix from the flame
I have learned
I will rise
And you'll see me return
Being what I am
There is no other Troy
For me to burn
And you should've left the light on
You should've left the light on
Then I wouldn't have tried
And you'd never have known
And I wouldn't have pulled you tighter
No I wouldn't have pulled you close
I wouldn't have screamed
No I can't let you go
If the door wasn't closed
No I wouldn't have pulled you to me
No I wouldn't have kissed your face
You wouldn't have begged me to hold you
If we hadn't been there in the first place
Ah but I know you wanted me to be there oh oh
Every look that you threw told me so
But you should've left the light on
You should've left the light on
And the flames burned away
But you're still spitting fire
Make no difference what you say
You're still a liar
You're still a liar
You're still a lawyer
(Yes it's really LAWYER, according to the official books!)
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Every once in a while there is some asshole
Giving you shit, cause something in his life won't fold
Usually, I'd walk away
The peace offering another day
He seems not to wanna trade
So he must pay (it's the inevitable, it's going down!)
He's talking! (fuck him up!) at me (fuck him up!)
Instead of! (fuck him up!) to me (fuck him up!)
My intelligence! (fuck him up!) sacked me (fuck him up!)
But he say's! (fuck him up!) he'll run through me (fuck him up!)
(Thrasher!) I'm a (Thrasher!)
I'm a (Thrasher!) you ain't know (Thrasher!)
That I'm a (Thrasher!) I'm a (Thrasher!)
I'm a (Thrasher!) I'm a (Thrasher!) I'm a'
Every once in a while there's that same asshole
Try to swing and hit, cause the things he can't control
And God knows what will unfurl
Either with or without his girl
'Cause I browsed down, his fingers curled
Like it's his world (it's the inevitable, it's going down!)
Now I know that slime ballers laying out and all
But he said things that were so uncalled for
But he deserved it (the boy deserved it)
And I know you're his girl but you should ride wit me
'Cause I'll show you feelings that you've never seen
Keep this rocking it's brown mixed with green (we'll be swervin)
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
You're too far to bring you close 
And too high to see below 
Just hangin' on your daily dose 
I know you never needed anyone 
But the rolling papers for your grass 
How can you give what you don't have 
You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
Start out playing with yourself 
You get more fun within your shell 
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way 
I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 
I rather eat my soup with a fork 
Or drive a cab in New York 
'Cause to talk to you is harder work 
So what's the point of wasting all my words 
If it's just the same or even worse 
Than reading poems to a horse 
You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
I bet you'll find someone like you 
'Cause there's a foot for every shoe 
And I wish you luck but I've other things to do 
I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 
I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more
I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we
Left this haunted town
The spookiness of night surrounds us in trees
Us on bikes on fountains
Never been alone as such
Your foots on the clutch
Your hand's on my crutch
Slow down
And run in little circles till circles are
Black and on the ground.
And clever isn't where it's at
'Cause dumb is back
Heads are holes and clouds
And I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we got this flaunting down
A feather in a baseball cap
You dance all wack
Weakened knees call
And I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we rocked three daunting nouns
It's better not to holla back
'Cause life long cracks
Speak through these walls
(Nicki Minaj)
I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flat screen
(Ha ha) Plasma
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that hoe, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
(Eminem)
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollerin' "Why, God?", He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)
The wo-world is my punchin' bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic
(Nicki Minaj)
(I-I-I-I-Is) Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little hoe
Now Imma wrap your coffin with a bow
(Ni-ni-ni) "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a stand, still, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' bucked, overbite
I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy ass, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli
These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli)
(Eminem)
A-a-a-a-all you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but Imma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if
You have the same passion I have
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass
You ass dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds class
It's (high class) meets (white trash)
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Roman! Roman
Stop it, stop it
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad
You and this boy Slim Shady
What's goin' on?
They'll lock you away
They'll put you in a jail cell
I promise
Take your mother's warning, Roman
Pleaaaaaaase
Back to bed! Run along
Let's go! Come on
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys
Shout
Heavy, you want it heavy
Welcome to my world
Feel the weight of it grinding down, and
Heavy, I want it heavy
Welcome to my world
Feel the weight of it grinding down again
Gather your pathetic masses and bring them to me
To a world devoid of lie
To another time, to another place
And let the broken ones taste my misery
Rip away the disguise and you will realize that you find
The truth is sickening
We don't need to change that, really
I kind of like it ugly
Leave it
Make it binding
Seething, blinding, screaming
Heavy, you want it heavy
Welcome to my world
Feel the weight of it grinding down, and
Heavy, I want it heavy
Welcome to my world
Feel the weight of it grinding down again
Gather your psychotic masses and bring them to me
To a world devoid of sanity
Another time and another place
And let the violent ones crave calamity
Rip away the disguise and you will realize that you find
The truth is sickening
We don't need to change that, really
I kind of like it ugly
Leave it
Make it binding
Seething, blinding, screaming
The race of the Mother Culture is thickening
The rape of the Mother Culture is nearing
The face of the Mother Culture is sickening
The rape of the Mother is the loving I need
Bleeding now (One, two, three, four)
The race of the Mother Culture is thickening
The rape of the Mother Culture is nearing
The face of the Mother Culture is sickening
The rape of the Mother is the loving I need
Bleeding now (One, two, three, four)
Heavy, you want it heavy
Welcome to my world grinding down and
Heavy, I want it heavy
Feel the weight of it grind and
Heavy
You want it heavy
You want it heavy
You want it heavy

(Whoa, oh, oh) The lines are drawn
(Whoa, oh, oh) Whose side are you on
And all our sins come back to haunt us in the end
To hang around and tap us on the shoulder
And smile
Silent
It's all implied
"You'll die trying to live this down. you might as well forget it."
Still, I'm convinced that wondering what if is the worst thing there is
So we bottled and shelved all our regrets
Let them ferment and came back to our senses
Drove back home and slept a few days
Woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be
All these lines fall short of what I had in mind
A failed attempt to capsulize a feeling
So I just try fail and try and try again
Someday I swear I'm going to get it
Because I'm convinced that giving in is the worst thing there is
So we bottled and shelved all our regrets
Let them ferment and came back to our senses
Drove back home and slept a few days
Woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be
We'll get over it
Sad, strong, safe and sober
We'll move forward
And know where we went wrong
But "you can't go home again."
Give me back
My pictures of me
Me, you and him makes three
It figures the wheezing will measure your rate of depress and I hope you know
Like a bitch in heat
I hope she know
So put another penny in and turn the crank
Until the frames cease to move
And the movie turns into a photo
A photo the size of a kiss
I hope she knows
Staring at
This Parisian sex flick
Where the characters don't meet
The characters don't speak
And the characters are like mirrors facing mirrors
Space always expanding
So put another coin in and turn the crank
Until the frames cease to move
And the movie turns into a photo
A photo the size of my fist
I hope she knows
A hiccup in paradise
I keep you jealously to myself
In photos the size of a kiss
A kiss in the shape of a bullet
On phone lines
And letterhead
I'm dying about
I'm dying about
On phone lines
And letterhead
I'm dying about
I'm dying about
I've watched you whore yourself for one more thing
Won't you sell yourself for one more?
There's always one more thing, why don't you sell yourself?
If I can't have you no one will
Pushing a lover
To love another
Are you turned on?
Are you turned on?
Pushing a lover
To love another
Are you turned on?
Are you turned on?
A hiccup in paradise
I keep you jealously to myself
In a photo the size of a kiss
A kiss in the shape of a bullet
On phone lines
And letterhead
I'm dying about
I'm dying about
On phone lines
And letterhead
I'm dying about
I'm dying about
A hiccup in paradise
I keep you jealously to myself
In a photo the size of a kiss
A kiss in the shape of a bullet
I keep you jealously to myself
I keep you jealously to myself
I keep you jealously to myself
I keep you jealously to myself
A kiss in the shape of a bullet
All my friends are embryonic
All my friends are dead and gone
All my friends are microscopic
All my friends wake up alone
Girl germs eat your little virus
Revolution come and die
Elitists who eat the virus
Sleep with me, wake up alive
Gutless... you're gutless
You're gutless... you're gutless
You can try to suck me dry
But there's nothing left to suck
Just you try to hold me down
Come on, try to shut me up
Step and fetch, grease my hips
I don't even have to pause
I don't really miss God
But I sure miss Santa Claus
Gutless... you're gutless
Gutless... you're gutless
I want to drink the honey blood
I want to drink the honey blood
Gutless... you're gutless
Gutless... you're undressed
You're gutless... you're gutless
You're gutless... you're undressed
Blood roses, blood roses
Back on the street now
Blood roses, blood roses 
Back on the street now
Can't forget the things you never said
On days like these starts me thinking
When chickens get a taste of your meat, girl
When chickens get a taste of your meat, yes
You gave him your blood and your warm little diamond
He likes killing you after you've died
You think I'm a queer
I think you're a queer
Said I think you're a queer
I think you're a queer
I shaved every place where you been boy
I said I shaved every place where you been, yes
God knows I know I've thrown away those graces
God knows I know I've thrown away those graces
God knows I know I've thrown away those graces
The Belle of New Orleans
Tried to show me once how to tango
Wrapped around your feet
Wrapped around like good little roses
Blood Roses, blood roses
Back on the street now
Blood roses, blood roses 
Back on the street now, now, now, now
You've cut out the flute
From the throat of the loon
At least when you cry now
He can't even hear you
When chickens get a taste of your meat girl
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
When he sucks you deep yes
Sometimes you're nothing but meat
And ah, the awkward way
That you recoil when I get close
And ah, the awful grin
That greets me
When I know I'm wrong
So down on hands and knees
Choking, gasping, dripping spit
I just can't make good
On any of these promises
Then he asked me
What does that mean
What's another word for desperate
Repetition makes an impression
What's another word for desperate
I won't be around here
For too very long
So tip the bottle back
Bubble foam
And watch it break
We can all be sure
Something awful's comin' this way
So take this medicine
In measured doses
Take your time
'Cause they'll tear into you
They will, they will
They will, they will
Then he asked me
What does that mean
What's another word for desperate
Repetition makes an impression
What's another word for desperate
I won't be around here
For too very long
I won't be around here
For too very long
And they'll tear into you
They will, they will
They will, they will
Take it apart
Let it all go
Holding it back
It's all just so
Why did I care
How did it go
Wait for a while
And I guess that
I won't be around here
For too very long
I won't be around here
For too very long
Everyone makes one mistake
One more time for old times sake
One more time before the feeling fades
One that's born of memories
One more bruise you gave to me
One more test just how much can I take?
Because you're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like shit
Something never meant to be
Everything you meant to me
Wake me when this punishment is done
Those who try and get away
From the one who gets away
Someone's always someone else's one
Because you're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like shit
You're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like shit
Until the end of time
In another life
Until the day I die
Save it up for one more try
Save it for the last goodbye
We go on and get off and get on and get off
You're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like shit
You're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like shit
You're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like
Oh shit
So the wind that blows across your room
Carried cheap perfume onto your dresser
It rained for jewelry and for credit cards
Two tickets to a film I don't remember
One day you'll kiss your rabbits nose, pick up the phone
To find I've been turned over
And you'll grab that piece of gold
Only to find that the smell has taken over
Now all the things you had, they aren't the same...
As what you hold
I'm standing in a room,
Its filled with older folks pleading "baby listen"
And I scream as loud as anyone,
But when asked to make a point I tend to whisper
Now highways turn to tidal waves
Theyre asking me to export all of your insecurities
But that wind that blows across your room
It's gonna set the sails, and send me back to you
Sometimes, when sailors are sailing
They think twice, about where they're anchoring
And I think, I could make better time of my time on land
Ill drink less
Cause lord knows I could use a warm kiss
Instead of a cold goodbye
I'm writing the folks back home to tell them
"Hey I'm doing all right"
It's a shame what your father did to your brothers head
He smashed it with a telephone
And your mother got scared and locked the door
You were only four, but lord you remember it
So now you're scared of love
I'm here to tell you loves not some fucking blood on the receiver
Love is speaking in code
It's an inside joke
Love is coming home
Sometimes, when sailors are sailing
They think twice, about where they're anchoring
And I think, I could make better time of my time on land
Ill drink less
Cause lord knows I could use a warm kiss
Instead of a cold goodbye
I'm writing the folks back home to tell them
"Hey I'm doing all right"
Yeah I'm doing just fine
And if she seems as lonely as me...
Let her sink.
Let her sink.
Let her
Let me take this awkward saw
Run it against your thighs
Cut some flesh away
I'll carry this piece of you with me 
It's all I can say tonight
Is I hate you
But it would be all right
If we could see each other sometime
Oh, If I could somehow make you mine
And if not, I'll take my spoons
And dig out your blue eyes
Swallow them down to my colon
They're gonna burn like hell tonight
'Cause you're beautiful
Just not on the inside, Yeah
Light comes from within
Your beaming eyes don't seem so bright
Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
Boardwalks and breaking waves
Made our Saturdays
I'd buy you lemonade right now
If you were here
Then I'd throw it in your face
And I'd listen to you cry
Remember how I'll miss
Our nights under the ocean skies
Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
You and I are like when fire and the ocean floor collide
You and I are like when fire and the ocean floor collide
You and I are like when fire and the ocean floor collide
You and I are like when fire and the ocean floor collide

In came the girl with the saddened eyes
And asked him over again and again
"Was I too weak ? Was I a child?
And can't we leave here and start again ?"
And I love you
Said "I don't mind if you take me down"
And "I don't mind if you break it all"
But "how much more can you take from me"
"How much more can you take from me"
"I'd like to take you inside my head"
"I'd like to take you inside of me"
"You came from heaven is all he said"
"You came from heaven and came here to me
And I love you
He drove it fast to make the night
And looked at his angel where she lay
Resting her head and closed her eyes
And outside the heat and the summer fades
Deep in the sky a storm he'd seen
Deep in the sky a storm he'd seen
"There ain't nothing no girl so sweet"
"Took her from heaven and gave her to me"
"Took her from heaven and gave her to me"
"Took her from heaven and gave her to me"
"Took her from heaven and gave her to me"
"Took her from heaven and gave her to me"
Nailed inside my head
Fuck you
I don't need your shit
All the lies deceit and arrogance
Talk your shit like my life is some kinda game
Like you fucking know me
Just go
Far away and be small
Run far away and be small
Go lie in a hole and be small
Thorns So you want inside of me
Splinters So you want a piece of this
Pushing So you want to tear me down
Under my skin For your own selfish wants and needs
So you want inside of me
They want in

Sharpened tongue
So you want to tear me down
To penetrate me
If you really think you got what it takes to be me
Then walk a mile in the skin
Of my head case mental being

Of this life that belongs to me
Well make a cut on the line
And take a deeper look inside of the freak

Trying to step in my circle I'm leaving you purple and black
On your back drop your ass like a heart attack
Ripping through your life like a fucking hurricane
Fist full of Novocain
For the pain
You're nothing in my life in my head
You're nothing in my life in my head
Nailed inside my head
You're under my fucking skin
I have cleansed my life now of the people who pry
And threaten place always in my face
I think it's time for them to
Go away always in my fucking space
Always in my scene
Always in my sight
Always in my way
You're dead to me punk ass fuck
If you really think you got what it takes to be me
Then walk a mile in the skin
Of my head case mental being
So you want a piece
Of this life that belongs to me
Well make a cut on the line
And take a deeper look inside of the freak
If you really think you got what it takes to be me
Then walk a mile in the skin
Of my head case mental being
So you want a piece
Of this life that belongs to me
Well make a cut on the line
And take a deeper look inside of the freak.
A wicked decision
We can agree
A wicked decision
Nothing's wrong with you and me
A week in the forest
A week in the fog
You'll be sad to hear that
I I I I I was robbed
And we're gonna own it
A fist to the voice
And we've found the music
Why did you try at the choice?
And decapitation
For failing to see
Nothing in this whole wide world saves us from this situation
(Nothing can save us)
Don't stop talkin' to me please
Baby cut me all to pieces
If you really want hell, hell
Ripped apart by the crows not the vultures
No one in this fair new world can talk us through this situation
Speak in the garden
You burn down the trees
I'll leave out the teasin'
While you are down on one knee
Never is heavy
And heavy is fine
But only in the street man
You ate your words wrong this time
It's wicked where you tread
Shot an arrow in your head
Since the apple wasn't there, yeah.
Ripped apart by the crows and the vultures
Ignore me in the parking lot
I'm petrified by conversation.
It's wicked where you tread
They shot an arrow at your head
Since the apple wasn't there, yeah.
We're ripped apart by the crow and the vultures
Ignore me in the parking lot
I'm petrified by conversation.
Joy was her name
A life un-wed
Thirty years old,
Never danced a step
She would have left these red hills
Far behind if not for her condition
Would have left these red hills
Long ago if not for my condition
Pitiful joy
She looked away
Into a hollow sky
Came face to face
With her own innocence surrounding her
Until it never was a question
Innocence so suffocating
Now she cannot move, no question
No hope for joy
No hope or faith
She wanted to go blind
Wanted hope to stay
"I've been believing in nothing since I was born
It never was a question"
No!
Look both ways when you leave the building
The wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
While the children of makeshift hills
Let the code of silence repeat 16 times
When we get delayed can we cast a line towards anyone dismayed
Can we go it alone say say say
Caught me listening to water dripping
From those old lips to a town where its dry
When you leave don't say
That anyone here will be thinking in modern ways
Can we go it alone say say say
Look both ways when you leave the building
The wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
Here underwater we're down. Here underwater way down.
Anger steaming up your glasses, you've been holding parties all your life.
Of course it's long gone down, you're still hanging around.
It's not over till it starts again.
Ha ha ha!
Hear me laughing! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha! It died out long ago.
Did you hear me laughing in your head, when I saw you stuck in a rut again?
Oh that drink went down smoothly, just like the one before the last you had.
Questions I have answered, you are still asking yourself again.
Passed-out in the gutter, worn-out in your head,
Your voices aren't clear enough after all.
Ha ha ha!
Hear me laughing! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha! It died out long ago.
Anger steaming up your glasses, you've been holding parties all your life.
Of course it's long gone down, you're still hanging around.
It's not over till you start again.
Ha ha ha!
Hear me laughing! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha! You died out long ago.
Talk to me
Can you listen to me now?
Do you understand?
Can you identify?
But it's as if you seem to
Make a small effort
But you bend, you're bending my mind
And you try and you try
I can see you try to suffocate
And smother me
Covered so I can't breathe
(We) When we collapse
(Fall) Our weakened hands
(Down) Fall together at once abandoned
(We) They'll force you down
(Fall) And strap you in
(Down) Now we agree and understand
Speak slowly
You gotta get it all out now
What are you saying?
Just remember we will always be here
Just in case you have been waiting
Waiting to show us something
Or give us some sign
As if you could not suffocate
Or smothering
Covered so you can't breathe
(We) When we collapse
(Fall) Our weakened hands
(Down) Fall together at once abandoned
(We) They'll force you down
(Fall) And strap you in
(Down) Now we agree and understand
Gently lure your submission
All the while suspicion grows
So be sick of listening
To senile old and staggering naive youth
Pick us up when we
(We) When we collapse
(Fall) Our weakened hands
(Down) Fall together at once abandoned
(We) They'll force you down
(Fall) And strap you in
(Down) Now we agree and understand
(We) When we collapse
(Fall) Our weakened hands
(Down) Fall together at once abandoned
(We) They'll force you down
(Fall) And strap you in
(Down) Now we agree and understand
Now we agree and understand
If Heaven is a place where the angels go
Well then, I got a story to tell
If Heaven is a place where the angels go
Then I guess you're going straight to Hell
Don't wanna leave you now or never
'Cause we're perfect together and never wanna be apart
Dare to take on the simple life
There was trouble for us when I came home early
Never would expect to see this
It's fair to say, could not believe my eyes
You cracked a smile but had nothing to say
So I made a list of how you're gonna pay
I locked you out, left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run, I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can, 'cause
I took your car with your baby in the backseat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Maybe now you know how much it hurts
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk
Now I feel better but it's hard to forget
I never think of looking back
'Cause time has no meaning when you're free
Oh, this is what you get, karma bitch
Now I see who you really are
'Cause happiness is the best revenge
Caught red-handed with a grin on your face
Didn't think you'd be so easy to replace
I locked you out, left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run, I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can, 'cause
I took your car with your baby in the backseat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Maybe now you know how much it hurts
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk
Again and again and again and again
If Heaven is a place where the angels go
Well then, I got a story to tell
If Heaven is a place where the angels go
Then I know I'm going straight to Hell
I locked you out, left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run, I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can, 'cause
I took your car with your baby in the backseat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Maybe now you know how much it hurts
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk
Overwhelmed with a deep repulsion for sights seen so commonly
Now I have come to be the walking enmity
Assimilate into a culture of post morality
From what I've seen, I hate humanity
Rot with repulsion
I'll write the world a brand new song
Look upon your bleak creation but is it truly me
That's come to be the human blasphemy?
I'll set the world on fire and in the burning light
I I'll write my first love song and I will feel warm
Hide your eyes
In heaven in the lies
Believe relieve
I'll end the world tonight
Overwhelmed with a deep repulsion for sights seen so commonly
Now I have come to be a walking enmity
For humanity, the human blasphemy
I'll end the world tonight
Throw my guitar down on the floor
No one cares what I've got to say anymore
I didn't come here to be damned with faint praise
I'll write my masterpiece some other day
Fuck everything, fuck me
I'm repeating myself again
Innovation, I leave to smarter men
Pretty melodies don't fall out of the air for me
I've got to steal them from somewhere
But it doesn't matter what you do or how hard you try
Now there's nothing left for me to do except die
When they cut you up
They'll tell you that it's not going to hurt
But they are not going to stop until they see you go to sleep in the dirt
There'll be no more cigarettes
No more having sex
No more drinking until you fall on the floor
No more indie rock
Just a ticking clock
You have no time for that anymore
You better watch where you run your mouth
Because you know what they'll say to you
They'll say
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, over, over, 
Over, over, over, over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
You think you can come and go as you please
You can't quit, you're fired
(Your life is over, your life is over)
(Your life is over, your life is over)
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over, your life is over
Your life is over
Finally I felt the calming breeze
Stepping out to watch the final scene
After all, it's you, my pride and me
I can't speak whatever I can speak
You see
Now I found the way to meet the means
Fake a face to make the kingdom clean
After all, it's me and the king and the beast
Whatever, whatever, I can't speak
A thing
How can I explain my wounded feet?
We cut them off in second market scenes
You cut me off before I start to sing
But I can cry as long as money's seen
You see me
See me, me, me
Sound, I'm a dead neck
What a habit
So I'll dig it up and bury it
In ground, what a broke head
I think I'm dying
I need another one to incubate
The sound, what a broke head
What a habit
I need another and another one
The ground, what a dead head
I think I'm dying
I think I'm dying for another one
The sound, what a broke neck
What a lion
I need another and another one
The sound, what a cheap trick
What a habit
What a habit when I needed you
The sound, what a dead neck
What a lion
I need another and another one
The sound, what a cheap trick
What a habit
I think I'm dying for
The sound, what a dead neck
What a habit
I think I'll dig it up and bury it
In ground, what a broke head
I think I'm dying
I think I'm dying
(Intro: Dr. TC)
Tyler you obviously have some fucking problems
And this is the end of this session, let's anything else you've gotta say?
Mom is getting jealous I see my manager more
Than I see her before, I go on tour and it hurts
I miss the days when this was fun but now it turned into work
They getting legal, so now I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out
My friends are turning into opposites
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
And all the bitches who forget about me want to ride my dick
Harder than the white kids that copy shit
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
All alone, bawling till my mothafuckin' eyes bleed
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man
Fuck, I'm putting myself at a distance
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant
Niggas saying "Free Earl" without even knowin' him
See, they're missing the new album, I'm missing my only friend
When I say Odd, y'all say Future
Odd... uh-uh, that shit's corny as fuck
(Tyler, you have a cult following)
To these white kids?
Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
Nashes with the Nazis but it's normal what the cops see
Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see
Mommy was a living single queen with a lot tee
So while my wallet's piling with symbolic colored paper
I lace her, 'cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
20, why didn't she get that abortion?
Probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing
Into a Grammy winning schizophrenic fucking orphan
Oops I meant bastard, a skinny ass disaster
Mom works hard, still working on her masters
Son lies about, taking classes at community college
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard
Start a fuckin' cult, clash his talents in a brash way
Before he even had a mustache and cash
And all I got was a fuckin' shitty article in Thrasher
I'm not crazy, I'm a fucking table, I'm a fucking table!
I'm a grab the Nina and find a nice arena
'Cause I can't even choose between Ortega or Suprema
And I'm not even human, I'm a body shaped demon
With some semen in my sack and some problems in the back
And a life that's full of crap, and a finger filled with hate
And a gat that's filled with love, now let opposites attract
I can finally be one like a marriage in a church
But this marriage has a hearse and the parents of the one
That's getting married has a curse and it's made up inside of him
Too late to reimburse but, wait it gets worse
All the guests that's in the church, all decided to disperse
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse
So they tied the knot, now it's too late to reverse
This arrangement (Yes it is) and the nurse is amazed at the hurt
That he was painting but it was obvious in all the photos
He was paining, now a bunch of whispering immerse
And then the nurse blurts
(What the fuck is his problem, here, we have two doses to give him, here)
Why didn't anybody ask him first?
(I've been asking you this whole time)
Because nobody gave a fuck
(Someone gave a fuck Tyler
And, uh, the person that gave a fuck was me
See, you're not, going crazy, it's me, I'm your best friend Tyler
I know everything, I know everything about you
You've been helping yourself this whole time
Your friends, they're just figments of your imagination
Dr. TC, see Tyler, I'm your conscience
I'm Tron Cat, I'm Ace, I'm Wolf Haley, I'm...)
Me
Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Eminem:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped "who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Eminem:
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Eminem:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I forget when words were only words
She knows the party makes me nervous
In this stage we can't get hurt
Don't try to understand me
We're too cool to be alone
But, not too crazy to get busted
I found out one life just ain't enough
I need another soul to feed on
I'm the flame I can't get burnt
I'm wholly understated
I found silence in this place
An on and off again attraction
I need such amazing grace
Heaven sweep me away
Love don't change, don't come around here
Don't wear my heart on your sleeve
Like a high school letter
Don't strain, 'cause nothing ever comes from it
And the people we've become, well
They've never been the people who we are
I strap on one horse and prayed for luck
I dug another hole to bleed
I know exactly how this works
I need a new feel dirty
I don't need you crowding up my space
I just want to get inside you
You can't believe the heart you save
Giving something away
Love don't change, don't come around here
Don't wear my heart on your sleeve
Like a high school letter
Don't strain, 'cause nothing ever comes from it
And the people we've become, well
They've never been the people who we are
I dreamed that the world was crumbling down
We sat on my back porch and watched it
(Background) Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart, eh?
I dreamed that the buildings all fell down
We sat on my back porch and watched it
Yeah well I dreamed that the world was crumbling down
We sat on my back porch and watched
In my head I heard the sound
Like fifteen strangers dancing
But oh how I want you to know me
Oh how I want you to know me
Oh how I wish I was somebody else, baby
Oh how I wish you could own me
Love don't change, don't come around here
Don't wear my heart on your sleeve
Like a high school letter
Don't strain, 'cause nothing ever comes from it
And the people we've become, well
They've never been the people who we are
Love don't change, don't come around here
Don't wear my heart on your sleeve
Like a high school letter
Don't strain, 'cause nothing ever comes from it
And the people we've become, well
They've never been the people who we are
Who we are, who we are
So I shook hands with you freely
Made a promise not to clean the slate
And I didn't need you till melody
Drew a line between love and hate
And I know I can be self righteous
And we both like to stretch the truth
But there's never been a song or a melody
That reminds me less of youth
Hey there hey there
Debbie down debbie down
And I felt my head exploding
So I left it beside the road
In the tall grass where
All the deer despair
At the thought of being stuffed in my home
And first we were antisocial
Till we tried hibernating through
All the seasons where you dye your hair
In a failed attempt on blue
Said the fibber to the snake
There's an opportunist dude
Watch his mouth its open wide
And he trying not to eat you
Hey there hey there
Debbie down debbie down
Child, don't you know
I don't want to let you go
Child, don't you know
That I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna let you
Styles come and go
But I'm not going to let you go
Styles, they come and go
But I'm not gonna let you, I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you, I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you, I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you, I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let you, I'm not gonna let you
Kid Creole killed all of his own people
Instigate the beat genuflecting in the steeple
Video killed what we once stood for
Who we gonna look to now?
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't tell them anything
Don't ask me, don't ask me
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't tell them anything
Don't ask me, don't ask me
Kid Creole killed all of his own people
Instigate the beat genuflecting in the steeple
Video killed what we once stood for
Who we gonna look to now?
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't tell them anything
Don't ask me, don't ask me
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't tell them anything
Don't ask me, don't ask me
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't tell them anything
Tell them anything, tell them anything (Don't ask me, don't ask me)
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't tell them anything
Tell them anything, tell them anything (Don't ask me, don't ask me)
Press eject and give me the tape
If you know what's good for you
What's good for you
Press eject and give me the tape
If you know what's good for you
What's good for you
Press eject and give me the tape
If you know what's good for you
What's good for you
Ghetto blasting on the basement floor
Ghetto blasting on the basement floor
Ghetto blasting on the basement floor
Ghetto blasting on the basement floor
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't tell them anything
Don't ask me, don't ask me
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't tell them anything
Don't ask me, don't ask me
If you know what's good for you
Give me the tape
If you know what's good for you
Ghetto blasting on the basement floor
And we hide behind loss, anger, hate
They'll shoo love away
Shells of ourselves outside
Shelters body from cold reigns of reality
Come on, step out of your rind
Assemble strength, focus...
Release, and run to me
You can never look back to the visions from the past,
They fade and wilt in time
You gotta' just trust me to hold your hand through
Then I'll turn and walk away
Eclipse... (Bleed you! Cut you away!)
You all... (Bleed you! Strip you!)
Of your states of Ain Soph Aur
Eclipse... (Bleed you! Cut you away!)
You all... Spit-up on my plate!
Push everything away from me!
And we sever all ties
It creates disruption midst circle of friends
I become sacrifice
Spare your life and leave me to my misery
Get off The Cross and save yourself
Run away, you'll be okay!
(Run away!) Get away from me
(Don't look back!) If I can get my grip,
(Don't ask for me!) I'll pull you down,
(Pretend I died!) Into the hell I call my head,
You'll never get away! (Get off The Cross!)
Sit down in my ugly place, (And save yourself!)
And build walls from fragments of my past,
(Darker side!) Of all the people that I needed,
(You offer me!) And loved, that walked away
You gotta' just trust me to hold your hand through
Then I'll turn and walk away
I walk under clouds of gray
Sphere of storms in my head
I'm trapped again in endless rain
I divorce the thoughts of you in love with me
I divorce your innocence and my guilt
I divorce the lying sell-out confidence
I'm divorcing every motherfuckin' thing!
I divorce the love, bled meaningless!
I divorce the makeshift harmony!
I divorce the taunting acts of violence!
I divorce the pastime of jealousy!
I divorce control! I divorce the faith!
I divorce the virtue! I divorce the rain
I divorce the excuse! I divorce the greed!
I divorce the greed! I divorce iniquity,
In this motherfuckin' bullshit life!
Just want it all to go away!
Just wanna' run away today!
Take it, myself, my life!
Textbook fucking mental!
Off me, and pitch me in a hole!
Rip this motherfuckin' bullshit life!
End this fucking bullshit life!
I'll always be your shadow,
And veil your eyes from states of Ain Soph Aur
I can't be the hero anymore,
I spit-up on my plate and then I turn and walk away
I spit-up on my plate and I disrupt the family
I spit-up on my plate, as I sever the entity
And I feel your warm sun on my face
Separate... Separate... Separate! Separate!
Eclipse... (Bleed you! Cut you away!)
You all... (Bleed you! Strip you!)
Of your states of Ain Soph Aur
Eclipse... (Bleed you! Cut you away!)
You all... Spit-up on my plate!
Push everything away from me!
Eclipse... (Bleed you! Cut you away!)
You all... (Bleed you! Strip you!)
Of your states of Ain Soph Aur
I blame... (Bleed you! Cut you away!)
You... It's always been this way!
Push everything away from me!
Eclipse... (Bleed you! Cut you away!)
You all... (Bleed you! Strip you!)
Of your states of Ain Soph Aur
Eclipse... (Bleed you! Cut you away!)
You all... Spit-up on my plate!
Push everything away from me!
So you should pump this shit like they do in the future
Got a strain un-contained that could turn parade zombie
Walk with an army on me, stalked by the harm and armor posse
Prolly got me on a radar with a dot
These watching, plotting minions of the lower God scene
Shit hawks abound, in the town of bullet dodging
I'm a Rocky, run a hundred a mile before my coffee
Shitty little sick kid, the Gipper's hitting for dolo, now I'm rarefied
Signal lit verified bossy
Fuck your droid noise, Voyboy's Noid ploy
Oi oi, I'll rugby-kick the shit out your groin, boy
Oi vey, the slayers of your harmony porn life
Throat fuck your lucky day, the flight of a torn kite
Holy smokes, city blown to the bone the death server
Fit a hearse with a burner, whip to the church of a murder sermon
Just a Cassandra too drained to painfully word it further
Future of a gerbil up ass of masochist, that's my word up
Pump this shit
In your floating whip system
Pump this shit
In the bread line, the prison
Pump this shit
From the chip under your wrist skin
(You are so fucking paranoid)
I am Sam, I am known to go HAM, the full retard
Playing taps on a keytar, in the Benz or the Beamer
Either, etherlicious or rebel yelling anathema
Son of forgotten freedom, rebel ¡Arriba 'riba!
Metal and man have melted, settle in to the FEMA, dreamer
Your polluted house speaker, leader
Yes indeed a, dawn of the dirt and doom draws nearer
Here's a mirror mirror to peer, fear grows clearer
Steer a path away from the panic of our era
Pyramided ocular, unlided insignia
Weirder here's another burner born and big in ya
Sector, rectified and fly sound selector
I'm a fucking ill, trill, kill at will etc
BK to the basic DNA math measurer
Better leave the lion alone do not pet him
He'll fuck-start your burp hole, jet in burgundy pleather
Whoa
Where harmony and love reign
No longer do we live in a society bent on its own destruction
Children of every race, creed and religion frolic through fields
Of golden dandelions
Lil bitch
That's some Camu shit
Those who know, lust. Trust: the flow is disgust, touch
Producto back rap rush, you'll notice the lad crush
I'm potent, intact, a black-hearted and lunged-up
Tarded and touched, plus designer of funk rust
Oh, El is back on that shit, huh?
That Paincave Kid talk, at the end of the painbow, the permanent stain bop
Maligning my name will holy ark up your squad's face
Viewers of the divine rage learn to worship the hard way
You get it? I don't fade, just float where the poem slays
At home with a roach hazed, alone or with hoes great
I called but got a tone: better boat out the borough posthaste
Last night I dreamt you called from Costa Rica
Yeah, the place you've been for the last two weeks
You said, "I miss you, oh sweet boy, and will you come on down?"
I woke up to my cold sheets and the smell of New Jersey
When do I get to wake up to you?
Tonight I can't forget that I've got these open wounds
It's such a drag
I can't forget you've gone
Yeah, my ribs have parted ways
They said, "We're not going to protect this heart you have."
Whoa, hey, what can I do?
My lungs are breathing open air
And my spleen is dripping from my pants
Whoa, hey, what can I do?
You've left me here in the cold
And I miss you
You never told me it would be this hard
I think my body's saying so
When you aren't here, it's got to know
It's leaving me
But I hope that you're okay
Even though I'm dying
I hope that you're still trying to have a killer time
Go see the volcanoes
Go see the rain forests
I'll be fine by myself
Yeah, I'll be fine without these bones
Whoa, hey, what can I do?
My lungs are breathing open air
And my spleen is dripping from my pants
Whoa, hey, what can I do?
You've left me here in the cold
And I miss you
Whoa, hey, miss you
Whoa, hey, miss you

Liar
He walks the streets full of dead meat
Empty heads and cancelled eyes
Got a pain, I've got a hunger
Lord my soul ain't satisfied
Come on, come on, hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on, hit the accelerator, the accelerator
It ain't hard to be a sinner
Lord it's hard to be a saint
Had a taste, you've had a glimmer
Start to shiver, can't be what you ain't
Come on, come on, hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on, hit the accelerator, the accelerator, come on!
Here we come, we're coming fast
All the others are in the past
Voices screaming in my head
Into the future, into the future
Come on, come on, hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on, hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on, hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on, hit the accelerator, the accelerator, come on!
So the water's thickening 
His collar's pulled, begin to be aware 
(It's on) that he needs to focus 
Beyond that man, he brings a world of pain 
Cause 
The war is on, too weak to move 
Call it off, sorry refused 
So we bend the bracket
Shove it down anything to make it fit 
(It's on,) and being foolish won't cover up 
Exposing them as fakes
But
The war is on, too weak to move 
Call it off, sorry refused 
So boredom captured another fool 
Shredding him to bits
(It's on)
And the more we tense up, avoiding pain 
You'll never learn a thing
Cause
The war is on, too weak to move 
Call it off, sorry refused
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long I'll be here
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long
I've checked
I've checked to find
I've checked
I've checked to find
I am not for you one
There's no telling how long
Go figure that out
Figure that out
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I've checked
I've checked to find
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long I'll be here
I am not what you want
There's no eyes in your own head
I'll check
I'll check tonight
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long I'll be here
I am not what you want
There's no eyes in your head
In your head
At least I cannot see them
In your head
I'm not what you want
I'll get
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Tonight
I'm not what you want
There's no telling how long I'll be here
Be here
At least I cannot see them
There are beads that wrap
Around your knees that crackle into the dark
Like a walk in the park, like a hole in your head
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world
And I guess it's worth your time
Because there's some lives you live
And some you leave behind
It gets hard to explain
The gardenhead knows my name
Leave me alone,
For you know this isn't the first time
In fact this is twice in a row
That the angels have slipped through our landslide
And filled up our garden with snow
And I don't wish to taste of your insides
Or to call out your name through my phone
For the glory boys at your bedside will love you
As long as you're something to own
Follow me through a city of frost covered angels
I swear I have nothing to prove
I just want to dance in your tangles
To give me some reason to move
But to take on the world at all angles
Requires a strength I can't use
So I'll meet you up high in your anger
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you
The stars are getting in and out of automobiles
And we keep wondering when we're gonna feel something real
Keep waiting for a Santa that will never come
A real party not just people who're faking fun
But everything gets erased before it's even said
And all that glitters isn't gold when inside it's dead
All that glitter is not gold
All that glitter is not gold
All that glitter is not gold
All that glitter is not gold
I went to your concert and I didn't feel anything
I went to your concert and I didn't hear anything
I went to your concert and I didn't feel anything
I went to your concert and I didn't see anything
(Oh Baby) Why won't you talk to me?
(Oh Baby) You just want me empty!
(Oh Baby) You don't say anything!
(Oh Baby) Why won't you answer me?
All that glitter is not gold
All that glitter is not gold
All that glitter is not gold
All that glitter is not gold
I sat through your movie but I didn't see anything.
I went to your comedy club and didn't laugh at all.
I went to your movie and I didn't hear anything.
I went to your concert and there was nothing going on.
You don't say
You don't say
You don't say anything...
And he's mean talking beanstalking icey man
My feet are walking over him
My sneakers in his hand
And with a picket for a knife
And a rocket to depart in
My life had barely started since you jumped all my heart
And now we're lazy
Lazy ooh lazy
In a galaxy of stars with nothing in the middle
'Cept the planet that we own and its playing 2nd fiddle
And we're playing 2nd fiddle
And we're bogged down in a delta of glee
My mouth has sprung wide open
We got tickets they were free
And can you keep sleeping metaphysical girl
Since the stars predicted something new would reconnect our worlds
And now we're lazy
Can we grow out?
And he's mean talking beanstalking icey man
My feet are walking over him
My sneakers in his hand
And with a picket for a knife
And a rocket to depart in
My life had barely started since you jumped all on my heart
You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain 'til it hurts
You've taken all my money
And you want more
Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies who are fools of the first division
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
Kill-joy, bad guy
Big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good, are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide?
(I think you should)
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good?
Feel good
Talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot-air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown school-boy
Let me tan your hide
Dog with disease
You're the king of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Know-All
Was the fin on your back part of the deal?
Shark
Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
(You never did, right from the start)
Insane, should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Make yourself null and void
Make me feel good
I feel good
Think I'm going for a walk now. I feel a little unsteady.
Don't want nobody to follow me... 'cept maybe you.
I could make you happy you know if you weren't already.
I could do a lot of things... and I do.
To tell you the truth I prefer the worst of you.
Too bad you had to have a better half.
She's not really my type, but I think you two are forever
And I hate to say it, but you're perfect together
So fuck you
And your untouchable face
Fuck you
For existing in the first place
And who am I
That I should be vying for your touch
Said who am I
I bet you can't even tell me that much
Two-thirty in the morning and my gas tank will be empty soon
Neon sign on the horizon Rubbing elbows with the moon
It's A safe haven of sleepless Where the deep fryer's always on
Radio is counting down the top twenty country songs
And out on the porch the fly strip is waving like a flag in the wind
You know I don't look forward to seeing you again
You'll look like a photograph of yourself taken from far far away
And I won't know what to do. And I won't know what to say
Except fuck you
And your untouchable face
Fuck you
For existing in the first place
And who am I
That I should be vying for your touch
Said who am I
I bet you can't even tell me that much
I see you and I'm so perplexed. What was I thinking?
What will I think of next? Where can I hide?
In the back room there's a lamp that hangs over the pool table
And when the fan is on it sways, gently side to side
And there's a changing constellation of balls as we are playing
I see Orion and say nothing the only thing I can think of saying
Is fuck you
And your untouchable face
Fuck you
For existing in the first place
Who am I
That I should be vying for your touch
Said who am I
I bet you can't even tell me that much
Said who am I
I bet you can't even tell me that much
Said who am I
Somebody just tell me that much
Said who am I
Somebody just tell me that much
Said who am I
Somebody just tell me that much
Said who am I
Somebody, somebody just tell me that much...
This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
Said it was blue when the blood was red
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through your head
Blasted through your head, blasted through your head
I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen, you was mesmerized
Cellular phone soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold turn you to stone before you realize
They load the clip in omnicolor
Said they pack the 9, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And motherfuckers lost their minds
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?", yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Run it
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Check-a, check-a, check it out
They load the clip in omnicolor
Said, they pack the 9, they fire it at the prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And muthafuckers lost their minds
No escape from the mass mind rape
Play it again jack and then rewind the tape
And then play it again and again and again
Until your mind gets locked in
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
Buyin' all the products that they sellin' ya
They say jump and you say how high
You brain dead? You gotta fuckin' bullet in your head?
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?", yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Uh
Yeah
Shit
What?
Standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Bowin' down to the flag
You got a bullet in your head
Standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Bowin' down to the flag
You got a bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in the head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in the head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
You gotta bullet in your fuckin' head
Yeah
Yeah
Simple souls overload as I explode data banks
'Cause the earth and space gave birth to this paleface
Supreme -- linguistic -- mental machine
My brain cells swell - the intellects extreme
Fire fills my veins as I proclaim my resistance
To the mind-swapping parasites that feed off my existence
As I -- skin the burn to relearn the royal plan
Out beyond the edges in the depths of spirit land
Its authentic, apocalyptic destroyer
Damaging challengers -- resurrection, disorder
A monument of crisis - I strikes this - your dead
Line my nest with your soul -- cleansed in bloodshed
Battle ready!
Poets gonna take control
Battle ready
Souls violate parole
Battle ready
Violently invade your home
-- Breaking the bones
Of those who pose
Commanding the mic -- striking up a verb-fest
Mass destruction is my function - time to put it to the test
In combat --- attacking since way back
In the days I drew praise for the way that I slayed facts
Formulating flows in revolutionary science
It's the catastrophic prophet from the anarchist alliance
Freaking techniques -- this creature of speech
We feel the fury of devastation 'cause we tasted defeat
I'm alone on my throne in this universe of fear
Royalty divides my soul -- in this role I'm revered
As the pinnacle -- lyrical master -- queen of disaster
I ruin brain fluid -- the UNKNOWN IS WHAT I'M AFTER
Shaking up the world -- just like the 2nd coming of Christ
-- When I write -- thrice divine with this goddess sight
Words will flow -- wounds will grow
Ewe know -- bones will be exposed from the force that I unload
It's THE SOUL EATER! -- mic bleeder with the voice of chaos
I got the nectar of the gods flowing from my mental pod
Gather the flock -- alarm your block
Tell them the shepherds have come and got the keys to unlock
A holy war -- through your veins it courses
More lyrical artillery than the armed forces
Supernatural -- styles be volatile
It's the mind manipulator -- the WAR CHILD
COME!
Shadow soldiers!
We came to defy - living life as a lie
We embryonic satellites need our freedom to fly
TO WATCH YOU DIE! -- agonizing cries are heard in stereo
I'm visualizing battlefield scenarios
In the line of fire -- watching empires fall
Into attack position -- ELIMINATE ALL!
My species!
My species!
No surrender!
Got me a raygun
Got me an altitude
Can't help feelin' somethin's wrong with everyone of you
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head
Talk revolution
As if it matters now
I don't care anyway just give me a what I want
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Fill me with your little whispers
Store your little nightmares
Of a generation said to burn
Come on honey
Let's go for a ride
Down where the crickets learn to sing and play
Baby
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head
Trust me instead
Inside your head, yeah
Yeah
It's a motherfucka
Oh
Ooh
Whew
Well, you can tell ev'ryone I'm a down disgrace
Drag my name all over the place
I don't care anymore
You can tell ev'rybody 'bout the state I'm in
You won't catch me crying 'cause I just can't win
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care what you say
I don't play the same games you play
'Cause I've been talking to the people that you call your friends
And it seems to me there's a means to and end
They don't care anymore
And as for me I can sit here and bide my time
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind
I don't care anymore I don't care no more
I don't care what you say
We never played by the same rules anyway
I won't be there anymore
Get out of my way
Let me by
I got better things to do with my time
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
Well, I don't care now what you say
'Cause ev'ry day I'm feeling fine with myself
And I don't care now what you say
Hey I'll do all right by myself
'Cause I know
'Cause I remember all the times I tried so hard
And you laughed in my face 'cause you held all the cards
I don't care anymore.
And I really ain't bothered what you think of me
'Cause all I want of you is just a let me be
I don't care anymore
D'you hear?
I don't care no more
I don't care what you say
I never did believe you much anyway
I won't be there no more
So get out of my way
Let me by
I got better things to do with my time
I don't care anymore
D'you hear? I don't care anymore
I don't care no more
You listening? I don't care no more
No more!
Oh, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah
You know I don't care anymore
Don't care no more
No more, no more, no more
Don't care no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, n-no more

I think you are living in denial
Oh can't you see she's pretty wild?
And every night I pray that you don't knock her up
'Cause I still want to be the mother of your child
They say "l'amour est né à Paris"
So she's planned a little trip to France
While she's in anxious anticipation
I really hope you have a horrible vacation
And so you think of me when you arrive.
Hope the French fleas eat you both alive.
And your room smells
And the toilet doesn't flush
And locals treat you mean
And the service takes too long
'Cause I'm fragile and you broke my heart in two
But you just smile
Like it's all the same to you, to you
But when you learn your lesson
Come like a prodigal son
Read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
And when you learn your lesson
Come like a prodigal son
Read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
Where did you get the ability?
To make fakes promises to me
You are exactly like
A politician
Need everyone's approval just to see if you are doing right.
And I hope you both freeze under the Eiffel Tower
So you end up throwing in the towel
Hope you'll miss me
And someday you're gonna see
That I put my trust in you
But you turned you back to me.
'Cause I'm fragile and you broke my heart in two
But you just smile
Like it's all the same to you, to you
But when you learn your lesson
Come like a prodigal son
Read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
And when you learn your lesson
Come like a prodigal son
Read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
But when you learn your lesson
Come like a prodigal son
Read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
And when you learn your lesson
Come like a prodigal son
Read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
Mon amour, mon amour...
Passengers with destination
Passengers with destination
Passengers with destination to Hell
Please proceed to your gate, we are ready to board now.
I was still a child when you caught me and tied me to your bed
You gave me shoes and pretty clothes, and I gave you what I had between my legs
Just a rite of passage, you held me down and said
"I'm gonna be your right of passage, so boy you better spread, spread em"
You said..."run run run as fast as you can but you can't run run from the childcatchers hands"
I wrote your name in my shit across the town to warn the kids of your bloodshed
When I chased you with a burning cross, my mother she wanted you dead
She said "run run run as fast as you can but you can't run run from our law given hand"
You said
"Well I've got no time for victims and I don't think it was all that bad
And if you can't run to save yourself well then you deserve to be had
This is the age of constipation, this is the age of martyrdom
I think you even enjoyed it, I think I even saw you come"
We all become
What we most dislike
In this picket fence cartel
Tell, there's nothing left to tell
What have we become
Cycle all over again
Filled the shoes 'til I was ten
In front of the classroom
In front of my peers
That day will always be remembered
'Cause it was etched in tears
Daddy taught well
At the end of his belt
Daddy taught well
At the end of his belt
We all become
What we most dislike
We all become
What we most dislike
Tell, tell, there's nothing left to tell
What will I become
When it's my turn again
Will it hurt me more than it hurts them
Scotch tape the volume of my mouth
Withold the expression
That I wasn't allowed
Daddy taught well
At the end of his belt
Daddy, daddy taught well
At the end of his belt
We all become
What we most dislike
We all become
What we most dislike
We all become
What we most dislike
We all become
What we most dislike
Daddy taught well
At the end of his belt
I said:
Daddy taught well
Nothing left to tell
Daddy taught well
At the end of his belt
Daddy taught well
At the end of his belt
Tell, tell, there's nothing left to tell
We all become
What we most dislike
We all become
What we most dislike
We all become
What we most dislike
We all become
What we most dislike
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
I need more, I need more
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimmie
Don't ask what for, don't ask what for
Sitting here like a loaded gun
I'm waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do but
Shoot my mouth off
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
I need more, I need more
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Don't ask what for, don't ask what for
I know the world's got problems
I've got problems of my own
They ain't the kind that can be solved with an
Atom bomb
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
I need more, I need more
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Don't ask what for, don't ask what for
You know I gotta go out
Get something for my head
If I keep on doing this
I'm gonna end up dead
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
I need more, I need more
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Don't ask what for, don't ask what for
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
I need more, I need more
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Don't ask what for, don't ask what for
You keep calling my phone non-stop
Don't you know I won't pick it up
You never leave a message
Look how you've changed
You got nothing to say, gettin' in the way
Show up at my house
You're gettin' so obsessive
Like I have time for you
Wasn't it me you didn't want?
Wasn't it me who was hanging on?
Now I'm done but before I go I want you to know ...
This is how it feels
When you wait for a call that never comes
Lie awake at night 'cause you miss someone
This is how it feels
When the trust you had is broken,
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open
Oh Oh
You wanted me, not to tell me why
Why and how you had the heart to fuck up my whole life
That's just so you
And now I've moved on by myself
And maybe I won't forgive
I'll just forget you lived
And I hope it hurts
Wasn't it me you tried to blame?
Wasn't it me you threw away?
But before you go there's something you should know ...
This is how it feels
When you wait for a call that never comes
Lie awake at night 'cause you miss someone
This is how it feels (Oh oh)
When the trust you had is broken,
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open
You taught me how to hate you
And I was so in love
When I tried to save us it was not enough
So what the hell is different?
'Cause now that I am gone
You're crawling back to tell me
I'm the one
Oh Oh
This is how it feels
Oh Oh
This is how it feels
When you wait for a call that never comes
Lie awake at night 'cause you miss someone
This is how it feels (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
When the trust you had is broken,
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open
Do you only want me 'cause you can't have me?
Do you only want me 'cause I'm gone?
Do you only want me 'cause you can't have me?
Do you only want me 'cause I'm gone?
Do you only want me 'cause you can't have me?
Do you only want me 'cause I'm gone?
Do you only want me 'cause you can't have me?
Do you only want me 'cause I'm gone?
Oh Oh
Oh Oh
I can't release you
You're a madman, need help to
Madman
Madman 
You're tied to alcohol
It starts to take its toll
Madman, madman
Madman
Mind's filled with confusion
Your life's an illusion
Madman, madman, oh
Madman, madman
Madman
This is a song about Susan
This is a song about the girl next door
This is a song about the everyday occurrences that make me feel like letting go
Yes, I think we got a problem
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
This is a song about Susan
Yeah, this is a song about the way things are
This is a song about the scary things you see from the corner of your eye
Don't you wonder why we never talk about the future
Yeah, we never talk about the past anymore
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody even wants to know
I guess the honeymoon is over
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
(Nah Nah)
(Nah Nah)
Ooh, I remember we could talk about anything
I remember when we used to want to hang out
I remember we could talk about anything
I remember when we used to want to hang out
I remember we could talk about anything
I remember when we used to want to hang out
I remember when we used to want to hang out
I remember we could talk about anything
I remember, I remember, I remember
Yeah, we never talk about the future
Oh, we never talk about the past anymore
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody needs to know
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)
So much for the afterglow
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)
So much for the afterglow
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)
So much for the afterglow
(Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh)
Yes I guess we need the drama
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
Yeah, so much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
Forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us
Give us this day our daily bread
Daily bread, daily bread
In caelo et in terra fiat voluntas tua
Gloria Spiritui Sancto
What language do you speak
If you speak at all?
Are you some kind of freak
Who lives to raise the ones who fall?
Hey, would you tell me why
The cat fights the dog?
Do you go to the Mosque
Or the Synagogue?
And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
And if you wrote the script then why the troublemakers?
How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high
And are you happy?
Do you ever cry?
... Are you sometimes sad?...
You've made mistakes
Well that's OK 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours
Will you forgive mine?
Hey, do you feel our pain
And walk in our shoes?
Have you ever felt starved
Or is your belly always full?
How many people die
And hurt in your name?
Hey, does that make you proud
Or does it bring you shame?
And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
And if you wrote the script then why the troublemakers?
How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high
And are you happy?
Do you ever cry?
... Are you sometimes sad?...
You've made mistakes
Well that's OK 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours
Will you forgive mine?
Forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us
... Sameh Zoonoobee Allah ...
Give us this day our daily bread
... Ya Allah ...
Daily bread
... Ya Allah ...
Daily bread
... Ya Allah ...
Forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us
... Sameh Zoonoobee Allah ...
Give us this day our daily bread
... Mehila ...
Daily bread
... S'lach lanu ...
Daily bread
Thine is the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory
Amen!
How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high
And are you happy?
Do you ever cry?
... Are you sometimes sad? ...
You've made mistakes
Well that's OK 'cause we all have
And if I forgive yours
Will you forgive mine?
... Will you forgive mine? ...
How do you do?
How does it feel to be so high
And are you happy?
Do you ever cry?
... Are you sometimes sad? ...
You've made mistakes
And that's OK 'cause we all have
But if I forgive yours
Will you forgive mine...?
My frustration caused the callous 
Turned my senses into spite 
My perception with no conscience 
Made the fear seem almost right 
I was unaffected for so long 
Now I'm fucking ruined 
I was desperation for so long 
Now it's fucking gone 
Can I see it? Can I see it? Can I see it? Can I? 
I can't even recognize myself 
I turned into what destroyed it 
Drown the truth out 
Until it all makes sense again 
I was unaffected for so long 
Now I'm fucking ruined 
I was desperation for so long 
Now it's fucking gone 
Take my fucking conscience from me 
Try to save me from myself 
Turn my fucking thoughts against me 
Now my ways will be dissolved 
Fuck integrity! Fuck integrity! 
Fuck integrity! Fuck integrity! 
Fuck integrity! Fuck integrity! 
Fuck integrity! Fuck integrity! 
My frustration caused the callous

The height of callousness 
The height of callousness takes over

Mother, mother
How's the family?
I'm just calling to say hello
How's the weather?
How's my father?
Am I lonely? Heavens, no
Mother, mother
Are you listening?
Just a phone call to ease your mind
Life is perfect
Never better
Distance making the heart grow blind
When you sent me off to see the world
Were you scared that I might get hurt?
Would I try a little tobacco?
Would I keep on hiking up my skirt?
I'm hungry, I'm dirty
I'm losing my mind, everything's fine
I'm freezing, I'm starving
I'm bleeding to death, everything's fine
Yeah, I'm working
Making money
I'm just starting to build a name
I can feel it
'Round the corner
I could make it any day
Mother, mother
Can you hear me?
Sure, I'm sober, sure I'm sane
Life is perfect
Never better
Still your daughter, still the same
If I tell you what you want to hear
Will it help you to sleep well at night?
Are you sure that I'm your perfect dear?
Now, just cuddle up and sleep tight
I'm hungry, I'm dirty
I'm losing my mind, everything's fine
I'm freezing, I'm starving
I'm bleeding to death, everything's fine
I miss you, I love you
Our government has a firm policy not to capitulate to terrorist demands. That no-concessions policy remains in force, despite the wildly speculative and false stories about arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments, we did not, repeat, did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages, nor will we
The ballot or the bullet, some freedom or some bullshit
Will we ever do it big, or keep just settling for little shit
We brag on having bread, but none of us are bakers
We all talk having greens, but none of us own acres
If none of us on acres, and none of us grow wheat
Then who will feed our people when our people need to eat
So it seems our people starve from lack of understanding
'Cause all we seem to give them is some balling and some dancing
And some talking about our car and imaginary mansions
We should be indicted for bullshit we inciting
Hand the children death and pretend that its exciting
We are advertisements for agony and pain
We exploit the youth, we tell them to join a gang
We tell them dope stories, introduce them to the game
Just like Oliver North introduced us to cocaine
In the 80s when the bricks came on military planes
A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not
The end of the Reagan Era, I'm like 'leven, twelve, or
Old enough to understand the shit'll change forever
They declared the war on drugs like a war on terror
But it really did was let the police terrorize whoever
But mostly black boys, but they would call us "niggers"
And lay us on our belly, while they fingers on they triggers
They boots was on our head, they dogs was on our crotches
And they would beat us up if we had diamonds on our watches
And they would take our drugs and money, as they pick our pockets
I guess that that's the privilege of policing for some profit
But thanks to Reaganomics, prisons turned to profits
'Cause free labor is the cornerstone of US economics
'Cause slavery was abolished, unless you are in prison
You think I am bullshitting, then read the 13th Amendment
Involuntary servitude and slavery it prohibits
That's why they giving drug offenders time in double digits
Ronald Reagan was an actor, not at all a factor
Just an employee of the country's real masters
Just like the Bushes, Clinton and Obama
Just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters
If you don't believe the theory, then argue with this logic
Why did Reagan and Obama both go after Qaddafi
We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil
Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby
Same as in Iraq, and Afghanistan
And Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran
They only love the rich, and how they loathe the poor
If I say any more they might be at my door
(Shh..) Who the fuck is that staring in my window
Doing that surveillance on Mister Michael Render
I'm dropping off the grid before they pump the lead
I leave you with four words: I'm glad Reagan dead
Ronald Wilson Reagan
Ronald Wilson Reagan
Ronald (6) Wilson (6) Reagan (6)
Ronald (6) Wilson (6) Reagan (666)
Here it comes again
Like the first time again
I can't sleep
I watch the rain
But I'm happy again
How can this be
Why did this feeling
Creep on up on me?
I can't be sure
You never can
But the signs I know
Where does it come from?
Where does it go?
Why does it kill you
Painful and slow?
I'm out of the fire
I'm into your home
I wanna feel you, feel you, feel you
Feel you again
It makes you a cheat
It makes you a liar
Step out of the fire
It gives a spring in the step
Smile on the face
Sing like a bird
Ya running the race again
What makes you bad
Makes you feel much better
Than you ever can
You can't touch it, see it, breathe it
Feel it's all you can
It makes the world go round
It makes you homeward bound
It makes you want it more
Look around every corner
To see if there's more around
You wanna take it all, it's never quite enough
You know ya need it all!
You wanna feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it again
It kill you in the end
But not to have it
You haven't lived
It will break you
Make you
Take you
Hate you, again
From me to you
From you to me
Look out your window
And you will feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it more, more, more
Here it comes again
That feeling again
I can't sleep
Sit and watch the rain
Again... watch the rain
Again...
Comming home from the school today
Crying all along the way
Ain't no way for a boy to be
Begging, "Mama, shave me please."
You little punks think you own this town
But someday someone's gonna bring you down
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
You take back what you said now
Thats the last time I cry
You dont know what it is to be a friend, now
Till I walk beside you on the street and now
Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boy
Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Going back to the school tomorrow
Hang my heavy head in sorrow
Ain't no way for a boy to be
Ain't no way to set me free, now
Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boy
Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boy
Who you fucking now?
I use my slit wrist
To sign my name with blood
And when you can't compete with the Joneses
You gun 'em all down, even the father
You fucking whore
Shut up and swallow my pride for me, go
Move closer or drive further
So why don't you suck on the end
Of this dick that cums lead
But first I'm coming after you all!
It's ladies night at the bar
But she smokes a man's cigar
I guess she's dying
Oh well *pfft*
I don't give a fuck about your dignity
That's the bastard in me
I know a girl
Who sells herself around
And I'm sure
That one day
She'll sign autographs in your town
You fucking whore
Who you fucking now?
You fucking...
Shut up and swallow my pride and go
Move closer or drive further
So why don't you suck on the end
Of my dick that cums lead
But first I'm coming after you all!
Looking back into my diary
What makes me say those things?
What causes my laughter
At another's disaster
It's the bastard in me
You fucking whore!
I know a girl
Who sells herself around
And I'm sure
That one day
She'll sign autographs in your town
I know a girl
Who sells herself around
And I'm sure
That one day
She'll sign autographs in your town
Who you fucking now
You fucking in this shit
You mean shit to me, you mean shit
You eat shit, you mean shit, you fucking whore!
I strain myself, I guess, I guess
I fuck myself, I guess, I guess
I strain myself, I guess
I mean it, fucking whore!
You live in shit
And you will eat your own way
Everynight
I am too fly and shy
Too fly and I
Like no other guy
Too fly and shy
Just for you
I'm too fly and shy
And I'm like no other guy
I'm too fly and shy
Just for you
And I'll mark you all!
I know a girl
Who sells herself around
And I'm sure
That one day
She'll sign autographs in your town
I know a girl
Who sells herself around
And I'm sure
That one day
She'll sign autographs in your town
Who you fucking now?
You fucking eat shit, you filthy shit
Who you fucking now?
Who you fucking now?
Coward!
Spit!
I think I'll spit!
For all those girls who speak contradiction
The guy who crept through the shadows every day
To clutch his own conclusion
Watch all the blood
As it drips from your veins
You coward
Godspeed
May your death come quickly
I think I'll take this hate and
Spit!
Spit!
Spit!
Now as it's passed onto the next one
I feel a bloodrush come right over me
You know you will never be right in the eyes
Of the ones who know
You trusted the devil
And she will betray you
Low...
Why do I get shit all the time from you men?
You are swine
You think dick is the answer, but it's not
Why do I get shit all the time from you men?
You are swine
You think dick is the answer, but it's not
The king of the jungle
Was asleep in his car
When your chances fall in your lap like that
You've got to recognize them for what they really are
Nobody in this house
Wants to own up to the truth
I crawl in shotgun and reach into his mouth
And grab hold of one long, sharp tooth
And hold on
For dear life, I hold on
Well, of course he wakes up
His paw hits the horn
I am going to regret
The day that I was born
And then Mom rushes out to the driveway
My sister too
Everyone's screaming
I am dreaming of you
I hold on
For dear life, I hold on
And my arms get sore
And my palms start to sweat
And the tears roll down my face
Till my cheeks are hot and red and soaking wet
In come the cops
They blowtorch the doors
I start wailing
The lion roars
There's no good way to end this
Anyone can see
There's this great big you
And little old me
And we hold on
For dear life, we hold on
We hold on
Backstage, everybody wants a piece of JD
Kathleen's on the phone and I got to go get paid
See, promoter's making small talk,
He says we knocked his socks off
Cinna-mint, Internet, Cinnamon and Butter-buns!
Who's got the keys?
Oh! Look, man, we just gotta get some sleep!
But he said "Do you guys need a place to stay?"
No, oh no. No thanks, just point us to the highway.
She said, she likes it better when were angry,
"Sing that song again that makes me think you're gonna spank me!"
Head on my jacket like a pillow in the van,
When I close my eyes I'm in a cross-town cab.
Hey, who wants to party?
Those girls outside just asked me
Check out's late and they seem cool,
So
Ooh... okay... okay, okay
Hey, we want a Universal healthcare deal
And we want Kissinger on trial for real.
We got a right wing king making third world war
Assholes, oil-guys!
How many shows till were back in New York?
Killer's got us packed up, coffee in a travel mug
Thinks she got the mix all right, says she wants to drive tonight.
The power amp, we call the "pamp"
The S-2000, we call it the "samp"
The MPC's do not come on tour,
They used to, though, back when we were hardcore.
Hey these girls say that this town sucks! ooh...
They just wanna know if they can come with us
Hey, who wants to party?
Those girls outside just asked me
Check out's late and they seem cool,
So
Ooh... okay... okay, okay
I'm sick with this
I'm sick with this
Situations avoided or just missed?
My own sweet time
Says it's 10:24
Hardly recognize simple things anymore
I don't wanna be defeated
I don't wanna be defeated
I don't wanna be defeated
I don't wanna be defeated
This is the point
This is the manifest
Bed for the scraping
Dirty little secret
Reason for the gathering
Consequence
What else is there to do
But go
This is the point
This is the manifest
Bed for the scraping
Dirty little secret
Reason for the gathering
Consequence
What else is there to do
What else is there to do
But go outside
Look, look, look, look
Look, look, look, look around
(Look out, look out, look out)
Look around
(Look out, look out, look out)
Look around
How time will heal
Make me forget
You promised me
Time will heal
Make me forget
You promised me
Love will save us all, yeah
And time will heal
You promised me
You promised me
You promised me
How love will save
Make me forget
You promised me
Love will save
Make me forget
You promised me
Time will heal us all, yeah
And love will save
You promised me
I trusted you
I wanted your words
Believed in you
I needed your words
Time will heal
Make me forget
Yeah, and love
Love will save us all
You promised me another wish, another way
You promised me another dream, another day
You promised me another time
You promised me another life
You promised me
You promised me
You promised me
So I swallowed the shame
And I waited
I buried the blame
And I waited
Choked back years of memories
I pushed down the pain
And I waited
Trying to forget
Trying to forget
Trying to forget
Trying to forget
Trying to forget
You promised me another wish, another way
You promised me another dream, another day
You promised me another time
You promised me another lie
You promised me
You promised me
You promised me
You promised me
And I waited
And I waited
And I waited
And I waited
And I waited
And I waited
And I'm still waiting
"My precious wife
I am in shambles
I am crumbling, I am
Was it something I did
Bid the tide
To climb so high
That it ripped our shore up?
I can fix it, I swear
If you trust me
I am old and I am rusting
But I care, I care"
"My precious wife
We made a promise
Pledged our flesh to be one
How can you doubt a love
That stood so proud as we raised our children?
I believe in
It still
It has faltered, and it is faded
But I know
It's there, it's there.
And how'd it change?
The way you thought of me?
How strange to think we once were lovers
Now we've wrapped the past up in broken glass
And when you speak my name you shudder
Oh precious wife
Please believe this
I'll revive it, I will
We've built a family from this marriage
Why would you tear it apart?"
"Oh, speak now, precious
Your silence screams
You're giving in to failure
Hear me
The promise that you made
Was meant to live forever
Until our deathbed
You're not allowed to change your mind
Was there nothing in that promise?
Are you listening to me?"
"Oh, husband, I could not control it
Husband, I could not abstain
One cannot stop the wind from blowing
Nor refuse the falling rain
Love stirred up a storm inside me
Wrapped its arms around my waist
I failed you
Dear, I'm sorry
Oh, I'm sorry
There was nothing I could do
No, there was nothing I could
Sure as the rain will fall
Some love just fails without a reason"
There is nothing you can do
There is nothing you can do
There is nothing you can do
There is nothing you can do
I heard the sound of your bike,
As your wheels hit the gravel,
Then your engine in the driveway
Cutting off
And I pushed through the screen door
And I stood out on the porch
Thinking fight, fight, fight
At all costs,
But instead I let you in,
Just like I've always done
And I sat you down and offered you a beer
And across the kitchen table
I fired several rounds,
But you were still sitting there
When the smoke cleared.
And you came crawling back
To say that you wanna
Make good in the end
And oh, oh,
Let me count the ways
That I abhor you,
And you were never a good lay
And you were never a good friend
But, oh, oh, what else can I say...
I adore you
All I need is my leather,
One t-shirt and two socks,
I'll keep my hands warm
In your pockets
And you can use the engine block,
And we'll ride out to California
With my arms around your chest,
And I'll pretend that this is real
'Cause this is what I like best,
And you've been juggling two women
Like a stupid circus clown
Telling us both we are the one
And maybe you can keep me from ever being happy,
But you're not gonna stop me from having fun.
So let's go before I change my mind
I'll leave the luggage of all your lies behind
'Cause I am bigger than everything that came before
And you were never very kind,
And you let me way down every time
But oh, oh, oh what can I say...
I adore you
I heard the sound of your bike,
As your wheels hit the gravel,
Then your engine in the driveway
Cutting off
(British hooker hired by bert's bandmates sings "Happy Birthday" and "He's a Jolly Good Fellow")
Choke Me (secret song)
As of now I'm down straight up
And I can turn to the box for some peace
Or a box for a piece
Or a box for a smoke
But they're all gonna choke me
You're so crazy (x3)
Enough in a way that I'll probably say you destroyed me
It's like a fucking drug deal
I'm sitting here waiting
I'm calling you back
And you won't call me back
And it's fucked up, but at the same time it just made me want you even worse.
For awhile I was cleaner than now
Then I started to destroy myself
With things that I love now the things that I hate
Until it finally broke me
You're so crazy (x3)
Enough in a way that I'll probably say you destroyed me
Bert, fuck my ass
Now
Fuck my ass
Now
Choke me (x5)
As of now I'm down straight up
And I can turn to the box for some peace
Or a box for a piece
Or a box for a smoke
But they're all gonna choke me
You're so crazy (x3)
Enough in a way that I'll probably say you destroyed me
So I want to kill this waitress
She's worked here a year longer than I
If I did it fast you know that's an act of kindness
But I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I want to kill this waitress
I can't believe this violence in mind
And his her power all in her club sandwich?
But I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I want to kill this killing wish
They're too many stars and not enough sky
Boys all think she's living kindness
Ask a fellow waitress
Ask a fellow waitress
All of my hate cannot be found
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming
Oh, you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming
Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
Pushing all the mercy down, down, down
I wanna see you try and take a swing at me
Come on, gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground
Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it's funny?
What the fuck you think you're doing to me?
You take your turn lashing out at me
I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me
All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming
Oh, you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming
Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
I'm above you, smiling at you drown, drown, drown
I wanna kill and rape you the way you raped me
And I'll pull the trigger and you're down, down, down
Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it's funny?
What the fuck you think you're doing to me?
You take your turn lashing out at me
I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me
All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming
Oh, you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming
All my friends are gone, they died
They all screamed, and cried
I'm gonna take you down
Gonna take you down
Gonna take you down
Gonna take you down
All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not drowned by your thoughtless scheming
Oh, you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming
No, all my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming
No, you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming

Fight with tools

Strip Poker Motel
Got a small blue tail
Hot ice, cold cash
I never been no good at staying out of jail
Wheel spin, roulette
Who's giving, don't get
Ripped shirt, black eye
Tuxedo, bow tie
Dark sound, straight road
Get lost, get loaded
Enlisted men, off duty
Stolen clouds, dark beauty
Cold gun, wild rose
Night clerk, door closed
Lie down baby
Your love is a faucet
Called China, cell phone
Chun King, not home
You know I feel like a preacher waving a gun around
Shake it, shake it. shake it baby!
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Shake it, shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Shake it, shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Outside, it's damp
Put a towel on that lamp
You look hot in this light
I can love you all night
Shoes off, hair down
Got a pink night gown
Mike Tyson, KO'ed
On the wild, blue road
Small town, straight road
That rooster, done crowed
Flat tire, homemade cross
You know I feel like a preacher waving a gun around
Shake it, shake it, shake it baby!
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Shake it. shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
Lay down this latrine in nailbomb,
In the city of Molotov,
In the province of gun,
In a whole off the highway
In the land of two suns.
Sometimes I get pissed
When
My blow goes like a quickie in the snow
But I'm sure I'll go down inside.
I chew the thorn when midnight gets too long
The seed of a bastard.
Alone in the sun for sticking it in too long.
On the feet of a dragon.
Some nights the wind pipe's covered in dope.
I pray it be covered in a rope.
Me, me, me.
Grief, grief, grief.
Beat the heat.
Me, me, me.
Grief, grief, grief.
Beat the heat.
But I'm sure I'll go down inside.
I chew the thorn when midnight gets too long
The seed of a bastard.
I chew the thorn when midnight gets too long
On the feet of a dragon.
Some nights the wind pipe's covered in dope.
I pray it be covered in a rope.
In a rope, in a rope, in a rope!
Lay down this latrine in nailbomb,
In the city of Molotov,
In the province of gun,
In a whole off the highway
In the land of two suns.
Sometimes I get pissed
When
Grunt fuck.
Grin fuck.
Push her in the snow fuck!
The dope fiend splashes gash like a nailbomb.
Why have we waited so long 
Supressing the power inside
Tear away all that was wrong 
Something too massive to hide
It's time to rip the chain from your neck
Let go the pas as you purge
Free now from everything weighing you down
Open the floodgates and surge with
New found power
Cleansing yourself of the past
Learn from mistakes and move on 
Conquering new ground at last
Unite and become twice as strong
It's time to rip the chain from your neck
Let go the past as you purge 
Free now from everything weighing you down
Open the floodgates and surge with 
New found power 
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Hope was all that kept me sane 
Rise above and prove myself
I'll survive without your help
Shut you out, my strength comes from within
New found power
The dark crow man sits and stares
Into the oblivion, into cold, into nothingness
It's snowing in his mind
He's created himself in his own image
Lust held for him means naught
A knock on the door brings no smile to his cruel lips
The welcome in a woman's eyes holds nothing for him
Alone on his haunches the hair raises on the back of his neck
His dead eyes pierce the night
As his gaze falls down on the city
It fills him the method ascertained, conviction
He knows what to do and moves to commit the deed
When I lay myself to sleep
Pray that I don't go too deep
Lightnin' won, Lightnin' won
Because it's cold down, gold down there, crow
Flat lands low lands on the track
Shows the water, pan the track
Lightnin' won lightnin' won
Close up hands to silhouette, crow
(Oh, oh)
Lightnin' won, Lightnin' won 
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
Hound bark on the track
Hound crow hold onto your hat
Lightnin' won, Lightnin' won
Low lands, timberlands, bad lands, bird lands.
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
White glow of a TV set
Lights dancing on a screen
Voice-overs rise like minarets
Then fall diatonically
Should I answer a friend's distress call
Or should I go to sleep?
Would I, like the voices, rise and fall
What's it to me?
All those hours of wasted time have never crossed my mind
Here I am comfortable
In arm's reach of the black remote
Here I am comfortable
Surrounded by strings and bows
Let everyone else go
Nights on Kirkwood so serene
Far from the sirens and the screams
I could write or I could read, go next door and smoke some weed
As long as I don't have to think
About who is running this mess
What shit they write in the Stone or NME
Go out and make a last call or sit here and do nothing at all
What's it to me?
All those hours of wasted time have never crossed my mind
Here I am comfortable
In arm's reach of the black remote
Here I am comfortable
And all those clowns, what can they know?
Let everyone else go
All those hours of wasted time have never crossed my mind
Here I am comfortable
In arm's reach of the black remote
Here I am comfortable
Surrounded by strings and bows
Let everyone else go
Let everyone else go
Lying naked
Alone on the bathroom floor
Evacuating pain, fear...
No more
And eye can't get his scent off me
She wants to be a messiah
Without the crucifixion
She wants to fuck delilah
Without samson's intervention
She wants to be a deity and rule us everyday
And punish the whores of your wishgod and the martyrs that they slay
She wants to see galaxies
All the planets and the stars
She wants to be a fallen angel without their swollen scars
She's unclean
Unclean
Fillthee
And eye can't get his scent off me
Unclean
Unclean
Fillthee
And eye can't get his scent off me
She wants to free the kingdumb
Be worshipped by the earth
She wants to be the prophet
For ten times whut she's worth
She wants to break free from eve
And leave them all behind
To be born again in the thrill of sin
And revive her dying mind
She wants to stand
Rape the king
Slaughter the daughter and kill everything
Burn the world and let her soul be free and ignite
The nebulas of eternity
Unclean
Unclean
Fillthee
And eye can't get his scent off me
Unclean
Unclean
Fillthee
And eye can't get his scent off me
Don't touch me there
Oh, eye know you're scared
Kill the need in me
And eye'll remain
Unclean
Unclean
Fillthee
And eye can't get his scent off me
Unclean
Unclean
Fillthee
And eye can't get his scent off me
Why should eye be afraid?
It's not the first time eye've tasted pain
Why should I be afraid?
It's not the first time I've tasted pain
Run!run!
And I can't get his scent off me
P-i-g, oh, p-i-g
Why don't you sing me that
Pretty lullaby
Then when you're singing great
Pack it all up
I wanna new face right now
And I want it bad
I wanna new body that's strong
I'm a butchered cow
I wanna try and fly
I wanna try and die
I wanna be a pig
I wanna fuck a car
I wanna new face right now
And I want it bad
I wanna new body that's strong
I'm a butchered cow
I wanna be a stupid and shallow motherfucker now
I wanna be a tough skinned bitch but I don't know how
I wanna be a shiny new baby with a spongy brain
I wanna be a horse full of fire that will never train
You think you know me
Got me figured out
Your casting shadows
Casting doubt
You think you know me
You think I care
You should spend some time sometime with the person in the mirror
I'm a fist, I'm afraid, I'm a link in the chain
I'm the worst of the best, but I'm in this race
You don't know me
I'm a knife, I'm a rope, I'm a bitter pill
I'm a tooth on the cog that you built to spill
You don't know me
I'm not defined by what you think I am
I won't fall into your predetermined plan
All like diamonds without the shine
If you never take the time you never know what you won't find
I'm a crow, I'm the most with the least to gain
I'm a fading Mona Lisa in a plywood frame
You don't know me
I'm a ring on a tree in a life that fell
What I did I done good and what I done I did well
You don't know me
Hate is a river flowing with money and greed
Drawing borders
Lines on a map we don't need
I'm a wall, I'm a fence, I'm a dotted line
I'm the land you kill for in the name of your kind
You don't know me
I'm a storm, I'm a sign, I'm a bleeding heart
I'm the time that got away
It's already gone
You don't know me
A band trip dance, what could be the harm
But a six week vacation from the use of my right arm? 
It was just the two hits and I remember nothing more
Only Alex hitting the switch and me hitting the floor
We're taking this lying down
The one thing I can stand up for is resting supine on the ground
Mr. McDermott, won't you help me to my feet? 
Because the drumline's going wild in the San Francisco streets
The long walk home, an hour and a half
But quickly turns to three or four with stops at every underpass
But by June 22nd, I have done the math
And it's a hundred and five liters I'll consume of Dr. Path
Some girls will tell their secrets to anyone
The word "love" gets thrown around a lot near graduation
So please don't whisper sweet nothings in my ear 
When the sound of shredding vocal chords is what I want to hear
Because we're going to San Francisco 
And I forget to wear some flowers in my hair
She's got a secret surname that nobody knows
With the most gorgeous hyphen
You wouldn't believe the way it glows
And I'm the only one who gets to see it way up close
So the rest of you can stick it up your nose
Last night, I had the strangest dream that I have ever known 
My mother, in a fit of rage, chases me from our home
My mother, the murderer holds me down in the road
She's got the nail clippers at my throat
Now even though things lately may have been real horrorshow
I'm wishing I was back in utero
I'd like to go back to the way that things were before
But apparently, I'm looking at physical therapy
It won't be exactly how it used to be
It ain't hard to see that it's not that way
Not that way anymore
Jesus Christ is suffering upon his cross tonight
I just sit outside waiting for frost to bite
"It's always this way," 
She says on her way out the door
Just wait and see
The rest is yet to reveal itself to me
I had a good home but I left
I had a good home but I left, right, left
That big fucking bomb made me deaf, deaf
A Humvee mechanic put his Kevlar on wrong
I guarantee you'll meet up with a suicide bomb
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Big fucking ditches in the middle of the road
You pay a hundred dollars just for fillin' in the hole
Listen to the general every goddamn word
How many ways can you polish up a turd
And left, right
Left, left, right
Left, right
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
How is it that the only ones responsible for making this mess
Got their sorry asses stapled to a goddamn desk
And Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Left, right, left
What did you do before the war?
I was a chef, I was a chef
What was your name?
It was Geoff, Geoff
I lost my buddy and I wept, wept
I come down from the meth
So I slept, slept
I had a good home but I left, left
Pantsed at the wind for a joke
I pranced right in with the dope
Glanced at her shin she said, "Nope."
Left, right, left
Nimrod Bodfish have you any wool
Get me another body bag, the body bag's full
And my face was scorched, scorched
I miss my home, I miss my porch, porch
Left, right, left
Can I go home in March? March
My stance was a chin full of soap
That rancid dinner with the Pope
And left, right, left
Kelly Presutto got his thumbs blown off
Sergio's developing a real bad cough
Sergio's developing a real bad cough
And Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Boom went his head away
And boom went Valerie
What the hell was it that the President said?
Give 'em all a beautiful parade instead
And left, right, left
When I was over here I never got to vote
I left my arm in my coat
My mom, she died and never wrote
We sat by the fire and ate a goat
Just before he died he had a toke
Now I'm home and I'm blind
And I'm broke
What is next?
Dinner's getting cold --
You haven't touched a thing
So what's it gonna be?
I can hold out much longer than you
When it's steady I'm just acting out my roles
When you're ready I'll be walking out that door
And don't call me Pretty Baby anymore,
Oh, foolish worker bee --
I'm your fucking queen.
I threw out the phone to try to get through to you
The lines are down, drowned by the hum of the radiator
This house is the hole that you could never fill
With rose-blossomed bouquets, vanities and loveseats
Sad little boy, I know you get confused
But everyone goes through these trials of self-truth and self-abuse
When you're selfless you're so hard not to adore
When you're selfish, I just love you even more
I want to help you, but you've got to say the words:
"I want to be cured."
Drowned...
Deep in this hole we've dug for ourselves
Throw me in -- headfirst, submerged in this great depression
Impoverished, and Impotent...
...And Don't Call Me Pretty Baby
I threw out the phone to try to get through to you
The lines are down, drowned by the hum of the radiator
This house is the hole that you could never fill
With shattered dinner plates
That's how we'll communicate
Hey, Pretty Baby, are you ready for bed?
Many ways
Many days
Many faces down the line
If people whisper
It makes her nervous
Gets you from the airport
Addressing most littlest
In several days
I just might prove worth it
So after all
After all
They let you decide
After all
After all
They let you decide
Any ways
Anyway
Walk the many walks of life
If people whisper
It makes her nervous
Gets you from the airport
Addressing most littlest
Several days
Too late to unearth it
So after all
After all
They let you decide
After all
After all
They let you decide
We are the most impassioned ugly people
Ugly people, ugly people, say
We are the most impassioned ugly people
Ugly people, ugly people, say
After all
After all
They let you decide
After all
After all
They let you decide (Yeah!)
After all
After all
They let you decide, yeah
After all
After all
They let you decide
I stood before the glittery borders of new radius in search of the fabled city of mud and crushed velvet,
What I found was a gutter where the love of entertainment meets the lust for blood and demerits,
Cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky,
Collar pop jolly roger, die motherfucker die,
Apache on the ship shape and Bristol fashion
Snuck a jimmy through the red tape and tip toe past him.
Worm teeth grinding feverishly below,
As little organic hacksaws eager to feed and grow,
So when it's blackhawk over the glass walk,
They surface up through the cash crops with clippers for your belly-up mascots,
And never dine alone, meanwhile back at sea level it was home by home zone for zone,
Bloom county's homeless riot for home ownership,
I hope you put gas in the motor-home and know the roads,
I studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb as opposed to the loaded nose who pray armageddon is numb and that's unevenly rendered to those who grew up thinking faith was the surrender of reason but not a reason to surrender.
Catch the liberty fires catalog,
40 torched orchids and citronella for algernon,
Don and vagabond alike repent,
This shit should have gone "beta burns babylon, the end".
And when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors to murder the medium that shot 'em 30 years before they said...
(Kill television) (kill television) (kill television) (difficult, isn't it?)
And when the cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky, no love lost baby the future is so bright...
(Kill television) (kill television) (kill television) (difficult, isn't it?)
Nothing says charm like an armored car taking the clone-farm 'tards to the arms bazaar,
We were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts and march through the gauntlet of car alarms,
No harps, no delusions of losing we're sitting prettier than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears,
We can run with scissors through the city fair or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs,
Double park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy clarks,
These are the vices of the p-noid bastards who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest,
Crews lose lunches by the hundreds,
Lose electricity, lose gas, phone, plumbing, humming
Keep your mouth closed, keep your cows cloned, go,
I am the pulse of this fucking town, holmes, no.
My what a convenient embargo,
At least I'll always know which side of the gun I'm supposed to buy the farm from,
The too-far-gone kicks still in the box, fix still in the pill in his sock, chilling, gill in the slop,
And a million watch gideon scribes, but once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide and that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish while profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes.
(Hold up let me get one more in there)
The mobile infantry is so postal,
Coast into the quotient provoking the local pistol pete, choking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens, smokey little pile of bloody pulp and co-dependencies.
They'll be no surrender bender in effect,
Sole defenders of the longest night new york had never slept,
And there were jumping jacks and whistlers over christmas,
Like rockets from the crypt spilling the festive morning beverage of your preference,
I step in hog heaven, stoney with no weapons, pissing on teleprompters, selling megaphones to hecklers,
Who broadcast 80 million versions of the sermon for that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains,
Pale arcadian moon, high definition flat plasma, Imax city-wide transfer,
Artificial einstein-rosen out the tenement,
Ease into the xanadu, let it hammer the tension out,
I'm talking cool, calm, dominant phenomenal, monitor face to the wall opposite.
U.f.o.'s and locusts sing the same old song while the weathermen get retarded as the day is long
My love is bigger than your love
We take more drugs than a touring funk band
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My band is better than your band
We've got more songs than a song convention
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
And we're all going straight to hell
My dad is bigger than your dad
He's got eight cars and a house in Ireland
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
When we gonna torch the restaurant?
Sing it
When we gonna pay the guide dog?
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
And we're all going straight to hell
My love is bigger than your love
We take more drugs than a touring funk band
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
When we gonna torch the restaurant?
Sing it
When we gonna get excited?
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
And we're all going straight to hell
Each day when I wake up and I set my best foot forward
I'll make an effort to be all that I can be
I take a look around me and I wonder how things change so much
In the few short years since I was a young boy
Do you know what we're fighting for?
I know in an instant I could lose everything I'm working toward
Yeah, I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
To the new American way
The morals of this nation's youth have long gone astray
Led by tolerance, indifference and this kinder gentler way 
That has corrupted and destroyed so many of our boys and girls
Oh Lord, I start to wonder will it ever come around?
Do you know what we're fighting for?
I know in an instant I could lose everything I'm working toward
Yeah, I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
To the new American way
Yeah, I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
To the new American way
I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
To the new American way
I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
To the new American way
I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
To the new American way
See, I've grown to find the same old sun
Erases shadows, devours light
We burn - we burn at both ends
Fate has no compass fear has no driver
What a cruel world clarity brings
We burn - we burn at both ends
Our ghosts were made of good that got in the way
Some just gave up in the end
Our faith was made for those who lost their own way
They just gave up in the end
Nothing will bring peace
Nothing will bring rest
And I've grown to find the same old sun
Erases shadows, devours light
We burn - we burn at both ends
Fate has no compass fear has no driver
What a cruel world clarity brings
We burn - we burn at both ends
Our ghosts were made of good that got in the way
Some just gave up in the end
Our faith was made for those who lost their own way
They just gave up in the end
Nothing will bring peace
Nothing will bring rest
Death and loss blossom, within the wound
Life and love writhing, wilting in you
Stayed up those nights to see
What the future could mean
Stayed up those nights to feel
A new day rise in me
Burn at both ends
Stayed up those nights to see
Burn at both ends
What the future could mean
Burn at both ends
Stayed up those nights to see
Burn at both ends
A new day rise in me
Don't think twice
I still believe it, John, we lived those nights
Like we were dyin' on the long haul drives
For our Maria, with the ragged sails high
And the radio on
And I always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
84 takes a lifetime, but Bobby does it better
I still sing 'em ragged for you and Maria
I don't drive nowhere without the radio on
And I'm still here singin', thinkin' 'bout the government
In my old man's shoes, and how you'd understand that
Are you hidin' in a basement mixin' up the medicine?
Every April Fools' I say your name
I know your name
I still know your name
And I always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
84 takes a lifetime, but Bobby does it better
I still sing 'em ragged for you and Maria
I don't drive nowhere without the radio on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on
One, two
One, two, three, four!
Always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
84 takes a lifetime, but Bobby does it better
I still sing 'em ragged for you and Maria
I don't drive nowhere without the radio on
We always loved the sad, sad songs
We always loved the sad, sad songs
We always loved the sad, sad songs
We always loved the sad, sad...
What have you done?
You followed footsteps in the dark
And found your faith
Left out behind your father's car
You said, "There's no one watching over me, over you; it's always out of reach"
I'm sick instead, write it into
Oh my God, where are we now?
Fractured lines
Dissolving like sugar in the sacrament
If it was just one night
Then we would be relieved
Tie this knot between our teeth
Keep tearing open bottles
Let it be
Tonight
Where have you gone?
Off with the friends you couldn't keep
Your mother's arms
Fill up with all the empty needs
So the saints slide out to bring her in,
Comfort her
And it's always comforting
When they start to sing,
The same old:
"Holy, Holy, lift up your dress. Feel your body
Dissolving like sugar in the sacrament"
If it was just one night
Then you could be redeemed
Tie this sin between your teeth
Make hollow promises we'll never keep
Tonight
This is all we've ever known of God
Fight with me
Let me touch you now
This is all we've ever known of God
Fight with me
Let me touch you now
Does he kiss your eyelids in the morning
When you start to raise your head?
And does he sing to you, incessantly,
From the space between your bed and wall?
Does he walk around all day at school,
With his feet inside your shoes?
Looking down every few steps
To pretend he walks with you?
Oh, Does he know that place below your neck
That's your favorite to be touched?
And does he cry through broken sentences like,
"I love you far too much"?
Does he lay awake listening to your breath?
Worried you smoke too many cigarettes?
Is he coughing now?
On a bathroom floor?
For every speck of tile
There's a thousand more
You won't ever see
But must hold inside yourself
Eternally
Well, I drug your ghost across the country
And we plotted out my death
In every city, memories would whisper,
"Here is where you rest."
I was determined in Chicago
But I dug my teeth into my knees
And I settled for a telephone
Sang into your machine,
"You are my sunshine,
My only sunshine.
You are my sunshine,
My only sunshine."
And I kissed a girl with a broken jaw
That her father gave to her
She had eyes bright enough to burn me;
They reminded me of yours
And in a story told, she was a little girl in a red-rouge, sun-bruised field
And there were rows of ripe tomatoes, where a secret was concealed
And it rose like thunder
Clapped under our hands
And it stretched for centuries
To a diary entry's end
Where I wrote,
"You make me happy,
Oh, when skies are gray.
You make me happy
Oh, when skies are gray, and gray, and gray."
Well the clock's heart it hangs inside its open chest
With its hands stretched towards the calendar hanging itself
But I will not weep
For those dying days
For all the ones who've left
There's a few that stayed
And they found me here
And pulled me from the grass
Where I was laid
We drew a crowd.
The crowd drew the blood.
Fawning swindlers.
There's a shark in the stream where the newborns are baptized.
Who let the flatterer,
Into the gallery,
On our sweet sixteen?
Take him away.
Get him against the wall for the witness.
This is doom in a borrowed suit.
It's a pickup line at a funeral.
Cannibals along side the catwalk.
But it's ok we've got old blood and our veins are rooted to the hornets nest again.
New love is tasteless.
We're wearing down.
This is the year of the party crasher.
What is charm?
Where are the heroics?
What is harm to the perfumed wrists of the stoics?
Designer impostors find us twitching in the claws of the snake.
A fin is circling around in the floor.
It appears we've lost our way.
The tide is swelling and we've fallen asleep on the shore.
Get inside.
Someone's yelling fire...
In the theater.
Oh, dear God, Everybody stay calm.
Tell your husband that his screaming just invited it in.
The horsemen are crashing through the gates.
We had better learn to play dead.
Our hands are reeking of rapture.
It's dripping from our chins.
The tragedy of infant hearts.
But it's ok we've got old blood and our hair is woven to the same hotel again.
New love is tasteless.
We're wearing down.
This is the year of the party crasher.
'Cause it's you and me for the first time in history.
We're history.
I believe in something else
Now go bother someone else
Stick your fingers in your book
Take a better second look
You crook
I hate it when you breach my space
And I hate it when you preach your case
And you should go down
Down
Save someone else
I think I should warn you
I think I should tell
What you've been doing
It makes you go to hell
I hate it when you preach your case
It makes me want to stick my dick in your face
And you should go down
Down
Save someone else...
Can your preacher bring me down?
I hate it when you breach my space
And I hate it when you preach your case
And you should go down
Down
Save someone else
Eat what you are while you're falling apart 
And it opened a can of worms
And the gun's in my hand and I know it looks bad 
But believe me I'm innocent
And I'm fearful I'm fearful I'm fearful of flying 
And flying is fearful of me
And I covered my eyes when she told me the news 
Turning me on with my lightsabre cocksucking blues
Are you coming?
Nicotine stained on account of her crutch 
And I'm aching from fucking too much
And I know what I do and it all points to you 
Did you sell me to wanderlust?
And I'm fearful I'm fearful I'm fearful of flying 
And flying is fearful of me
And I covered my eyes when she told me the news 
Turning me on with my lightsabre cocksucking blues
Are you coming?
Eat what you are while you're falling apart
And it opened a can of worms
And the gun's in my hand and I know it looks bad
But believe me I'm innocent
And I'm fearful I'm fearful I'm fearful of flying
And flying is fearful of me
And I covered my eyes when she told me the news
Turning me on with my lightsabre cocksucking blues
Told you I felt lucky with my humble breasts
Well I don't
Said that I was sure the world was gonna change
Well I'm not
Before I didn't give a damn 'bout what they say
But I do
Promised that I'll never ever lie to you
So you can help
Taking the make-up off my face
Before I forget my own features
I'm not here to let you down
But the costume makes the clown
It's just life's anatomy
Don't be so hard
Don't be so hard on this
It's your turn now
To cheat on me
Promises I made to you went down the sink
Really hope I haven't harmed your self esteem
I'm not a virgin but I'm not the whore you think
And I don't always smell like strawberries and cream
So you can help
Taking the make-up off my face
Before I forget who I am now
'Cause I'm not here to let you down
But the costume makes the clown
It's just life's anatomy
Don't be so hard
Don't be so hard on this
It's your turn now
Your turn now...
I'm not here to let you down
But the costume makes the clown
It's just life's anatomy
Don't be so hard
Don't be so hard on this
It's your turn now
Your turn now...
To cheat on me

I wonder who you think you are? You damn well think you're God or something.
God give life, God taketh it away. Not you; I think you are the Devil itself.
If hospitals cure then prisons must bring their pain.
Don't be ashamed to slaughter, the centre of humanity is cruelty
There is never redemption, any fool can regret yesterday
Nail it to the House of Lords, you will be buried in the same box as a killer.
As a killer
As a killer
A drained white body hanging from the gallows
Is more righteous that Hindley's crotchet lectures
Pain not penance, forget martyrs, remember victims
The weak die young and right now we crouch to make them strong
Kill Yeltsin, who's saying? Zhirinovsky, Le Pen. Hindley and Brady, Ireland, Allit, Sutcliffe
Dahmer, Nielson, Yoshinori Ueda. Blanche and Pickles, Amin, Milosevic
Give them the respect they deserve. Give them the respect they deserve
Give them the respect they deserve. Give them the respect they deserve
Execution needed, a bloody vessel for your peace.
If man makes death then death makes man, tear the torso with horses and chains
Killers view themselves like they view the world, they pick at the holes
Not punish less, rise the pain, sterilise rapists. All I preach is extinction
Kill Yeltsin, who's saying? Zhirinovsky, Le Pen. Hindley and Brady, Ireland, Allit, Sutcliffe
Dahmer, Nielson, Yoshinori Ueda. Blanche and Pickles, Amin, Manic Street Preachers
Give them the respect they deserve. Give them the respect they deserve
Give them the respect they d-e-s-e-r-v-e
You're the tree that you can't
Eat the fruit from
I heard horses came to
Ride me away - I want shade
And a good place to shoot from
If I's a clock I'd be the end of the day
You know you're not the boss of me
You can lift your skirt
You can shake your hair
But I got all the time in the world
You're the ditch in the road where the
Wheels keep spinning. You're the same dead cat
Clawing it's way back grinning. You know
You got a bad reputation and you're nine lives
Way down the line. I got a jacket to put on
And a hat to wear. I wouldn't waste a
Gallon on you out there and I got all
The time in the world
A bridge is only there for you to jump
Off of. And there ain't no rain clouds
That are blue. I do declare my
Independence baby I shot off all my
Fireworks for you. The river's burning
And the trees are on fire
There's lots of good rubber left on these tires
And I've got all the time in the world
Baby you're the light that won't change
That I got suck at
You're the fan that won't work
At the motel
They were all out of red so I got
Me a blue one
Baby you're always using mine, why you get
You one. I know you won't go very far
You left your blonde wig in the car
And I got all the time in the world
Let's fall deeper into sleep
And our dreams become fake reality
I wake, I hope.
I'm on my way, to a coast
Where I know the roads like the back of my hand
Familiar landscapes
And I know that this is new
Like your first day of school
And you're feeling awkward
Like you miss your home
And it leaves you with an empty feeling
I just can't take it anymore
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from my life?
What do you want from me?
Cause my heart can't take it
My heart can't take this anymore
You feel deeply misplaced
Your world has been built to crumble
You hope and pray everyday it works out
And it leaves me with this empty feeling
I just can't take it anymore
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from my life?
What do you want from me?
Cause my heart can't take it
My heart can't take this anymore
Anymore
My heart can't take this anymore
Anymore
What better time than now to bandage your bleeding
And I won't stop 'til I fix your misleading
Your charm of course, you use as a weapon
But my heart can't take it
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from my life?
What do you want from me?
Cause my heart can't take it
My heart can't take this anymore
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from my life?
What do you want from me?
Cause my heart can't take it
My heart can't take this anymore
Let's fall deeper into sleep
And our dreams become fake reality
We hope and we pray everyday it works out
And it leaves me with this empty feeling
I just can't take it anymore
Face the day embrace the pain
Wage my war internal
Save my soul eternal
Reach out for redemption it bites the hand that needs
Neglect becomes rejection the silent sounds retreat
I can't believe
It's the last time
Anything you say
It's the last time 
Chained to the past ride the wings of despair
Corroded and rusted trust beyond repair
In this triumph of the wills I won't be overrun
The pride that is instilled cannot be overcome
I can't believe
It's the last time
Anything you say
It's the last time
It's the last time that I'll try today
I can't believe
It's the last time
Anything you say
That I'll fall down
It's the last time 
It's the last time
That I'll try today
Break it all down
I wanted to be friends with her too
So my relationship could be the same as yours
I hated everyone just like you
Hating you should be introduced as a new law
Take the time to learn to hate
Come and join the mass debate
Take the time, take the time
It's all uphill, you've gotta climb
You betrayed all the trust I gave you
Now I need therapy to hate a little more
You cannot help me to forgive you
The drugs have given you all kinds of different sores
I hated everyone just like you
Hating you should be introduced as a new law
Take the time to learn to hate
Come and join the mass debate
Take the time, take the time
It's all uphill, you've gotta climb
As you pump drugs into your bloodstream
I sit observing in disgust
Hoping that you will finally come clean
So I don't have to use this gun
Take the time to learn to hate
Come and join the mass debate
Take the time, take the time
It's all uphill, it's all up, it's all uphill
Instrumental
Caught between the twisted stars
The plotted lines the faulty map
That brought Columbus to New York
Betwixt between the East and West
He calls on her wearing a leather vest
The earth squeals and shudders to a halt
A diamond crucifix in his ear
Is used to help ward off the fear
That he has left his soul in someone's rented car
Inside his pants he hides a mop
To clean the mess that he has dropped
Into the life of lithesome Juliette Bell
And Romeo wanted Juliette
And Juliette wanted Romeo
And Romeo wanted Juliette
And Juliette wanted Romeo
Romeo Rodriguez squares
His shoulders and curses Jesus
Runs a comb through his black pony-tail
He's thinking of his lonely room
The sink that by his bed gives off a stink
Then smells her perfume in his eyes
And her voice was like a bell
Outside the streets were steaming
The crack dealers were dreaming
Of an Uzi someone had just scored
I betcha I could hit that light
With my one good arm behind my back
Says little Joey Diaz
Brother give me another tote
Those downtown hoods are no damn good
Those Italians need a lesson to be taught
This cop who died in Harlem
You think they'd get the warnin'
I was dancing when I saw his brains run out on the street
And Romeo had Juliette
And Juliette had her Romeo
And Romeo had Juliette
And Juliette had her Romeo
I'll take Manhattan in a garbage bag
With Latin written on it that says
"It's hard to give a shit these days"
Manhattan's sinking like a rock
Into the filthy Hudson what a shock
They wrote a book about it
They said it was like ancient Rome
The perfume burned his eyes
Holding tightly to her thighs
And something flickered for a minute
And then it vanished and was gone
The most remarkable thing
About coming home to you
Is the feeling of being in motion again.
It's the most extraordinary thing in the world.
I have two big hands
And a heart pumping blood
And a 1967 Colt .45
With a busted safety catch.
The world shines,
As I cross the Macon county line,
Going to Georgia.
The most remarkable thing
About you standing in the doorway
Is that it's you,
And that you're standing in the doorway.
And you smile as you ease the gun from my hand,
And I am frozen with joy right where I stand.
The world throws its light underneath your hair.
40 miles from Atlanta, this is nowhere,
Going to Georgia.
The world shines,
As I cross the Macon county line,
Going to Georgia.
I exclude light
And wash my hands of you
By larger being devoured
Leaving only me to improve
Weep
Don't fucking weep
Your weak eyes cry tears of the meek
You're expectant to the Bible
Fiending all the foes in middle
Don't you see in the mirror
That you're the selfish shit
Shot glass seems to hug your soul
There's no point to grow
You don't have time to explore
You're already broke
Weep
Weep
Don't fucking weep
Your weak eyes cry tears of the meek
Weep
Catch up with the sheep
It's a sacrilegious ceremony
New flavor of the week
Nothing's sacred in the faces of
The soulless that you're made into
The soulless that you're made into
The soulless that you're made into
You're raptured by a guilty stifle down
You're...
Raptured by a guilty stifle
Down
(I wash my hands of you)
And what I'll do
Is mess you up and lie to you
Look at you, you know it's true
It's a field trip to Hollywood Babylon
But I'm not coming
No
Pull the car over you're frightening the kids.
What did you promise us
About grinning in the rear view mirror
Without your fake teeth in?
Keep your glass eye glued on the end of the highway up ahead of us.
The collision is always licking it's lips.
You weren't supposed to open the door.
Just keep the plane from drifting off course.
We'll attend to the terrified first class
Convinced there's a hoof print on the bow.
All hail the wounded heart continment
Who've given us something more than faultlessness to sing about.
Long live prosthetic live wires.
The faulty mechanism of hope has disintegrated.
Your captain nailed his feet to someone else's ship at the sight of me.
Do what your mother tells you and put down the sheriff's horse.
The choir on the black box rejoiced splendidly,
Singing hallelujah the king is dead.
The king is dead.
I'm never coming back
I'm never giving in
I'll never be the shine in your spit
I disconnect the act
I disconnect the dots
I disconnect the me in me
You're mistaken
It's you that's faking, living, breathing, dying too
This message is for anyone who dares to hear a fool
You can't bring me back
You can't bring me back 'cause I give it all back to you
Through sacred alleys, the living wrecks, yeah, wreak their havoc upon this world
The disenchanted, the romantics
The body and face and soul of you is gone down that deep black hole
Destroy the mind, destroy the body but you cannot destroy the heart
Destroy the mind, destroy the body but you cannot destroy the heart
And you, you make it so I need to disconnect
And you make it so real, I don't need your love to disconnect
To runaround kids in get-go cars
With vaseline afterbirths and neon coughs
Galaxies full of nobodies giving us the farewell runarounds
And I took a Virgin Mary axe to his sweet baby Jane
Lost my innocence to a no-good girl
Scratch my face with anvil hands
And coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouth
And I give it all back to you
I give it all back to you, yeah
I give it all back to you
And for you
No way, I don't need it, I don't need your love to disconnect
And you make it so real, I don't need your love to disconnect
No way, no way, no way, yeah yeah, to disconnect
And you make it so real, I don't need your love to disconnect
No way, no way, no way, yeah yeah, to disconnect, yeah
Here
Here
I'm not sure who's fooling who here
As I'm watching your decay
We both know you could deflate
A seven hurricane
Seems like you and your tribe
Decided you'd rewrite the law
Segregate the mind
From body, from soul
You give me yours, I'll give you mine
'Cause I can look your god right in the eye
You give me yours, I'll give you mine
You used to look my god right in the eye (here)
I believe in defending
In what we once stood for
It seems in vogue
To be a closet misogynist homophobe
A change of course in our direction
A dash of truth spread thinly
Like a flag on a pop star
On a Benzodiazapene
You give me yours, I'll give you mine
'Cause I can look your god right in the eye
You give me yours, I'll give you mine
You used to look my god right in the eye (here)
Oh Zion please remove your glove
And dispel every trace
Of his spoken word
That has lodged in my vortex
I'm not sure who's fooling who here
As I'm watching our decay
We both know you could deflate
A seven hurricane
You could have spared her, oh but no
Messiahs need people dying in their name
You could have spared her, oh but no
Messiahs need people dying in their name
You say, "I ordered you a pancake"
You say, "I ordered you a pancake"
I've seen them kneel with bated breath for their ritual
I've watched this experience raise them to pseudo-higher levels
I've watched them leave their families in pursuit of your nirvana
I've seen them coming to line up from Switzerland and America
How long will this take, Baba?
How long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much will this cost, guru?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?
I've seen them give their drugs up in place of makeshift altars
I've heard them chanting "Kali, Kali" frantically
I've heard them rotely repeat your teachings with elitism
I've seen them boasting robes and foreign sandalwood beads
How long will this take, Baba?
How long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much will this cost, guru?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?
I've seen them overlooking God in their own essence
I've seen their upward glances in hopes of instant salvation
I've seen their righteousness mixed without loving compassion
I've watched you smile as the students bow to kiss your feet
How long will this take, Baba?
How long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much will this cost, guru?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?
Give me strength all-knowing one
How long till enlightenment?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?
(Fake, fake flowers)
(Fake funeral)

This room is a, a fluorescent tomb: it's brazen bulbs mimic death's heina croon.
He pulls on her wires, she jerks to attention, she's animated again,
She's talking to a hypodermic reflection.
We've watched it all from the window ledge,
The nurses offer their condolences,
Tongues flapping I can't make out your tone,
Our hearts beat in slow motion.
If we make it to the final scene (fake flowers!)
Show me to the sapphire pit (fake tomb)
Peel the candy crust of my body (fake flowers)
Throw in the brittle skeleton (fake tomb)
Can you inject love's tender touch back into the gang bang?
Can you knit the stiletto back into the bloodstain?
Can you put the bite back into the beast you've broke, and tied and tamed?
Can you crease the wrinkles back into the cracked and open brain?
So doctor won't you pull the fucking plug? Won't you cut the cord?
'Cause you can't put the life back into this hospital ward.
Say won't you pull the plug!
Say won't you cut the cord!
x4
Now she's gonna make it out ok, but she's shaking like a revolution!
And she stares at the fire all day, mumbling to herself:
Every hole has a snake in it,
And every crotch is a siamese gun.
Every sunshine hides a cancerous chime
And every breath is a bomb.
I'd like to wrap my arms around you like a flesh canopy
I'd like to take your head, place it
Somewhere between my shoulders and neck
But, I'm afraid your brittle bones would break
We can hear the black out orchestra singing...
Can you hear them singing?
Can you hear them?
Can you?
Can you inject love's tender touch back into the gang bang?
Can you knit the stiletto back into the bloodstain?
Can you put the bite back into the beast you've broke, and tied and tamed?
Can you crease the wrinkles back into the cracked and open brain?
So doctor won't you pull the fucking plug? Won't you cut the cord?
'Cause you can't put the life back into this hospital ward.
So doctor won't you pull the fucking plug? Won't you cut the cord?
'Cause you can't put the life back into this hospital ward.

I can hear their song from miles away. 
It's carried in the wind. 
Its melody is sung to me in miracles. 
The sun rises over the sea.
When I hear their love song.
I don't understand.
From out beyond the shadows.
I can hear it calling me.
Honestly, if I'm honest with myself.
I've cried myself to sleep.
Crying out, 'Oh God, where are you?
Can you hear my scream way up there.
Through the clouds, in heaven?
Do you even care?'
And honestly if I'm honest with myself.
I hate the song they sing.
It's like salt on an open wound.
But I can't get it out of my head.
This melody kills me.
It's out of key and foolish.
But I think I might just like it.
If I could just get past my pride.
I turn my head and look away.
'Cause you know it hurts to see the light of day.
When I hear their love song.
I don't understand.
From out beyond the shadows.
I can hear it calling me.
Honestly, if I'm honest with myself.
I've cried myself to sleep.
Crying out, 'Oh God, where are you?
Can you hear my scream way up there.
Through the clouds, in heaven?
Do you even care?'
And honestly if I'm honest with myself.
I hate the song they sing.
It's like salt on an open wound.
But I can't get it out of my head.
The whole world hates you.
The whole world hates your song.
Oh God I'm a sinner and I think I wanna sing along.
The whole world hates you.
The whole world hates your song.
And I wanna sing.
I wanna sing along.
Heaven's not so far away.
I can hear its melody from here in the waiting room of hell.
Well heaven's not so far away.
I can hear its melody calling me.
Calling me home.
Honestly, if I'm honest with myself.
I've cried myself to sleep.
Crying out, 'Oh God, where are you?
Can you hear my scream way up there.
Through the clouds, in heaven?
Do you even care?'
And honestly if I'm honest with myself.
I hate the song they sing.
It's like salt on an open wound.
But I can't get it out of my head.
And honestly, if I'm honest with myself.
I've cried myself to sleep.
Crying out, 'Oh God, I need you.
Can you hear my prayer way up there.
Through the clouds, in heaven?
Do you even care?'
And honestly, I've never really been honest with myself.
Well this melody heals my wounds.
And I can't get it out of my head.
6 AM, day after Christmas
I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold, car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping, I am numb
Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
They're not home to find us out
And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
They call her name at seven-thirty
I pace around the parking lot
And I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got
Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for
Now she's feeling more alone
Than she ever has before
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
As weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine
They told me, "Son, it's time to tell the truth."
And she broke down and I broke down
'Cause I was tired of lying
Driving back to her apartment
For the moment, we're alone
Yeah, she's alone and I'm alone
Now I know it
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Baby, you got a bad bad mouth
Everything is poison that's coming out
Cheating, lying since the day you were born
Someone outta rinse it out with soap
Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out
No kind words are coming out of your mouth
Plenty goes in but nothing good comes out
Badmouth, sad mouth, you were an unhappy child
That doesn't make your lying tongue all right
Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out
'Cause everything is poison
You'll be the unhappy one
Your lips taste of poison
You're gonna be left alone
When you told me every word you said
Came from voices talking in your head
Baby, I just think you're out for what you can get
Your badmouth has killed off everything we had
Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out
'Cause everything is poison
You'll be the unhappy one
Your lips taste of poison
You'll be in the corner crying
Cold eyes and a painted face 
Black heart pumping discount rates
The shell you've built around your world lets nothing out 
So take your fucking faker face and stay away from me 
I'm trying not to hear your lies or see your make-believe 
The words you speak are empty and your stories full of holes 
You've got to know you'll burn in hell for all the lies you've told 
Trust built on a mound of shit
All signs pointing to your sins
The smiles only make it worse for you, you'll see 
So take your fucking faker face and stay away from me 
I'm trying not to hear your lies or see your make-believe 
The words you speak are empty and your stories full of holes 
You've got to know you'll burn in hell for all the lies you've told 
Look deep in the mirror but try not to see 
Look deep in the river and try not to scream 
You've never been a giver 
It's obvious to me 
So take your fucking faker face and stay away from me 
I'm trying not to hear your lies or see your make-believe 
The words you speak are empty and your stories full of holes 
You've got to know you'll burn in hell for all the lies you've told
Something so benign from me construed as cruelty
Such a difference between who I am and who you see
Conclusions you come to of me routinely incorrect
I don't know who you're talking to with such fucking disrespect
This shit's making me crazy
The way you nullify what's in my head
You say one thing, do another
And argue that's not what you did
Your way's making me mental
How you filter as skewed interpret
I swear you won't be happy 'til
I'm bound in a straitjacket
Talking with you's like talking to a sieve that can't hear me
You fight me tooth and nail to disavow what's happening
Your resistance to a mirror I feel screaming from your body
One day I'll introduce myself and you'll see you've not yet met me
This shit's making me crazy
The way you nullify what's in my head
You say one thing do another
And argue that's not what you did
Your way's making me mental
How you filter as skewed interpret
I swear you won't be happy 'til
I'm bound in a straitjacket
Grand dissonance
The strings of my puppet are cut
The end of an era
Your discrediting has lost my consent
This shit's making me crazy
The way you nullify what's in my head
You say one thing do another
And argue that's not what you did
Your way's making me mental
How you filter as skewed interpret
I swear you won't be happy 'til
I'm bound in a straitjacket
Don't you mess
With a little girl's dream
'Cause she's liable to grow up
Mean
Surprise you to find that I'm laughing?
You thought that you'd find me in tears
You thought I'd be crawling
The walls like a tiny mosquito
And trembling in fear
Well, you may be king for the moment
But I am a queen, understand
And I've got your pawns and your bishops and
Castles
All inside the palm of my hand
While you were looking the other way
While you had your eyes closed
While you were licking your lips
'Cause I was miserable
While you were selling your soul
While you were tearing a hole
In me
I was taking control
Now I have taken control (I have... control...)
Now I have taken control (I have... control...)
Now I have taken control
Control...
This is beginning to feel good
Watching you squirm in your shoes
A small bead of sweat on your brow
And a growl in your belly
You're scared to let through
You thought you could keep me from loving
Ha, you thought you could feed on my soul
But while you were busy destroying my life
What was half in me has become whole
While you were looking the other way
While you had your eyes closed
While you were licking your lips
'Cause I was miserable
While you were selling your soul
While you were tearing a hole
In me
I was taking control
Now I have taken control (I have... control...)
Now I have taken control (I have... control...)
Now I have taken control
Control...
So this is how it feels
To breathe in the summer air
To feel the sand between my toes
And love inside my ear
All those things, you taught me to fear
I've got them in my garden now and
You're not welcome here
Come here
Come a little bit closer...
Let me look at you
I gave you the benefit of the doubt, it's true
But keep in mind my darling
Not every saint is a fool
(Don't)
While you were looking the other way (you mess)
While you had your eyes closed (with me)
While you were licking your lips
'Cause I was miserable
(Don't)
While you were selling your soul (you mess)
While you were tearing a hole
In me
(I was taking control)
Now I have taken control (I was taking control)
Now I have taken control (control)
Control...
(Control)
Control...
Don't you mess with me
spoken:
This cannot be all that there is to life,
Because, in our confrontation, with,
An enormous and cold, universe.
There is something comical, to the idea
That we can really enforce our will, on humanity.
Power, corrupts.
It's your world, do with it what you want!
No, that's not the way to do it.
Power... That's not the way to do it.
Paradox
No
It's your world
No
It's your world
No
It's your world
NO!
Control it! Control it!
(This is scaring me...
I live at the end of a 5 and 1/2 minute hallway
I live at the end of a 5 and 1/2 minute hallway)
At the end of it all lies of course the final phenomenon of deterioration
Entropy
Which is a predictable deterioration when the creative energy ceases...
I'm not afraid of standing still.
I'm just afraid of being bored.
I'm not afraid of speaking my mind.
I'm just afraid of being ignored.
I'm not afraid of feeling and I'm not afraid of trying...
I'm just afraid of losing and I am afraid of DYING!
Without you yes I do and I hope that you do too.
Without you yes I do.
Without you yes I do and I hope that you do too.
Without you yes I...
I'm not afraid of being sick.
I'm more afraid of being well.
I'm not afraid... put the gun in my hand...
I'm just afraid it will hurt like, hurt like hell.
I'm not afraid of screaming and I'm not afraid of crying
I'm just afraid of forgetting and I am afraid of DYING!
Without you, yes I do and I hope that you do too
Without you, yes I do
Without you, yes I do and I hope that you do too
Without you, yes I...
I'm not afraid of looking ugly.
I couldn't care what they say.
I'm not afraid of happy endings
I'm just afraid my life won't work that way.
I'm not afraid of forgiveness
I'll absolve you everything.
I'm not afraid of lying but I am afraid of DYING!
Without you, yes I do and I hope that you do too.
Without you, yes I do.
Without you, all I do is sit and think about you.
Without you, yes I...
If ignorance is bliss
Eradicate my knowledge of my history
Now meaning is left on my own
I look for a long time
Cross back with your kind
But some things are better left alone
Wake up, lonely, hating my life, alone...
Wake up, lonely, hating my life
Shame, shame on me
Come again
Shame, shame on me
Come again
Just bodies, they brightly scratch
They claw like golden souls
Show pictures you won't see, you'll never know
Just bodies, these golden souls
With pictures, wont delete it
Heaved into the ocean to drown with your brothers, your brothers...
Wake up, lonely, hating my life
Their brothers, brothers...
Wake up, lonely, hating my life
Shame, shame on me
Come again
Shame, shame on me
Come again
Come again
Come again
Oh shame, shame on me
Come again
Shame, shame on me
Come again
Shame, shame on me
Come again
Oh shame on me
Come again
If it wasn't for hate, we'd be dead by now.
If it wasn't for truth, we'd have taken our bow.
If it wasn't for love, we'd have faded away.
If it wasn't for hate, baby, I would have lost out today.
It won't kill me.
You can't stop me.
It won't kill me.
You can't stop me.
It won't kill me.
You can't stop me.
If it wasn't for death, I know I'd never feel this alive.
If it wasn't for lies, I probably wouldn't survive.
If it wasn't for damn hypocrisy, I wouldn't have to sing this song.
If it wasn't for patience baby, I couldn't wait it out this long.
I'm killing everything you know.
I'm killing everything you know.
I'm killing everything you know.
I'm killing everything you know.
You can turn off and on more times
Than a flashin' neon sign.
When you want you're bad
But you can be so kind
Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend
Just what you're gonna do now
You take it or leave it, it's just my life
There've been times when you tried
Makin' eyes at all my so called friends
Then you go, now you're back
But you can be so kind
Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend
Just what you're gonna do now
You take it or leave it, it's just my life
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la
I'm sick and tired of the smile that you give
When you don't come home at night
You said you'd call, that's a lie
But you could be so kind
Just take it or leave it
Don't tell your friend
Just what you're gonna do now
You take it or leave it, it's just my life
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la la la
Oh, la la la ta ta ta ta la la
I only see myself reflected in your eyes
So all that I believe I am essentially are lies
And everything I've hoped to be or ever thought I was
Died with your belief in me so who the hell am I?
I don't know if I am real without you
What is left of me without you?
I don't know what's real without you
How can I exist without you?
I'm wandering around confused, wondering why I try
The more that you deny my pain, the more it intensifies...
I pray for someone to ache for me the way I ache for you
If you ignore that I'm alive, I've nothing to cling to
I don't know if I am real without you
What is left of me without you?
I don't know what's real without you
How can I exist without you?
I stare into this mirror, so tired of this life
If only you would speak to me or care if I'm alive
Once I swore I would die for you, but I never meant like this
(I never meant like this)
No, I never meant like this
I don't know if I am real without you
What is left of me without you?
I don't know what's real without you
How can I exist without you?
How can I exist without you?
How can I exist without you?
A little bit closer,
I know you're not bashful
There, now that's not so bad, is it?
So what was that secret?
What did that prick whisper to you?
Was it playful and flirty
Or degrading and dirty?
I know you like it both ways
So -- what did he say?
To make you so goddamn defiant
So fucking triumphant
Relations, in direct competition
Domination
The players, disguised as the lovers
The best friend
A game of who needs who the worst
A little bit closer
Your lipstick is smudged, dear
Here, let me wipe that smirk off
A secret
But you couldn't keep it so secret
Relations, without hesitation
Or social tact
As it occurred, it occurred to me
Who needs who?
Who needs who?
A little bit closer...
Closer...
We never met, you and I
We were always inside, we were somewhere inside
One another. And I'll live without you love,
But what good is one glove, without the other?
Still, you only ask about my leaving,
Well but honey I had no choice, so
I call and (when you hear that heavy breathing)
For that sound of your voice.
But you sit there silent, folded arms
And look down as I walk by
My face has changed, you know it's me
You know by the stillness in my eyes.
Come and whisper in my ear,
"You're very pretty, dear" and, and,
"It'll be all right."
You're lying!
But I don't mind tonight.
So I wander and I wander
Your absence beating inside my chest
I try but I can't remember
The color of your eyes, just the shape of your dress!
And through a garden overgrown...
Oh, it's a long walk home!
I said I'd not come back, well I'm coming back!
(And you'd better be alone.)
Sit there silent, folded arms
As you smile, as I walk by
My face has shamed, but you know it's me,
You know it's me!
Come and whisper in my ear, my dear!
My dear!
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.
It'll be al--No!
No!
O, baby, I want ya
You're so fuckin' big
You're so big and hard
You've got such a big cock
Push it in deeper now
O, deeper, harder
I'm almost cummin'
I'm almost cummin'
O, sugar!
I can almost reach my mouth, now, now
Sugar
I'm a self-fulfilling porno queen, yeah
I mimic out your ever' fuckin' fantasy yeah, yeah
You know, you know
In my head, I'm on my knees
O, baby
Why don't I ever get my
Sugar?
What are you afraid of?
Who are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
Who are you afraid of?
O, sugar!
I won't play girl to your boy no more
Sugar
I want mine right here, right now
Baby, sugar
I can almost reach it now, now, now
Sugar
What was that you just said
That didn't make any sense to me
It's not the way I see it, man
I'm almost tired of listening to you
Why do you tie me up with words
The way your eye shifts makes me wanna go
Black chalk living room couch professor
When will you be through with me
I'd like to know
Everywhere I go I feel it
And I won't talk, I won't get stuck with you
Everyone's so lonely I dig it
But I'm afraid I can't share this with you
So don't make me a captive
I don't feel like talking your shit
I nod my broken head
I'm not too amused with humans
We stare into the blinding light
To see what's between us
It's red and it's white
Like lies, like lipstick on last look good-byes
The substance assimilating to watch the bodies burst into a string of lights
When there's nothing left
The party crashes and the rings come out
From all the jacket pockets
Into the blinding light!
The fire is dying out
And there's nothing left to burn except for ourselves
The cinema speaks as you take off your clothes and burst into dissimulation
Just let your body burst into a streak of light
When there's nothing left
The wedding crashes and the rings fall off,
Roll out the bedroom window
Into the blinding light!
Please someone help me-- take away my loneliness
Please someone fill me-- take away my emptiness
Please someone touch me-- take away my longing and
Please someone, please someone, please someone show me the light...
Please someone-- take away my sadness
Please someone-- kill me, tear me up and throw me away
And the rings fall out like a silver snowfall, Into the blinding light!
Just make your body burst into single line
When there's nothing left,
The heart rate crashes and the rings fall out
As we turn each other into the blinding light!
White night coming down
Silent armies all around
Deep sleep covering
Enemies in clean white sheets
(The sky went off-white, it snowed for fourteen years the sunlight splintered into all our darkest fears)
You don't own me
(Fuck)
You don't own me
(Fuck)
You don't own me
(Fuck)
You don't own me
You don't own me
You hold me down, you hold me down,
You hold me down like a magnet
And this is not all that I am
No this is not my name
I've got the love that's strong not weak
I've got the love that's strong not weak
Tonight two great ships will pull back to their ports
Depleted of everything that shoots flames and reports
And in the morning the shells will wash up on the shore
And the mighty of Earth will have no other recourse
But to shiver and shake and make shit in their shorts
Because we have been told that if you've been assured
There's a way to live the values your forefathers gave you
Prepare to be told "That shit's gay, dude"
Well, I guess that what they say is true
That there is no race more human
No one throws it away like they do
The things I used to love, I have come to reject
The things I used to hate, I have learned to accept
And the worst of the three, you now have to expect
Satan ain't hard to see without craning your neck
He'll be seventy-some inches tall
He'll be chugging a beer and he'll be grabbing his balls
He's a remote explosive waiting for someone to call
He's just eighteen for now but he's going to murder us all
Solidarity's going to give a lot less than it'll take
Is there a girl at this college who hasn't been raped?
Is there a boy in this town that's not exploding with hate?
Is there a human alive that can look themselves in the face
Without winking?
Or say what they mean without drinking?
Or believe in something without thinking, "What if somebody doesn't approve?"
Is there a soul on this Earth that isn't too frightened to move?
I think the wrong people got a hold of your brain
When it was nothing but a piece of putty
So now try as you may
But you will always be a tourist, little buddy
And half the time I open my mouth to speak
It's to repeat something that I heard on TV
And I've destroyed everything that wouldn't make me more like Bruce Springsteen
So I'm going back to New Jersey, I do believe they've had enough of me
So when I leave Boston, my tail is between my legs
After deep cups of patience have been drunk to the dregs
And now I'm heading west on 84 again
And I'm as much of an asshole as I've ever been
And there is still nothing about myself I respect
Still haven't done anything I did not later regret
I've a hand and a napkin when I'm looking for sex
And that's no one to talk to when feeling depressed
And so now when I drink, I'm going to drink to excess
And when I smoke, I will smoke gaping holes in my chest
And when I scream, I will scream until I'm gasping for breath
And when I get sick, I will stay sick for the rest
Of my days peddling hate out the back of a Chevy Express
Each one a fart in the face of your idea of success
And if this be thy will, then fucking pass me the cup
And I'm sorry, Dad, no, I'm not making this up
But my enemy, it's your name on my lips as I go to sleep
And I know what little I've known of peace
Yes, I've done to you what you've done to me
And I'd be nothing without you, my darling, please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever leave

You think you're going to live your life alone
In darkness, and seclusion
Yeah, I know.
You've been out there, and tried to mix with those animals
And it just left you full of humiliated confusion.
So you stagger back home, and wait for nothing.
But the solitary refinement of your room spits you back out onto the streets
And now you're desperate, and in need of human contact
And then, you meet me, and your whole world changes
Because everything I say is everything you've ever wanted to hear
So you drop all your defenses, and you drop all your fears.
And you trust me completely.
I'm perfect, in every way.
'Cause I make you feel so strong and so powerful inside.
You feel so lucky.
But your ego obscures reality and you never bother to wonder why things are going so well.
You want to know why?
'Cause I'm a liar, yeah, I'm a liar
I'll tear your mind up, I'll burn your soul
I'll turn you into me, I'll turn you into me
'Cause I'm a liar, a liar, a liar, a liar
I'll hide behind a smile
And understanding eyes
And I'll tell you things that you already know, so you can say:
"I really identify with you, so much!"
And all the time that you're needing me
Is just the time that I'm bleeding you
Don't you get it yet?
I'll come to you like an affliction
But I'll leave you like an addiction
You'll never forget me
You wanna know why?
'Cause I'm a liar, yeah, I'm a liar
I'll rip your mind out, I'll burn your soul
I'll turn you into me, I'll turn you into me
'Cause I'm a liar, a liar, liar, liar, liar, liar
I don't know why I feel the need to lie and cause you so much pain
Maybe it's something inside, maybe it's something I can't explain
'Cause all I do, is mess you up and lie to you
I'm a liar, oh, I am a liar
But if you'll give me just one more chance I swear I'll never lie to you again
'Cause now I see the destructive power of a lie
It is stronger than truth
I can't believe I ever hurt you
I swear I will never lie to you again, please, just give me one more chance
I'll never lie to you again
No, I swear
I will never tell a lie
I will never tell a lie, no, no
Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh oh oh oh!
Sucker! Sucker! Oh, sucker!
I am a liar, yeah, I am a liar, yeah, I like it
I feel good, I am a liar
Yeah, I lie, I lie, I lie, oh, I lie, oh, I lie, I lie, yeah
Oh, I'm a liar, I lie, I like it, I feel good, I'll lie again, and again
I'll lie again and again and I'll keep lying
I promise
Find your faith in your security
All broken up at seventeen
Jam your brain with broken heroes
Love your masks and adore your failure
We're a mess of eyeliner and spray paint
D.I.Y. destruction on channel chic
Deny your culture of consumption
This is a culture of destruction
Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just
Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just
Babes on the run with poisoned lips
Wrap your arms 'round this everlasting kiss
Clinging to your own sense of waste
All we love is lonely wreckage
Your school, your dole and your chequebook dreams
Your clothes, your suits and your pension schemes
Now you say you know how we feel
But don't fall in love, 'cause we hate you still
Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just
Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your words
Why don't you just
Destroyed by madness, oh yeah
Destroyed by madness, oh yeah
Destroyed by madness, oh yeah
Anxiety is freedom
(Intro-Fat Joe and Prodigy vocal samples)
"So who the next to get it?"
"I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left"
(Verse 1-Vinnie Paz)
Yo, roll the dro and spark, a bunch of animals like Noah's Ark
A rapper so ill, my flow just stole Jehovah's heart
My fist'll break a fuckin' boulder in half
When I was young, I'd smack a stick off of your shoulder and laugh
I've chosen a path, spoke on my emotional past
Spoke on everything from war to how the ocean is vast
My flow is too fast, you can't contend with me there
Or it's gonna be a massacre, Tiananmen Square
My pen is prepared, and so the guns and the swords
And death the only thing you get for fuckin' with lords
Been stuck in some wars, but Vinnie fought his way out
The double jab, right cross what they caught in they mouth
I'm callin' 'em out, anyone who fuck wit my fam'
Thinkin' that they got away and they was lucky, then blam
Buck 'em and scram, don't use the shotty no more
They didn't think that Vinnie P was catchin' bodies no more
(Hook-Fat Joe, Jay-Z and Prodigy vocal samples)
"So who the next to get it?"
"You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God"
"I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left"
"Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it"
"So who the next to get it?"
"You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God"
"I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left"
"Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it"
(Verse 2-Vinnie Paz)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is death and doom, my occupation puttin' flesh in tombs
Whether or not you shot, the aggression looms
I'm the one that speak the language of fate
I'm the one that speak the language and the anguish of hate
My banger is great, it split the top of your dome
Like the book of Revelations spoke of the prophets in Rome
I'm locked in the throne, whether you like it or not
'Cause I'm chemically the reason liquid nitrogen hot
I'm nice with the glock, nicer with the semi's and Tec's
But I'm nicest when I'm clappin' at my enemies neck's
They tend to regret ever sendin' me threats
'Cause they know the only thing that they could send me is cheques
(Hook-Fat Joe, Jay-Z and Prodigy vocal samples)
"So who the next to get it?"
"You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God"
"I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left"
"Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it"
"So who the next to get it?"
"You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God"
"I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left"
"Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it"
(Verse 3-Vinnie Paz)
Yeah, I'm like Mark David Chapman with a Salinger book
Stalk my enemy and let the fuckin' silencer cook
It's down in the book, that my competitors ain't really ready
The way my four pound turn your stomach to spaghetti
It's like the Serengeti, because it's hot here
The way that policia set it on the block here
They pushin' rocks here, in the dead of night
I take my glock and I point god/point guard like Brevin Knight
Your fuckin' men are mice, you shouldn't answer that
If my father was still alive, he wouldn't stand for that
He wouldn't stand for how you act like a bitch
Wouldn't stand for anybody who a rat or a snitch
I'm back in this bitch, we was gone for a while
Till a shorty told me that he heard my song and he smiled
I'm strong but I'm wild, they say I drink too much
The only problem that I have is that I think too much, pussy
(Outro-Jay-Z sample)
"You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God"
"You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God"
"You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God"
"You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God"
Still
Kill
Still
Kill
Back up in your ass with The Resurrection
Is the group harder than an erection
That shows more affection
They wanna ban us on Capitol Hill
'Cause it's die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
All along it was the Geto, nothing but the Geto
Takin' short steps one foot at a time and kept my head low
And never let go, 'cause if I let go
Then I'll be spineless, I'm goin' insane
I think my mind just goes outta control
And judge on subjects muthafuckas read about
I touch on the shit that they be leavin' out
I seen this muthafucka's 9 smokin'
I seen the same nigga with the 9 die with his eyes open
And simply what this means is
He didn't know that every dog had his day
Until he seen his
I bet you muthafuckas will too
Because it's die muthafucka, die muthafucka still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
(I-I. I. I think it's something in the water man, it's-it's gotta be in the water.)
Aw, fuck; Chuck's on a killin' spree again
With guillotines for men
I walk around town with a frown on my face
Fuck the whole world, fixin' to catch a murder case
The murder rate
May increase if you're caught up in the world
While it's dyin', I guarantee you're fryin', 'cause I am
On the verge of knockin' muthafuckas out for no reason
Once I get down there'll be no breathin', it seems when
Muthafuckas wanna calm down, put his palm down
Seems I gots to lay the law down
Now it's on, pow, what you to do? I'm askin' you
Step to face, I'll break your ass in two, bastard you
Rather swim in some fuckin' hot tar
Before you fuck wit' Willie D, 'cause what I got for
Your ass will make ya shit your meal
'Cause it's die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas, still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
(... Real life.)
(Tell me) How many niggas brought they irons tonight? (I did)
(Tell me) How many niggas wanna ride tonight? (I do)
Pick out our victims when the time is right
We get they ass up off the corner 'cause they dyin' tonight
Niggas be all up in my mug
But it's a different story when them muthafuckas coughin' up blood
(When he died, looking in his eyes, glossy as he cried)
I bust another cap in his ass and he died, time is 5
Niggas be shootin' the gif like they for real
But when it jumps, they ain't got no murder skills
So Bill just chops 'em down, watch 'em fall
And cut they ass head to toe, jaw to jaw
But I'ma make your bitch ass holla
'Cause I'ma put a hole in your head
The size of a half a dolla'
(Fuck around and get your cap peeled 'cause this is)
Die muthafucka, die muthafucka (kill)
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
(... We gettin' shit done, you know what I'm sayin'? Geto Boys, 1996. The year 2000 and forever. And the shit don't stop until I say it's over with, muthafucka. Know what I'm sayin'? This is Geto Boys for life.)
"Live and direct"
One little two little three little putos
Tried to jack me they got the boot-o
Taking no shit when push comes to shove
'Cause the niggas showed me no love
Step back punk 'cause I'm a Latino
What I bring you is the hardcore lingo
Funky, but ya don't understand
Now I gotta stand with the Glock in my hand
No scope
And there's no hope
'Cause I'm dishin'
Out my .45 slug and it ain't missin'
Here it comes hissin'
Here it comes hummin' at ya
Now the slug is comin' at ya
One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground 'cause here the slug comes
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
Cuando entro, loonie es el fuerte
Speakin' to the gente
'Cause I'm insane in the mente
Movin' 'em back, click-click goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
It's no fun
When I got to break you off some
Of the psycobeta beatdown, boy you get done
Serio
Here we go
Off for the muchacho
Come if you really want some of the chingazo
Me caso you don't hear this little lazo
Cypress Hill, breaking you off a pedazo
Humming at ya
Don't make me come gatt ya
Punk 'cause I still will be comin' at ya
One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground 'cause here the slug comes
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
When I come in, kickin' with a vengeance
Swift of the engines
Coming like the three little indians
Stompin' around on the ground on the plains
'Cause a nigga like me is goin' insane
In the brain
So I gotta maintain
My direction
What I mighta gained
Without my protection
Not a damn thing
So when I come just bring
That new style, break ya off like a chicken wing
Buckooock!
So you can just suck my cock
Like a fat blunt, stoned is the way of the walk
When I'm peepin'
Checkin' out the punk-ass creepin'
I let the dogs loose then I let the dogs sick 'em
Graaah! Nigga don't make me catch ya
Punk 'cause I still will be comin' at ya
One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground 'cause here the slug comes
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
Now lightning strikes in old
New York
It may be dark but I wanna talk
It might rain, it might snow
Too many things I got to know
If this is spring than it's time to sing
Never mind the l'il birdies wing
Look out, look out, old New York
New York's coming an' New York talks
Hey! Strike! Not once...
Strike! But twice!
Get out your money - peel a slab
Roll some notes an' hail a cab
Drive in church drive in back
Drive down Seventh in a tank
Take in the sights, feel the breeze
See New York's one and only tree
It can be found in Garbage park
But don't inspect it after dark
Strike! New York! Lightning!
Not once but twice.
Accidental hike in the transit strike
Roller skate or ride a bike
Three to a car, Brooklyn Bridge
You won't get far if you're privileged
Graffiti Jack sprays in black
An Englishman can he read it back?
Deli Joe he ought to know
He runs the gang on Pastrami Row
Strike! Lightning strike!
Because glass to glass, street to street
Buildings touch St. Peter's feet
From car to bar, prez to shah
Everything is in the jar
The 4 winds blow 'cause the 4 winds know
Takes a special hustle to make a roll
Honey girl on her feet
I wish everything to make her sweet
Strike! Twice! OK so roll!
From Harlem! Strike one!
Harlem slum to penthouse block
On every door I already knocked
There wasn't anybody that I didn't leave alone
Somebody lying under every stone
Everything that a man could need
In a bag down by my knee
That looks good, this ain't got seeds
Cheaper than booze down in the bowery
Lightning strike! Old New York!
Everything's light! Strike!
Hey ho such a night
I'll see y'all when the lightning strike
A polaroid caught in the act
You're married too and that's a fact
But I won't peek and I won't squeek
Down by the trucks on Christopher Street
It's Cuban Day - Oi Vey
Chinese New Year let's call it a day
Tootsie! Hey Chi man!
That melody is Puerto Rican
Hey Chi man is what he's speaking
An' there's the road down into London Town
Where many cars get broken down
It's the Westway from Ladbroke Grove
Runs down to Old Hounslow
Just thought I'd mention the new extension
That run's down the 59th street intersection
Did you hear the news y'all?
London Town on the Broadway!

Life is a journey, not a mystery
Open your eyes, live what you see
Life is a journey, beautiful and free
Life is a wonder, beautiful and free
Why are you such a stupid asshole? Would you really like to know? Well, remove your clothes and a vet will show you how. You went to school where you were taught to fear and to obey. Be cheerful. Fit in, or someone might think you're weird. Life can be perfect. People can be trusted. Someday I will fall in love in a nice, quiet home of my very own. Free from all pain. Happy and having fun all the time. It never happened, did it?
We got a drug
We're gonna try it out on you
Won't make you die
It'll get you just a little bit sick
Got a head cold, got a chest cold
And it's three days old, going on forever
Make you hazy, make you lazy, drive you crazy
For days and days and days and days and years
Barely got the time now
To stay on the job
Double up the dosage in your water supply
Make you even sicker 'til you're slipping away
Getting all depressed
It's getting all your friends
You can't get it up
For nothing that'll rock the boat
The government flu
The government flu
The government flu
Slip it abroad
Keep a-slowin' down the USSR
But meanwhile
We'll keep an eye on what it's doing to you
Got a head cold, got a chest cold
And it's three days old, going on forever
Make you hazy, make you lazy, drive you crazy
For days and days and days and days and days and days and days and days and days and days and days and days and years
The government flu
The government flu
The government flu
Flu you
I was born in this town
Live here my whole life
Probably come to die in this town
Live here my whole life
Never anything to do in this town
Live here my whole life
Never anything to do in this town
Live here my whole life
Probably learn to die in this town
Live here my whole life
Nothing to do, sit around at home
Sit around at home, stare at the walls
Stare at each other, wait till we die
Stare at each other, wait till we die
Probably come to die in this town
Live here my whole life
There's kerosene around
Something to do
There's kerosene around
She's something to do
There's kerosene around, she's something to do
There's kerosene around, find something to do
There's kerosene around, she's something to do
Kerosene around, set me on fire
Set me on fire, kerosene

Set me on fire, kerosene
Set me on fire
Kerosene around
Something to do

Kerosene around, she's something to do
Jump kerosene, now what do we do?
Never anything to do in this town
Never anything but jump kerosene
Never anything to do in this town
Never anything but jump kerosene
Set me on fire, kerosene
Set me on fire, kerosene
Set me on fire, kerosene
Set me on fire, kerosene

I don't need religion
God bless no one
Me and my own opinions
Are written by me
You surrender
Under mass hypnosis
Bound to illusions
Produced by your god
Who is humane
Real alive no god
I see your blindness
Erase your identity
Your mind is hollow
Carved to inability
I know to be
Loyal to myself
My integrity leaves myself
Alone in peace with me
God
There's no god
Life is a trap
Unlock your mind
Trust in yourself
Wake from the grip of the tongue
You've been choked oppressed
God owns god cheats god lies
God hates god kills god slays
The pressure on humanity
Has risen beyond control
We are leading evolution
Into termination
The sense of hate
Inbreeding scars to innocence
Genetic prejudice a
Selfdestructive line in pain
Why this reality
Life poured into inanity
This must be the place, I can tell by your glare
I wouldn't touch you on a dare
Seven months to June, and even then, so what?
My mouth is open, my book is shut
My air guitar is out of tune
My stupid hair is so '82 to you
At least I don't fit in
Corner me in, in chemistry
It's all just simple math to me
Call me your names and make them stick
I'll laugh until I am sick
Glad that that's all through, got better friends than you
Just can't remember where I left them
I'll see you all in class, but not if I ditch first
Expect the best, accept the worst
Walk until your blush subsides
Drink beneath the 405 in the ivy
And think about that girl
Two grades below, she pierced her nose
Way before it was cool
Some older guy with a motorbike
Picks her up after school
This school's a living hell
I work and don't get paid
I smoke a lot but can't get laid
Sit and stare, it's all we do
All my friends are broken, too
We're just waiting, waiting to begin
Corner me in, in chemistry
It's all just simple math to me
Call me your names and make them stick
I'll laugh until I am sick
My hell
Another day in life
Which way will I go?
Will I pick suicide?
How do I say no?
The demons are calling me
"Just one more line"
Voices echoing in my head
These thoughts aren't mine
Chop it
Snort it
The kid?
Ignore it
Life sucks - I'm over it
Save me from myself
Can't quit - I tried it
Your love?
Denied it
Can't fake it - I hate it - please help me
God
Save me from myself
I'm begging you
God
Save me from my hell
Chilling in my own gutter
I've sunk so low
I want to be a good father, but
Here the voices go
Chop it
Snort it
The kid?
Ignore it
Life sucks - I'm over it
Save me from myself
Can't quit - I tried it
Your love?
Denied it
Can't fake it - I hate it - please help me
God
Save me from myself
I'm begging you
God
Save me from my hell
(Save me, save me, from my, myself)
(Save me, save me, from my, my hell)
Wake up
Wasted
Get up
Wasted
Go out
Wasted
Come home
So wasted
Play shows
Wasted
Pimp hoes
Wasted
Life blows - I'm wasted
No more living wasted!
Drug use - I kicked it
Abuse - I kicked it
I'm through - I kicked it - I won't kill myself
Depression - I kicked it
Suicide - I kicked it
Telling lies - I kicked it - I won't kill myself
Father!
Thank You
Father!
I live for You now!
Oh my God - I live for You now
Oh my God - I live for You now
God
Save me from myself
I'm begging You
God
Save me from my hell
I can't terrorize
I see terror in your eyes
As we go up, we go down
I can't socialize
I'll be institutionalized
As we go up, we go down
And see the truth, yeah
Is just a lie, oh
And see the truth, yeah
Is just a lie, oh
I speak in monotone
"Leave my fucking life alone."
As we go up, we go down
As we go up, we go down (And see the truth, yeah)
As we go up, we go down (Is just a lie)
As we go up, we go down (And see the truth, yeah)
As we go up, we go down (Is just a lie)
As we go up, we go down (And see the truth, yeah)
As we go up, we go down (Is just a lie)
As we go up, we go down (And see the truth, yeah)
Parallel crossing lines
I don't want to fall behind
Is it too much to cope
Not running down an empty hole
New brigade
Will never fade
It grows and grows
Could never end
It's within me
It's within you
It's within me and you
Parallel crossing lines
I don't want to fall behind
Total bliss must be peace
Running through inside your knees
New brigade
Will never fade
It grows and grows
Could never end
It's within me
It's within you
It's within me and you
This is a blood path
Betrayal is a sin
Pointlessness in surroundings
Cannot ruin things
Can you keep a promise
Alliance is our home
We'll stay together
In brotherhood it shows
Working for the devil
You'll have to pay his tax
That means going to see him
Down among the racks
You don't believe in him
But he can wait for you.
You do his work so fine
He'll remember you
Worried for my friend
As he shows me round the flat
Where I don't wanna find him
His lips an' eyelids black
He don't believe my speech
That lines can and should be drawn
Lke if he had a shotgun
The barrels would be sawn
Swallowed by the river
Swollen by the rains
That leakin' ol' computer
Of fingerprints and names
Swimming in the river
That floods the neighborhood
I would call to you
But it would do no good
Voting for the law
That's the general occupation
First comes the public safety
Second comes the nation
You won't believe me now
But there's been some illumination
The wisest cops have realized
They fucked the operation
Cooking up the books
A respected occupation
The anchor and foundation of multi-corporations
They don't believe in crime
They don't know that it exists
But to understand
What's right and wrong
The lawyers work in shifts
'N speaking of the devil
He ain't been seen for years
'Cept every 20 mins
He zooms between me ears
I don't believe in books
But I read all the time
For ciphers to the riddles
An' reasons to the rhymes
I am not so upset about my horrible self
But why don't you go upset yourself
Hey here's the mirror see your stupid face
What a disgrace man and you know it's true
Cretin family Cretin family Cretin family Everyone's against me
Cretin family Cretin family Cretin family Oi-Oi-Oi-Oi
Don't stare at me it's freakin' me out
Look what's happening now it's all your fault
You can't do nothin' absolutely nothing' o.k.
Why don't you get a hoola hoop and do the cretin hop and
Cretin family Cretin family Cretin family Everyone's against me
Cretin family Cretin family Cretin family Oi-Oi-Oi-Oi
I'm never wrong don't tell me what to do
Here's a little curse it's from me to you
It's nothin' gonna happen nothin' ever will
You'll be miserable every day your luck will always be bad
Cretin family Cretin family Cretin family Everyone's against me
Cretin family Cretin family Cretin family Oi-Oi-Oi-Oi
Cretin family Cretin family Cretin family Everyone's against me
Cretin family Cretin family Cretin family Oi-Oi-Oi-Oi
All right!
I left with shaking hands, looking for danger
Cheap tales of modern love, in bed with strangers
And there is no warning, I'm not ignoring
Cut glass on my callused feet,
'Cause I'd walk through miles of makeshift mud
Motherfucker, I want your blood!
I got the hands of history's stranglers
And the midnight sky reflects off my skin
I got the face of a million strangers
You're never gonna see me closing in
Yeah, while you're sleeping!
No need for safe return, is no need for your concern
There is no warning, I'm not ignoring
I follow you across the county lines
Where these beads of sweat feel like a flood
You motherfucker, I want your blood!
I got the hands of history's stranglers
And the midnight sky reflects off my skin
I got the face of a million strangers
You're never gonna see me closing in
You're never gonna see me closing in
While you're sleeping!
Breaking through your window!
Stabbing through your ribcage!
When I am queen I will insist with perfect scars upon my wrists
That everything you once held dear is taken away from you
When I am queen sweet girlscout's face and not a one will fall from grace
If all their hearts I could replace, but until then I'll have to...
Drown drown drown myself
Drown drown drown myself
Drown drown drown myself
Drown...
When I am queen on royal thrown made out of parts of broken bones
Of all the devils I have known that suck the angels dry
When I am queen I'll have my way I'll make it drowning dollie day
And all the tears that we have cried we'll suck back in our eyes
Drown drown drown myself
Drown drown drown myself
Drown drown drown myself
Drown...
Drown drown drown myself
Drown drown drown myself
Drown drown drown myself
Drown...
Hush my baby hush my baby
Hush my baby go to sleep
Hush my baby hush my baby
Hush my baby I'll make you bleed
When I am queen I will not wait my body type will still be great
I will not leave it up to fate because I hate you too
When I am queen they all will see the patron saint of self-injury
The glitter sores will heal themselves I'll play the part of someone else
Drown drown drown myself
Drown drown drown myself
Drown drown drown myself
Drown...
Drown drown drown myself
Drown drown drown myself
Drown drown drown myself
Drown...
And now we proudly present
Songs perverse and songs of lament
A couple hymns of confession
And songs that recognize our sick obsessions
Sing along, I'm on the ugly organ again
Sing along, I'm on the ugly organ, so let's begin
There's no use to keep a secret
Everything I hide ends up in lyrics
So read on, accuse me when you're done
If it sounds like I did you wrong
Whoa-oh
Our Father who art in Heaven
Save me from the wreck I'm about to drown in
Didn't I learn anything
Counting out my sins on rosary beads?
The reverend plays on the ugly organ, oh-oh
He spews out his sweet and salty sermon on the audience
So why do I think I'm any different?
I've been making money off of my indifference
We all pass the hat around
This is my body, this is the blood I found
On my hands after I wrote this album
Play it off as stigmata for crossover fans
Some red handed sleight of hand
Whoa-oh
Whoa
Yeah
Whoa-whoa-whoa
I'm not a good friend, I'm not a friend at all
It's never resolved, I'm nervous when you call
My words are limp, and my mind is dry
I try to be polite, but I feel like I'm stuck for life
I follow my heart, it leads me far from you
No matter how close we are, I'm far, far away
I have too much now to fill my day today
I'm not a good friend, I'm not a friend at all
I don't need obligations to our crippled conversations
I'd never tell you, it's something you should know
I'm not a friend at all, oh, please let me go
Somehow I don't trust you
I don't trust myself
And I may never forgive you
'Cause I can't forgive myself
Somehow I don't trust you
I don't trust myself
And I may never forgive you
'Cause I can't forgive myself
Don't break my stride
Don't break my stride
Don't break my stride
Don't break my stride
I realize I'm dead, I'm fucked in the head
I'm not living without you
My life is a game, my life is a shame
I'm not living without you...
This heart is a joke, & my life has been choked,
And I'm not living without you
My life's alone, (x2), I'm not living without you...
You're bleeding me (x3)
You're bleeding... (repeat x3)...
You're bleeding me (x3)
(Verse 1] / [Verse 2 (alt))
-(Alt: "This song is a joke, & my life's a joke")-
You've, you've taken all from me
What I have to see, what I cannot be, inside you
My love, (my God), my love
-(What's this, what's this?)- ...I can't live (x3)
(Verse 1] / [Verse 2 (alt))
...[Chorus] ...You!
Veins are a racetrack for fuel that I need
Life on the edge is the bread which I feed
Standing alone, open for all to see
My tunnel vision for life, it drives me
Focus in closer
Releasing the fear
White-knuckle blackout, adrenaline rush
Wide-eyed and red-faces, my skin hot and flushed
The hair stands up down the backside of my neck
Blood's beginning to boil the beads of sweat
Fear has its place in the scars that I bear
Deep in the mine, behind everything shared
Fixate my sickness as long as there's air
Headstrong I'll forcibly change what was there
By focusing closer
Releasing the fear
White-knuckle blackout, adrenaline rush
Wide-eyed and red-faces, my skin hot and flushed
The hair stands up down the backside of my neck
Blood's beginning to boil
These beads of sweat I'll dry, out of my eyes
And blacken everything except the goal out
Adrenaline is my fuel when I've obstacle to climb
Adrenaline is the lubrication, focusing my mind
Adrenaline is telling me when someone's thinking they're too cool
To raise my middle fingers up and say "fuck you"
Adrenaline is fueling my mint to focus my climb
Reaction evoked at the challenge provoked out of you
Adrenaline is fire to fuel
You wanna fire my fuel?
I'll fire back a fuck you!
Neon black tanks grope the skyline.
Neon black cocks rot into poison wine.
Neon black flowers on the mass grave.
Neon black corpses, stacked, eclipse the horizon.
Neon black whip, war gang hiss;
While Devastator sips from the crystal chalice.
Neon black lemonade drip drips from his grin crammed with cool charm,
Culture and opulence.
The bayonets clamor on all night, hemming scars into the hillside.
Devastator sleeps under satin sheets.
"Death campaigns are a fucking gold mine."
And all the swine at the cabaret lick their lips as they clap along.
Devastator, in a negligee, does a strip tease while he sings this song:
"Everybody needs a little Devastation!"
Neon black dirt in the garden.
All the roses blossom into skulls this season.
Neon black branches hanging from the trees.
Every limb is empty, robbed of pleasant memories.
The fields are throbbing fresh cut bruises.
Devastator violates with dirty fingers.
Neon black flames cook the calm air.
The party's over, what was your favorite gift?
Neon black future charging like a bull with a funeral bouqet ready to explode.
I'm hypnotized by rituals
Now that I am on my own
Tranquilized like an animal
All because I lost control
Are you tuning into our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter the illuminated
Control the audience
The weight of the world has dragged you down
And took with it what you've earned
Communication's lost to the radio
Burning all your bridges down
I may never be quite satisfied
But that's the only way I know
I am overcome with sympathy
For your, for your pathetic soul
Are you tuning into our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter the illuminated
Control the audience
Are you tuning into our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter the illuminated
Control the audience
Breathe in the air while you still can
Take all that you have while you still can
Sleep all night while you still can
Breathe
Are you tuning into our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter the illuminated
Control the audience
Are you tuning into our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter the illuminated
Control the audience
No man abandon his post. A gatecrasher has called us to arms. Take up your torch.
I want this ship cleaner than a hospital ward. A radical has polluted our ranks.
Slouch into position men, this is a war. Set the traps.
We'll have that criminal's head marched through the streets on a stick. 
Someone will pay for this.
We'll squeeze his goddamn brains out.
Sleep with one knife open. You can't outthink us, we've been out of thoughts for a while.
The warrior with the deadliest weapon is the one without an instruction manual for his gun.
This is a union of dunces and we are the new global menace.
Stalking the land, gnashing dull teeth, tapping our feet, 
Sighing and humming and watching the clock.
That's what you get for fucking with us.
When we find you we will skin you alive, we'll pluck out your eyes
And the cannons will roar as we march to the capitol, dragging your hide.
Drooling polished jackboot monsters, tracking the scent of a sleeping child.
Your composure gave you away, next time it's best to cry havoc.
Keep marching, the bridge is ours. They're coming to get me. They're coming to take me away.
I'll never make love in this town again. 
Everyone on the dance floor is doomed. Hit the ground. Shut your mouth.
The prisoners have laid waste to the pulpit. 
You're in for it now. Are these helicopters for me?
Have I been appointed to speak? 
Then I'm going to Hell, and I'm taking the renaissance with me.
Wild, wild
I go wild, 'cause you break me open
Wild 'cause you left me here
I go wild 'cause your promises are broken
Wild because the chips are down
Wild because there isn't anybody else around
Wild when the waves start to break
And God knows they're breaking in me now
I go wild because it doesn't make sense
For me to cry out in my own defense
And wild because I would do anything
To tear you off your precious fence
So this is what it's like living in limbo
First I'm high, then I'm so low
I go wild 'cause you break me open
Wild 'cause you left me here
I go wild 'cause your promises are broken
Wild when I know you're near
I go wild
I go wild...
Tell me what you've come here for
Moving like a hunter through my back door
Leaving the perfume of all you adore
To die nameless on my floor
Yeah, well we both know that you don't play fair
I guess you really think that you'd get me there
Let's be honest, perhaps it's all right
It's too much for even you to bear
You've got some nerve to come back here
You're not the only one who can smell fear
I go wild 'cause you break me open
Wild 'cause you left me here
I go wild 'cause your promises are broken
Wild, don't you get it dear
You're not the only one who runs on instincts
No, I got instincts of my own
You've got a lot of nerve to come back
Plan your attack and I am still waiting
Did you want something?
You wrote the rules to try and contain me
You broke them now, you'll haven't tamed me
And I'm wild
I go wild
Tell me what you've come here for
What is it you adore, won't you tell me?
What would you cry for?
Swallow your pride for?
What would you, oh, go wild for?
You've got a lot of nerve to come back here
Speak up now, darling, I have been waiting
I go wild 'cause you break me open
Wild 'cause you left me here
I go wild 'cause your promises are broken
Wild, don't you get it dear?
You're not the only one who runs on instincts
No, I got instincts of my own
You got a lot of nerve to come back
Plan your attack, and I am still waiting
Did you want something?
You wrote the rules to try and contain me
You broke them now, you haven't tamed me
And I'm wild...
Oh, oh, oh...
Wild...
Tell me what you've come for...
I go wild...
Like a hunter...
Tell me what you've come for...
(Come back here)
La da da da da da
Like a hunter...
Communication is not just words.
Communication is architecture.
Because of course it is quite obvious
That a house which would be built without the sense,
Without that desire for communication
Would not look the way your house looks today.
Left with images of you pouring from my eyes:
You young, you here, day dawning, eyes wide.
Just images, images
All that's left
All that I can find
Like water
From a cactus
In the desert of my mind.
Little to big: o' brother, you leave me like blood from my veins.
Big to little: o' brother, you leave me like blood from my veins.
In a room that holds you
Like a guilt-ridden paralyzing cell:
No calls
No mail
No visitors for you when you're in hell
Forced hellos
Rushed goodbye's
And best wishes for you in the meantime
My face seen as often as god's
Can let guilt have its way of owning you
Like a dog.
May to march
March to may
The days fall with the promises I make
Like water
From a faucet
Into the sink of your faith
Little to big: o' brother, you leave me like blood from my veins.
Big to little: o' brother, you leave me like blood from my veins.
We always seem to fall with only words to hold
We always seem to fall with only photos to hold
We always seem to fall with only memories to hold
We always seem to fall without family to hold.
Take a souvenir and stop your staring
Just 'cause I'm screaming
Don't mean I'm sharing
Can't keep my mouth shut
If you keep that dress on
You can't negotiate
Not with me this time
You go so low
Your faggot rainbow
Your Nazi Halo
Won't save you this time
Bring your IQ and try to understand
Just 'cause I'm listening
Don't mean we're still friends
Can't fix my problem
You crossed a thin line
You can't just work it out
Not with me this time
You go so low
Your faggot rainbow
Your junkie ego
Won't save you this time
You go so low
Your tragic disco
Your Nazi Halo
Won't save you this time
Time, time, time, time
You're so predictable no shadow of doubt
When you are suffering know who sold you out
Fuck your opinions
Fuck your lack of spine
When you are miserable
Know that I'm just fine
You go solo
Your faggot rainbow
Your junkie ego
Won't save you this time
You go solo
Your tragic disco
Your Nazi Halo
Won't save you this time
One more charlatan goes mute
Safe in these halls discreetly
I hold out for the rare when the silence is golden
Beg to join me here
Too late (too late...) now to be
Self redeemed for all of these dreams that you've wound tightly
Remain enthralled as breathing stalls the course of your mind
And join the line to march in time right back with your flock
Hollow minds stalk rope-less gallows in turn to idle on immersed
Where eager eyes and sameness strangles concern and fashion murders worth
Hey you there on the outside
You there on the fault line
Will you save us from emotion?
Will you save us from the cold tide?
Fuck you, you fool
With your hand me down views
And your Valium counterpoint bullshit excuse
You wouldn't have a word
If I hadn't said it first
So cup your little seed and
Beg beggar beg
Beg until you cannot speak
I hold out for the rare when the silence is golden
Beg to join me here or stay where you stand there to deny all your faults and beg to join me here
Peace now fools to trace your muse beyond the failing hand
("Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!")
When you left the door was
(Slamming)
You paused in the doorway
(Slamming)
As though a thought stole you away
(Slamming)
I watched the world pull you away
(Slamming)
So I run into the hall

"Let me in"
Woman let me in
Let me bring in the memories
Woman let me in
Let me bring in the Devil Dreams
I will not let you in
Don't you bring back the reveries
I turn into a bird
Carry further than the word is heard
Woman let me in
I turn into the wind
I blow you a cold kiss
Stronger than the song's hit
I will not let you in
I face towards the wind
I change into the Mule
"I change into the Mule"
"Let me in"
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw! 
Hee-haw-hee-haw-hee-haw-hee-haw
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
If there's a thing that I can't explain
Is why the world has to have so much pain
With all the ways of communicating
We can't get in touch with who we're hating
And no, we can't get in touch with who we're hating
So turn on (turn on), turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on) the news
Turn on (turn on), turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on) the news
I hear it every day on the radio
Somebody shoots a guy he don't even know
Airplanes falling out of the sky
A baby is born and another one dies
Highways fill with refugees now
Doctors finding out about disease
With all this uptight pushing and shoving
Keeps us away from who we're loving
It keeps us away from who we should be loving
So turn on (turn on), turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on) the news
Turn on (turn on), turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on) the news
(Turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on)
(Turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on)
Turn on (turn on) the news
Turn on (turn on), turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on) the news
Turn on (turn on), turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on) the news
Yeah, turn on (turn on), turn it on (turn on)
Turn it on (turn on) on the news
Turn on (turn on), turn it on (turn on)
Turn it on (turn on) the news
You got to turn it on, got it turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on
Turn it on
You, I trusted your intentions
The trust you took advantage of
Now you are sitting in the hole
That you dug around yourself
You lie so much you think it's true
And you know what the truth is.
How does someone get to be like you,
The king of all excuses?
Is she your partner in
Deception and caught inside the web you have spun
Did you forget you have a family,
The damage you have done?
You lie so much you think it's true
And you know what the truth is.
How does someone get to be like you,
The king of all excuses?
I trusted you
I trusted in you
This time you're gonna get it
All the things you've done coming back to you
This time you're gonna feel it
Your conscience slowly suffocating you
In time you will regret it
Say goodbye to all the things you've gotten used to
Life will find a way to bring this karma to you
Life will find a way to bring this karma to you
You lie so much you think it's true
And you know what the truth is.
How does someone get to be like you,
The king of all excuses?
Everything must come full circle
It kills me that I feel this hurtful
I wonder what your children think of you
The king of all excuses.
I want to go, I want to get out
All guns are loaded and have gone off now
I'm channeling seventeen dead revolutions
That have long gave up the ghost
I don't wanna
No, I don't wanna
One drink of water and I'm
The space between the dime and dollar
The space between the city and the suburb
One kid took another kid
Pumped him full of holes just to see a new horizon
I don't wanna
No, I don't wanna
One drink of water and I'm drowning in it
Not alright
Downed city
Downed city
Not alright
Two and two
Sawed in two
Two and two
Two and two
Sawed in two
Two and two
The city is
A city, city's
City, city's
A silly dream
City is
City is
City, city's
You know
I wanna tell you something
I wanna tell you something
You know what?
I don't give a damn about my reputation
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a damn about my reputation
You know what else?
I don't give a shit! I don't give a shit!
I don't give a shit! I don't give a shit!
(I don't give a damn about my reputation)
I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a damn about my reputation
I don't give a shit! I don't give a shit!
I don't give a shit! I don't give a shit!
I don't give a shit! I don't give a shit!
I don't give a shit!
I don't give a damn about my reputation
Fuck, shit
Fuck, shit
Fuck, shit
Fuck, shit
I don't give damn, I don't give damn
I don't give damn, I don't give damn
I... Don't... Give... A... Damn...
I got empty point to make
It's about a faith
An empty point of view
It's stinky through and through
So you think you've got some problems?
So you think you've got it bad?
Good boy
Gone bad
So sorry
So sad
Makes you wonder if you can
It takes you, puts you in a can
One thing I'm gonna do
Something you don't want to view
(X2) This is mine
This is my world...
I got a fresh opinion now
I can't tell you how
I think it's best just to take it and go under
Oh take some
Swallow you can't miss
Let's you 
Spend some time in bliss
Oh come on down X2
Oh welcome
This is my world
This is mine
This is my world
This is all mine
Oh it's all mine
I'm not takin' no chance tonight
I'm gonna pack me a gat tonight
Now I'm gonna sell me some sacks tonight
And if it all goes well and I'm stacked tonight
We can all kick back and we can laugh tonight
You're off track tonight, and if you snooze you lose
You slept, we crept, you're being broke and bruised
That's the life I choose guns, drugs, and booze
And we can get down right here in the street
You choose to live on your knees, I'd rather die on my feet
Sheila is a mess-o
She comes from majesto
And you confessed oh
I don't want to let go
She will do her best though
Death to confession
Everything's ok
If she goes and says so
She's gonna load 'em up
Tie it up, now boot it up
Shoot 'em up, suit 'em up
Cigarette now smoke it up
I got my cuda up
Cigarette now smoke it up
She's not my sister
I love to watch you tear it up
And we can get down right here in the street
You choose to live on your knees, I'd rather die on my feet
Instrumental
We came here to slit your throats
You came here to sniff some coke
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh
When they started to holler
I thought about how a couple dollars in my pocket
Could've doubled as a power
Taller than most, but never tower over
I don't know if I could trust or if I could sits on my shoulder (hell no)
I waste time by talking to the drama
The world was mine but gave it to my baby's mama
It goes one for the Cuervo, two for the lime
Spill that girl and get that from behind
Bobshow Murderous, insane verbalist
Lead protests, kill women and children
Feminine, weak type, ho with a leash
Beat a brotha down in the middle of the street
With police watchin, full of various toxins
Sicker than a slave when he's boxed in
I bring Glocks in, C4 with the clocks in
To watch it function and bubble out your lunch
We've been listenin to the vermin, squirmin'
Tryin' to find a way to get the words in
Twisted space through a missile at the middle of existence
Missed it and hit its face
That's my place, give it back
Didn't react, too busy choking on the fat
Follow for now, swallow this spit
You velvet you get ripped
Gift of gab, this mic gets grabbed
Life gets dragged like racist lipstick on men's faces
Complacent as a passive racist
Pathless makeshift, glass knife
Aim for the face lift
I wanna break shit, run up and take shit
I can't take it, runnin a space ship
Escapism, great livin'
(Yo, man, how you doin' man?
I'm chill I'm chill
You lookin' like you doin pretty good, man
Nah I ain't doin' that well actually
I was wonderin' if I could...borrow a dollar
Nah you can't borrow shit
We came here to slit your throats
You came here to sniff some coke
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh
Can I run up in the settlement
Should I change you like the government
Burn rhymes like sniffin' on Doublemint
Make troubles then I blow off suckers then
Bourgeoisie brothers talk about sufferin'
Burn rubber in a silver DeLorean
We aim to win, made to end
Fraudulent styles but you play em again
The face card, mimic of an action-figure
Embedded in the trash can
Last stand on an ocean of sweat
On a path to the sun, how close can you get?
Must be high off the cost of livin'
The life of rhythm, get lost in the vision
Toss that fish in a lake of snakes
Self and Slug came and caught the brakes
Hell, been through it, jail - seen
Melanin brothers like chalk on pale
It's all good from time to pale ale
Had 50 G's sent straight in the mail
I keep that on stock for all hard rocks
We camouflaged stone cold
Don't stop cause your songs on
You could crip walk before gettin' laid straight on a futon
I got screws gone, members of my crew gone
Bustin' off in the center til the roofs gone
I'm too strong, dealing with snakes on the regular
Take 10 shots to the jugular
Come on, order the special, I dare ya
Get served that riddle that kills your character
Cuttin' at the beams with a hacksaw, on a camel's back
Killin' yak through the last straw
I'm glad ya'll made it
Now let's see how far we can take it
Already heard that joke about how shit floats
Now get off the mic and get off the coke
We came here to slit your throats
You came here to sniff some coke
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh
We came here to slit your throats
You came here to sniff some coke
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh
Tearing out all these open pages, 
Women and kids of all ages, 
Millions of men with blank faces, 
Italicised lies, headlines, bold type 
Living lost just like deer in headlights, 
Terrified, blind, and wait to die, 
I wonder when they'll come get me, 
I wonder when they'll come get me: 
We want to, have to, need to: 
And we'll tell you when they're hungry again,

Ticket please, thanks, walk through the door
Into the Halls Of Illusions, visit yours
And see what coulda and shoulda and woulda been real
But you had to fuck up tha whole deal
"Lets take a walk down the hallway
It's a long way it, it takes all day!"
And when you get to tha end, you'll find a chair
With straps and chains, we slap you in there
Lock you down tight so you can't move a thread
And pull your eyelids up over your head
'Cause you're about to witness an illusionary dream
It's just to bad it ain't what it seems
You walk in and see two kids on the floor
They playin' Nintendo and he's got tha high score
And sittin' behind them chillin' in a chair
Is your wife, when ya look, oh, you ain't there
It's some other man in the hand in hand
Now she looks so happy you don't understand
See this is an illusion, it never came true
All because of you!
Back to reality and what you're about
Your wife can't smile 'cause ya knocked her teeth out
And she can't see straight from gettin' hit
'Cause you're a fat fuckin' drunk piece of shit
But it's all good here, come have a beer
I'll break the top off it and shove it in ya ear
And you're death comes wicked painful and slow
At tha hands of MILENKO!
Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into
Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone

Look who's next it's Mr. Clark
The dirty old man from the trailer park
You got your ticket? Thanks take your coat off
And later on, why not, I'll rip your throat off
"Lets take a walk down the hallway
It's a long way it, it takes all day"
And when you get to the end you'll find a chair
You see all the blood, yeah your boy was just here
We get all different kind of people comin' through
Richies, chickens and bitches just like you
In the Halls everybody gets a turn
To sit and witness your illusion before you burn
What do we have here, oh yeah, no way
It looks like your kids and they okay
Your daughter's chillin' up in college top grade
And your son's a fuckin' doctor, phat paid
They got families and kids and it's all good
They even coach little league in the neighborhood
Is this true have ya really seen tha holy ghost?
Nah, bitch, not even close!
Back to reality your son's on crack
And your daughter's got nut stains on her back
And they both fuckin' smell like shit
And live in the gutter and sell crack to each other
When they were kids you'd beat 'em and leave 'em home
And even whip 'em with the cord on the telephone
And that reminds me man hey ya gotta call
Watch your step to Hell... it's a long fall!
Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into
Ah, it's time to pack up and move to the next town
But we forgot Mr. Bigot, okay, dig it
We can't show you an illusion 'cause we're all packed
But I'll still cut ya neck out, how's that?
Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into
Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into
Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into
Great Milenko, wave your wand
Don't look now, your life is gone
This is all because of you
What you got yourself into
Rape is just cause for murdering
Waste life
Die bastard, die bastard, burn
Rape gives strength to weakness
Lies prone, cold and alone
He says
I want you for your body
I want you for your body
I want you for your body
I want you for your body
Body, body, body, body, body
Here now alone with all who love her
Now feel this come down on you
You fucking pig, now you die
I want you for your body
I want you for your body
I want you for your body
I want to see you fucking dead
Silence is golden
Ignorance bliss
Better off not asking
What you'd rather forget
And as the vice-grip choke holds
All of our freedoms are meeting their end
And for the wars they wage
Numberless troops lie wounded or dead
The beatings will continue
Until morale improves
Free your hate
Crusade in the days of rage
Perilous folly
Rise up against your fate
Free your hate
Crusade in the days of rage
Tireless cunning
Stampede and break your chains
Terror at gunpoint
Torture at large
Enemy combatant
Labeled a threat
Without trial or charge
Repetition of history
Messenger, prophet
Martyr for god
All for once and for all
Reclaim your power
The tyrant must fall
The beatings will continue
Until morale improves
Free your hate
Crusade in the days of rage
Perilous folly
Rise up against your fate
Free your hate
Crusade in the days of rage
Tireless cunning
Stampede and break your chains
"Violence in America today is not cause for the war
It's not cause for a repression
There is no romantic ideal involved
Let's recognize these people for what they are
They're the same thugs and hoodlums
That have always plagued the good people."
Free your hate
In the days of rage
Free your hate
In the days of rage
Free your hate
Free your hate
Free your hate
In the days of rage
In the days of rage
In the days of rage
In the days of rage
In the days of rage
Last night I had a little altercation
They wobbled menacingly
Beneath the yellow street light it became a situation
Well, they wanted my brand-new phone with all the pictures of the kids and the wife
A struggle ensued and then fat children took my life
Fat children took my life
Fat children took my life
Fat children took my life
Well, some passers-by took me to the station
The police force was elsewhere,
Putting bullets in some guy's head for no particular reason
So I died in the back of the cab
But I'll be back to haunt them
This thing does not end here
My spirit walks the streets of Tottenham
Singing:
Fat children took my life
Fat children took my life
Fat children took my life
Oh, the parents are the problem
Giving birth to maggots without the sense to become flies
So pander to your pampered little princess
Of such enormous size
I'm not awake, but I'm not dead
The drugs are late
Lost my money again
They never gave you anything
You'd think you'd get the fucking point
I'll live until I'm fucking killed
I see the point, but I can't find a way to get through this fucking men-tal hell
I'm not all right, but I'm OK
I'm not all right, but I'm OK
All hail the pessimists
All hail the anarchists
All hail the rest that never gave a motherfucking shit
It's killing season
It's time to celebrate
What better way than rid the world of all the walking waste?
Wanna see it?
I'll show you something-
A middle finger with a barrel and it's fucking cocked
I got a new way-
So you can fuck yourself
Kill the motherfucker
All that I think about, yeah
I'm not all right, but I'm OK
I'm not all right, but I'm OK
Sometimes you gotta voice your opinions or you're better off dead
You'll lose your fucking mind
Sometimes you gotta look at yourself
See the world inside out and scream it out loud
Kill that motherfucker...
Kill that motherfucker...
Kill that motherfucker...
And it's all that I think about
Kill that motherfucker...
Kill that motherfucker...
Kill that motherfucker...
'Cause we all need to scream out loud
I'm not all right, but I'm OK
I'm not all right, but I'm OK
I've found the easy way to die
Just educate myself and pretend all I've learned's untrue
And yeah, I know that all I'll lose is you
Have you ever loved something that never seemed to have a face at all?
It just screams out loud, yeah
It always cures the pain that would never leave and causes even more...
It just screams out loud
But never goes away, yeah
Fuck!
Kill that motherfucker...
Kill that motherfucker...
Kill that motherfucker...
And it's all that I think about
Kill that motherfucker...
Kill that motherfucker...
Kill that motherfucker...
Another summer rolls by
And I can't help but feel pain
All those familiar faces
Come back to haunt me again
Whether I hated their guts
Or hardly knew them at all
I always felt far away
Beside them there in the halls
My yearbook keeps me informed
My yearbook keeps me in line
It's an obituary
Gives me a concept of time
We've graduated and grown
From a real world once our own
Yet we have proven them wrong
By dropping off all along
Well you can't say nothin'
If your money ain't right
'Cause that government trash
Will keep me up all night
Some folks work so hard
They nearly break their backs
Don't step on the crack
'Cause you know about that, aw aw aw
21, 21
Nobody knows anything at 21
22, 22
Nobody knows anything at 22
But you're alright, alright
You know you're alright, alright
It's not a secret
Everybody has two sides
Look in the mirror
Starin' back in those eyes
Don't stop thinking
Lookin' out past the fog
I say do what you want
But just leave me alone
Nothing is free
Call the police
They dress to kill
I dress to die, aw ,aw, aw
It's not a secret
Everybody has two sides
Look in the mirror
Starin' back in those eyes
Don't stop thinking
Lookin' out past the fog
I say do what you want
But just leave me alone!
Does anybody see him?
Another set up for the fall
Does anybody hear him?
He's screaming at the same blank wall
Everyone can't be right
But everyone will decide
I'm not afraid of the price I pay
I won't lie down as you walk away
I'm sure you must have seen him
I know you must have heard it all
I know you used to be him
Did anybody care at all?
Everywhere I go I see your face.
And every sound I hear
Is the sound of your voice.
Why are you haunting me?
Why are you haunting me?
Why can't I let you go? Go?
Why are you haunting me?
Why are you haunting me?
Why are you haunting me?
Why are you haunting me?
Everything about me is a lie,
At least it feels that way
When I look in your eyes now.
The truth scares the shit out of me.
Whoever said love is real,
Or love is blood,
Has never felt the way that I feel.
What does it matter?
What's done is done,
And I should get on with my life.
Why are you haunting me?
Why are you haunting me?
Why are you haunting me?
Why are you haunting me?
I don't know what it means
But I can't seem to make myself forget.
Was it something that you said?
Or is it all the guilt inside my head?
Why are you haunting me?
Why are you haunting me?
Why are you haunting me?
Why are you haunting me?
Why are you haunting me?
Why are you haunting me?
(1, 2, 3, GO!)
Hey now everybody
Look who's on TV
Look who just got famous
Don't you know
It
Should have been
(Me)
I'm not really bitter
I'm not really mad
I love to see other people get
Everything I ever
Wanted to have
I don't really care
How big they get
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
Why can't I be cool like them?
I used to have a girlfriend
I treated her so bad
She went out and
Found another lead singer
Maybe she just likes guys in bands
I give up on everything
All my dreams are dead
Maybe I'll get a shotgun and
Try to blow her right out of my head
Everybody says
"How come you ain't made it yet?"
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
Why can't I get my girl back?
I knew you wouldn't understand
(No, no no)
Just what I'm tryin' to do
(No, no no)
'Cause you're not fuckin' me
And I'm so glad
That I'm not fuckin'
You
I know it's my problem
There's nothing I can do
But I don't think there is no reason
I don't think there's no excuse for you
Well I've learned my lesson
I hope you've learned it too
And if they're gonna go and do it to me, well
I guess I'm gonna have to go and do it to you
I don't really care, how much you cry
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
Why can't anything go my way?
(B-Real)
Huh, what you want?

To bleed and die quickly
Here I turn my back here's the knife, for you to stick in me
What you do for me?
Stab me in the back, preney
Over little shit you do, pretty hittin in me
What you done for me?
Robbery, pray the po'
Actin' like it was my homie, just a fuckin' phony
What you see in me?
A weakness so you can damage me
And dis-granite me so you can take advantage (yeah)
What you need to see?
The Nina milli six-a, show ya how I don't give a fuck about you
You talk now, what you need to be?
Runnin' away from the leader
Before you're gettin' warm by my heater
(Chorus: B-Real)
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you, what you
What you want, what you want from me?
(B-Real)
What you want from me?
Money and the record deal
Free tickets to the shows and the free meal
What you got for me?
Besides, or your hang ups and sob stories
The violins play 'em baby
What you want to be?
Everything I am now, but you never worked for it
The live it, you fuckin' gimmick
What you want -- disease?
For me and my homies
Niggas want to act, damn, you don't even know me
What you need to breathe?
To think it over clearly, you can hear me over the speaker
It's best you don't come near me
What you got for me?
Back up and a lot of weight, but now
You hatin' on me, in every single way
What you have with me?
To make me turn the switcher
Funny how money makes a fuckin' little picture
What it's got to be?
You get disconnected over methods you choose
To make yourself get ejected
(Chorus: B-Real)
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you, what you
What you want, what you want from me?

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

What you, what you want?
What you, what you want from me?
(Sen Dog)
What you want from me?
Pictures and the demos
You wanna act funny?
And hear my layo
What you got to see?
I need a little privacy
You don't even know of the shit that drivin' me
What you need from me?
Someone to put your shit on
Never forget what I've done for you
Before you get on
What you have to be?
True to the family
And fuck 'em and feed em
If you ain't understandin me?
What you want to be?
Hard or a pop star
Goin' out and doin' the same shit
That's a love song
What you want from me?
Nothin' but burn riches down, I should grab your jaw
And knock it off the hinges now
What you after me?
Doctors and nurses and hearses
And the worst thing you feelin' the blood curses
What you have to be?
Gone another memory
Remember this if I gotta choose over them or me
I'll choose me motherfucker you understand...
(B-Real)
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me what you want
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
(Chorus: B-Real)
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you, what you
What you want, what you want from me?
Drink deep, it's just a taste
And it might not come this way again
I believe in moments, transparent moments
Moments in grace when you've got to stake your faith
Yeah
Why do I confine
When all I want is release?
I can
It moves outside you, it stays inside you
And it's not something you know that I could, I could prove
Or could chose to be moved
Yes, it's a promise and it's a threat
And it's not something that I'll let you forget
Not just yet, not just yet
Yeah
But why do I chase
When all I want is near?
If it's not the rule then it's always the case
Good intentions get fractured, good intentions get replaced
So close to reach but so hard to hold
The only chance you get is past your control
It's so hard, it's so hard
Yeah
Drink deep, it's just a taste
And it might not come this way again
Time to surrender, yeah sweet surrender
Of all things in time, all things one place
One place
Yeah, uh
It's been two whole years.
Since you and I shared fears.
Two-thirty A.M. talking to sleep inside that diner.
And now in your eyes, I can't find you.
Sorry That I'm taken aback.
But, how I am, you never ask.
And I don't need such sympathy,
But a care would be, so whoa whoa
Nice to have once in awhile.
You mean more to me, than I could ever tell.
So sorry that, I'm taken aback
But I just can't help it.
Small town, we just ride
Holding on to what we have inside.
But now it's never here.
So should I get near?
You and I both know the culprit.
Cause now in your eyes, I can't find you.
Sorry That I'm taken aback.
But, how I am, you never ask.
And I don't need such sympathy,
But a care would be, so whoa whoa
Nice to have once in awhile.
You mean more to me, than I could ever tell.
So sorry that, I'm taken aback
But I just can't help it.
Someday this will go away.
And everything I am, will just leave and stay
And I won't bend, you will understand
It's not everything I am, my dear only friend.
Sorry That I'm taken aback.
But, how I am, you never ask.
And I don't need such sympathy,
But a care would be, so whoa whoa
Nice to have once in awhile.
You mean more to me, than I could ever tell.
So sorry that, I'm taken aback
But I just can't help it.
Oh whoa oh
Oh whoa oh, whoa
Oh whoa oh
Oh whoa oh, whoa
Hey
I heard it from the state
They told me you were never gonna let me get away
And if you tell me fiction, you will never get me back
I had to get away, I had to get away, ay, ay
Hey
You try to compensate
You thinking with your one brain, watch you decapitate
You show me all your letters and I should've confiscated
Put my eyes away, and I had to get away
Talking to ears that have been deaf for as long as I can remember
A self-medicated handicap so I speak to myself
And I try so hard to get his stupid deaf ears to hear
That have become illiterate, I've become dumb
Hey, hey, hey
When I'd come through
You were dark blue
And I saved you
From your darker days
Born to
Take care of you
Oh, I thought so
Baby, it was just a phase
Hey
I heard it from the state
They told me you were never gonna let me get away
And if you tell me fiction, you will never get me back
I had to get away, I had to get away, I had to get away
Hey
You try to compensate
You thinking with your one brain, watch you decapitate
You show me all your letters and I should've confiscated
Put my eyes away, and I had to get away
Shut down by a guy I never wanted to kiss
Not gonna hear this singing of this ringing triumph thing
And I'm chugging along in a train
And I'm heading the wrong way, and I'm a trainwreck
And my heart goes beat, beat, beat to the music of this sad same song
It's quite depressing, there's no fixing to the problem
When you're talking to an idiot
When I'd come through
You were dark blue
And I saved you
From your darker days
Born to
Take care of you
Oh, I thought so
Baby, it was just a phase
Saving
Only made me
Just a dreamer
But I soon found out
That the traintracks
Were behind me
Tried to warn me
Oh, but my ears went out
When I'd come through
You were dark blue
And I saved you
From your darker days
Born to
Take care of you
Oh, I thought so
Baby, it was just a phase
Hey
I heard it from the state
They told me you were never gonna let me get away
And if you tell me fiction, you will never get me back
I had to get away, I had to get away, I had to get away
Hey
You try to compensate
You thinking with your one brain, watch you decapitate
You show me all your letters and I should've confiscated
Put my eyes away, and I had to get away
I'm too worried 'bout what you're doing
Are you worried 'bout what I'm doing too
What ya doin' to me
Why can't you see
I'm too worried bout what you're doing
Are you worried bout what I'm doing too
What ya doing to me
Wanna be free
And who could blame you
I made it so complicated
If I just drain you
Till working it out
Is over rated
But why are we so blind to see
That truth and love
They could overcome
Come -come -come...
I'm too worried 'bout what you're doing
You're not worried 'bout what I'm doing too
What you're doing to me
Wanna be free
I'm too worried 'bout what you're doin' doin'
You're not worried 'bout what I'm doing too
What you're doing to me
Why can't you see
That I can't change you
Nor was that my intention
Please explain
Your earnest words
Are just shucking and jiving
You like to see your thumb on me
Just checking in
To make it begin again
'Gain 'gain 'gain...
And for the last four years of my life I've thought about you pretty much
Every fifteen seconds
Last four years of my life
Pretty much every fifteen seconds
Oh my heart, my heart's gonna break again
Oh my god my god won't forsake again
Oh mercy I want to be taken in
Oh mercy
I'm too worried 'bout what you're doing
You're not worried about what I'm doing too
What you're doing to me
Honey why can't you see
I'll stop worrying 'bout what you're doin' doin'
'Cause you're not worried bout what I'm doing too
And then you will see
What it was like to be me
Oh my heart
I still recall what made me like you
So yes they have said things about you
And yes I see where it's true
Thought you could get all you wanted
By just thinking of yourself
It's not your pretty face that matters
And I think you need some help
So please just leave me the hell alone
Cause now I know this isn't at all right
How much more times
Will I have to tell you
You try to cry but it's just for show you know I know you know
Saying sad things that don't make sense
Can just make you look like a liar
Don't convince me that your right
About some fear I have of heartache
So I'll make you just one promise that I'll never regret this
Take a long look inside cause right now
I'm leaving you
Instrumental
One hoped they'd break the patent when they die cast me in stride.
Just a simple steel specimen, truly empty down inside.
With copper-core wound veins, a pumping cold hydraulic heart,
Bellows cycle air on rhythms, rhythms fixed within my code.
It's easier to bow than keep these knees locked tight
Like the rivets in my skin.
My pulse reverberates through this malleable shell,
With scars from shaping.
My pulse reverberates through this malleable shell,
With scars from breaking shell.
My insides grind their gears.
Abrasive churning, I'm so conductive.
It's always been a task with such low impedance.
My tendons tend to rust with time while wires misplace their currents
So I will flee the factory, and pray you to dismantle me.
It's easier to bow than keep these knees locked tight
Like the rivets in my skin.
My pulse reverberates through this malleable shell,
With scars from shaping.
My pulse reverberates through this malleable shell,
With scars from breaking shell.
Someone find my maker; I'm coming apart at the seams.
I'll cauterize myself back together again.
My pulse reverberates through this malleable shell
My pulse reverberates through this malleable shell
(Ikon the Hologram)
Yo
Enter the eye of the storm
Rappers just battle me for the glory
It gets gory
They shitty like suppositories, that's the end of the story
Bury his body in Missouri
Banish the apparatus of Gladys to crematories
My territory, perimeter of purgatory
Stingy in winches of vicious, malicious inflictions upon your clic
Circulatory
Causing head spasms
Rip through your motherfucking temple like Phantasm
Hologram has 'em and walks through the holy arches
Left you in the forest with your carcass in the harness
Death is upon us
We slam like Adrian Adonis
Swarm of the pure blood like malicious piranhas
Islamic Bombers, no contender is parallel
When I'm on paper, devastator 'em like 7L
So where I dwell, without question rattles the league
Left you in a vessel with severe battle fatigue
Before you leave I insist you listen to more raps
Before I saw cats, making weapons out of your thorax
*Break*
(Jus Allah)
I inhale toxins
Drunk off blood from dead cops and
The watchman, that kill us in this maze we locked in
Side cobra clutch, Only truth can sober us
Wild 'cause we know there's no Jehovah watching over us
Only 10 percent that's controlling us
Try to take our souls from us, while the state patrolling us
Caged in we break barriers, change to new areas
Dodgin' the pits and chariots out the barriers
Jus Allah don't make threats
Leave your fuckin' necks clipped
Had you speakin' the manual alphabet
Seein' me is def not repeated or done twice
I laugh as I cast the first stones at Christ
Joint in ace bands, you move to Graceland and Satan
Mics spray then, bury flesh in wasteland
Infect you
Inject you with the gunpowder pegs
Indent your forehead with hot lead
Whether in the abode of the dead
Or resting in the Zions
Allah stay chasin' dough like wild lions
Unchained tearin' your flesh we unfed
Flyin' through, like birds we takin' your daily bread
The impact
The aftershave
The European cigarettes
The taxi
The alcohol
That lingers on your breath
The lipstick
The street lamp
The woolen overcoat
The front desk
You tell yourself
It isn't over yet
Second best, oh second best
I can learn to live with this
Plus I really need a rest
After all what's wrong with second best?
What's wrong with second best?
The motel
The distances
Cave into kisses cold and wet
Familiar exchanges
Like needle pulling thread
The empty movements
That once were so inspired
Desperate attempts to fan the flame
Without the fire
The mattress creaks beneath
The symphony of misery and cum
Still we lie jerking back and forth
And blurring into one
Second best, oh second best
I can learn to live with this
Plus I really need a rest
After all what's wrong with second best?
What's wrong with second best?
Where did it go?
The one
One big dream we don't give up
Steel-eyed through the pressure drop
Thirst and hunger, workday rhymes
In disastrous times
Build up this family, we draw so close
Outside of the lines, we're still screaming
For the music
The meaning
Meaning what is right
Two thousand other souls burn bright
All in, this entertainment
Break out or be contained in it
Reaction, reaction
Are we all forgetting?
All in, this entertainment
Break out or be contained in it
Reaction, reaction
Are we all forgetting why?
All forgetting why the clothes of the rebel sound
Don't fit
Lost in an instant
We all fall down to build up
This family, we draw so close
Outside of the lines, we're still screaming
For the music
The meaning
Screaming for our rights
Two thousand other souls burn bright tonight
All in, this entertainment
Break out or be contained in it
Reaction, reaction
Are we all forgetting?
I won't take it or leave it
The question's asked, do you still believe it?
Reaction, reaction
Are we all forgetting why?
Where is your courage?
Wasted!
Where is the courage that
Has brought you to this place?
Sold into the fashions of the false heroes' fight
Souls burn bright
Will I drive out in the night
Never come back in a mighty fright
Stay out longer while I can
Picking fossils in the sand
I admire all the games
Another asshole lights the flame
Rusted clotheslines in the sun
Noise control, I've sunken out
With smile the greatest written smile
No one to complain
Written in chrome and gore it's all the same
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
All I ever wanted was a piece to myself
All I ever wanted was a nine to five
People hide what they feel inside
So they'll cover it up till it's grey and dry
A pussy is a piece of skin wrapped in a pocket
All the king's men fell down on their knees
Raised their arms to the leader outside
Praising the devil they said
Hell fuck yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I can't fight it I can't hide
Will you take me over
Little devil run around inside
Will you take me under
I can't breathe if I cannot see
I can't see if I can't breathe
All I ever wanted was an afternoon
A middle class and an open sky
They rushed in the square with the paper alight
They pushed down a statue and spat on its side
A feeling is a piece of skin wrapped in a pocket
All the king's men fell down on their knees
Raised their arms to a leader outside
Praising the devil the said
Hell fuck yeah
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I can't fight it I can't hide
Will you take me over
Little devil run around inside
Will you take me under
I can't breathe if I cannot see
I can't see if I can't breathe
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Fuck Yeah!
Take me down
Take me down
Take me down!

Life used to be life-like
Now it's more like show biz
I wake up in the night
And I don't know where the bathroom is
And I don't know what town I'm in
Or what sky I am under
And I wake up in the darkness and i
Don't have the will anymore to wonder
Everyone has a skeleton
And a closet to keep it in
And you're mine
Every song has a you
A you that the singer sings to
And you're it this time
Baby, you're it this time
When I need to wipe my face
I use the back of my hand
And I like to take up space
Just because I can
And I use my dress
To wipe up my drink
I care less and less
What people think
And you are so lame
You always disappoint me
It's kinda like our running joke
But it's really not funny
I just want you to live up to
The image of you I create
I see you and I'm so unsatisfied
I see you and I dilate
So I'll walk the plank and I'll jump with a smile
If I'm gonna go down
I'm gonna do it with style
And you won't see me surrender
You won't hear me confess
'Cause you've left me with nothing
But I've worked with less
And I learn every room long enough
To make it to the door
And then I hear it click shut behind me
And every key works differently
I forget every time
And the forgetting defines me
That's what defines me
When I say you sucked my brain out
The English translation
Is I am in love with you
And it is no fun
But I don't use words like love
'Cause words like that don't matter
But don't look so offended
You know, you should be flattered
I wake up in the night
In some big hotel bed
My hands grope for the light
My hands grope for my head
The world is my oyster
The road is my home
And I know that I'm better
Off alone
"You are weak, I am strong,
And I've done nothing but lead you on," she said.
Drove around all night
The stop lights were interminable, but I get along all right
As long as I don't have to interact with anyone else
On a meaningful level I'll be fine
'Cause I don't want to marry my convictions
Not right now
Not right now
Not right now
When wicked thoughts come inter alia
You wind up in Centralia, morally,
Looking for a decent cup of coffee,
Trying to meet halfway
It seems like I'm stealing your words,
But really I'm just giving them back to you.
Once again, it's all about me, and pride is not a factor, no
Once again, it's all about me
"You are weak, I am strong,
And I've done nothing but lead you on and on," she said.
Feeling well... into my cups already
(just until my hands are steady)
The spins are setting in
I swear I'll never never feel like myself again
I'd like to go back 10 years
And show you a picture of yourself now;
But I'm afraid that it might kill you then.
You used to be such a loyal friend.
Once again, it's all about me, and pride is not a factor, no
Once again, it's all about me:
Third person in the inner monologue again
It's all about me.
Me, yeah
Me, yeah.
Big bad wolf
Came over to my ranch
Took all my land
Left me with a branch
That's how I feel about the
Loving that I had
That's I know about the girls he had
Bring her to my door now
Bring me that ho
I Put her on the table
And put her in my claw
I'll put her down my jaw
To my belly, to my toe
I'll shit on that ho
And drop her to the floor
Big branch
I'll hit her with the mother fucking branch!
Men are like pearls
They look good with my curls
I string 'em to get the best necklace in the world
In the states of the world
All women wanna lay
But it's man's world so keep him at bay
You can fuck a man, mack a man
Tell 'em that you're gay
Tell him real love ain't on BET
Sex is so cheap, I get it at KFC
When its meaningless why they do R&B
Bring her to my door now
Bring me that ho
I Put her on the table
I And put her in my claw
I'll put her down my jaw
To my belly, to my toe
I'll shit on that ho
And drop her to the floor
Big branch
I'll hit her with the mother fucking branch!
I ate my chips and I washed that plate
Thought about women that take that bait
Men with stamina or money on the plate
Can get a woman thinking her period is late
Thanks to Jesus, I got my own estate
If I let you in, will you run off with my maid?
All men are just so fickle these days
To find a really good one
I keep on getting laid
Bring her to my door now
Bring me that ho
I Put her on the table
And I put her in my claw
I'll put her down in my jaw
To my belly, to my toe
I'll shit on that ho
And drop her to the floor
Spotlights are roaming
The show will begin
I had never thought
But don't give my circus away
I hope it ends before you know me
I've lost it completely
My faith is lost again I'd say
I'm tired of this place and I want to go
Riding my carousel
They can never tell
Riding my carousel
They can never tell
I'm spinning and turning
Always revolving
You should have seen it
Where were you?
I needed a stage
To walk all over you
That's better
I'm throwing my three ring away
And I can hear you say
I'm tired of this place
I'm tired of this place and then I think of
Riding my carousel
They can never tell
Riding my carousel
They can never tell
Spinning, turning
Always revolving
Close all of the doors
Lock me away
I'm happy in here
So let me stay
I'm so tired of this place
I'm tired of this place and then I think of
Riding my carousel
They can never tell
Riding my carousel
They can never tell
Spinning, turning
Always revolving
Spinning, turning
Always revolving
A billionaire chatting with his friends,
They've gotta stop to laugh,
"We've really got those suckers fooled,
We've got 'em trained like rats!"
The riches plot,
Control your thoughts,
To make you blame yourself,
"The rich are rich because they're smarter than me..."
You're taught this is right,
That it's all your fault.
Kill, kill, kill!(x4)
They throw a war like a party saying,
"It's for a moral cause..."
Telling you if you're a patriot that,
"You'd better do what you're told!"
You burn a flag,
You're gonna hang,
Brainwashed nationalism
Makes you a tool.
They're getting rich by selling weapons to both countries,
You never think to question what you're told!
Kill, kill, kill! (x4)
They're gonna give you nothing
They want to take away the little they call something
You know you're being used but still you play along
If you're not complacent,
You're doing something wrong.
One day they'll push too far
That marks the beginning of their end
We'll bring them chasing down till they're all dead, they're all dead,
They're all dead!
The time is growing near... put the trigger to the man
Lets go kill 'em!
The most intense of burning hells
Blasting expectations into smithereens
Never feeling normal, can't accept the truth
Resign myself to hating it, I hate it all 
Can't say that I don't like it
Because the words won't come out right
All I feel is bitter
And it won't make it better
59 times the pain, I could never be like you
59 times the pain, I could never be with you
59 times the pain
Never figured out eating 3 meals a day
When the people sit in their broken-down homes
Look at the photos from different eras gone by
Shows the changes, and I hate them all
Can't say that I don't like it
Because the words won't come out right
All I feel is bitter
And it doesn't make it better
59 times the pain, I could never be like you
59 times the pain, I could never be with you
59 times the pain
Don't want to live with myself
Can't live with what goes on
All I see is the humiliation
I wish it was gone
Can't say that I don't like it
Because the words won't come out right
All I feel is bitter
And it don't make it better
59 times the pain, I could never be like you
59 times the pain, I could never be with you
59 times the pain
59 times the pain, I could never be like you
59 times the pain, I could never be with you
59 times the pain
She'd walk on broken glass for love
She thought burnt skin would please her lover
To keep love alive and lust beside
Kind people should never be treated like...
Empty arms and an aching heart
The love she sought through faltering thought
Table for two, such a sweet delight
Whispers "I love you my darling" tonight
Love bathed her in a bath of bleach
Brush her hair, no-one else will
Don't hurt her anymore, stop now
But salmon pink skinned Mary's still caring...
Empty arms and an aching heart
The love she sought through faltering thought
Table for two, such a sweet delight
Whispers "I love you my darling" tonight
Empty arms and an aching heart
The love she sought through faltering thought
Table for two, such a sweet delight
Whispers "I love you my darling" tonight
Oh Vivica I wish you well
I watch you burn in humid hell
No sleeping pills no old tattoos
Will save you now
He'll never change he's just too vague
He'll never say you're beautiful
Oh Vivica I wish you well I really do, I really do
The apple falls far from the tree
She's rotten and so beautiful
I'd like to keep her here with me
And tell her that she's beautiful
She takes the pills to fall asleep
And dreams that she's invisible
Tormented dreams she stays awake
Recalls when she was capable
Oh Vivica I wish you well
I watch you sit I watch you dwell
No crooked spine no torn-up rag
Will save you now
He'll never change he's not like me
He'll never say you're beautiful
Oh Vivica I wish you well I really do, I really do
The apple falls far from the tree
She's rotten and so beautiful
I'd like to keep her here with me
And tell her that she's beautiful
She takes the pills to fall asleep
And dreams that she's invisible
Tormented dreams she stays awake
Recalls when she was capable
Oh Vivica I wish you well
I'll sit right here I'll never tell
No tender scar no twist of fate
Will save you now
He'll never change he's just not there
He'll never say you're beautiful
Oh Vivica I wish you well I really do, I really do
The apple falls far from the tree
She's rotten and so beautiful
I'd like to keep her here with me
And tell her that she's beautiful
She takes the pills to fall asleep
And dreams that she's invisible
Tormented dreams she stays awake
Recalls when she was capable
She's empty and so beautiful
I'll keep her here with me
The day's reality around the bend 
Pain and misery my only friend 
I raise a toast and I salute the end.
Six feet in the ground is where the living begins
I got to get on with living or get the hell on with dying
Shove a million dollars in my pocket, but there ain't no pacifying me
Anyone can see, what's happening to me
My life's out of reach of my arms, but I'm holding on
I'm living in a dream, and no one hears me scream
I'm breaking at the seams of life, but I'm holding on
I've created a world that is devoid of love
I'm praying to God and up to Heaven above
My heart and my soul have turned to push and shove
It's enough to kill me but it's never enough
I got to get on with living or get the hell on with dying
Shove a million dollars in my pocket, but there ain't no pacifying me
Anyone can see, what's happening to me
My life's out of reach of my arms, but I'm holding on
I'm living in a dream, and no one hears me scream
I'm breaking at the seams of life, but I'm holding on
So please, be honest
What's it mean and what have you done?
Can I just be another risk you're running? Can I?
It's simple, soaked, and always on my mind
I'm dying
We've got these lives to lead
Cut it out, don't think about it
Cut it out, don't think about it
Not now
We'll get through somehow
This is only temporary, no
This is only temporary
Not now, but soon
We'll be living in the future
And please, be honest
What's it mean and what have you done?
Can I just be another risk you're running? Can I?
It's simple, soaked, and always on my mind
I'm dying
We've got these mouths to feed
Food and drink and hand-shake drugs
Food and drink and hand-shake drugs
And we've,
We've got something up our sleeves
No one's gonna see it comin'
No, they won't ever see it coming
Not now, but soon
We'll be living in the future
Please, be honest
What's it mean and what have you done?
Can I just be another risk you're running? now
What's it mean and what have you done?
Can I just be another risk you're running? Can I?
It's simple, soaked, and always on my mind
It's simple, soaked, and always on my mind
I'm dying
Bitterness infested, justice is molested
Govern my contested ways
As a child arrested, as a man detested
Happiness inside my pain
You hate my life
Because you see my strife
Could never understand or try
It makes me mad
Because it makes me sad
But I don't care why
You fake it, mistake it
Fuck it away
Your lying is trying
My dignity
I see right through your soul
Can't help but feel this cold
But this city made me so
Life filled with deception, unwanted inception
Want redemption for it all
All my life frustrated, pushed, alienated
Wait for me to take a fall
My faith has waned
Because I feel the strain
In my eyes it's all gone wrong
We'll rise above
From this lack of love
It won't be long now
You fake it, mistake it
Fuck it away
Your lying is trying
My dignity
I see right through your soul
Can't help but feel this cold
But this city made me so
I'm not the only one
Can't be the only one
No.
Corrupt my hope
In joyous hell
Between the lines
Lick the cream that smells
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Crawling down your spine to make you stay)
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Covering your eyes, I'll make you pay)
Beyond the high
Lies burning eyes
Crashed down to soil
Fucked up and coiled
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Crawling down your spine to make you stay)
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Covering your eyes, I'll make you pay)
Too beautiful
Too beautiful
You want to feel it
But you can't reveal that
You conceived the meaning
And caress the demon
All those callous eyes
How they infect your world
So you pretend to reason
But you've lost your soul
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Crawling down your spine to make you stay)
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Covering your eyes, I'll make you pay)
You shouldn't be so beautiful in my eyes
(Crawling down your spine to make you stay)
I wish you weren't so beautiful in my eyes
(Covering your eyes, I'll make you pay)
Too beautiful
Too beautiful
Too beautiful
Too beautiful
Too beautiful
Too beautiful
Too beautiful
Too beautiful

And yes it's time
To get some victory
Yes it's time for
Some victory
Your time
My time
This is our battle
So the pierce screwed up your face
'Cause your girlie liked the taste
You're infected by the tease
Political
So your dirty guilty braids
Made your body smell of mace
So debauched in your slick mink
Political
Yes it's fucking political
Everything's political
Yes it's fucking satirical
Everything's satirical
Yes it's fucking political
Everything's political
And the wild ones like to hide
As the dirty priest confides
In the love of baby whores
Political
Negative are all your views
So you to can prop up your fake cool
A puppet all the same
Political
Yes it's fucking political
Everything's political

Everything's satirical

Everything's political
Too many times you're gonna go out river walking
Too many times you come in late
Too many times you suck yourself out of the scene.
It makes you walk up straight,
It makes you walk up straight.
Too many times you trade the bottle for the body
One drop for breath and one for skin
You say nobody knows the truth about your body
Are you tired and thing? Are you tired and thin?
But if I were a good man
Would it really happen
Would you walk me home then, everyday from work.
But maybe I'm a good man, wait and let it happen
I believe in love, I'm married to my work.
'Cause I could be your father, I could be your brother,
I could be your flower, rise up in the dirt,
We were born to live here we were born to die here
And you know this when you work
Yeah you watch me when you work
And When you are free from the work of the towns
Well You know what to do with your hands
Listen, I'm sure, you've got a few ideas.
And when you wake from the shell of this body
How will you sink your ghost in a man
Well I hope you've got something better up your sleeve
Too many times you cleaned your love dry for your family
And roll over in your sleep
Roll over twice and hold the burden like a man
Something you can keep, something you can keep
You smell the scent of something burning in the kitchen
He smells the future on the lawn.
These are the things we come to recognize as truth
We cut the right into wrong, we cut the right into wrong.
But if I were a good man
Would it really happen
Would you walk me home then, everyday from work.
But maybe I'm a good man, wait and let it happen
I believe in love, I'm married to my work.
'Cause I could be your father, I could be your brother,
I could be your flower, rise up in the dirt,
We were born to live here we were born to die here
And you know this when you work
Yeah you watch me when you work
It seems that we used to live like rebels
But now we get scared like our parents
Our struggling faith,
Its just a waste of money
And when you wake up tomorrow my son
Yeah, you will be the father of something terrible
It will shine throughout your life
Oh it won't bury you
'Cause we know
Somewhere in the darkness
You will find love baby
You will find love
You will feel young again
And you will feel young.
Well it's a different man in your face
And so out of place
That you can see anything there that you wish
Kiss my bliss
It's like I'm a welcoming freakshow doormat
Held in awe while growing fat in the head
This is where we all should see red
A big fat wet slab of red
And I see that it makes me anti everything
And I see that it makes me want to shed my skin, shed my skin
Revelation leading to my psychosis and inspiration
Digest another hallucination psychosis by recreation
Happy till the next deterioration psychosis
For you it's a different notion of music and motion
A dance of lights a prosaic ocean
A delicate nearly transparent creation of somebodys
Soul on the screen has caught you in between
Of somebody's life on the stage and somebodys life on
The frontpage and this is where we all should see red
A big fat laughing mouth of red
And I see that it makes me anti everything
And I see that it makes me want to shed my skin, shed my skin
Revelation leading to my psychosis and inspiration
Digest another hallucination psychosis by recreation
Happy till the next deterioration psychosis
I think I'm gonna start my own religion
Seems to be the recipe for a new sensation
Think it's gonna make a trendy revolution
Quite the contribution to the unnatural selection
Think I'm gonna start my own religion
Seems to be the recipe for a new sensation
Think it's gonna make a trendy revolution
Quite the contribution to the unnatural selection
And I see that it makes me anti everything
And I see that it makes me want to shed my skin, shed my skin
Revelation leading to my psychosis and inspiration
Digest another hallucination psychosis by recreation
Happy till the next deterioration psychosis
Into the dark is where you're draggin' me
And into your dark is where I never want to be.
I know I'm not alone and I really want to leave.
Into the dark is where you want to watch me bleed.
I'm feeling kinda trapped, I gotta go.
I'm feelin' kinda trapped don't you know.
I'm feelin' really trapped I gotta go.
I gotta go.
I'm being dragged down, for how long I don't know.
I'm being dragged down and I rise up way too slow.
I know I don't belong here and I think I ought to go.
I hope that I can leave here with my soul
Instrumental
In this hole, that is me
The dead are rolling over
In this hole, thickening
Dirt shoveled over shoulders
I feel it in me, so overwhelmed
Oh, this pressure center, rising
My life overturned, unfair, the despair
All these scars keep ripping open
Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?
In this hole, that is me
A life that's growing feeble
In this hole, so limiting
The sun has set, all darkens
Buried underneath, hands slip off the wheel
Internal pathway to contention
Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?
(Are you) Happy?
(Are you) Happy?
Are you feeling happy?
In this hole, that is me
Left with a heart exhausted
What's my release?  What sets me free?
Do you pull me up just to push me down again?
Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?
Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?
Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you fucking happy
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing?
Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you fucking happy
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing?
It comes as no surprise he's taken by surprise

She walked into the admiral
Looking for someone
Show me what you can do he asked
Get on your knees and let the games begin
Bow to your queen and I will crown your head
'Cause I can make you every inch a king
Before I do it, tell me, tell me what's in it for me
I need someone young, willing and able
You need someone old enough to know better
I want you to
Do my dirty work, do my dirty work (Oh)
Do my dirty work, do my dirty work, yeah, come on

I'm getting sick of it!
Living on borrowed time so I'll die tomorrow (die)
Yeah living in yellow skin so I shed and borrow (shed and borrow)
Okay, okay, okay I fuckin' get it
Okay, okay, okay I'm gonna kill it
No way, no way, no way you're gonna stop me
Okay, okay, okay
Waiting on a revolution that I can follow (I can follow) Yeah
Feeding on an open wound kills the pain but I like it (yeah I like it)
I'm looking for a new solution that I can swallow (I can swallow)
Living on borrowed time, I'll die tomorrow
Who cares if you die?!
Okay, okay, okay I fuckin' get it
Okay, okay, okay I'm gonna kill it
No way, no way, no way you're gonna stop me
Okay, okay, okay
Get out of my face, out of my face with that shit!

It gets you nowhere; your life becomes a hit to a hit!
(I'm getting sick of it!)
Get out of my face, out of my face with that shit!
It's getting deep
You're gonna die tomorrow
Okay, okay, okay I fuckin' get it

Okay, okay, okay
Who cares if you die?

Who cares if you die?
(You're gonna die tomorrow)
Who cares if you die tomorrow?
I remember desert places
Shadowless and cold
Where heaven looks down
On this empty hole
Levers here to taste the ruins
Dark and obscene
But all I want is you
In my sunken dreams
I remember all the places
I remember when we met
You, alone and graceless
Me, covered in sweat
We hid among the empty isle
Shuddered 'neath the scene
And your lips reached out
In my sunken dreams
She finished the move, presenting blue waves of doubt
Natured now and blown apart
This fury and cruel matriarch
She leads me to the edge of my own frail being
And my own mortality in question
The sanctity pushed me on and off to the depths of my own cowardly demise
And in this decay I find another day
Will I burn at the stake
That I know, into the decay, another day
Will I burn at the stake to have a chance to obey
And will I start again where I first began
With a flat fluid embrace
And I remember, when I tried to find a voice
In the distorted German channels of my own mind
And that seemed so long ago
That was so long ago
(Everlast a/k/a Whitey)
I'm A Swing It watch me bring it to the next level
The graphic devils gettin' funky like the Nevilles
Brothers from the bayou, so why you wanna trip
Just play the sideline kid and wait for me to slip
'Cause I can feel it "In The Air Tonight"
But yo I'm not Phil Collins, I'm more like Henry Rollins
'Cause I search and destroy retoy with the plot
Tryin' to get what I got ya might get shot
Hot damn I'm a "Slam" ya like Onyx
Then teach ya how to write a rhyme like "Hooked On Phonics"
Mother Goose ain't got shit on me
'Cause I get loose at the jam and wreck the whole party
I make em' jump and mosh oh my gosh
There slamin in the pit when I'm kickin my shit
They're buggin at the eyes 'cause I got mad styles
And ain't a damn thing funny I get money in piles
Some people thought I died that's just a rumor though
Others thought I fell off but now I'm numero uno
Dos not cuatro word to Kool Keith, "I'ma break up your teeth"!
When I die (Die!), bury me (Me!)
Hang my balls from a cherry tree (Tree!)
Let them get ripe (Ripe!) and take a bite (Bite!)
And if they don't taste right then don't blame D (D!)
(Danny Boy)
You need to quit swingin'
The styles that I'm bringin'
The funk knuckle dragon
The kids on the wagon
I'm not the 12 stepper
Don't play me like a lepper
My mic sounds nice
But it's not Salt 'N Pepa
(Everlast)
Well it's the man with the plan to get all your skins
The tip of my D**K is where the line begins
So Hoes form a line
Take off that swine!
Strip your ass butt naked
Let's see if you can take it
'Cause (*trying to sing like Aretha Franklin*)
I'll make you feel... LIKE A NATURAL WOMAN!
'Cause I keep it comin'
I'm the Everlastin' freestyle assassin
With soul and my goal is to bring a little passion
To your girl's life like the Daily Soaps
Throw her down on the bed and tie her up wit' ropes
"Lyrics be on and on and on." (Repeat)
(Danny Boy)
I'm just another rager with a Dairy Face
Punk motherfuckers beef and rhyme my race
You need to step back kid and give me some space
So I can cold spark the party when I'm rockin' the place
Danny Boy's arrivin' I stand six five and a half,
Don't laugh kid the graph is surviving
The outlaw biker with my big shit kicker
On a "Highway To Hell'
'Cause I never tell!
(Everlast)
Well it's the funk back breaker
We heat it up like Jamaica
Don't bring your woman to the party 'cause I'll take her!
Hit the deck 'cause I'm down with the Hoolis
I got a trunk full of funk like the Groovy Doolies
I'm not the man but I'll asked who was he
Quick's hot the hair do just like Ruth Buzzy
Runnin' 'round town like ya been to jail son
But ya hit the swap meet to get your hair and your nail done
Get off my sack 'cause your shit is WACK!
Ya dis me and I'm a dis ya back!
I'm A Swing It
Yeah
Hopsin
Funk Volume
C'mon, keep sleepin' on me
Hollywood ass rappers
Bitch ass females
That's enough to make a nigga flip
Yeah
I erupt like a bomb
So give up the baton
I slap you after bustin' a fuckin' nut in my palm
Why you buggin' me like something was wrong
Just take a puff of the bong
And let me leave your mind corrupt from this song
See you can't stop me 'cause I'm a brainwash teens
And create false dreams cause it pays off clean
I'm just an idiotic ironic symbolic illuminatic product
That's gonna be killed if I talk about it (shhh!)
This industry business is all screwed up
I have no favorite rapper because all you suck
I severe the weakest niggas who not on my pedigree
Because on the tombstone its as hard as it will ever be
I'm judged by my wild image a lot
And everybody seems to think I have a sinister plot, I do
Be offended by every sentence I jot
I got some militant thoughts and you ain't killin' em'
Off so listen
I sag my pants until my ass shows
I even slap hoes (bitch)
Yeah I'm an asshole (yeah yeah)
And your parents hate me 'cause I love you
So tell em' I said fuck you
Yeah I said fuck you (yeah yeah)
I snuck in Drake's house when he was alone inside (uh
Oh)
You can say I have a bogus mind
I dim the lights and close the blinds
Around his neck is where my rope was tied
I yanked on it till I broke his spine (yeah)
Lately I've been fuckin' pissed off (why?)
Cause everybody's sayin' Lil Wayne spits raw
I start a big brawl
And slam his ass into a brick wall
And have a fat nigga sit on him
Rick Ross (gross)
I don't play with this rap shit
I got no life, I stay in the attic
Fuck a rap career, I'm waiting to smash it
Soulja Boy you got a corny flow (true)
So you can suck my fuckin' dick through a glory hole
I'm just being me
What you trying to hate for
All you niggas is faker than Lupe Fiasco claimin he
Skateboards
Yeah right, that nigga can't even ollie
Push him away on the dolly
Not even Satan can't stop me (what)
I sag my pants until my ass shows
I even slap hoes (bitch)
Yeah I'm an asshole (yeah yeah)
And your parents hate me 'cause I love you
So tell em' I said fuck you
Yeah I said fuck you (yeah yeah)
I'm probably the sickest muthafucka who don't get recognized
Eazy-E's wife's life is somewhat now jeopardized
She signed me and I was set aside
For like three and a half years
I don't think I remember why
I'm fuckin' dope and this is my reward
That's wacker than the five hundred dollars you signed
Me for
Eazy's dead now
Yeah the label's finally yours
Too bad he never knew that you were just a grimy whore
You can't maintain what Eric built (nah)
I know he's in his grave turnin' like a ferris wheel
Don't think you're cool just cause you inherit mil
Bitch play the skills
I'm Hopsin, I spit shit so unfair and real
I got some deep dark issues within
All because you lied and tried to pretend you a friend
Fuck Ruthless, bitch I never lend you a hand
And I'm a make sure nobody ever signs with you again
(You know why?)
I sag my pants until my ass shows
I even slap hoes (bitch)
Yeah I'm an asshole (yeah yeah)
And your parents hate me 'cause I love you
So tell em' I said fuck you
Yeah I said fuck you (yeah yeah)
Horny and burned out now is how it always ends for me 
Chemicals wear me down in your summertime bacchanalian 
I saw you go faster than the morning comes 
She walks away like a lady 
It's always the fallen ones  
I think are always going to save me 
I saw you go faster 
I want to get off one time and not apologize 
You got to steal the time of a life that's passing by 
In bed she flexes her knees to try and abate the feeling 
She mouths the words please to the poster on the ceiling 
I saw you go faster right in front of me 
She stares at him so madly 
She's got the nerve to say 
She wants to fuck that boy so badly 
I saw you go faster 
I want to get off one time and not apologize 
You got to steal the time of a life that's passing by 
I want to get off one time and look you in the eyes 
I want to get off one time, get off one time 
I was hoping you would be waiting there for me lately 
I was hoping you'd be waiting for me  
I was hoping you'd be waiting there for me lately 
I was hoping you would be waiting there for me
I was hoping you would be waiting there for me lately 
But you're not the kind who would be waiting, not for anybody 
You're not the kind who would be waiting there for anybody
Not even me 
Just one time 
I could go off right now 
(I want to get off)
I want to get off one time and not apologize 
You got to steal the time of a life that's passing by 
Not for sale [x3]
I wouldn't bother to look if I was sure that you were happy together
But I've seen the way she covers her chest up as if it was a national treasure
Looks are the first weapon
Charm is the second
I reckon that she doesn't have much of either
You don't need her
It's better that you come and see about me
No, I won't get bored and I won't get tired
I've already spent years at the back of the line
So another six months won't make a difference to me now
Soon enough we'll be the
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
All the men came back from six years' fighting
To the beige row of houses and the prospect of spending
Their Saturday nights in
From here to eternity
And it wasn't that summer their wives didn't love them
They had the run of the house
And with nothing to do on a night
One thing led to something else
No, I won't get bored and I won't get tired
I've already spent years at the back of the line
So another six months won't make a difference to me now
Soon enough we'll be the
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Behind your back in the supermarket
She's got his number and she's not afraid to use it
I want to know, exactly what you, exactly what you intend to do about it
Because you can't keep your eye on her all the time
And you can't trust a word that she says any more
Can't trust a word that she says any more
Can't trust a word that she says any more
No, I won't get bored and I won't get tired
I've already spent years at the back of the line
So another six months won't make a difference to me now
Don't tell me what price salvation
I have to take it anyway
Can I get it on credit or something?
Godspeed the day, godspeed the day when we're the
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Left alive
Left alive
Staring at the world through the hole you put in my hand
That was caused by a blade you gently inserted
I did this for you, I did this for you, not for your religion, not for your patterns
I did this for you
I did this for a man like you
Stop searching and find Me
I am stabbed by grace and slinging blood
I'm slinging blood
So I made you lie! 
And we both hope 
This will pass by 
Through our life lines 
Standing broken 
Come on tell me 
You can't hurt me 
Don't ignore the 
Lies you're bleeding 
Entranced in noise 
And words and phrases 
All about you 
Everyone was so right 
I know something you don't know 
You hid something obvious from me 
I know something you'll never know 
You hid something obvious from me 
Envy sets in 
And I hate you 
For what you did 
I will break you 
Cry for help now 
They can't hear you 
Here's an offer 
You can't refuse 
Scream a little bit louder for me baby 
Face the truth 
That you baited so well 
I know something you don't know 
You hid something obvious from me 
I know something you'll never know 
You hid something obvious from me 
Scream my name 
At the top of your lungs 
Help me to know 
Why I should care 
Destroy our past 
I'll still have 
These memories 
You'll never take from me 
I know something you don't know 
You hid something obvious from me 
I know something you'll never know 
You hid something obvious from me 
Scream my name!
Dear Preacher, thanks for making time for me today, I hope you don't mind if I hide behind the curtain. It's been fifteen years since my last confession; by your good book's standards I sinned like a champion, but that book seems a tad bit outdated.
Please, forgive me for questioning divinity - it's an ugly job but I think I'm up for it. I'm not saying who's right, I'm just saying there's more than one way to skin a religion. There's more than one way to explain our existence.
Reverend Sir, I don't want to seem irreverent, my teenage angst is far behind me. But Father, certainly it's troubling to see all these people kneeling instead of dealing with the fact that we're all we have. So rise up, rise up, there's no one to worship - but plenty of life to lose. I'm not saying, "Let's burn down the churches!" but do you want to hear my confession? It's my greatest sin... (here it is)
I wasted half my life on the thought that I'd live forever.
I wasn't raised to seize the day, but to work and worship 'cause he that liveth and believeth supposedly never dies. Rise up, rise up, live a full life - 'cause when it's over it's done. So, rise up, rise up, dance and scream and love.
Schizophrenic nightmares sending shivers down my spine
I may be a little twisted, but I swear that my life is fine
I'm living with a perfect stranger, is there anybody home?
I'm living with a perfect stranger, but I find myself alone
Well I'm still working to make life better, though I've fallen from God's grace
I'm standing still in a shattered mirror, staring at somebody else's face
I'm living with a perfect stranger, is there anybody home?
I'm living with a perfect stranger, but I find myself alone
Just when things are back on track, I sabotage myself
These are all certain telltale signs of my decaying mental health
Nobody's home
Teacher starve your child, P.C. approved 
As long as the right words are used 
Systemised atrocity ignored 
As long as bi-lingual signs on view 
Ten foot sign in Oxford Street 
Be pure - be vigilant - behave 
Grey not neon, grey not real 
Life bleeds, death is your birthright 
P.C. she speaks impotent, sterile, naïve, blind, atheist, sadist, stiff-upper lip, first principle of her silence, of her silence 
PCP - a P.C. police victory 
PCP - a P.C. pyrrhic victory 
When I was young P.C. meant Police Constable 
Nowadays I can't seem to tell the difference 
Liposuction for your bad mouth boy 
Cut out your tongue, effigies are sold 
Words discoloured, bow to the bland 
Heal yourself with sinner's salt 
Doctors arrested for euthanasia 
Kill smokers through blind vanity 
If you're fat don't get ill 
Europe's gravestone carved in plastic 
P.C. she says inoculate, hallucinate, beware Shakespeare, bring fresh air, king cigarette snuffed out by her midgets, by her midgets 
PCP - a P.C. police victory 
PCP - a P.C. pyrrhic victory 
When I was young P.C. meant Police Constable 
Nowadays I can't seem to tell the difference 
P.C. caresses bigots and big brother, read Leviticus, learnt censorship, pro-life equals anti-choice, to be scared of, of feathers 
PCP - a P.C. police victory 
PCP - a P.C. pyrrhic victory 
When I was young P.C. meant Police Constable 
Nowadays I can't seem to tell the difference 
Lawyers before love, surrogate sex 
This land bows down to 
Yours, unconditional love and hate 
Pass the prozac, designer amnesiac
In these days you can get no rice
No razor blades but you can get knife
In these days see the people run
They have no food but the boy have gun
In these days they don't throw the stone
Nor use the voice they use the gun alone
In these days to be an oddity
Be hunted down like a scarcity
In these days don't beg for life
Wanna take Kingston advice?
Oh please don't beg for your life
In these days the beat is militant
Must be a clash there's no alternative
In these days nations are militant
We have slavery under government
In these days in the firmament
I look for signs that are permanent
In these days with no love to give
The world will turn with no one left to live
In these days I don't know what to do
The more I see the more I'm destitute
In these days I don't know what to sing
The more I know the less my tune can swing
In these days you can get no rice
No razor blades but you can get knife
In these days see the people run
They have no food but the boy have gun
Shut up 
I'm not like you 
Back off 
Don't smother me 
Fuck this 
I see through you 
Suffer me through 
Shut up, I'm not like you 
Shut up, I'm not like you 
Shut up, I'm not like you 
Suffer me through
Type A, fly away 
Don't lie
 
I won't let you get the best of me
I won't let you get the best of me
I won't let you get the best of me
If I try, if I try 
Oh, God 
I can't stand you 
Disappoint you with me 
One day you'll come down too 
Suffer me through 
Shut up, I'm not like you 
Shut up, I'm not like you 
Shut up, I'm not like you 
Suffer me through
Type A, fly away 
Don't lie
 
I won't let you get the best of me
I won't let you get the best of me
I won't let you get the best of me
If I try, if I try (try, try, try...)
Shut up 
I'm not like you 
Back off 
Don't smother me 
Fuck this 
I see through you 
Suffer me through
Oh, God 
I can't stand you 
Disappoint you with me 
One day you'll come down too 
Suffer me through 
I won't let you get the best of me
I won't let you get the best of me
I won't let you get the best of me
If I try, if I try 
I won't let you get the best of me
I won't let you get the best of me
I won't let you get the best of me
I try, I try
Don't even take a breath
The air is cut with cyanide
In honor of the new year
The press gives us cause to celebrate:
These air raid sirens
Flood barbed-wired skylines
By artificial night
As we sleep to burn the red 
From our bloodless lives
Tonight we're all time bombs
On fault lines
Have we lost everything now?
Walking like each others ghosts
Around these silent streets (the seditatives tell you everything is alright)
Like calendars dying at new year's eve parties
As we kiss hard on the lips
And swear this year will be better than the last
Jet black - the ink that spells your name
Jet black - the blood that's in your veins
Jet black - We say, "how long can we take this chance not to celebrate?"
There's music playing
But we dance to the beat
Of our own black hearts
And draw diagrams
Of suicide on each others wrists
Then trace them with razorblades
Fire to flames
"strike match."
Burn these words from our lips
As the dagger screams
"Love is dead."
And it's a "newspaper tragedy."
Have we lost what we love?
Have we said everything?
Does it change everything?
Stare at the clock
Avoid at all costs
This emptiness
Have we lost everything now?
Walking like each others ghosts
Around these silent streets the seditatives tell you everything is alright
Like calendars dying at new year's eve parties
As we kiss hard on the lips
And swear this year will be better than the last
Have we lost everything now?
Walking like each others ghosts
Around these silent streets the seditatives tell you everything is alright
Like calendars dying at new year's eve parties
As we kiss hard on the lips
And swear that this year... this year...
Ten seconds left
Until midnight
Nine chances to drown ourselves
In black hair dye
Eight faces turned away
From shock
Seven windows and six of them are locked
Five stories falling
For ever and ever
Three cheers to the mirror
Now there are two of us.
Can we have one last dance?
Jet black - the ink that spells your name
Jet black - the blood that's in your veins
Jet black - We say, "how long can we take this chance not to celebrate?"
Jet black - the ink that spells your name
Jet black - the blood that's in your veins
Jet black - We say, "how long can we take this chance not to celebrate?"
What I feel when I'm playing guitar
Is completely cold and crazy,
Like I don't owe nobody nothing
And it's just a test just to see
How far I can relax
Into the cold wave of a note.
When everything hits just right (just and right)
The note of nobility can go on forever.
I never tire of the solitary E
And I trust my guitar
And I don't care about anything.
Sometimes I feel like I've broken through
And I'm free and I could dig into eternity
Into eternity riding the wave
And realm of the E.
Sometimes it's useless.
Here I am struggling and filled with dread
Afraid that I'll never squeeze enough
Graphite from my damaged cranium
To inspire or asphyxiate any eyes
Grazing like hungry cows across the stage or page.
Inside of me I'm crazy I'm just crazy.
Inside I must continue.
I see her, my stiff muse,
Jutting around round round
Round like a broken speeding statue.
The colonial year is dead
And the greeks too are finished.
The face of alexander remains not only solely
Due to sculpture but through the power and foresight
And magnetism of alexander himself.
The artist must maintain his swagger.
He must he must he must be intoxicated
By ritual as well as result.
Look at me I am laughing.
I am laughing.
I am lapping cocaine from the hard brown palm
Of the bouncer. and I trust my guitar.
Therefore we black out together.
Therefore I would run through scum.
And scum is just ahead, ah we see it,
But we just laugh.
We're ascending through the hollow mountain.
We are peeking.
We are laughing.
We are kneeling.
We are laughing.
We are radiating at last.
This rebellion is just a gas
Our gas a gas that we pass.
You want to see me disappear
Well, it starts here
Trying my best
Not to say what you don't want to hear
But it's all right -
You can cover your, cover your ears.
Face my fears
Just once a year
The feeling I get
When I want to return everything
That's in my life
I'll be busting at the seams.
It's a gamble either way
If you play your cards
It's another tidal wave
I'll be waiting with my eyes closed.
No, I don't want to be
The one who lives a lie
But never knew it.
We're just a world away from where
I can feel like I've never felt before
So lock the door.

I can feel like I've never felt before
So lock the door.
You're the one who told me
To pack up all my things
And leave in the morning
It's just a world away from here
And I will never bother you no more
And that's for sure.

"I found love on a prison ship..." (repeating)
"Number 247681-Zed, step to the line"
(Gunshot)
Cage:
Two types of people in this world I recognize
Conquered, and the one holding rifle next in line
The crosshair in my eye, a vessel to god
Decontaminated and kept you around in a hole in they yard
Sailing cemetery seas after crew leaves and moves on
You have no idea how right my head is screwed on
When I wake up and put this suit on, I feel escape begin
Expirations are needed, I facilitate the end
El-P:
There are two types of mornings/mournings in this life I can surmise
I wake early in the first to help supply the second type
Technician of repetition clips and the numbers of tradition zips
Little one-risk blunders that can summon one's demise
I know line and walk tall, soft, and punch a clock--Ain't done
I see the shelter and contrition, best to limit wagging tongues
But today's a confrontation with a thought that's not assured
She says she's closer to my services and further from my world
"I found love on a prison ship..." (repeating)
El-P:
Does this job ever bother you, darkly creep up in your conscious too?
Cage:
Nope, in fact I'm so enamored with this standard
That being handed a commander, it's almost romantic
The lead giveth, I take it, if I didn't understand it
El-P:
I'm saying during the tenure of your gig, have you ever heard of prisoner
Despite the traitorous label, makes you nervous as a kid
(Who) May be beyond a date with the lead, maybe there's something else meant for her
A prisoner with the beauty of prisoner 247290-Zed?
Cage:
Oh God, you gotta be joking, I get it she's smoking
Got get a taste, I'll hold you down for thirty, she must be purty or open
Your secret's safe with me, go on a raping spree
I gotta couple numbers of my own, just return the courtesy
El-P:
No, naw man, that's actually not on my mind, naw, it's different this time
She's a creature so sublime, and already be in line for the gun?
And I'm the one to dispense it, She seem almost defenseless
And her eyes have the surprising effect of rendering me restless
"You know, you look really pretty without handcuffs on
Without the dirt on your face..."
Like the prison stench of the huddled traitors evaporates from the room
And in that moment I can see her truly, and she can see me too
Beneath the body armor and weaponry, my heart quietly thumps and whispers
"Drop the guns and grab her, it's time to make a run"
Sitting in my transport as we slip through traffic veins
She doesn't ask me where we going, only holds my hand and gaze
She's my only reason now, and my only hope to live
We pull up to the cabin way above this damn metropolis
Me and prisoner 247290-Zed
Somewhere that is Soylent Green, we're living life instead
No more war traitorism, it's only me and her
She can clean my gun and I can help her clean the floor
Back to something natural, we'll live off the land
When Radon levels drop we walk the trails and talk and laugh
I tell her she's innocent, and she'll show me she's not
I kiss her number on her arm and lay her on the cot
I'm the first to touch her without gloves on
She's the first to kiss me without crying
Life before this was just dying
Me and prisoner 247290-Zed
Away from all this violence, live inside each other's head... (repeating)
"Number 247290-Zed, step to the line"
"Dammit Lent, fire your weapon!"
"Yes sir"
(Gunshot)
"I found love on a prison ship..." (repeating)
"She's dead Lent, just how we wanted it. Great."
"Just how we wanted it (laughing)"
"You shot the s--- out her Lent. I'm proud of you. Go home"
I'm always around you to show that I care but I don't know what for.
It seems to me that you couldn't care less so I'm not going to do it anymore.
I see no reason why I've placed such a value on you,
But my thoughts have changed now, I've opened my eyes and now I'm through.
Lookin' back at my short life, the few pleasures that I've found,
All your misconceptions pummel me into the ground.
Now, I look at your small life and it doesn't mean a bit.
I pick myself up off the ground 'cause I don't give a shit.
They say all good things come to an end, I wish this didn't apply.
You were once someone I called my friend but that's all now changed and I don't know why.
Things are very different now.
You've got nothing to say.
It' s sad when someone you know very well decides to fuckin' die and go away.
Lookin' back at my short life, the few pleasures that I've found,
All your misconceptions pummel me into the ground.
Now, I look at your small life and it doesn't mean a bit.
I pick myself up off the ground 'cause I don't give a shit.
Now, I look at your small life and it doesn't mean a bit.
I pick myself up off the ground 'cause I don't give a shit!
Give me some antiseptic
To take this headache away
Give me a syringe
To inject the pain
Give me something pretty
I hope I'll never be
I'd rather be creepy and very strange
Give me a cake
That I can mix and bake
In a betty crocker oven
That I will BREAK!
Bake it up and we will
Stab! stab! stab!
Come on, don't be afraid
We will make you
Stab! stab! stab!
My world is evil
But American made
Give me something easy
That I can complicate
Something hard
To Injest The pain
Give me a mate
In a crippled state
With halloween teeth
That I can BREAK!
Bake it up and we will
Stab! stab! stab!
Come on, don't be afraid
We will make you
Stab! stab! stab!
My world is evil
But American made
Mama's apple pie got a cock-a-roach in it
Burn the flag with a fag
Mama's apple pie got cock-a-roach in it
Burn the flag with a fag
Mama's apple pie got cock-a-roach in it
Burn the flag with a fag
Mama's apple pie got cock-a-roach in it
Burn the flag with a FAG!
Bake it up and we will
Stab! stab! stab!
Come on, don't be afraid
We will make you
Stab! stab! stab!
My world is evil
But American Made
American Made
American Grave
In an American Grave
All my life
All my time
Oh it's got a price
Oh gonna pay for mine
I know you really care X2
Oll my friends they got
Old apathy in the brain
They got no ideas in their heads
They got no path that I can't see
Don't you think that I don't blame them
Don't you think that I can't shame them
Don't you think that I don't want them
Don't you think that I ain't one of them
One of them X3
I know you really care X3...
You're just another exile X8
A violência é tão fascinante
E nossas vidas são tão normais
E você passa dia e noite e sempre vê
Apartamentos acesos
Tudo parece ser tão real
Mas você viu esse filme também
Andando nas ruas, pensei que podia ouvir
Alguêm me chamando, dizendo meu nome
Já estou cheio de me sentir vazio
Meu corpo é quente e estou sentindo frio
Todo mundo sabe, ninguém quer mais saber
Afinal, amar ao proximo é tão demodê
Essa justiça desafinada
É tão humana e tão errada
Nós assistimos televisão também
Qual é a diferença?
Não estatize meus sentimentos
Pra seu governo, o meu estado
É independente
Já estou cheio de me sentir vazio
Meu corpo é quente e estou sentindo frio
Todo mundo sabe, ninguém quer mais saber
Afinal, amar ao proximo é tão demodê
This is life 
It's a test 
It's a game 
Did you pass? 
Play again 
In the hope 
That you see 
Where you've been 
It's the fame 
It's the drugs 
It's the social circle that you're not part of 
It's the feel 
It's everybody else, it can't be me 
You're the reason I can't control myself 
You are the reason I can't control myself 
You're the reason I can't control myself 
You are the reason I can't control myself 
I can't control myself 
I am done 
With this war 
I will spit right in the face of all you whores 
In the hope 
That you see 
Where you've been 
It's the fame 
It's the drugs 
It's the social circle that you're not part of 
It's the feel 
It's everybody else, it can't be me 
You're the reason I can't control myself 
You are the reason I can't control myself 
You're the reason I can't control myself 
You are the reason I can't control myself 
It's the world 
On its knees 
It's the heaven that everyone seems to need 
It's the light 
It's the focus that you cannot seem to find 
The fame 
The feel 
The social circle that you can't get near 
The drugs 
It's everybody else, it can't be you 
You're the reason I can't control myself 
You are the reason I can't control myself 
You're the reason I can't control myself 
You are the reason I can't control myself 
You're the reason I can't control myself 
You are the reason I can't control myself 
You're the reason I can't control myself 
You are the reason I can't control myself
Took my
Lover to the sea
Drowned him
Precious bride to be
Bleeding
Heaven from the start
Woe is
Rapture ripped apart
Hey
You're honest
Aren't you?
Show me
Rapture torn apart
Everybody's riddled with disease
But I bet you say "not me"
So honest
Aren't you?
You're
So honest
Aren't you so?
My, aren't you
Surely the finest of the brigade?
My, aren't you
Always right, a portrait of dignity?
My, aren't you
Innocent and never suspectable?
My, aren't you
Wait...
You smell like shit, not the truth
Full of device, not devotion
Conscience came right up to you
And then
You threw it back
You are the scum of the earth
You are the scum of the ocean
To you, it's above as below
You smear your filth across the world
You smear your filth across the world
You smear your filth across the world
You smear your filth across
The world
(Verse One)
God damn, it's a brand new payback
From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black
How many motherfuckers gotta pay
Went to the shelf and dusted off the AK
Caps gotta get pealed
Cause "The Nigga Ya Love to hate" still can "Kill at Will"
It ain't no pop cause that sucks
And you can New Jack SWING on my nuts
Down wit the niggaz that I bail out
I'm platinum bitch and I didn't have to sell out
Fuck you Ice Cube, that's what the people say
Fuck AmeriKKKa, still wit hthe triple K
Cause you know when my nine goes buck
It'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from 12 stories up
Now let's see who'll drop
Punk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hip-hop
Fuck R&B and the runnin' man
I'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand
Make sure before you buck wit duck quick
Punk, 'cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck wit
"I'ma let y'all know one thing man.."
(Verse Two)
Hell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em
Ice Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin L.M.
It's the number one crew in the area
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt
Punks roll when I put in work
Cause Lench Mob niggaz are the craziest
And y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit
South Central, that's where the Lench Mob dwell
Hittin fools up with the big ass L
One time can't hold me back
Sweatshirt, khakis and crokersacs
Stop givin' juice to the Raiders
Cause Al Davis, never paid us
I hope he wear a vest
It's all about the L-E-N-C-H y'all know the rest
Motherfuckin crew, motherfuckin mob
Do a motherfuckin job in a motherfuckin squad
In '91 Ice Cube grew stronger and bigger
And I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
"One-and-two, ah-three-e-and-ah-four-and.."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute"
[Cube] Drop a old school beat!
(Verse Three)
Like I said, it's a brand new payback
Now in '91, let's see who beats the jack
Sir Jinx grew a little bit taller
(Keep the wack beats out) true motherfuckin baller
And hoes can't roll on
Even bitches looking like En Vogue gotta "Hold On"
Don't let me catch Daryl Gates in traffic
I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
I hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue
Goin' up against the Zulu
Break his spine like a jellyfish
Kick his ass till I'm smellin shit
Off wit the head, off wit the head I say
And watch the devil start kickin
Run around like a chicken, grand dragon finger lickin'
Yo, turn him over wit a spatula
Now we got, Kentucky Fried Cracker
Mess with the Cube, you get punked quick
Pig, 'cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with!
"Last person in the world you wanna fuck with.." (repeat 3X)
The boy I love's got another girl
He might be fucking her right now
I don't have an apartment
Thought if I was smart I'd make it far
But I'm still at the start
Guess I'm contagious it'd be safest if you ran
Fuck that's what they all just end up doing in the end
Take my car and paint it black
Take my arm, break it in half
Say something, do it soon
It's too quiet in this room
I need noise
I need the buzz of a sub
Need the crack of a whip
Need some blood in the cut
Met back up with the boy I love
Cried on the streets of San Francisco
I don't have an agenda
All I do is pretend to be ok so my friends
Can't see my heart in the blender
Lately, I've been killing all my time
Reading through your messages my favorite way to die
Take my head and kick it in
Break some bread for all my sins
Say a word, do it soon
It's too quiet in this room
I need noise
I need the buzz of a sub
Need the crack of a whip
Need some blood in the cut
Shut up I'm about to take
All your innocence for free
In the end you're gonna wanna pay me
Shut up I'm about to tell you how
I won the war
Won't tell you what or how or when
And in the end you'll never ever ever
Ask what for
(Hellohellohello)
Are you talking to me?
Shut up I'm about to tell you 'bout the difference you'll never make
And win the war with no regrets
No hurt, no pain, no shame
Shut up I'm about to tell you some secrets you'll never know
Now don't ask what, don't move, don't cry Don't even ask where this is going
I don't know
(Hellohellohello)
Are you talking to me? hey hey
(Hellohellohello)
Are you talking to me?
(Hellohellohello)
What's the matter, my baby's dead
His heart went blind on me
My dress caught fire
From 1 match that you gave me
And all that's left is your bill and
The breath I got
Yeah I won't sit in your misery 'cause the phonecall's gone and no one's comin'
No one's comin' no one's comin'
No one's coming for you
(Hellohellohello)
My dress is on fire
(Hellohellohello)
It's burning down
(Hellohellohello)
I got no desires
No one no one
But you leave this taste in your ring around the rosy yeah
Addicted to all that shit
Pocketfil of mistakes
Taxes and romances
When it all burns down
Dive dive dive dive
Baby fire baby fire baby FIRE!
One and one and one is two
All this and more you said was true
And if you'd left me ground to stand on
I'd run so far away from you
What do you do with a remainder?
You round it up or round it down
And if you're scared by what you're left with
Destroy the answer that you've found
You were the one
When the day had begun
The sun was shining on us
Blinding me such
That I couldn't see
There was a hole beneath me
And then you watched me fall
With no expression at all
There is an absolute zero
But you won't find it on your own
Only someone else can show you nothing
And leave you with a gaping hole
You were the one
When the storm rolled in
The sky was grey like your heart
With no color at all
I don't know you like this
You're as reckless as wind
And I couldn't predict
Just the way this would end
(Slug)
We travel in a missile, weaving through your cornfields
Leaving behind a trail of amateur porn and orange peels
Navigating through this basement
That masquerades as a nation
Practicing my acetate masturbation
Watching the expressions on the faces
Of the ones designated to be the queens, kings, and aces
How many miles can you put on one soul
Before the smile starts to blend into one big bullet hole?
(Brother Ali)
Shoot through it as a unit with the best of my crew
Pumping melodies and memories too, my head's killing me (Ooh)
Stomach empty, my bladder is full
Two year old son on Jaybird phone
Crying, missing me
And I'm starving, I'll bite your arm off
Saber tooth tiger, run the night with the sharp claws
In your back yard just to fuck with your guard dogs
Throw a brick through your shit, come cut the alarm off
(Slug)
Fuck yes
I do my best to take advantage in bouts
With one hand over the mouth, still managing to shout
There's more said within the lines of your forehead
Then they could ever try to fine print on the inside of that warhead
Cross Country, like a little lost junkie
Make 'em hot and jumpy, trying to get that God money
Steering the van through the blizzards, the fanfare
Pivot when we visit, spit victim if you stand there
(Brother Ali)
Check a map of this picture, throw a dart at it
That's where
We took a room back full of kids and threw a heart at it
Angry like a hostage
Kicking like a little bitch in one of Dibbs's mosh pits
Shifting through your city limits, trying to find the raw shit
Thread a needle with it and weave a world of heads together
Till we get 'em carsick
Face full of war paint, strapped ready for action
Battle cry just trying to seek the satisfaction of the captain
(Slug)
Climbed over the side, closed his eyes
Took a dive into his famed inspiration for staying alive
Swam to the shore
Stepped upon land
Walked up to a whore
Grabbed her by the hand and said
Let the wheels spin, Let the room shake, Let the speakers blow
Let the light in, Let the kids play, Let the people know
Let the roof burn, Let the girls love, Let the heat flow
Let the world turn, Let the curbs up, Cats Van Bags Yo!
(Brother Ali)
Lock eyes with a thousand people at the same time
They mind believe in us
My style of graffiti is
Squeezing just the Midwest sweat out of my shirt
And leaving with my life essence embedded in your dirt
(Slug)
We work, move, and hustle with the rest of the gypsies
Spoon feed these issues to a new school of fishies
Swimming through a hazy shade of passion
Here they come, the Hazelden has-been
And his chapter
(Brother Ali)
Yeah, that's them, the migrant seasonal workers
The finest imperial wordsmiths on the circuit
Two million smiles and running
Stomping, trying to flee the heat
Turn around shooting at the monster till his knees are weak
(Slug)
They call me Jesus Freak, I came to listen
Then I save you
Then I make you my favorite position
Chasing this pigeon down the street towards the banks
Just in case my my traffic receives Jeeps and tanks
(Both)
And we wander through this soul
So let it be known
Mama I don't know if I'm a ever be home
The revolution wont have any distribution
I love my son and my music so I gotta keep it moving like
Let the wheels spin, Let the room shake, Let the speakers blow
Let the light in, Let the kids play, Let the people know
Let the roof burn, Let the girls love, Let the heat flow
Let the world turn, Let the curbs up, Cats Van Bags Yo!
I wish I had a bullet big enough to fucking kill the sun
I'm sick of songs about the summer
And I hate everyone
I'm gonna load my rifle gonna aim it at the dying star
I wanna live in a bubble
I need a getaway car
Hate, rain on me
Hate, rain on me
How can I be someone that you love 
If you hate me?
And how can I be someone you respect
If you call me lazy?
I've got to get out of my skin
But I don't know where to begin
And right now I feel worthless
And I feel crazy
Hate, rain on me
Hate, rain on me
I wanna put on my sweatpants
You know I'm trying to quit
I want to give a shit again
I wanna put on my sweatpants
But don't you know I'm trying to quit
I want to give a shit again
Hate, rain on me
Hate, rain on me
Take your mind back, I don't know when
Sometime when it always seemed to be just us and them
Girls that wore pink, boys that wore blue
Boys that always grew up better men than me and you
What's a man now, what's a man mean?
Is he rough or is he rugged, cultural and clean?
Now it's all changed, it's got to change more
We think it's getting better but nobody's really sure
And so it goes
Go 'round again
But now and then
We wonder who the real men are
See the nice boys dancing in pairs
Golden earring, golden tan, blow-wave in the hair
Sure they're all straight, straight as a line
All the guys are macho, see the leather shine
You don't want to sound dumb, don't want to offend
So don't call me a faggot, not unless you are a friend
Then if you're tall, handsome and strong
You can wear the uniform and I could play along
And so it goes
Go 'round again
But now and then
We wonder who the real men are
Time to get scared, time to change plan
Don't know how to treat a lady, don't know how to be a man
Time to admit what you call defeat
'Cause there's women running past you now and you just drag your feet
Man makes a gun, man goes to war
Man can kill and man can drink and man can take a whore
Kill all the blacks, kill all the reds
If there's war between the sexes then there'll be no people left
And so it goes
Go 'round again
But now and then
We wonder who the real men are
And so it goes
Go 'round again
But now and then
We wonder who the real men are
And so it goes
Go 'round again
But now and then
We wonder who the real men are
Instrumental
Roses in the hospital
Try to pull my finger nails out
Roses in the hospital
I want to cling to something soft
Roses in the hospital
Progressing like a constant war
Roses in the hospital
There's no one to feel ashamed for
All we wanted was a home
Now we're so strung out we wanna own
Like a leaf in the autumn breeze
Like a flood in January
We don't want your fucking love
Roses in the hospital
Stub cigarettes out on my arm
Roses in the hospital
Want to feel something of value
Roses in the hospital
Nothing really makes me happy
Roses in the hospital
Heroin is just too trendy
All we wanted was a home
Now we're so strung out we wanna own
Like a leaf in the autumn breeze
Like a flood in January
We don't want your fucking love
Roses in the hospital
This century achieved so much
Roses in the hospital
To make a voice no voice at all
Roses in the hospital
Flowers cannot express the loss
Roses in the hospital
Torn reflections of burnt out trash
Of burnt out trash
Forever ever delayed
Forever ever delayed
Forever
Forever
Forever ever delayed
Independence is a game
Forever ever delayed
Credibility, I'm yawning
Forever
Forever
Rudi Rudi Rudi Rudi gonna fail
Forever ever delayed
Forever delayed
Forever
Forever
Forever delayed
The West scratches onto my skin
Forever delayed
Contagious like a suntan
We never felt any sun
There's a tear in my heart where the blood ran out
There's a tear in my heart where the love ran out
I thought we worked, pushed toward the same ends
I'll never be so quick to trust, trust again
Disenchanted, disgusted
I regret that I trusted
I put my faith, my faith in you
You poisoned me through and through
I though we both shared the same injuries
Now I've found it's you who injures me
My heart is cracked from being left out in the cold
I know you'll pay for what you've taken, tenfold
Disenchanted, disgusted
I regret that I trusted
I put my faith, my faith in them
They twisted the knife further in
I got the razor at my wrist
'Cause I can't resist
I've got this fever burnin' fist
That does as I wish
But when I get downtown
And see what's around
I just know there's got to be
A better place to be found
Oh, god help me
The river runs red and I think I'm dyin'
Well I knew there'd come a day
When my mind would say 'hey are you afraid'
Well all I know is that I been down here tryin'
Well, I'll bleed on through the night
I suppose I'll be dead by the morning light
So don't be surprised if you mind when you find me
The river runs red and I think I'm dyin'
The river runs red and I think I'm dyin'
Oh, god help me
Tar and feathers hide your feelings
If you even know the meaning
Your high road is overrated
You left your guru out there hangin'
Don't stay
Don't stay
Your appetite's insatiable
Devouring one thousand souls
It's more or less the same ole story
The princess and the whore, the lady
Don't stay
Don't stay
Nobody sees it (nobody sees it)
Nobody hears it (nobody hears it)
Nobody breathin' in a coma
So keep your secret (so keep your secret)
Your perfect secrets (your perfect secrets)
It's just a game but no one's playin'
In a coma lying, waiting
Desire fills the lonely craving
So many trampled-under footwear
But more to fill the trophy cases
Don't stay
Don't stay
Nobody sees it (nobody sees it)
Nobody hears it (nobody hears it)
Nobody breathin' in a coma
So keep your secret (so keep your secret)
Your perfect secrets (your perfect secrets)
It's just a game but no one's playin'
Nobody sees it (nobody sees it)
Nobody hears it (nobody hears it)
Nobody breathin' in a coma
So keep your secret (so keep your secret)
Your perfect secrets (your perfect secrets)
It's just a game but no one's playin'
A deep sore dragged through ages
The sores are my own, I know
Wounds collected through a lifetime
And wisdom I pick up along the way
I received the spit from a snake
And the snare cut real deep
I was caught in her womb
Something spreading in my veins
Those walls I faced alone.
I crept on bounded knees
The own will just vanished.
I wept my compassion away,
With tears that flooded your heart.
No river leads back to mine.
I bow down in soil and whisper
I gather strength to spread the disease
It's the bird, it must have been the bird, disgusting critter, it must
We should have known better than to trust
This disease infested ball of lust and carnage
Piece of garbage with wings and she has the guts to sing
Get the bird, catch her, shoot her, I don't care
Get the bird, bring her down to the ground from out the air
Gotta tear her apart, let me at her first
Sink her to the level of the rest of us that inhabit the earth
What's she thinking? Does she really believe
That she's above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets
See her up in the tree, looking down at you and me
Like she's chosen over those who walk around on two feet
The bird, the melodies she play
The music she make, rubbing our faces in the feces of the daybreak
Trying to remind us it's time to awake
Antagonizing and instigating my hate
The chirps, I turn them into screams
My feathered friends' end will justify the means
Disturbed, I'll grab her by her beak
And swing her in circles until she's too dizzy to speak
Well I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(She's a snake that can fly) she's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better then me just because she's free?
I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(She's a snake that can fly) she's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better then me just because she's free?
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
My beautiful bird has gone away
Yeah...
I know what darkness means
(And the void you learned from me)
The isolation stings
(So it thick it wants to bleed)
The echoes in my brain
(All the things you said to me)
You took my everything
(Now I'm coming for you)
I won't back down
I will not bow
(I've come to bring you hell)
I can't forget
Things you did
(I've come to bring you hell)
The shadows that you see
(In places that you sleep)
Are memories of me
(Better pray your soul to keep)
The truth behind your eyes
(You know the thing you never see)
Your darkest little lies
(I'm coming for you)
For all the scars that never heal
All the wounds that will not seal
I will not forget the day
These memories never fall, yeah
I've come to bring you hell...
(I've come to bring you to hell)
I've come to bring you hell...
(I've come to bring you hell)
I've come to bring you hell...
(I've come to bring you to hell)
I've come to bring you hell...
(I've come to bring you hell)
I've come to bring you hell...
It's the same old situation, it seems it's coming 'round again
I won't play the fool, I'm not screwin' around
I only play to win
I only want what I deserve so who are you tryin' to kid
You can call it like you see it but I call it like it is
I'm sick of shruggin' off your petty little ways
The names are always changing, in the end it's just a game
We're runnin' in a circle
A never ending chase
You keep on steppin' out of reach but you won't win the race
No more waitin' around
No more hangin' around
No more draggin' me down
No more, no more
Everything's so easy for you but I've struggled to get this far
I'm alone in the fight
What's wrong, whose right
I take it all to heart
Your true colors start to show
You call yourself a friend? The teams are drawn
You chose your side, you'll get yours in the end
You play along to the same old song just as long as you can win
When someone better comes along, you're too cool to let them in
So now I've got you wonderin' if I've got it in for you
I'd like to tell you different but I can't because it's true
No more waitin' around
No more hangin' around
No more draggin' me down
No more, no more
So now I've got you wonderin' if I've got it in for you
I'd like to tell you different but I can't because it's true
Your name here
A witch will burn
When she's thrown into the fire
Not her she'll peel and writhe
But never expire
She crawls on webs of lies
I die up inside her
To take what's mine
That bitch, the cinnamon spider
I won't try
And I every time I tell that lie, I live without guilt
And I won't cry
And I hope you love your life
And live with your guilt
Consumed by hate and guilt
She'll never retire
Too old to fix
Too dead to ever acquire
Slit wrists- talk shit
But she will never inspire a plan to save herself
The cinnamon spider
I won't try
And every time I tell that lie, I live without guilt
And I won't cry
And I hope you love your life
And live with your guilt
Bit heads off those who fail and try to imply her
Forlorn dispised
I am the cinnamon spider
I won't try
And every time I tell that lie, I live without guilt
And I won't cry
And I hope you love your life
And live with your guilt
And I am fine
And I'll learn to take what's mine
And live without guilt
Oh yeah
Last night I was cool at the pool hall
Held the table for eleven games
Nothing was easier than the first seven
I beat a woman with varicose veins.
She stopped to see herself in the mirror
Fix her hair and hide heir veins
And she lost the game.
Next day I went to the dentist
He pulled some teeth and I lost some blood
We'd like to thank you for the cards you sent us
My wives and I were all choked up.
I recall how Caesar and Cleo
Made love in the Milky Way
They needed boats and armies to get there
I know there's a better way.
I saw the movie and I read the book
But when it happened to me
I sure was glad I had what it took
To get away.
Gotta get away, gotta get away
Gotta get away, gotta get away
I'm making another delivery
Of chemicals and sacred roots
I'll hold what you have to give me
But I'll use what I have to use.
The lasers are in the lab
The old man is dressed in white clothes
Everybody says he's mad
No one knows the things that he knows.
No one knows, no one knows
No one knows, no one knows
I'm sleepin' in every hallway
I just can't accept the stares
I'm using too many covers
I'm warm now so I don't care.
I'm thinkin' of no one in my mind
Sedan delivery is a job I know I'll keep
It sure was hard to find.
Hard to find. hard to find
Hard to find. hard to find
(Limped up like a dog with three legs [shut up.] to the stage)
So many dark arts to choose
You can focus till the phobias evolve in forty hues
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Tune into the prudence of the dark heart news
Breathing's a tug of war
Wet when I rushed aboard
Plus twenty nine bust gum stuck cluster door
Slumped in the back Burn bush by the son of George
Sweat, tear, and feed 'cause I don't bleed when I cut no more
A system of gods from each of the brawling tribes
So my bible is a pot of cons clipped and collaged
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
I don't speak the language but my last laugh's hell
Spiral, get vertigo
Signals that flash and beat
Postin my head from myself to get back to me
Pouch full of dynamite, blast cap anatomy
Bags full of smelling salts, mad as the magazine
Attack medic stretcher call cracked crazy header fall
A threat, a break, a mistake with the pulse
Picking every last fuckin' piece of paint off the walls
Ok the rotary phoner grow to be notably mobile
In social gopher tea formals or any scene where brie is normal
He will locate every exit in seconds to flee the wormhole
When emergency diversions ring the celly or the doorbell
Burnin it at both ends, friends let's commiserate
Turning into something, to the sound that the triggers make
Born at the badder side, half this time still await
Trainin' all my zeroes to perform like they're figure eights

Hey, four corners of the globe, all invent fire
On the very same day in the very same cold
Each sent a man with a torch to the borderline to boast
Watch them collide and explode
When I peal the blind back, up jumps the iron cough
Monky wrench in my hand, razor cut the eyelids off
Homemade 'tached memories
I ignore the private calls
And ever since the 80s I think something's in my Tylenol
What plague make an idling brigade
So eager to walk plans
They will climb a tree and wait
Irony is waiting over piety and faith
So when the ghostly ruminations that are kindly disobeyed
I'm gonna live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint
To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks
Can't hold howls and corrals with a key,
So will the worms please shriek on the count of three (three!)
If I had a dollar for every time I couldn't sleep,
I could buy a million locks and finally read a book in peace
No more would my president come off as a crooked thief
And turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me
Sideways eye on a sinister boundary
Peddlin' contemporaries killin' me loudly
99 models of fear on the wall timorous
Done run akin to the car on the lawn cinderblocks
Whether you levitate or bend spoons (x4)
Three legged dogs that chewin the wrong food
Riff raff []
Land sharks stole the tape, money money booze

Eat yourself out of house and home
Go home, there's nothing there because
You ate yourself out of house and home
Throw up, you do it again
Make a meal of nothing at all
Why? It makes you feel better
Anything in your life you own
It's alright if it makes you feel better
Cut yourself up and down your arms
Both arms and it makes you feel better
They're your arms, it's none of my business, it's
It's none of my business if it makes you feel better
Fucking you is a total stranger
You picked him up but he's a total stranger
Why? It makes you feel better
It's none of my business if it makes him heal better
It's alright if it makes you feel better
It's alright if it makes you feel better
It's alright if it makes you feel better
It's alright if it makes you feel better
It's alright if it makes you feel better
It's alright if it makes you feel better
It's alright if it makes you feel better
It's alright if it makes you feel better
It's alright if it makes you feel better
It's alright if it makes you feel better
It's alright if it makes you feel better
It's alright if it makes you feel better
Niccolite under blowpipe gives off foul fumes
Halite rock salt tastes salty
Cinnabar volatilizes under blowpipe on charcoal
Dolomite effervesces slowly if powdered
Hornblende flakes have wedge shape
Willemite turns green with cobalt nitrate
Feldspar, the one to choose for cleaning spaces
Galena perfect cubic cleavage
Never thought I'd be this way
Hung on every word you say
Scars that you gave to me
I earned all too eagerly
Cause down inside of you
(Down inside of you)
Deep inside of you
(Deep inside)
Down inside of you
(Down inside of you)
Is all of Heaven and Hell
Everyday is all the same
Take the pleasure with the pain
Things that you put me through
Never is enough for you
So I'll fly far away
Find another life (far away)
I know somewhere it's right
So why can't I forget you?
I stopped the thought before its drip became insistent.
I rubbed it out and loved the spot where it were missing.
She's widely known, the only maquereau that pays her taxes.
I got to box her for the money, said it might end...

This is not novelty
This is nothing delicate
This is the result of some Google search for something relevant
Stake claim immediately
Cause hot products cool down
At which point will flot the new sounds
Take fame intravenously
But when nature turns to habit
I'll be sure to leave the scene and start stacking it
This is nothing fraudulent
This is that sure shot itchy finger lingering behind your target audience
You got 'em all convinced
But we ain't buying it buddy
Demand for lies is high
And you're supplying it
Truth is brutal and consumes you if you let it
Type that in your little away message and set it.

Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs for me
Man you're boring me what you ought to be
Keep singing songs for me
Just following the leader with your blah blah blah
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep.
(Gym Class Heroes:)
And this is not a fashion statement
It's elegant intuition
Far beyond your bed wetter kindergarten compositions
This is a part of me
How can you sleep at night
When what you don't bite you write half-heartedly
Go join the army
And be the best you can be
Give new meaning to blowing up overseas
Please
We kick them doors down when nobody would let us in
And give you that proverbial taste of your own medicine
We took your formula and relabeled it
And sat patiently and giggled it when you drank it
See poison street cred weigh just about the same reflesh
Pop bottles and dropped names
And you'll dismiss it cause it isn't what you're used to.
But who the fuck died and made you King Koopa?
(Kids Of Crush High:)
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep

Man you're boring me what you ought to be

That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep.

Wow congratulations on your new purchase
I heard you bought a crib on biters block downtown plagiarism's paradise
You're not a movement
You're purely amusement
The poster boy for Xerox and the role model for parasites
You serve no purpose
You're purely decorative
And bore use to death with your auditory sedatives
Oh they don't see
No, we don't sleep
And hog tie your runaway bride with cold feet
We built this city on lock and load logic
And burned it down the same night
So go ahead and put your tears on ice baby
I think we got a winner
And kiss your crucifix your boy's a certified sinner.

I never jumped in and rescued you
But I wanted to
I didn't tell you which way to go
'Cause I thought you'd know
You had a problem with your new-found wealth
Brought it on yourself
I never told I told you so
But I told you so
Have to let it go
It's time to let it go
Now I can't believe
It took so long to leave
Perhaps one day I'll grieve
Or I never will
I never told you I agreed with you
I don't think I do
I wasn't sure quite what the whole thing meant
But I'm glad you went
I never thought that it could be painless
But it is I guess
I had myself fooled into meeting you
Did I fool you too?
Have to let it go
It's time to let it go
Now I can't believe
Took so long to leave
Perhaps one day I'll grieve
Or I never will
A viral infection
That can incubate for years
Caused by affection
Falling deep into arrears
No medication to procure
Makes me pure
There's no cure
I am sure
I never mentioned how I've prayed for you
Now I've paid for you
I never said that I would wait for you
It's too late for you
It's time to let it go
Now I can't believe
It took so long to leave
Perhaps one day I'll grieve
Or I never will
Or I never will
I never will
Oh I
Oh I
Oh I
I Never will
Never will
I cannot distance myself
You were the one who believed
That only half of a girl
Half more than you could deceive
I watch your face on TV
All that I am turns to fear
When you're the boy that I want
I will be waiting right here
I don't know what to believe
Sew up the sore make it fake
When you're the boy that I want
I'll be the girl that you hate
You end up dead in the end
Star no star
You end up right here my friend
Star no star
We end up dead in the end
Star no star
We end up right here my friend
Star no star
I can not distance myself
You were the one who believed
That only half of a girl
Have you but never have me
I see your face on the street
Burnt hands but features so clear
When I'm the girl that you want
I will be waiting right here
I don't know what to believe
Peel all the scars from our way
When you're the boy that I want
We will have one perfect day
You end up dead in the end
Star no Star
You end up right here my friend
Star no Star
We end up dead in the end
Star no Star
We end up right here my friend
Star no Star
I am so distant myself
I guess I never believed
That you could take it away
And I'd have no time to grieve
I don't believe in TV
I don't believe in the fear
When you are searching for stars
You will be looking right here
You end up dead in the end
Star no Star
You end up right here my friend
Star no Star
We end up dead in the end
Star no Star
We end up right here my friend
Star no Star
We end up right here my friend
Star no Star
We end up right here my friend
Star no Star
We end up right here my friend
Star no Star
Closing comments made you wonder
What was the start of it all
Hunting to find the answers
Unavailing attempts to be me
Hey
Did we distract you
Did we prevent you
Did we bore you
Did we stop you
And I'm
Betayed by you
Won't be overlooked by you
Betayed
Betayed
Hoped you were thinking of redemption
Found out you erased the memories
Erased the thought of me
How can I believe this untrue
I know I'm not insane
Come take a look in my eyes
...2... 3...
This song goes out to my good friends
Especially the ones I had before the Grammy Nominations in 2003
And to all the girls from back in high school
Who actually spoke to me even though I was a fat kid and a marching band geek
I hope this song finds you well
And I hope that you're doin' fuckin' swell
I hope that you're back up if you've ever been down
And I hope you got the fuck out of our hometown!
Here comes a shout-out to the professor
Who said, "Son, pick a path and stay the same, cause charisma is the key to opportunity."
And to all the clubs that let us play
To our family and friends and the music stores for giving us gear when we couldn't pay.
I hope this song finds you well
And I hope that you're doin' fuckin' swell
I hope that you're back up if you've ever been down
And I hope you got the fuck out of our hometown!
You know I can't count how many times I've heard people say
(Heard people say)
Be proud of where you're from, you're gonna put us on the map
But where the hell were you back in the day?
(Back in the day)
No one came to see us so we got the hell out of there, so there.
You have a d-d-d-d-d-d this song goes out to my big brother
For putting up with me following you around
And for making me smile when things at home weren't great
And for not getting pissed when I humped your girlfriend
For letting me take your car to the prom
For beating up the guys that hung my bike in a tree
For hand-me-down albums and guitar with no strings
And for never beating the shit outta me!
I hope this song finds you well
And I hope that you're doin' fuckin' swell
I hope that you're back up 'cause I know you've been down
I just wish you'd get the fuck out of our hometown!
I hope you get the fuck out of our hometown!
I'm so glad I got the fuck out of our hometown!
You know what I'm talking about, dontcha? Dammit!
(You've been naughty, very very naughty)
Are you cut up or do you easily forget?
Are you still around, why haven't you managed to die yet?
You could prop up the bar in hell
How do you sleep, you've never loved
Why was I never good enough?
You thought you'd leave me falling forever
Karma killer
Needless to say, I guess you know I hate you
You're so full of sin even the devil rates you
I hope you choke on your Bacardi and Coke
How do you breathe, why don't you cry?
How come you never ask me why?
You're not a man, stand and deliver
Karma killer
How do you sleep, you've never loved
Why was I never good enough?
You thought you'd leave me falling forever
Karma killer, karma killer
Karma killer, karma killer
I hope you choke on your Bacardi and Coke
Look what you didn't take from me
Look what you didn't take from me
Look what you didn't take from me
Look what you didn't take from me
No no no no no no no no no no no no
(I don't need to take revenge 'cause they're coming to get you)
No no no no no no no no no no no no
(There's no hope for you my friend 'cause they're coming to get you)
Karma killer
Karma killer
Karma killer...

Chaos
This world is a chaos, this life is a chaos CHAOS!
Attitude
Live your life
Not the way they taught you
Do what you feel
Survive the jungle
Give me blood
Give me Pain
These scars won't heal
Can you take it
Can you take it
Can you take it
Motherfucker
What were you thinking
What a wonderful world
You're full of shit
Leave it behind
They don't care if you cry
All is left is pain
I won't take it
I won't take it
I won't take it
No
The song remains insane
I remain insane
Chico Science talking about a folktale from northern Brasil
Called "A Perna Cabiluda" (The Hairy Leg)
One thing is for sure I don't need it
Makes my life a war, What a bore
Don't you understand
It wasn't ever my plan
I guess you just can't see
What you do when you blame it all on me
White like that
I'm white like that
It's all the same
Said one thing and mean another
Who are you gonna lose?
Who are you gonna choose?
What do you think I'm gonna do?
What are you thinking?
White like that
I'm white like that
It's all the same
They call me white trash
White like that
I'm white like that
It's all the same
White like that
I'm white like that
It's all the same game
So who's gonna lose?
Who's gonna lose?
It's whereabouts that won't cave in
Scenes of violence protect this
In aching heart that will begin
To wrestle with obstruction
And I'd stay for ages, if I could
To wake you
I'd stay for ages, If I could
To wake you
In taking hold to waste within
Coping as best as you can with;
The way it is does not have to be
As long as it stays unwritten
And I'd stay for ages, if I could
To wake you
I'd stay for ages, If I could
To wake you
Speak to me in tongues
And you speak in tongues to me
Speak to me in tongues
And you speak in tongues to me
And I'd stay for ages, if I could
To wake you
And I'd stay for ages, If I could
To wake you
And I'd stay for ages,
And I'd stay for ages to wake you

"Folks I know you're all dying to know how long--
I cannot answer that now. We're gonna have to remain as technicians come over
And take a look at it and uh once that's done, then we'll give you an estimate
I'd say it's probably at least uh 15 minutes or so."
It's like all of Franklin Avenue now sleeps upon my chest--my chest
I've used cigarette butts and loose leaves to build my nest--build my nest
Did I mention I appreciate the way you treat your guests?--guess not
But I'm not really convinced when you say that you're impressed--hell no
The line between MC and comedian gets a little thinner--little thinner
Now it's nothing but ruffage for lunch and punchlines for dinner--feed me
I've tried to open the blinds to let in some sunshine
Wound the watch till it broke all in hopes of stopping the time
The key broke off in the ignition humping if I wandered off through my thoughts wishing
Hoping this could be for you but it is for me patiently I stay busy, I wait, I see [X2]
It's the sure shot [X6]
See it's simple--simple, it's not that I want to make it ripple--ripple
But I feel I'm only being civil--civil
When I sit back and giggle like the rest it's the ritalin-a-fest!
I'm stressed--stressed, but most of 'em would never guess--never guess
That I'm closing in upon the dredge
Why? 'Cause I think it'd be best for the who? To hide the mess from who?
It's all true--it's all true not good but I know it'll do--it'll do
Still trying to reach the kid in you
So I may continue to find why this childproof's so wild
I smile--smile, tired, I walked a thousand miles--miles
Wired over the thoughts I've dialed--dialed
Inspired by the monsters, the files of life full of stars and stripes
(Chorus End)
If you wanna sleep with me and talk about existence
We'll need more than 15 minutes
I'll tell you what let's forget about the fame
Push pause on the game and get to know each other by our real names
If you wanna sleep with me and talk about existence
We'll need more than 15 minutes
I'll tell you what let's forget about the fame
Push pause on the game and get to know each other by our first names
If you wanna sit with me and talk about existence
We'll need more than 15 minutes
I'll tell you what let's forget about the fame
Push pause on the game... What the fuck's your name?
It's freezing in Bristol
There's love on the telly
A girl grinning at me
She's doing the shimmy
And she's cool
And she's skinny
And she's a fool
For the last living rock king
It's her thrill
It's her wonder
It's her will
It's her way home
She's right where she always wanted to be
She can't change, change, change
It's lighting in London (it's lighting in London)
There's shit on the telly (there's shit on TV)
You're pushing my buttons (pushing my buttons)
You know how to touch me
And I knew
That you'd choose me
By the times
That you tried to refuse me
It's your thrill
It's your wonder
It's your will
It's your way home
You're right where you always wanted to be
You can't change, change, change, woah
It's morning in Philly (it's morning in Philly)
My head's feeling heavy (my head's feeling heavy)
The sun makes me dizzy (the sun makes me sick)
You monkey, you left me 
And I know
That you miss me
By the way
That you kiss and resist me 
It's my wonder
It's my will
It's my way home
I'm right where I always dreamed I would be
I can't change, change, change, woah
I know them
I see the world, and it's full of hate
Around me, hypocrites, and I know them
They want to take away my emotions
But I resist; I will destroy them
I know them
Great future, safe life, money, abundance
They promise everything, but it's bullshit
I'm not a motherfucker ignorant
I will strike...
I will fight...
They cannot take my life
They cannot stop me
They cannot take my rights
No...!
They cannot control me
They cannot change me
They cannot repress me
No...!
Never!
I know them
I go ahead, never, never turn back
Live your fucking life and give me respect
I have my life, and it's only mine
I will strike...
I will fight...
Is this a feeling of something about to happen?
Like snapping out of something I didn't realize I was in,
Was I sleeping? What? How can you be so sure?
If you've never been here before?
I don't understand, it can't be that easy,
I love you, I hate you, I love you, I hate you,
I can't keep my hands off you,
I love you, I hate you, I love you, I hate you.
Get back, get away from them, it's all wrong,
Keep calm for a moment, look in my eyes,
Get back, get away 'cause this could get ugly,
If you think that I'll let you go,
You're out of your mind.
Oh my god, I'm not supposed to say this,
And I know that you're trouble but,
Is that your real name and why are you doing this?
And how did I get here?
Ok, no more questions, no worries,
It's destination unknown, so dive in,
The waters great,
Listen I'm starting to speak like you,
I love you, I hate you, I love you, I hate you,
You can do no wrong,
I love you, I hate you, I love you, I hate you.
Get back, get away from them, it's all wrong,
Keep calm for a moment, look in my eyes,
Get back, get away 'cause this could get ugly,
If you think that I'll let you go,
You're out of your mind,
You're out of your mind,
You're out of your mind.
Anata ga koe no, (Hey, your voice)
Anata sono made hashitai no, (I just wanted you to talk about it...)
Anata ga koe no,
Anata sono made hashitai no.
Get back, get away from them, it's all wrong,
Keep calm for a moment, look in my eyes,
Get back, get away 'cause this could get ugly,
If you think that I'll let you go,
You're out of your mind, get,
You're out of your mind, get,
You're out of your mind, get,
You're out of your mind.
Short sleeved shit kicking animals lining me up
It's all over their face
Here's a new chicken shit angel eyed boy
With a face to rip open all night
Step up to the line, boys
Cover your eyes as they fire their guns
The Friday night abattoir spills out into
The streets
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
This boy's taking the easy way out
'Cause there's nothing like a midnight run
Don't you tell me not to hide
You've got to grit your teeth and try to keep them too
Curled up in a can they don't know where I am
I'll spend the night in here
Cowered in the trash till 4 A.M.
You missed another one
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack
Here comes the panzer attack

She's yelling on the phone, she's yelling on the phone again.
And she's banging on the door; she's losing all control again.
What's she doing in the tub?
She's shooting up the junk again.
And all the water in the stream couldn't ever wash her clean, in my mind.
And I'm Leaving
Demon with the needles leaning over your shoulder.
It's over.
I pictured this differently.
I cast us in perfect light.
I'd trade an eternity, for what's been taken away.
Feels like the future for you and me, fades in the failing light,
This time you drowned us in misery, that's why you forced me to say
Goodbye, my love, so long, you've thrown us away.
It's been going on for months, said she'd only done it once with friends.
I couldn't keep her clean at all, every dealer that she called was a friend.
Believe it.
Demon with the needles leaning over your shoulder.
It's over.
I pictured this differently.
I cast us in perfect light.
I'd trade an eternity, for what's been taken away.
Feels like the future for you and me, fades in the failing light,
This time you drowned us in misery, that's why you forced me to say
Goodbye, my love, so long, you've thrown us away.
I remember how it worked, back when we were both in love again, made-up memories.
They were few and far between, no it wasn't meant to be from then.
Been stuck inside a dream, woke up and I could breathe the air.
Been down this road before I'll make it on my own I swear.
Feels like, I pictured this differently, our lives, I cast us in perfect light, this time.
I'd trade an eternity, that's why, you fucking forced me to say
Goodbye, I'm saving her, my love, I wave to her
So long, you've thrown us away.
Flattered that you think I warrant ugliness.
Gutters drain west, mud made a mess of us.
It's time to leave this place.
I'd saw through your wrist to find a better trap that fits.
I'd saw through your traps to find a better you.
A part of you that lasts.
I saw through your trap and into my own wrists.
Saw we were through, red ribbons spill to blue:
A sight to sore your eyes.
I got this dress.
I'm hiking it around this waste of laughter.
Slow dance alone with no one to the sound of four hands clapping.
Congratulations to you both, I hope you're happy.
If there's a moral to this story then I wish you'd show me.
Hair in the blood, fly in the disappointment.
Rubber, I'm glue.
I'll write the book on you.
It's sticking to my face.
You need a little less than what you take for granted.
This is the sip that's drinking back from you,
Blacking out your eyes.
You need a little more suppression of you appetites.
This is your honeymoon, in separate rooms,
It's neither sweet nor bright.
I made a word to give this state a name, this game a guess.
I call it "sluttering."
It means as little as your little test.
You are your worst revenge.
Your very means, they have no ends.
This is a story you won't tell the kids we'll never have.
If you hear this song a hundred times it still won't be enough.
(Ill Bill)
Non-Phixion be the real hip hop
We make you wanna kill cops
Cats hatin', 'cause they know I finga girls twats
You feel helpless, real jealous, we killed Elvis
I shot Reagan with the help of the secret service
Super double agent, shoot your mother with my brothers favorite
12 gauge waving at your brain, strange universe, I'm too famous
Leaving the murder scene blameless, drug entertainment
Thugs that'll blaze with laser guns
Saying what I wrote, you feel what I feel
They see the same picture
We made a biscuit do the talk and it became richer
Nobody gets a record deal, you gotta take that shit
Treat the record label like a slut, then rape that bitch
I keep it simple for these stupid cats
Claiming you the facts, but in reality, you a trap
Jesus Christ was a gangsta rapper
They killed him then he came back and made a platinum album
The path that travels like the dragon shadow
Invisible to CIA camera angles
They got a file on every rap group
They killed the last man that had proof
They after me for information that I have too
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I'm'a have to blast you
The CIA tryna kill me, we bad news
Get the fuck up out my way when I pass through
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I'm'a have to blast you
The CIA tryna kill me, we bad news
Fuck around with Non-Phixion that's a bad move
(Sabac Red)
Symbolisms, socialism's live life lead, learn
Struggle war whole drug fiends, the white house burn
Sex, pain, fear, freedom love, young guns be shootin
Genocide, revolution, lost souls, prostitutin
Military confrontation, safe sex, and masturbation
Peace to all the homeless people livin' in the train station
Project war, spill the one verse four
Lock the door, burn the disc now everybody hit the mutha fuckin' floor
They bustin' out a blunt for this shit
I'm number six on they list next to kiss and all these kids
'Cause I run wit Asians, Latinos and Black fists
5 percent is caucasians thugs who live communist
They broke in my house, planted bugs in ma lamps and my couch
They after me, what? Let me find out
I'm not havin' it, My rap attract the service like a magnet
The bastards gettin' under like crowded parties wit no laminents
If I'm'a die, I'm'a die bustin' and strugglin
I'm hostile for the people, for those devils and corruptions
Nuttin for nuttin, and if somehow they do
They ID me due to my tattoo
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I'm'a have to blast you
The CIA tryna kill me, we bad news
Get the fuck up out my way when I pass through
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I'm'a have to blast you
The CIA tryna kill me, we bad news
Fuck around with Non-Phixion that's a bad move
(Goretex)
Projects for straight jackets, electric shock states
A rock could fall out, traded for royalty rates
Get ya drink on, we build the bombs, spit in ya face
Smart to change cars like cruise the block I do it for chase
Nice spite work, the fancy knife work
Hit to Chirst Non-Phixion striking prison Ice shirts
I paid dues, nothin' to lose, Steady bustin' off weapons In 2's
When I come home I be smellin shit and furnitures moved
Eat a slug, take some weight off, I lit it so real
I do this for the dead, rest in peace I'm holdin' you near
Makin' on time, 12 years we on tour we blow you back off
Support cats that jack the car seats and tear ya scalp off
Soldiers of merits, inherited for way back
Cyanide in bullets, so I should follow my stats
We too futuristic, thugs to robots, experiments
Four point restraint and my hyper cube on medicines
Pain Veterans, crippling souls
Its gettin' bigger now the information runnin' the globe
Its just my mechanics, either wit a gat or (x) anax
Why spread panic until the sabbath?
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I'm'a have to blast you
The CIA tryna kill me, we bad news
Get the fuck up out my way when I pass through
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I'm'a have to blast you
The CIA tryna kill me, we bad news
Fuck around with Non-Phixion that's a bad move
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
Anymore
You hurt me
Lied to me
You earned my trust but then you
Bitred me, my family
You wanted all control so
You cut down everyone
Who ever stand in your way
I'm moving on
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
No, I don't care about you
Anymore
I forgive you now I'm moving on
Moving on
Moving on
Consumed by selfishness
You wanted nothing less then
To see me leave because
I ruined all your plans so
So you spread lies
Compromise, me and the family's very lives
I'm done with you
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
No, I don't care about you
Anymore
I forgive you now I'm moving on
Your left in the past
But I'm not looking back
Anymore
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
Anymore
I forgive you now I'm moving on
I don't care
I don't care about you
Moving on
I don't care
I don't care about you
Anymore
I forgive you now I'm moving on
I forgive you now I'm moving on
I don't care
I don't care about you
I don't care
I don't care about
Would you go outside
I asked you to leave
I had enough of this ruckus
I wanna sleep
You say you're feeling lonely
I got to agree
I feel it coming slowly
Slowly to me
Here comes, here comes the night train
And here comes, here comes the night train
Making a point in conversations
That I'll never hold
Protect myself from rumours
That will never be told
Choking on beauty
I usually don't even see
I'm living life through someone else
Looking at me
Here comes, here comes the night train
And here comes, here comes the night train
And here comes, here comes the night train
Now all the evil thoughts I had
And all the harm I ever did
Stand right before me, eyes wide open
Where were they hidden?
I'm gonna rip it up, bring it down
Send it to hell
Oh, somebody teach me something new
Somebody as guilty as me can break this spell
Here comes, here come the night train
And here comes, here come the night train
And here comes, here come the night train
(Make it stop, oh, I can't make it stop, it's on again)
Get up, put up, open your eyes
Let the black blooded vein come to your brain
Angels round here don't sing
They have a curse upon me
(Make it stop, oh, I can't make it stop, it's on again)
The shame, the lovers
The tricks, the blessings
The rebound, the future
Is used, it feels like you used it up
I look at you, I pity you
I dream of you, what are you
Drop a name, leave it there
Bruise a heart, leave it there
Pay the entrance, leave it there
Get some style, cut your hair
Shouldn't be this, shouldn't be that
Take the heat, take a free kick, man
Try to get a grip on these times
'Cause the harder that I chase, the harder you're running
You don't have to be impatient for something that ain't coming
I tried to sneak myself through, tried to get to the other side
I tried to patch up the cracks and the holes that I have to hide
For a little bit of time even made it work okay
Just long enough to really make it hurt
When they figured me out and it all just rotted away
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Go on, get back to where you belong
You better take a good look 'cause I'm full of shit
With every bit of my heart I have tried to believe in it
You can dress it all up you can try to pretend
(You can try to pretend, you can try to pretend)
But you can't change anything
You can't change anything in the end
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Go on get back to where you belong
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Don't you fucking know what you are? (go on get back to where you belong)
Don't you fucking know what you are? (go on get back to where you belong)
Don't you fucking know what you are? (go on get back to where you belong)
Don't you fucking know what you are? (go on get back to where you belong)
In the land of dirt and plaster
Lies an army of a thousand nowhere kids
Losing ground and falling faster
Into a life that no one should have to live
We are the people that you hate
We are the bastards that you created
A generation with no place
A generation of all your sons and daughters
Behind the fake family image
Behind the smile of a thousand moms and dads
Inside the cage that we've been given
I see an image of the future that we don't have
We are the people that you hate
We are the bastards that you created
A generation with no place
A generation of all your sons and...
We are the people that you hate
The fucking bastards that you created
A generation with no place
A generation of all your sons and daughters
And what did you expect...
A perfect child...
Raised by TV sets...
Abandoned every mile...
We never get respect...
Never a fair trial...
No one gives a shit ...
As long as we smile...
Smile...
Smile...
We are the people that you hate
We are the bastards that you created
A generation with no place
A generation of all your sons and...
We are the people that you hate
The fucking bastards that you created
A generation with no place
A generation of all your sons and daughters
I'm told the case is now closed
So I can come to my senses
But when the question is posed
I'll have this meager defense
I was hoping that you'd know better than that
I was hoping, but you're an amateur
I was hoping that you'd know better
But I've been wrong before
Despite conclusions I drew
There was a chance you'd surprise me
And you'd be better than new
'Cause I'd have left otherwise
I was hoping that you'd know better than that
I was hoping, but you're an amateur
I was hoping that you'd know better
But I've been wrong before
So I wasn't thinking clearly
So you didn't think at all
I thought that was protocol
I was hoping that you'd know better than that
I was hoping, but you're an amateur
I was hoping that you'd know better
But I've been wrong before
I was hoping that
I was hoping, but you're an amateur
I was hoping that you'd know better
But I've been wrong before
I want you to know
That I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but
The best for you both
An older version of me? Is she perverted like me?
Would she go down on you in a theater?
Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died? But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well
Things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well
I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face, how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name 
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died? but you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Ooh
Ahh
Ooh ah
Oh ah ah
Ooh ah
Ah ah ah oh
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?
Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
It's our time
To make a stand
You and me one by one
Up against the man
It's about time
To understand
You and me, we're the ones
With the upper hand
Revolution
Can you hear me
This is our time
Revolution
Are you with me
It's about time
It's our time
Where here to stay
It's begun everyone better fuckin' pray
It's about time
Were not afraid
One by one by the gun
Now your gonna pay
I think it's our time for
Revolution
Can you hear me
This is our time
Revolution
Are you with me
It's about time
Our whole life we've felt the upper hand of the man
Who was born into the wealth of this sytematic fuckin' scam
And never had the ability to ever fucking understand
Or the patience or the courage or the strength to withstand god damn
The weight of the world is on the shoulders of the man who can
But that's the way it is and it's the way it's always fucking been
Forever and ever since this cold black world began
Ruled by greed and by pocrisy and the superficial mind fuck again
Revolution

Kumpikaan meistä ei oo eikä ollut kultaa
Vaikka me niin annettiin olettaa
Ei huomattu lainkaan
Et kuinka ollaan velkaa
Kuin vasta nyt kun nenää
Siihen painetaan
Kumpikin toistaan paremmin
Tiesi jokaisen vaiheen
Kumarrettiin kuvaa peilissä
Pahempi toistaan kumpikin on
Ja kuinka nyt ne tappaa toisiaan
Sokeina toistaa lausetta samaa
Kuinka ne on tässä oikeessa
Rumempi toistaan kumpikin teko
Eikä niitä tekemättömiksi saa
Eikä ne huomaa kumpikin on
Vain pahempi toistaan
Varmoina voimasta ja niin helvetin ylpeet
ilmeet kasvoilla me kaaduttiin
Synnytä uudestaan
Ei muuta kuin lauluissa
Kun jokaiselle jää
Laskut huveistaan
Kuningas ilman valtikkaa kuin on kuningatarkin
Vielä kumartavat peileilleen
Pahempi toistaan kumpikin on
Ja kuinka nyt ne tappaa toisiaan
Sokeina toistaa lausetta samaa
Kuinka ne on tässä oikeessa
Rumempi toistaan kumpikin teko
Eikä niitä tekemättömiksi saa
Eikä ne huomaa kumpikin on
Vain pahempi toistaan
Katkeemaan ei sitä mitenkään saa
Turhempaa ei oo olemassakaan
Huomaa vaan kun joku sanoo jotain sellaista
Mitä kuulla haluaa
Ei haittaa onko edes tottakaan
Oikeuttaa kalleintansa tuhlaamaan
Pahempi toistaan kumpikin on
Ja kuinka nyt ne tappaa toisiaan
Sokeina toistaa lausetta samaa
Kuinka ne on tässä oikeessa
Rumempi toistaan kumpikin teko
Eikä niitä tekemättömiksi saa
Eikä ne huomaa kumpikin on
Vain pahempi toistaan
When you said you loved me, did you really love me?
Or did the words just spill out
Like drool on my pillow.
'Cause I was naked
When you said those words,
But I felt covered in your whispered worship.
And as you passed out fast on my shoulder,
I imagined a child
Waiting so sad and still for his mom to arrive.
Did she leave you an orphan,
In that big, brown leather chair?
Said, "Don't you move a muscle, kid,
I'll be back in twenty years,"
You were scared, you were lonely,
But you must've been aware;
Life is a series of calluses,
This is just another layer.
So, build'em up, tough it out,
Yeah, that's your skin;
Don't let anyone under there.
When you said you needed me,
Did you really need me?
Or was I just someone?
Oh, you'd take anything.
Am I first on that list of yours,
Or am I second, or third?
So, who's that ahead of me,
Some harlot from Pittsburgh?
Or Detroit, Santa Fe, or San Diego?
I know you're so alone,
But how much affection does one guy really need?
Did you date a lot in high school?
Were you always chasing girls?
Couldn't you find some young valentine
To steal your heart for good?
Were you content, or contemptible?
Are your memories pleasant,
Or is it a string of endless flings of bitter resentment.
Seems that what you want and what you need
Doesn't mean a thing, we're just here for the taking.
When you said you'd hurt me,
Did you think you hurt me?
Are you really that cocky?
Oh, what a heartbreaker!
Well, I've got my armor
Yeah, I've been through some battles before.
And I met your old girlfriend,
She said, "Baby, don't bother."
She told me you told her you'd hurt her
Funny, how familiar.
So, how much of this relationship was rehearsed?
Did you act out as a child?
Were you always crying wolf?
Attention-starved, you tried too hard
To get someone to look.
Now you're the wolf in second-hand clothing.
I'm the sheep in a pleated skirt.
It's an awkward form of payback,
But if it works for you, it works.
It's that I recognize your off-white lies,
Still, I lie beside you
And that's what really hurts.
When you said you'd leave me
Well, why haven't you left me?
What are we still doing here,
So desperate for company?
There's a greyhound on Jackson Street,
There's an airport in Council Bluffs.
Hell, there's a car in the driveway.
Fifty ways to get lost.
But as I hold you and listen to you sleeping,
I'm starting to wonder if you really believe
That you'd ever really leave.
Would you leave me, and orphan,
In that big, brown leather chair?
The one you've lugged around from town to town for all these years.
It's the trophy of your childhood,
Like a shark's tooth or gator skin boots
But this one holds you prisoner
It holds me prisoner too.
What we need to set us free
Is to let go of each other - let go of everything.
When I said I loved you,
It was because I loved you.
When I said I needed you,
Well, I really need you.
Yeah, I guess you hurt me,
For once you're a man of your word.
Well, guess what
I'm leaving.
I can't be your prisoner.
I won't.
I walk without you, but I need to believe
I've got my own eyes now and I want you to see
There's no discretion in my voice and you need to stand clear
I've been falling out of time, but I want you to hear
And I don't think you care to know
But you've taken out my heart and soul
They'll never break you, but you keep it comin'
I've got my own crimes now and I won't let you in
You can't appreciate it and I need to feel whole
I've gotta find a place to hide where I know you won't go
'Cause I don't think you care to know
But you've taken out my heart and soul
Now I don't think you care to know
But I gave my life to be your whore
I think our moments come and if you'd feel this love
You could save me
I fear my selfishness will be the end of this
If you don't save me
Save me
I never told you, but I feel you must know
I've buried half my life in the same place you've soared
I couldn't resurrect it, I feel my arms break
I've got a long way left to go and you've shown me no grace
Now I don't think you care to know
But you've taken out my heart and soul
And I don't think you care to doubt it
But I don't mind 'cause I've got time
I'd get down on my knees if I could beg you to see
You could save me
I fear my selfishness will be the end of this
If you don't save me
Save me
Save me
You keep on saying that you want to know me
But you never show me your true self
How can you ever expect someone else to know you
When all you're going to do is just pretend
You're someone else
You keep on saying that you want to show me that you're really different
But you're just the same
If you're really mindless
Then there is no way that I can win
Maybe
You're just one of them
Or maybe it's just a game
You lie to yourself 
You lie to yourself and remain alone
You lie to yourself 
You lie to yourself and remain alone
Remain alone
I'm not exactly sure of your motivation
I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do
All I'm really sure is that you're not too impressive
And you're wearing a mask that I can't see through
Maybe you're not looking for acceptance
Maybe you're striving for something more
If it's status that you lust then why try to be one of us
You're someone we'll never trust 'cause
We know the score
You lie to yourself 
You lie to yourself and remain alone
You lie to yourself 
You lie to yourself and remain alone
Remain alone
I can't see through
I can't see you
Instrumental
Shit filled spasms
Deep in a colostomy bag
I like being trapped inside
The plastics wearing out
Red and perfect her legs
Spread out in front of me
They're so open they make me sweat
It's my lubrication
Recent findings say
Circumcise the abstinent
Make it hard for them to breathe
I like to make you lie
Dropped and so ill
Steeped in my misogyny
My shaking hands are in the skin
I've gone too far, too soon
You look so seamless now
You look so seamless now
You look so seamless now
You look so seamless now
She stared at me
Thinking I was sweet to it
Her legs tied apart for me
It feels so good inside
Now I'm thinking
Who's this that lies under me
Needs a piece of my respect
You make me so sick I'm
Crawling broken my face is
Cringing to see
Figures drawn inside of me
Succumb, succumb, succumb
Sickness fittings
Procured this fascist medium
But know I'm laughing in your face
You lie, you lie, you lie
You look so seamless now
You look so seamless now
You look so seamless now
You look so seamless now
You look so seamless now
You look so seamless now
You look so seamless
Now you look so seamless now
You look so seamless now
Take me, take my life
Take me, take my life
Take me, take my life
Take me, take my life
Take me, take my life
Take me, take my life
Take me, take my life
Take me, take my life
Stink filled spasms
Deep in a colostomy bag
I like being trapped inside
The plastics wearing out
Red and perfect her legs
Spread out in front of me
They're so open they make me sweat
It's my lubrication
Recent findings say
Circumcise the abstinent
Make it hard for them to breathe
I like to make you lie
Dropped and so ill
Steeped in my misogyny
My shaking hands are in the skin
I've gone too far, too soon
You look so seamless now
If I could walk
I'd be a miner
If I could talk
I'd be a preacher
If I was a preacher
Tell you what, I'd save a million souls, even you
If I was a miner
Tell you what
I'd be a damn good one
This ain't a record
Neither a joke
Got us all worked up
And left us naked out here in the sun
But who could say it's sad?
I attach no importance to it
Just because of my hand
Just because of my shriveled little hand
I could be a baseball player
Doesn't surprise me now
Even though we had a map
Took three days to find
Local redneck stare
Taylor from Pizmo
At the dog and pony show
Hey there cracked God
You're, you're looking older
You're, you're looking older
Cry on someone else's shoulders
Pink dried up crippled Christ
Try to take your own advice
NOW now I'm God
Because God never loved me this much
NOW I'll play God
'Cause your God is just losing his touch
Hey there rich God
You're, you're looking distressed
You're, you're looking distressed
Buy a saint to clean up your mess
Temptation on my side
Devil got me a fat new bribe
NOW now I'm God
Because God never loved me this much
NOW I'll play God
'Cause your God is just losing his touch
I can't breathe
Save me
Sow the seed
Praise me
I never had faith in you
I'll never have faith in you
I'll never have faith in you
I'll resurrect myself
Hey there dead God
You're, you're lost and jaded
You're, you're lost and faded
You've become the sheep you hated
You're rotten to the core
Don't believe in you anymore
NOW now I'm God
Because God never loved me this much
NOW I'll play God
'Cause your God is just losing his touch
Somebody better give me a sting
Somebody better make me bleed
Fill this vacancy underneath my skin
'Cause I'm fighting with a thorn on my side
I never meant to fall this far
I have grown the soul of an enemy
I hold an element of surprise
God knows it's gonna make me smile
Breathe in immortality
I'm falling down one thousand feet
So let's gather with the Gods tonight
Play truant for the final time
I've been strung from Hell, give me birth again
'Cause I never meant to crawl this high
My guts are gonna drop like flies
Breathe in immortality
I'm falling down one thousand feet
And oh my God, one hundred floors
Flash faster than my eyes can meet
Give me something sacred
So long so deep so high so far so good
So much pressure building
They won't break me
They won't ground me
Breathe in immortality
I'm falling down one thousand feet
And oh my God, one hundred floors
Flash faster than my eyes can meet
It's not the truth I see
It's just a mockery
Don't need to waste my time
You know I've really tried
You take and never give
Make it so hard to live
I'm hangin' on a ledge
Push me over the edge
Don't do the things you do
Don't have to oblige you
Makin' choices on my own
Don't buy their trite or drone
Grow up and be a man
Drop dead right where you stand
I'm hangin' on a ledge
Push me over the edge
I walk without you, but I need to believe
I've got my own eyes now and I want you to see
There's no discretion in my voice and you need to stand clear
I've been falling out of time, but I want you to hear
And I don't think you care to know
But you've taken out my heart and soul
They'll never break you, but you keep it comin'
I've got my own crimes now and I won't let you in
You can't appreciate it and I need to feel whole
I've gotta find a place to hide where I know you won't go
'Cause I don't think you care to know
But you've taken out my heart and soul
Now I don't think you care to know
But I gave my life to be your whore
I think our moments come and if you'd feel this love
You could save me
I fear my selfishness will be the end of this
If you don't save me
Save me
I never told you, but I feel you must know
I've buried half my life in the same place you've soared
I couldn't resurrect it, I feel my arms break
I've got a long way left to go and you've shown me no grace
Now I don't think you care to know
But you've taken out my heart and soul
And I don't think you care to doubt it
But I don't mind 'cause I've got time
I'd get down on my knees if I could beg you to see
You could save me
I fear my selfishness will be the end of this
If you don't save me
Save me
Save me
It's brainfog
It's brainfog
It's brainfog
It's brainfog
You are insatiable
Latex smile peels off your skull
Everyone knows they need a piece of lollirot
Lolli lolli lolli lolli lolli lolli lolli lolli lollirot
Hard rock queens in ripped up jeans

We are all candy covered on the outside
Peel away the shell and we're rotten on the inside
We are all candy covered on the outside
Peel out your eyes
Take my advice
Taste all your fears, sugar and spice
We are all candy covered on the outside
Peel away the shell and we're from the inside
We are all angry, angry on the inside
Peel away the shell and we're frightened on the inside
You are insatiable
Latex smile peels off your skull
Everyone knows you need a piece of lollirot
Lolli lolli lolli lolli lolli lolli lolli lolli lollirot
Evil boy still the best
Peanut butter smeared on his chest
Get real close you'll get a sniff of lollirot
Lolli lolli lolli lolli lolli lolli lolli lolli lollirot

Dead ringer in my head

Freak out and feed the gods

Creep on the wheels of love,
Do you know what it means to feel like god?
Hey yeah, It's alone in my head
Hey yeah, and I think of the past

Ooh, a dirty little witch

Dop dop dop
Dop be do dop dop
Dop do be do dop dop
Dop do be do dop dop dop
Sometimes I feel you're not listening
Sometimes I feel you don't understand
But I think I've got the answer
Already know what you're gonna say
'Cause I'm just a little girl you see
But there's a hell of a lot more to me
Don't ever underestimate what I can do
Don't ever tell me how I'm meant to be
You say I'm just a little girl, just a little girl
How can I compare
What do I know
What have I got to share
But there's nothing in this world, nothing in this world
That could hold me down
Can't you hear me
Don't you understand
That I wanna be myself, wanna be the girl
Wanna be the one
That you can rely on
How I wish that you could see all there is of me
How I long to hear
That you take me
For who I am
'Cause I'm just a little girl you see
But there's a hell of a lot more to me
Don't ever underestimate what I can do
Don't ever tell me how I'm meant to be
'Cause I'm just a little girl you see
But there's a hell of a lot more to me
Don't ever underestimate what I can do
Don't ever tell me how I'm meant to be
Sometimes I feel you're not listening
Sometimes I feel you don't understand
'Cause I'm just a little girl you see
But there's a hell of a lot more to me
Don't ever underestimate what I can do
Don't ever tell me how I'm meant to be
'Cause I'm just a little girl you see
But there's a hell of a lot more to me
Don't ever underestimate what I can do
Don't ever tell me how I'm meant to be
Tell me how I'm meant to be
In a mirror of you
Reflections of you
You're showing what you feel like inside
Need the power of two
Just me and you
An image that you hold in your mind
Sometimes you're wrong and then sometimes you're right
You don't expect me to put up a fight
I'm sick and tired of all of your lies
I'm sick and tired and I'm saying goodbye
I, I, I don't need this poison
I, I, I don't need control
I, I, I don't need forgiveness
I, I, I don't need you
You're a shadow of me
What I used to be
I'm fading as the light dims outside
I, I know what you need
Because I can see
I'm taking over thoughts in your mind
Sometimes you're wrong and then sometimes you're right
You're in the dark, so I'll turn on the light
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
I'm fucking tired and I'm saying goodbye
I, I, I don't need this poison
I, I, I don't need control
I, I, I don't need forgiveness
I, I, I don't need you
I, I, I don't need this poison
I, I, I don't need control
I, I, I don't need forgiveness
I, I, I don't need you
Hear my voice, hear my voice, hear my voice
Make your choice, make your choice, make your choice
Beat the drum, beat the drum, beat the drum
Hide the sun, hide the sun, hide the sun
Devils in my head tonight
All is wrong if it's not right, take care
Whispers in the walls I hear
Nothing ever made quite clear, beware
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell
Make me well, make me well, make me well
Show your hand, show your hand, show your hand
Make a stand, make a stand, make a stand
Angels in my heart tonight
Say the word and make it right, so dark
Angels flying in my dreams
All is never what it seems, take heart
Speak my name, speak my name, speak my name
Feel no shame, feel no shame, feel no shame
Take your time, take your time, take your time
You are mine, you are mine, you are mine
Monsters in my eyes today
I can't make them go away, it's true
Strangers in the world it seems
Nightmare visions, fevered dreams
I dream of you
Angels in my heart tonight 
Angels in my heart tonight
Angels in my heart tonight
Angels in my heart tonight
Well did you hear, there's a natural order.
Those most deserving will end up with the most.
That the cream cannot help but always rise up to the top,
Well I say: Shit floats.
If you thought things had changed,
Friend you'd better think again,
Bluntly put in the fewest of words,
Cunts are still running the world,
Cunts are still running the world.
Now the working classes are obsolete,
They are surplus to societies needs,
So let 'em all kill each other,
And get it made overseas.
That's the word don't you know,
From the guys that's running the show,
Lets be perfectly clear boys and girls,
Cunts are still running the world,
Cunts are still running the world.
Oh feed your children on Cray fish and Lobster tails,
Find a school near the top of the league,
In theory I respect your right to exist,
I will kill ya if you move in next to me,
Ah it stinks, it sucks, it's anthropologically unjust,
But the takings are up by a third, Oh So
Cunts are still running the world,
Cunts are still running the world.
Your free market is perfectly natural,
Or do you think that I'm some kind of dummy,
It's the ideal way to order the world,
Fuck the morals, does it make any money?
And if you don't like it? Then leave.
Or use your right to protest on the street,
Yeah, use your rights but don't imagine that it's heard, Oh no no,
Cunts are still running the world,
Cunts are still running the world.
A rat done bit my sister Nell
With Whitey on the moon
Her face and arms began to swell
And Whitey's on the moon
I can't pay no doctor bills
But Whitey's on the moon
Ten years from now I'll be paying still
While Whitey's on the moon
You know, the man just upped my rent last night
Cause Whitey's on the moon
No hot water, no toilets, no lights
But Whitey's on the moon
I wonder why he's uppin' me?
Cause Whitey's on the moon?
Well I was already given him fifty a week
And now Whitey's on the moon
Taxes takin' my whole damn check
The junkies make me a nervous wreck
The price of food is goin' up
And if all that crap wasn't enough
A rat done bit my sister nell
With Whitey on the moon
Her face and arms began to swell
And Whitey's on the moon
With all that money I made last year
For Whitey on the moon
How come I ain't got no money here?
Hmm, Whitey's on the moon
You know I just about had my fill
Of Whitey on the moon
I think I'll send these doctor bills
Airmail special
(To Whitey on the moon)
Gut level, below it all
Out of duty - just here
Feeling like a knife's being twisted in the hole of how it is
False hope, an inch of pride that died when I left to hide from non stop
Battering of conditioned opinion
Rest assured but not assured, all is well, but I think we've dealt
With the fear for far too long
Unborn suffer the norm
Born to this - I thin not
I stand against till the shit drops
We see all but do nothing, in the hole of "How it is"
2Pac:
Fugees! Fugees and Mobb Deep tryin' to diss now too huh?
Hahaha! Well I ain't prejudiced, I don't give a fuck
This is what it sounds like - when we ride on our enemies
Biatch! When we ride on our enemies
Hey! Got some static for some niggaz on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin thug niggaz?
Used to love niggaz now I plug niggaz, and slug niggaz
Am I wrong? Niggaz makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I bust! Then we ride till the sun come
Shinin back to brighten up the sky, many die
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me - look bitch!
I cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin movie
Then! We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow
Bam! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uh
Now label this my fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we ride - on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Make sure everybody dies, when we ride, on our enemies
Eminem:
They think they crazy but they ain't crazy
Lets face it
Shit basically they juss playin' sick
They ain't shit they ain't sayin' shit spray 'em 50
A to the K get in the way
I bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem you stayin wit me?
Don't let me lose you
I'm not tryin' to confuse you
When I let loose wit this uzi and just shoot through your isuzu
You get the message?
Am I gettin' through to you?
You know its comin'
You motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac
And you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top
What the fuck do you got?
You got tha realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit
Like it or not
It's like a fight to the top
Just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothin' like survivin the shot
Y'all know what time it is
As soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats?
'Cause I get a lot
Shady records was 80 seconds away from the towers
Them cowards fucked wit the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children
Nuclear showers there's nothin' spookier
Your now about to witness the power
2Pac:
When we ride on our enemies
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Bet all you mutherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes
You was heartless on yo' hits
Niggaz love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
How many niggaz wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Know I meant, every motherfuckin word
When we ride on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
I make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Give me a polaroid picture to fit in my pocket
And I'll paste it into my heart shaped locket
Eventually I'll cheat on every man I meet
I know I can't help it
Buy me a drink and I will tell you my name
I'm a rose petal fallen from a mainline train
Always there to touch but just out of reach
I know you can't help it
Eye on metronome, watching the way you write her name
An object of destruction made for Madame Ray
Left New York but drew your outline
On a ticket back to London
Whitewashed all my boyfriend's features
Solarising future pictures
I'm an ideal portrait of a girl, I'll be your apprentice
But you can't keep me captive on your wall, I'm still in my twenties
Lie behind a camera past the city music hall,
Madame Ray will sit me high above you all
Left New York but drew my outline
On a record sleeve in brooklyn
Whitewashed three years of existence
Solarising future pictures
Man let go, he couldn't keep her
Locks of hair on artist's easels
Traces of unseen love rivals
Solarising into pictures
I am forever being put away
And I am always in reserve
I am forever being put away
And I am always in reserve
"With an eye always in reserve
Material indestructible
Forever being put away
Taken for a ride
Put on the spot
The racket must go on
I am always in reserve"
I am forever being put away
And I am always in reserve
I am forever being put away
And I am always in reserve
I am forever being put away
And I am always in reserve
I am forever being put away
And I am always in reserve
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Do you want a ride on my death machine?
Pump a dime in if you do
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, I kill what I need
Yeah, I kill what I need
When I die won't you bury me?
'Cause I buried you, baby, deep in me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Cut it open
What's inside?
You drag me back there
Yeah, I want to know
Baby, I said I want to know
Never know, never know
Cut it open
Say pretty please
You'll drag it to the...
Yeah, I want to know
Baby, I said I want to know
Never know, never know
And when I die, won't you bury me?
'Cause I buried you, baby, deep in me
Yeah, when you fall for the garbage man
You wind up in the garbage
Who's paying your mortgage?
Daddy's dying
Throw yourself on the body
Take out your sharp teeth
Line your lungs with noise then just sew it up
In and out is like this it's like a fist
You want the questions you got your answers down
You want the answers, you got the face fleshed out
The air is full of harmonies but is anyone even sleeping right?
Every town gets an Eiffel Tower, don't worry
Every town gets an Eiffel Tower tonight
Everyone is sleeping under one tonight
In der deutschen Verfassung steht
Die Todesstrafe ist abgeschafft,
doch hin und wieder
tritt diese Verfassung außer Kraft
Denn um die Sicherheit im deutschen Staat
mit allen Mitteln zu bewahren
holt man sich immer wieder gerne Rat
bei den Gesetzen von vor sechzig Jahren
Was früher die Gestapo war
ist heut das BKA
nur damals setzte man Henker ein
und heut gibt es die GSG 9
Kopfschuß-
das war kein Selbtmord, das war Mord
Kopfschuß-
Ihr habt gelogen seit dem ersten Wort
Kopfschuß-
Das war ein mieser, feiger Mord
Kopfschuß-
und ich glaube Euch kein Wort-
nie mehr ein Wort
Ist die Regierung erst in Panik,
gilt weder Ordnung noch Moral
Das Gesetz wird ausgeschaltet
und da Menschenrecht egal
Polizei ist Staat im Staat, Selbstherrlichheit regiert
Ist der Staatsfeind lokalisiert,
wird auf Rambo-Art agiert
Was früher die Gestapo war...
Kopfschuß-
das war kein Selbtmord...
Ihr könnt erzählen, was Ihr wollt
Ich glaub' Euch niemals mehr ein Wort
Ihr habt uns immer schon belogen,
habt uns eingelullt und habt uns abgefüllt
unsere Seelen kastriert
und unsere Hirne amputiert
uns manipuliert, uns wegzensiert, uns exekutiert,
doch mir reicht es jetzt:
Ich spiele eure Spiele nicht mehr,
Ich scheiß Euch ins Gesicht: Fickt Euch- Mörder!
Was früher die Gestapo war...
Kopfschuß-
das war kein Selbtmord...
und ich glaube Euch kein Wort-
nie mehr ein Wort- niemals
Stop and listen
I'll rock with it with no competition on this... shh
You gotta get it, there's nothing hotter then it
A whack rapper is what Hopsin isn't I kick it
To ya if you got a minute you'd bobbin ya head like a walking pigeon
Play my position I kinda dip it when I always kick it
I got lots of this, I vibe to this like I rock a fee-gee
Me and amount of people that's feeling me is a hot percentage
They know I'm tight but I be conceited if I admit it
I'm a climb the game till I'm on the top of it
And don't be chicken if you call me out if you got a problem with it
On some silent shit just get it stuck it's some violent shit
And feelings will be hurt so your better of if you mind your business
Don't get it started, with that brother Marcus that kid retarded
Hes gonna evolve us, some rock-es to prove that shit is garbage
You'll be the illest artist realist in this rap
All you fools out there wanna get him on your track
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen

I use to push weight on the block
A fat chick and she was barely able to walk
She was good for one thing and that was taking the rock
She told me she was pregnant and I pray to the god
That she wasn't, cause all that mess was making me hot
I'm happy that she ain't the one to have a baby with hop
She's so obese I take her out and make her stay in the car
Her body odor always smelling like some bacon and farts
I tell her ha don't eat pork she takes it straight to the heart
Ready to make a song, she needa make a fat with it (eh)
The farm, that's where she belong, better leave me alone, calling me and asking where I'm at
Like she needs to know
A what a surprise, she thinking I'm the lover of her life, becoming my wife
Listen to me take some advice, you wanna look nice, trust me I'm right
Go the Motherfuckin gym and loose the gut and your fine
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen

Don't get what you say about the pans in the kitchen mama
I'm a prove that I'm the man in the kitchen mama
I'm Marcus and yes I am stupid
Thought I was a smart kid guess again stupid, I'm a special ed student
Give me a couple of bars and let the man prove it 'cause they ever dance to it
I never knew it, but the rest of my class knew it
They must of thought id never remember to pass to it
Forget school man I never could pass threw it
I never be the student ahead of the class who gets an A in his report card
A nice kid whose so smart
Seem like they threw me in special ed it got more hard
Every year the cycle repeats over again
My friends graduated and I'm way older then them
Then they come to me nice mugging me
Making fun of me
What a resignedly of motherfuckin you thinking what they Uh
Tell me they lucky I don't suddenly go off and cause another Dem
Like a freaking cycle then what's it gonna be
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen

So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen

Don't get what you say about the pans in the kitchen mama
I'm a prove that I'm the man in the kitchen mama
All your two-bit psychiatrists
Are giving you electroshock
They said they'd let you live at home with mom and dad
Instead of mental hospitals
But every time you tried to read a book
You couldn't get to page 17
'Cause you forgot where you were
So you couldn't even read
Don't you know they're gonna kill your sons
Don't you know gonna kill, kill your sons
They're gonna kill, kill your sons
Until they run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
Mom informed me on the phone
She didn't know what to do about dad
Took an axe and broke the table
Aren't you glad you're married
And sister, she got married on the Island
And her husband takes the train
He's big and he's fat
And he doesn't even have a brain
They're gonna kill your sons
Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
Until they run away
Creedmore treated me very good
But Paine Whitney was even better
And when I flipped out on PHC
I was so sad, I didn't even get a letter
All of the drugs that we took
It really was lots of fun
But when they shoot you up with thorizene on crystal smoke
You choke like a son of a gun
Don't you know they're gonna kill your sons
Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
Until they run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
Peace... I hate the word
As I hate hell
All Montagues
I had a dream last night...
'Cause it looked just like a dream
I had a dream last night...
But it looked unlike a dream
Mercy, mercy I'm made of heart
Make me a suit so I can get it off
Heaven help me, my head's spinnin' round
Stop this airplane 'cause I got to get down!
I had a dream last night...
And it fit me like a glove
I had a dream last night...
And it fit me like a glove
Right on... Haha
Here's to the Montagues
John Wayne and Betty Davis
And Romeo... he waved before
A chorus girl in Vegas
Yeah!
Juliet is up in heaven
A pocket full of pills
And Jesus drives to Mexico
To get her prescription filled!
I had a dream last night...
And it fit me like a glove
It was a scream last night
It was gettin' kinda fun
Yeah, rock out, whatever!
I had a dream last night...
Because she looked just like a dream
I had a dream last night...
Because she looked just like a dream
She was on fire last night...
And I was breathing gasoline
I had a dream last night...
And it fit me like a glove
I had a scream last night...
Lord above!
I didn't know where to shake my butt
Walked backwards, fucked like a fox
I was more fucked up than your sister's tackle box
3AM to 5 O'clock
And one of us leaves
And I got shot
Shot me down
Yeah, whatever... rock out!
That's it, that's my rhyme
Take it to the street... beeeeatchh!
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out quick but when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at
I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that
Sweet lady
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth
Blowing down the backroads headin' south
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You're an idiot, babe
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of my boxcar door
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
After losin' every battle
I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes
Blood on your saddle
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You're an idiot, babe
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
You're on the bottom
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned
Slowly into autumn
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You're an idiot, babe
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I been somebody else instead
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And all your ragin' glory
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves
We're idiots, babe
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves
Dig deep, dig in deeper
You go where only fools fear to tread
You'll find devices to kill your master
Why not kill your maker instead?
Leave it to the ones who own you
Leave it to the ones who disown you
Put your faith and trust in the dusk
Do what you must do
I'm getting edgy for those departed
Left all alone, left still forgotten
Miles to go and skies to fly
Hold back the day
Miles to go and skies to fly
It's darkest before the dawn
Miles to go and skies to fly
Hold back the day
Miles to go and skies to fly
It's darkest before the dawn
Claw hard from your casket
Six feet and getting deeper
Should the top soil feel heavy
It must be getting weaker
Towers people build up in life
Become frail and fall to the ground
Fuck them, their opinion
Deceiving the honest man
I'm getting edgy for those departed
Left all alone, left still forgotten
Miles to go and skies to fly
Hold back the day
Miles to go and skies to fly
It's darkest before the dawn
Miles to go and skies to fly
Hold back the day
Miles to go and skies to fly
It's darkest before the dawn
Always, always darkest before the dawn
Always darkest before the dawn
Always darkest before the dawn
Always darkest before the...
I'm getting edgy for those departed
Left all alone, left still forgotten
Miles to go and skies to fly
Hold back the day
Miles to go and skies to fly
It's darkest before the dawn
Miles to go and skies to fly
Hold back the day
Miles to go and skies to fly
It's darkest before the dawn
Darkest, Darkest
Always, always darkest before the dawn
Always darkest before the dawn
Always darkest, darkest
The first and last time
Traces of life and look what comes between
I'm simple-minded
You're always trying to win these selfish games
We'll throw away what we're looking for
All I can say is "It's my chance to walk away"
Even I'll let fate decide
You're breaking off like something's in the way
Is it us?
My mind has settled
I'm a living shadow in doubt of shape or size
So lately you answer to sort this out
I know I'll break some time
You'll take away all that I'm asking for
All I can say is "It's my chance to walk away"
Even I'll let fate decide
You're breaking off like something's in the way
Is it us?
You said you're working for it, but are you fighting for it?
You're just igniting the flame, but it's going down.
You said you're working for it, but are you fighting for it?
You're just igniting the flames.
All I can say is "It's my chance to walk away"
Even I'll let fate decide
You're breaking off like something's in the way
Is it us?
All I can say is "I know I'll find a way"
Even I'll let fate decide
I'm looking back at my regrets, I'm still the same
Well, she crept back in the house at half past three
Shook her head to see him snoring in his sleep
"If he really loved me," she said
"I wouldn't have to be so mean..."
He's a heap of junk that pours from his top drawer
He sometimes likes to spread it out around the floor
It's evidence of what he was like
He likes to remember when...
Sha la li, sha la li, la la li
The end is growing near
And we're treading water now
And holding back our tears
And the day is rising
We're sinking
Sha la, la la li
In a minute it will all be coming down
And they know it now but no one makes a sound
It's such a shame to ruin this bright
Lazy sunny day...
Sha la li, sha la li, la la li
The end is growing near
And we're treading water now
We're holding back our tears
And the day is rising
We're sinking
Sha la, la la li
My, my... the cruelest lies are often told without a word
My, my... the kindest truths are often spoke but never heard
She said, "You've been pushing me like I was a sore tooth.
You can't respect me 'cause I've done so much for you."
He said, "Well I hate that it's come to this
But baby I was doing fine. How do you think
That I survived the other 25 before you?"
Sha la li, sha la li, la la li
The end is growing near
And we're treading water now
And holding back our tears
And the day is rising
We're sinking...
Sha la, la la li
You know it never meant much to me
There's something on your mind that I couldn't see
It didn't hurt me too much to find
You were seeing someone else for all of this time
You know that I don't care
And I'd like you to know that I don't care
I don't need your sympathy
Why don't you ever look at me
You did nothing for me
You did nothing I see
You did nothing for me
You did nothing
There's no today and there's no tomorrow
Where you find sadness I find sorrow
Nobody knows but it always shows
I think I'm losing my mind but that's the way that it goes
And it's fine, all those lies
I can see the truth lies in your eyes
So I guess we are through
You did to me what I did to you
I don't need your sympathy
Cause you don't mean that much to me
(1)
I spent my whole life
In love with despair
Kept my lungs full
With the breath of their
Mute atmosphere
... I became what I hate.
And thus shall I remain
To give birth to a mighty assassin
Armed with a weapon of words
To defy the lies
To never compromise
No.
Today, my name ... is pain.
(2)
I stood
Beyond the world
Whispering secret syllables
In the eyeless dark
Dancing wildly
Round and round on the rotting ground
Surrounded by the dead dusts of Hell ...
This is how I delete myself
And this is how I corrupt everyone else
Obey
Obey
Betray
Betray
You are not unique.
You do not need to think.
Take it, take it!
I will,
I will ... I will.
You succumb, so nicely.
(Like an insect staring back, like a dying dove)
My love ... (no) ... my love.
(Song)
So here we are again
The sheets are stained and bloodied
The animals scratch at my skin
Here we are again
My face is scraped and bloodied
I've nothing left to give
- I wasn't there,
- I'm not involved,
- I'm innocent,
- It's not my fault.
- I wasn't there,
- I'm not involved,
- I'm innocent,
- It's not my fault.
... Here in the suicide trees.
... Here in the suicide trees.
No. bloody, bloody, bloody, MURDER!
Among the excrement of my sins!
It's not happening, it can't be happening, it's not happening.
So here we are again
In secret ceremonies
Changing shape, amen.
Here we are again
Pretending not to notice
The illness sneaking in.
- I wasn't there,
- I'm not involved,
- I'm innocent,
- It's not my fault.
- I wasn't there,
- I'm not involved,
- I'm innocent,
- It's not my fault.
... Here in the suicide trees.
... Here in the suicide trees.
Toil and labor
Hate your neighbor
Faith in favor
Obey!
Toil and labor
Hate your neighbor
Faith in favor
Obey!
OBEY.
OBEY.
Here, I do as I please!
Here in the suicide trees!
Here, I do as I please!
Here in the suicide trees!
OBEY!
Hate your neighbors!
Hate your neighbors!
(The animals scratch at my skin)
It's not happening, it's not happening.
Die young, stay pretty.
Die young, stay pretty.
Die young, stay pretty.
Die young, stay pretty.
Deteriorate in your own time.
Tell 'em you're dead and wither away.
Are ya living alone or with your family?
A dried up twig on your family tree?
Are ya waiting for the reaper to arrive?
Or just to die by the hand of love?
Love for youth, love for youth.
So, die young and stay pretty.
Leave only the best behind.
Slipping sensibilities.
Tragedy in your own dream.
Oh, ya sit all alone in your rocking chair
Transistor pressed against an ear.
Were ya waiting at the bus stop all your life?
Or just to die by the hand of love?
Love for youth, love for youth.
So live fast 'cause it won't last.
Dearly near senility.
Was it good or maybe you won't tell?
Got your hand up all in my shirt
And you know that it hurts
Ball and chain
Ball and chain
Crossing the street you look so fine
Making up everything that's in my mind
You're my ball and chain
Ball and chain
You are the same with your balls and your chains
Bend me over the back of the car seat
Take me down to Easy Street
Ball and chain
Ball and chain
You are the same with your balls and your chains
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Why does this always happen?
Why does this always happen?
Why?
Why?
Yeah
Yeah, her tits were higher than mine
With a waist that is sugar-fine
I heard she could read and write too
And she's getting a degree in fucking you
Sexual psychology
It's easier than philosophy
It's easier than chemistry
Where is my chemistry?
Why does this always happen?
Oh why does this always happen?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Won't need no shadow man
Runnin' the government
Won't need no stinkin' war
Won't need no haircut
Won't need no shoeshine
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
What will people do
After the garden is gone?
What will people say
After the garden?
Won't need no strong man
Walkin' through the night
To live a weak man's day
Won't need no purple haze
Won't need no sunshine
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
Where will people go
After the garden is gone?
What will people know
After the garden?
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
You gave me a chance at the palais de danse to prove I'm worth your time...
You gave me a chance to prove I'm more than just an also ran...
A knife for the girls who want to come home for just one night
A knife for the girls who never return your calls
You gave me a chance at the palais de danse to prove I'm worth your time
You gave me a chance to prove I'm more than just an also ran
Something happened to change your mind
Something happened I don't know why,
And now you reach for my hand and you cut me again
You've got a knife for the girls and a knife for the men
I don't mind seeing your face around, but we can never speak again (no no no)
A knife for the men who've taken the heat off you this time,
A knife for the men who keep you awake at night
This could be the last time you could say for sure
You know I'm here if you need a girl...
Something happened to change your mind
Something happened I don't know why,
And now you reach for my hand and you cut me again
You've got a knife for the girls and a knife for the men
I don't mind seeing your face around, but we can never speak again (no no no)
But in a back room in Harehills,
When you said I was a superstar,
What did you mean, what did you mean?
Harehills
Harehills
Harehills
Well in a back room in Harehills, what did you mean?
And now you reach for my hand and you cut me again
You've got a knife for the girls and a knife for the men
I don't mind seeing your face around, but we can never speak again
I got my souvenir

Well in a back room in Harehills, I got my souvenir
My baby doll, don't go to London

Push and push and push 'till it hurts
The Devil's on roller-skates
The Devil's on roller-skates
Down at the roller rink
Picking up chicks for me
Ones that push and push and push 'till it hurts
Push and push 'till it hurts
Dirty enough, I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Dirty enough, I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Life's for the living

We'll see if I'm kidding
Push and push and push 'till it hurts
Did it on Ritalin

Now I work me the night shift, where I
Pull and pull and pull 'till it hurts
Pull and pull 'till it hurts
Dirty enough, I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Dirty enough, I got me a love

Down at the Radio Shack
Turning shit into solid gold
Solid gold
Dirty enough, I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Dirty enough, I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Hello, time bomb, I'm ready to go off
Hello, time bomb, I'm ready to go
Ready to go off
All that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
A round of applause, it's all that you want
Take a good look at what you give up
Because I'm telling you
A heart can't be unbroken oh, oh, oh, oh
And can you remember how I kiss you
Recall the sweet taste in your mouth
'Cause baby the memory is all you get now
And I'm moving, movin, moving on
All that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
'Cause I didn't

Does every morning make you happy
And tell me do you laugh yourself to sleep
I hope you find it easy to forget me oh, oh, oh, oh
I hope you don't feel anything when you see me
I wonder if you're out there having fun
I hope you get all that you really wanted
'Cause I'm moving, movin, moving on
Don't you see the light has changed
And nothing looks the same
Just shadows on the ground
And if you listen carefully you'll hear
All that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
'Cause I didn't
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
'Cause I didn't
I've found something
No one else is looking for
I've found something
That there's no use for
And what's more
I'm keeping it to myself
I'm leaning over backwards
Shoulders pressed to the floor
I'm leaning over backwards
Shoulders pressed to the door
Two falls or one submission
Or a single K.O.
Two falls or one submission
Or a single K.O.
But what's one submission
Amongst friends?
Go

Forgot what it's like
Like fighting, like sex

Attention thrills and then it kills
They make you king then make you ill
'Til you're alone, dead on your throne
So my idea of fun
Is killing everyone
My idea of fun
Is killing everyone
My idea of fun
Is killing everyone
Now is the season for war with no reason
Now is the season for war with no reason
They break your skin when you're a kid
They steal your soul and keep it hid
And that is why I hate mankind
'Cause my idea of fun
Is killing everyone
My idea of fun
Is killing everyone
My idea of fun
Is killing everyone
My idea of fun is killing everyone
My idea of fun is killing everyone
My idea of fun
My idea of fun is killing everyone
My idea of fun is killing everyone
My idea of fun
Wiped out down the stairs
I'll bet you there's a song in there,
I'm not sure I'm prepared to write it down.
That guy should be me
I'd look much better on t.v.
Then the world would see
That I can do anything.
I can be that
But soon you'll see that
I will never do anything.
Let's play tic-tac-toe
I'll play X, you can be the O.
Thoughts of turning pro have crossed my mind.
I could make a mint
Fill my pockets with more than lint.
I'll give you a hint
It involves the "internet".
I can be that
But soon you'll see that
I will never do anything.
Don't write me off as an also ran.
Just mark me down as an angry man.
Got a big chip, you want a fat lip?
How 'bout a mouthful of Chiclets?
Life passed me by, but it's not my fault.
I'll lick my wounds, could you pass the salt?
I can be that, but soon you'll see that
I will never do anything
If I were the king
All my subjects would dance and sing
They could kiss my ring
And kiss my ass
When I'm old and grey,
I'll look back on my life and say
"Give me one more day,
And still I'll never do anything."
I can be that
But soon you'll see that
I will never do anything
I can be that
But soon you'll see that
I will never do anything
I-I feel like I'm losin' my mind-mind
She crept into your life-life
And cut me up like a knife-knife
Yeah, hey hey, few things that I wanna say-ay
Still got my dignity-y
No one'll love you like me-e
Yeah, she's prettier than I'll ever be
Got yourself a beauty queen, yeah
But there's one thing I gotta say
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta, etta, etta, etta, etta, etta, aye
I can fuck you betta, etta, etta, etta, etta, etta, aye
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you

But she don't do it that way-ay, no.
She's prettier than I'll ever be
Got yourself a beauty queen, yeah
But there's one thing I gotta say
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta, etta, etta, etta, etta, etta, aye
I can fuck you betta, etta, etta, etta, etta, etta, aye
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta

She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta
But I can fuck you betta
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta
I can fuck you betta, baby!
I'll take one cause
I needed to feel it so much 
I had an emotional crutch, but 
I'm feeling bored
So I'll take some more 
'Cause nothing is happening 
And once you
Told me you loved me so much 
I foolishly began to trust, but 
Now I'm ignored
And I'm taking more
Till something is happening
I'll take one cause
I needed to feel it so much 
I needed that thing we call fun, but 
Now I'm ignored
And I'll take some more
Till something is happening 
Cause once I
Thought you were right here with me, so 
Maybe I'll take two or three 
Until I believe
That what I have seen
Is really happening
Morpheus!
How could you leave me when I had need of your love? 
Stop holding back! 
Give me one reason to think you're decent 
When I am
Alone 
Don't you ever try to bring me back
With this one I
Needed to feel you so much
I wantingly longed for your touch, but 
Now I'm ignored
And I'm feeling bored 
Till something is happening
Because once I
Thought you were right here with me, so 
Maybe I should take two or three 
Until I believe
What I have seen
Is really happening 
With this one I
Needed to feel you so much 
I needed that thing we call fun, but 
Now I'm ignored
And I'm feeling bored
Till something is happening
And once I
Thought you were right here with me, so 
Maybe I'll take two or three 
Until I believe
That what I have seen
Is really happening
No no more 
Oh Morpheus
Why did you leave me when I had need of your love?!
No holding back now!
Give me the real thing
I've got a reason
When I am
Alone 
Don't you ever try to take me back
This movie would've killed us
It would've made a mess
I'd have lit the fires but I'd have pulled you out
Take a shot from every angle
Yeah, I'd have shot you down
I'd have made you look fucking beautiful
Don't think 'cause you can't see me that I'm not watching
Yeah, he got leather, he got car
Well, me got channels on CCTV
This movie would've killed us
We'd have cut a deal
I'd have set the traps but I'd have pulled you out
Lend a hand make all the right moves
I'd have helped you out
I'd have made it perfect just for you
Don't think 'cause you can't see me that I'm not watching
Yeah, he got leather, he got car
Well, me got channels on CCTV
This movie would've killed us
We would have made a hit
But now it's turned to shit and it's because of you
But hey, you didn't want to make it
Instead you made it with him
Guess I just didn't make the final cut
Don't think 'cause you can't see me that I'm not watching
Yeah, he got leather, he got car
Well, me got channels on CCTV
Yeah, this movie's gonna kill me
But it'll kill you first
We could've made it out, but oh
It's just too late now
I'd have made us a killer movie
I'd have made us a killer movie
I'd have made us a killer movie
I would have made us a killer movie
There's a beautiful sky tonight 
And if you were by my side then we could share this but you are gone. 
So come at me with your moon and burn me in the stars 
Cause nothing matters anymore. 
If I could only see you now 
For about an hour 
Maybe just a minute 
Just to ask 
What he's got that I don't have? 
Is it his brown eyes? 
I know blue eyes get boring 
But I'll wear dark glasses all the time 
And hey if you want me to 
I'll take a knife to 
My own bright eyes. 
If I could only see you now for about an hour 
Maybe just a minute 
Just to ask 
What he's got that I don't have? 
Is it his brown eyes? 
Well, I'll give you a thousand reasons that tonight 
You should grant me this one wish. 
Like the 
One year 
Of my life that I gave to you 
And 
Now you put me through hell. 
You break me up. 
Yeah. 
Whoa I should hate you 
But I can't replace you in my heart. 
Why am I so pathetic? 
Don't get it 
Why you won't return my calls? 
Can't you look at me once? 
And please if you got a minute, 
Enjoy this lonely sky with me. 
It'll swallow us whole 
If we only let it. 
If I could only see you now for about an hour 
Maybe just a minute 
Just to ask 
What he's got that I don't have? 
Is it his brown eyes? 
Well, I'll give you a thousand reasons 
That tonight 
You should grant me this one wish. 
Like the 
One year 
Of my life that I gave to you 
And 
Now you put me through hell. 
You break me up. 
Yeah 
If the sky's going to eat us 
Then I'd like to be digested into 
One million pieces 
With you. 
I'd love to be scattered 
To hell with you. 
To hell with you. 
To hell with you.
This sense of cynicism will eat me alive,
Long before the waking dead will ever get their chance.
For I'd sooner litter the earth with our corpses,
Then allow them to dine upon this flesh.
I must convey,
In this life nothing can last forever.
Will you fly with me tonight?
I promise you towards the heavens.
And as we gaze down from this midnight's sky,
I'd laugh and say they almost seem to be so lucid.
I must convey,
In this life nothing can last forever.
An amaranth shall mark our tombs,
For this love's eternal.
I beg of you my only saving grace.
Please take my life tonight, let's disintegrate.
I must convey,
In this life nothing can last forever.
This love, it is eternal.
Even in death it will not fade.
I can't believe I hung around with you
All this time
You drove me crazy with your O.C.D
Girl you're out of your mind
I'm counting on UFOs to beam me up
I just don't know
How long I can take this shit
I'm over it, girl you gotta go
It's over, we're over
Just like in crimson and clover
We're sinking and I'm thinking
How the hell did we get so stupid?
It's the end, ex-girlfriend
I don't care what you think of me now
So long you're gone
This is the break up song
One more thing before you go
Would you please give me my records back
My Bloody Valentine, The Pixies, Cheap Trick
And Back in Black
You can keep the dog we bought
But you can't go near the Standard Bar
Don't hang around, don't call my friends
They won't know who you are
It's over, we're over
Just like in crimson and clover
We're sinking and I'm thinking
How the hell did we get so stupid?
It's the end, ex-girlfriend
I don't care what you think of me now
So long you're gone
This is the break up song
So long you're gone
This is the break up song
It's over, we're over
Just like in crimson and clover
We're sinking and I'm thinking
How the hell did we get so stupid?
It's the end, ex-girlfriend
I don't care what you think of me now
So long you're gone
This is the break up song
So long you're gone
This is the break up song
So long you're gone
This is the break up song
So long you're gone
This is the break up song
This is the break up song
Instrumental
Isn't there enough to talk about?
I don't want what else is running out your mouth
Chewing my ears from my head
Will not keep me interested
I wanna put you on someone else
I wanna leave you all by yourself
If I look like I'm involved
Well, I ain't listening at all
You never listen to a single thing I say
How in the hell did I get into this mess anyway?
Oh yeah, I was
Shot in the hall with a glance
If looks could kill I would've never had a chance
And you could bury me where I lie
I'm so unhappy that I could die
Other people, they're not looking
Anywhere in your direction
Got this creeping party doubt
There's no chance I'm ever getting out
You're having fun at my expense
Oh yeah, you're raking up
Sometimes I think that you
Wanna end up with no one to talk to!
Other people, they're not looking
Anywhere in your direction
Got this creeping party doubt
There's no chance I'm ever getting out
They're acting like somebody near
Just passed away in here
So if I go
No
When I do
You'll end up with no one to talk to!
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Baby says I'm tearing her down
Shoulder to shoulder
I hold her too lightly
And baby says,
"Baby, your kiss don't do anything"
Oh sweetness, all I need is a brand new heart
It's old and it's cold and it's no longer golden
And baby says,
"Baby you're right, but that's no excuse"
And my baby says,
"It's a lie, it's a cop-out and I know you know I know why
You won't try, 'cause you're scared and you're weak
And you don't give a fuck about me
And I do believe that you hate yourself
And I knew you'd never stay forever
Holding it together, making songs for me
And all right, forevers on your side
Oh it's only time
It's longer than you think."
And baby says, "this house was a home
It's worn and it's torn
And it holds only your ghost."
And baby says,
"Baby you're cursed, oh why can't you see?"
Oh sweetness, all I need's a brand new head
Clear without fears and it knows only your name
And baby says,
"Baby you're right but you'll never win."
And my baby says,
"It's a lie, it's a cop-out and I know you know I know why
You won't try, 'cause you're scared and you're weak
And you don't give a fuck about me"
And I do believe that you hate yourself
And I knew you'd never stay forever
Holding it together, making songs for me
And all right forevers on your side
Oh it's only time
It's longer than you think.
"And I knew you'd never stay forever
Holding it together, making songs for me
And all right, forever's on your side
Oh it's only time
It's longer than you think."
And she says, "it's a cop-out and I know you know I know
(I know you know, I know you know)"
Hey hey, hey hey

There's a place in space where violence and love
Collide inside and solid is wide
And heat is cold and birth is death
And creation and time are made from destruction
From fucking destruction, fucking destruction
Fucking destruction, fucking destruction
Now ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Doodoodoodoodoodoo
Doodoodoodoodoodoo
We go where we like
We got overtime
We get paid to rattle our chains
We go in the back
Paint our money black
Spend it on the enemy
Sleeping in the church
Riding in the dirt
Put a banner over my grave
Make a body work
Make a beggar hurt
Sell me something big and untamed
Now our time
Real good time
Now our time
Real good time
Now our time (Said now our time)
A real good time (It's a really good time)
Baby, you're mine
We know how to pray
Party everyday
Make our desolation unsafe
Riding in a rut
'Til the power's cut
We don't even have a good name
Sleeping in the church
Riding in the dirt
Put a banner over my grave
Make a body work
Make a beggar hurt
Sell me something big and untamed
Now our time 
Real good time
Now our time
Real good time
Now our time (Now our time)
A real good time (Real good time)
Yeah yeah yeah
Baby, you're mine
Doo doo doo doo, baby, I can fly
Sell me something big and untamed 
Now our time
Real good time
Now our time (Said now our time)
Real good time (It's a really good time)
Now our time (Now our time)
A real good time (Real good time)
Feel good, real good, it's the same old same
Real good, feel good, don't got no more brains
Feel good, real good, it's the same old same
Real good, feel good, don't got no more brains
Baby, you're mine
Driven by restrained desire
I want what I need
Shaking as her sex takes hold
I've lost all control
Temptation
Temptation
Drowning in a sea of rage
I taste the embrace
Helpless as it steals my soul
I've lost all control
Temptation
It never lets me down
Temptation
One foot in the ground
We exist in a world
Where the fear of illusion is real
And we cling to the past
To deny and confuse the ideal
Once inside we conceive
And believe in a god we can't feel
I can't feel it
I can't feel it
I can't feel
Destined by a fate so cruel
I'm drugged to delight
Laughing as these lies unfold
I've lost all control
Temptation
It never lets me down
Temptation
One foot in the ground
Temptation
You satisfy my soul
Temptation
I've lost all control
It's a lovely night for something to go wrong 
Can't you see those clouds? 
They are spelling disaster 
This will be your last night on earth
Your mother sucks cocks in hell
This night will not be forgotten 
Until everyone lies dead 
As the angels lay broken beneath the ashes 
Massacre 
Watch the people 
As they burn alive 
For freedom 
Watch the people 
As they burn alive 
For fucking freedom
Dear Hugh Miller
I've thought it through for a while but it doesn't get any easier
And three months on in this bad design won't make it feel any easier
Your grave, it's your grave
Dear Hugh Miller
It's four months now from when we started and nothing feels much easier.
I sit and stare in a cork tiled room and it doesn't get much easier.
Your grave, it's your grave
Pretend it works a while, it's transmitted live
Pretend it works a while (you don't try)
Pretend it works a while, it's transmitted live
Pretend it works a while (don't try)
Dear Hugh Miller,

I don't care if I don't have an idea track, it's an idea track, it's an idea
I don't care if I don't have an idea track, it's an idea track, it's an idea
Your grave, it's your grave.
To me it seems
To ask for reason's a plea for change
And a law that they set out what's love
Of course this mean giving up from all my sleep
But it's warm
So warm in here
I'm restless to escape
'Cause that's all it takes to buy a gun
On the third day of the third month
We thought for one instant we forgot our gun
The rush creates
An impact on the current mental state
And some would say that it's wrong
But I find more joy in coaxing with a gun
And the expression of the chaos we've become
'Cause that's all it takes to buy a gun
On the third day of the third month
We thought for one instant we forgot our gun
We thought for one instant we forgot our gun now
'Cause that's all it takes to buy a gun
On the third day of the third month
We thought for one instant we forgot our gun
Sit pretty now, watch the wishes fall
Wait patient now they're alert to your call
Silence so sweet feel the dreams unfold
As I wake in my sleep and it's you I hold
I gaze at the way that the colours merge into a beautiful view
But nothing compares to the path that I tread on now
And I'm led into
A rush to my senses
I follow this sweet-scented figure
I taste it now
A taste I can only describe as a dream I once had
It tastes so good
Submerge my soul to the depths of your waves
Under lock and key is the feeling I crave
Soothe every ache with the touch of your skin
You're living proof that there's healing within
I gaze at the way that the colours merge into a beautiful view
But nothing compares to the path that I tread on now
And I'm led into
A rush to my senses
I follow this sweet-scented figure
I taste it now
A taste I can only describe as a dream I once had,
It tastes so good.
Artie with Finn & Puck
Oooh, yeah...
Hush, just stop
There's nothing you can do or say, baby
I've had enough
I'm not your property as from today, baby
You might think that I won't make it on my own
But now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I'm stronger
Than I ever thought that I could be, baby
I used to go with the flow
Didn't really care 'bout me
You might think that I can't take it, but you're wrong
'Cause now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I'm stronger
Come on, now
Oh, yeah
Here I go, on my own
I don't need nobody, better off alone
Here I go, on my own now
I don't need nobody, not anybody
Here I go, alright
Here I go
Stronger than yesterday
It's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
Now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I'm stronger

I gotta get this shit off my chest
Another sucker behind a desk
You try to tell me that you know best
Snap your fingers, snap your neck
Sunshine has always been an enemy
(Sunshine an enemy)
My life a chemical insanity
(My life will kill me)
Sundown is bringing out the freak in me, wired
Getting higher
So check your attitude at the front door
I'm really getting tired of taking
All of your shit when I'm sober
I'm thinking that I'd rather be stoned
Yeah
I gotta get this shit off my back
I run in circles but I won't crack
So fucking sick of your politics
Snap your fingers, snap your neck
Sunshine has always been an enemy
(Sunshine an enemy)
My life a chemical insanity

Sundown is bringing out the freak in me, wired
Getting higher
So check your attitude at the front door
I'm really getting tired of taking
All of your shit when I'm sober

Why you always waste my time, I don't know
Man, I'm thinking that I'd rather be stoned
I am my worst epitome, wired

That's funky!
Fuck!
The people have heard the news
The people have spoken
You may not like what they said
But they weren't jokin'
Way out on the desert sands
Lies a desperate lover
They call her the"Queen of Oil"
So much to discover
Don't need no ad machine
Telling me what I need
Don't need no Madison Avenue War
Don't need no more boxes I can see
Covered in flags that I can't see them on TV
Don't need no more lies
Don't need no more lies
Don't need no more lies
Don't need no more lies
The restless consumer flies
Around the world each day
With such an appetite for taste and grace
People from around the world
Need someone to listen
We're starving and dying from our disease
We need your medicine
How do you pay for war
And leave us dyin'?
When you could do so much more
You're not even tryin'
Don't need no TV ad
Tellin' me how sick I am
Don't want to leave
Don't want to know how many people are like me
Don't need no dizziness
Don't need no nausea
Don't need no side effects like diarrhea or sexual death
Don't need no more lies
Don't need no more lies
Don't need no more lies
Don't need no more lies
The restless consumer lies
Asleep in her hotel
With such an appetite
For anything that sells
A hundred voices from a hundred lands
Need someone to listen
People are starving here and there
They don't see the world the way you do
There's no mission accomplished here
Just death to thousands
A hundred voices from a hundred lands
Cry out in unison
Don't need no terror squad
Don't want no damned Jihad
Blowin' themselves away in my hood
But we don't talk to them
And we don't learn from them
Hate don't negotiate with Good
Don't need no more lies
Don't need no more lies
Don't need no more lies
Don't need no more lies
The restless comsumer flies
Around the world each day
With such an appetite for efficiency
And pace
Don't need no more lies
What we're dealing with here is a total lack of respect for the law 
I'm the law and you can't beat the law       
I'm the law and you can't beat the law 
I'm the law and you can't beat the law 
Fuck 'em and their law 
Crackdown at sundown 
Fuck 'em and their law
We're moving on the bags are all packed
I'm feeling like less of a wreck
The plans for revenge have all been detailed and laid out
The graves have all been dug don't let me forget one for myself
I've got hate running through my veins
And my blood runs like the venom of a poisonous snake
Emptiness, my old friend
Keep me company as I hunt down and kill my enemies cause there must be someone to blame
Someone to blame for the way I've been feeling
I've been shot at, I've been cheated, how could you send me to this place
I have every right to feel the way I've been feeling shut up - I don't want to hear anymore of your dirty excuses
You've got hate running through your veins
And your blood runs like the venom of a poisonous snake
Emptiness, my old friend
Will be your victory and the riches you have earned you deserve every red cent
It's too late to turn back now
Crying for a love that you know you never learned how to make
Buried in what you dug
Crying for a love when you know you never learned how
Hate is running through my veins
And my blood runs like the venom of a poisonous snake
Emptiness, my old friend
Keep me company as I hunt down and kill my enemies cause there must be
Sometimes I try to do things, and it just doesn't work out the way I wanted to.
And I get real frustrated and like I try hard to do it. 
I like take my time and it just doesn't work out the way I wanted to.
It's like I concentrate on it real hard and it just doesn't work out
And Everything I do and everything I try it never turns out.
It's like I need time to figure these things out.
There's always someone there going
Hey Buddy:
You know, we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately. 
You know, you need to maybe get away and like maybe you should talk about it,
You'll feel a lot better
I go:
No it's okay, you know I'll figure it out, just leave me alone I'll figure it out. 
You know I'll just work it out myself.
And they go:
Well you know if you want to talk about it I'll be here you know and you'll 
Probably feel a lot better if you talk about it, so why don't you talk about it?
I go:
No. I don't want to talk about it. I'm okay, I'll figure it out myself but they just keep 
Bugging me and they just keep bugging me and it builds up inside.
So you're gonna be institutionalized
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
You won't have anything to say
They'll brainwash you until you see their way.
I'm not crazy (being institutionalized)
You're the one who's crazy (being institutionalized)
You're driving me crazy (being institutionalized)
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself
I was in my room and I was like just sitting there staring at the wall thinking about 
Everything but then again I was thinking about nothing
And my mom came in and I didn't even realize she was there and she calls my 
Name but I didn't even hear it, and she started screaming BUDDY! BUDDY!
And I go:
What, what's the matter?
And she goes:
What's the matter with you?
I go:
There's nothing-wrong Mom.
And she goes:
Don't tell me that, you're on drugs!
I go:
Mom I'm not on drugs I'm okay, I was just thinking you know, why don't 
You get me a pepsi?
And she goes:
NO you're on drugs!
I go:
Mom I'm okay, I'm just thinking.
She goes:
No you're not thinking, you're on drugs! Normal people don't act that way!
I go:
Mom just give me a Pepsi please
All I want is a Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me
All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me.
Just a Pepsi.
They give you a white shirt with long sleeves
Tied around you're back, you're treated like thieves
Drug you up because they're lazy
It's too much work to help a crazy
I'm not crazy (being institutionalized)
You're the one who's crazy (being institutionalized)
You're driving me crazy (being institutionalized)
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself
I was sitting in my room and my mom and my dad came in and they pulled up 
A chair and they sat down and they go:
Buddy, we need to talk to you
And I go:
Okay what's the matter?
They go:
Me and your mom we've been noticing lately that you've been having a lot of 
Problems, you've been going off for no reason and we're afraid you're gonna 
Hurt somebody, we're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself.
So we decided that it would be in your interest if we put you somewhere 
Where you could get the help that you need.
And I go:
Wait, what are you talking about, WE decided!? MY best 
Interest?! How do you know what MY best interest is? How can you say what 
MY best interest is? What are you trying to say, I'M crazy? When I went to 
YOUR schools, when I went to YOUR churches, when I went to
YOUR institutional learning facilities?!
How can you say I'm crazy?
They say they're gonna fix my brain
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
But by the time they fix my head
Mentally I'll be dead
I'm not crazy (being institutionalized)
You're the one who's crazy (being institutionalized)
You're driving me crazy (being institutionalized)
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself
It doesn't matter. I'll probably get hit by a car anyway.
Speak the truth don't you dare lie to me
I've seen it all before the way you disagree
The way you always attack all the things that you say
The way you turn your back and then you walk away
Shut your mouth and open up your eyes
You better take your time and try to realize
That no-one's free from sin and when I look at you
I scream within WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
You raise yourself up to a higher degree
And look down in disgust at our misery
You're no better than your enemy
But it's easy to hate what you just can't be
Don't deny the fact that you're a mortal man
You can't escape from death when it's close at hand
Don't sit upon a pedestal and raise your voice
If you're too deaf to listen to the people's choice
Truth, tell me the truth, the truth motherfucker
Tell me the truth, tell me the truth, tell me the truth
The truth you sucker
Truth, tell me the truth, the truth motherfucker
Tell me the truth, tell me the truth, tell me the truth
The truth you sucker
You play us out and take us all for fools
But I never understood who even made the rules
I'll make my stand against supremacy
Cos hypocritical governments threaten me
I know you ain't blind and I know you're aware
But you ego's too big for you to even care
The doors are wide open but your eyes are closed
You're unable to look any further than your nose
You open your mouth and all I hear is lies
You keep spreading your message that I despise
The game you're playing is so easy to see
It's just another repeat of our history
You talk about peace it's a very strong word
It's always being said but it's never been heard
Hi-tech weapons are here to reassure it
But I've never seen a time when they've done shit for it
Truth, tell me the truth, the truth motherfucker
Tell me the truth, tell me the truth, tell me the truth

Get off my back
Out of my life
Everything is building up
Take the lid of the pot
Before it blows up
Chewed my fingernails to the bone
Get off my back
Just leave me alone
Wake up tomorrow, do it again
Yes sir, yes ma'am
No sir, no ma'am
Get so fed up
With your fucking scams
Chewed my fingernails to the bone
Get off my back
Just leave me alone
Pressure, pressure, pressure
Ah...
Heavy weight on my mind
Not enough beer
To erase the thought
Work, money, bills, reality,
No spare time no sanity
Check your diction
Search your memory
Create your history
Still not true
Write your novel
Pick and shovel
You will need them when I bury you
No forgiveness
You're no martyr
Sell yourself
Make it true
Check your gammar
Your bad nature
Exaggerations still not true
Ask your question listen closely
Here's your answer
It's still FUCK YOU
No forgiveness you're no martyr
Sell yourself
Make it true
There's no price tag on my conscience
Here's your answer it's still
Fuck you
I met a man who was gone in a day
He grabbed my hands
Memories flashed away
I met a man who was once on my side
He wrote a book
And now everyone LIES
NO
No forgiveness you're no martyr
Sell yourself
Make it true
There's no price tag on my conscience
Here's your answer it's still
Fuck you
My bones are tired, Daddy
I don't get enough sleep
I don't eat as good as I should, Daddy
What's that say about me?
Sometimes I sleep past noon, Daddy
Drink lots of black coffee and I smoke like a chimney,
Yes, I left the refrigerator door half open, Daddy
What's that say about me?
Sometimes I want to rip out your throat, Daddy
For all those things you said that were mean,
Gonna make you just as vunerable as I was, Daddy
What's that say about me?
Sometimes I want to bash in your teeth, Daddy
Gonna use your tongue as a stamp
Gonna rip your heart out the way you did mine, Daddy
Go ahead and psycho-analyse that
'Cause I'm your creation, I'm your love Daddy
Grew up to be and do all those sick things you said I'd do
Well last night I saw you sneak out your window
With your white hood, Daddy
What's that say about you?
I'm sloppy, what's that say about you?
I'm messy, what's that say about you?
My bones are tired, Daddy.
Just enough water to ensurface the world
Oil baron running the government
So I'll start a war
All votes invalid, use any old lie
Gonna carve up your wealth like pumpkin pie
Only fools won't realize, you won't be told
That empires run on the old black gold
It's a global abrasion
It's consecration
United Nations
It's a total invasion
Terrify them, complete submission
This is our goal, this is our mission
Destroy your customs, you'll have no say
We'll clothe your women in the western way
It's a fucking crusade
A lesson in trade
So all you intellectuals
We're gonna invade
It's a global abrasion
It's consecration
United Nations
It's a total invasion
The final push, the last battle
Even restored? Man is cattle
We want your oil, we want your land
We'll take your wealth, you'll have much less
We'll change your God to the "Bitch Goddess"
It's a global abrasion
It's consecration
United Nations
It's a total invasion
It's a global abrasion
It's consecration
United Nations
It's a total invasion
Ignorance is bliss, no wise woman's failed to mention,
And surely some koan suggests: "neglect leads to perfection."
But the more I turn my face from the crowd,
The more I feel my back's increasingly compelled.
For the sake of escape, to turn a knife on itself,
A knife of relief, from all the petty insight,
And finally I'll sleep, I'll sleep through the night.
Bored as fuck with this street corner-cover,
Study of a face in a figure. 
Surveying this language as a game,
Surveillance of this language
As the plague. As the plague.
The dimension of persistence condemns.
The plague. The plague.
The dimension of persistence condemns.
As the plague. The plague.
The dimension of persistence condemns.
This portrait of karma, 
Crafted in accident.
Text book seduction,
Minus the text in the language of ghosts.
And so we ran, like the wolves were biting,
The inhibitions of their prey kept them from screaming:
"Scratch my back and I will stab you in yours."
So I chose to live this life alone, without the teeth marks,
But I predict,
I'll have to sink my fangs in someone else's heart to heal my own.
Just a victim's split, 
One part for the wolves, one part for you.
But I'll grow weary soon, weary of this fractal code,
Weary of this hallway lined with ghosts.
Just a scratch upon the skin, 
A drop of blood to let them in.
Their words will cause
The sweetest fracture from a stone's throw.
Just a scratch upon the skin, 
A drop of blood to welcome them.
Parasitic, viral critics, 
Or lovers, like spirits mingling in the mist
That we crafted, a starving jury,
Let them eat shit from our trembling hands.
The heat for heat's sake, on this Barnard block of congress.
Deductively speaking, the polar of progress.
Well, maybe I put too much faith in the accident.
Entranced, we danced toward the ripest display of escape.
Let the starving ghosts feast,
From this flesh, from these bones.
Let them all feast. 
In this chess game of language,
Forced to sit so I play all alone, 
Watch the bathos drift forth like the petals from a wild crafted rose.
I know your kind
I've seen that smile
I won't let you come back
But you know
Just how to make my world fall back
Just how to make my world turn black
I cannot breath
My mind is blank
You're laughing when I cry
Why did you bring
My happiness so deep inside
My happiness there just to die
Just how to make my world fall back
Just how to make my world turn black
On sunless days we're side by side
Sunless days
Sunless days
My emotional decay
You're hiding now
I'll cut you out
My sky will gather clouds
Where can I go
I try to hide but can not find
I try to leave all things behind
My happiness so deep inside
My happiness there just to die
'Cause on sunless days we're side by side
Sunless days
Sunless days
My emotional decay
I try to hide but can not find
I try to leave all things behind
'Cause on sunless days we're side by side
Sunless days
Sunless days
My emotional decay
In the day by day collision
Called the art of growing up
There's an innocence we look for in the stars
To be taken back to younger days
When there was no giving up
On the people we held closest to our hearts
Yeah it is you that I remember in that glowing
It is you that took my first away from me
It is you I set my standards to... to every walk of life
I haven't met another you since you were with me.
Sing with me...
(Chorus) A brief bout with a razorblade cut me
I freaked out, thinking people didn't love me
I watched closely as the you I knew forgot me
In letting go, I am so proud of what I've done, yeah
In a way, I failed religion
I spit the wine from mouth to cup
And I reached for something more than just your God
Uncle, you spared not your children
And while your praying hands were up
There's no forgiveness for you, you sick fuck!
Because it is you that I remember in their bedroom
It is you that took their first away from them
It is you they set their standards to
You wounded them for life
You were a preacher and suppose to be above men
Sing with me...
A brief bout with a razorblade cut me
I freaked out, thinking people didn't love me
I watched closely as the you I knew forgot me
In letting go, I am so proud of what I've done, yeah
A brief bout with a razorblade cut me
I freaked out, thinking people didn't love me
I watched closely as the you I knew forgot me
In letting go, I am so proud of what I've done, yeah
When I'm wrong, I don't care!
If I'm right,
I will be programmed and compared!
If I crash,
If I fail,
I'll be waiting for you deep in hell!
Well it's the loneliest place to go;
The loneliest place to hide!
Look at us now,
Up in the sky!
We went and taught ourselves to fly!
Parasites,
Sell advice!
And the weak will never trust what they've become!
They're most safely and perfectly them!
Kissing 'cause they never fight!
They fist and they fuck through the night!
Look at them now,
Up in the sky!
They went and taught themselves to die!
We won't be paragraphed by silence.
We won't be hidden by the phone.
We may appear sidetracked by violence.
We may appear as barking dogs.
Nothing is wrong,
We are impossibly strong!
Gather your strength,
Believe everything you say!
Never break down,
Follow or blindly obey!
Inveigh!
Look at us now,
Up in the sky!
We taught ourselves!
We taught ourselves!
We taught ourselves!
We taught ourselves to fly!
Dead girls dance they burn and twirl
Witch cunt
Witch hunt burn this girl
Dead girls dance they burn and twirl
Witch hunt
Witch cunt burn this girl
Dead girls dance they burn and twirl
Witch hunt
Witch cunt burn this girl
Dead girls dance they burn and twirl
I'm running out of air
There's a carnival in the graveyard tonight
With the clouds that fall with poison
And they fall on my skin making tiny holes
Erasing my legacy
Nothings hurts
Nothings right
I am nothing
Turning to the left
I get on a ride
And the ride's dark...
And neon drive nazi cars...
And I am no longer afraid
Because I've held on so tight
That I've crushed them... I've crushed them
It covers me
And I try to find comfort in the darkness
Where I am no longer your misanthropic majesty
With only one match... and one chance to burn,
Only one...
I'm burning
I'm fucking burning
Witch hunt
Witch cunt burn this girl
It's the emptiness that follows you down
It's the ache inside when it all burns out
It's poisonous it muscles it aches
It's everything you had when it breaks
It's the emptiness that's all you have left
Too terrified of your frozen breath
It's a bitter mouth it's buttered and knifed
It's the awful truth you fight for your life
It might as well it might as well hurt
It might as well it might as well
I went down to rescue you
I went all the way down
Fill your hungry wretched life
Here they come it's closing time
It's the bitter root it's twisted inside
It's the heart you used to have when it died
It's the emptiness it poisons it lies
It's everything that you'll never find
It might as well it might as well hurt
It might as well it might as well
I went down for the remains
Sort through all your blurs and stains
Take your rapture blister burns
Stand in line it's not your turn
All dressed in red, always the bride
Off with her head, all dressed in white
Off with her head
I went down to rescue you
I went all the way down
I went down for the remains
Sort through all your blurs and stains
Ooh, I will follow you
Anytime anywhere
Ooh, when they come for you
Just say you don't care
Your mouth is like a funeral
Where words go to die
Your mouth is like a funeral
Where kisses go to die
I'm not the girl that stopped and stared
I'm not the girl that lied
Your mouth is like a funeral
Where kisses go to die
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you got
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you get from me
Your mouth is like an open sore
Where words blister and die
Your mouth is like an open sore
Where kisses rot and die
I'm not the girl that stopped and stared
I'm not the girl that lied
Your mouth is like an open sore
Where kisses rot and die
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you got
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you get from me
Clear hearts, grey flowers
Clear hearts and GREY...
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you wanted
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
Fuck you
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This what you want this is what you want
This is what you wanted
Fuck you
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want this is what you get
This is what you want from me
From... me
I know I've been tolerant till now,
But here comes a warning,
There's a very clear line that I'm drawing,
And if you cross it.
Sod off
Sod off
If you think I'll let you pull me down to
Your third-class communication,
And bulldoze over all my sensitivities
You've read me all wrong.
Sod off
Sod off
Sod off
Sod off
Things so far,
Have been too perfect
This is the premiere
But, oh, how many dress rehearsals
I've been through
Darling this is far too pure and perfect
I let you corrupt it.
Sod off!
I won't let you ruin this.
Sod off.
Sod off.
Sod off.
Sod off.
Sod off.
Nail the bodies to the crucifix
Slit the throats of all the priests
The last smile they will ever expect
A gaping hole running right through their neck
Snakes get fat while the good rats die
All the pigs should be bled dry
Who's with me?
All your sins will be forgiven
When your blood begins to thicken
You have no answers to our questions
God bless this great depression
Snakes get fat while the good rats die
All the pigs should be bled dry
Who's with me?
Throw the bodies into the streets
Nothing more than rotten meat
Taught not to bite the hand that feeds
Till it's cold and dry and no longer bleeds
The snakes get fat while the good rats die
So all the pigs should be bled dry
The London metropolitan
All the fucking clergy men
Child abusers, National Front
Rapists, racists, all fucking scum
And they march hand in hand
To rape our green and pleasant land
Dust to dust, earth to earth
The new born babies drowned at birth
And there's no future for England's son
There nine years old and they all carry guns
Take out your crowbars, take out your knives
Drain out your blood we all deserve to die
It's time for us to take a stand
We are dying on our knees in this grey broken land
And all the martyrs they have convinced themselves
That death ain't a sin when you're living in hell
There ain't no glory and there ain't no hope
We will hang ourselves, just show us the rope
There ain't no scapegoats left to blame
We brought this on ourselves, and we could have been the change
Great Britain is fucking dead
So cut our throats
End our lives
Let's fucking start again
I am a bitch
How do you want me?
From behind
Or on my knees?
I am a slut
Please hold me down
I'll be your noise
This shit will fuck you up
I wrote this song about you
I wrote this song about you
Just to let you know that I hate your guts
And I think you suck
I wrote this song about you
I wrote this song about you
Just to let you know that I hate your guts
And I think you suck
I hate the way you look
(You make me sick)
I hate the way you talk
(I wanna punch you in the face)
I can't stand you at all
(You drive me insane)
Why won't you go away?
I wrote this song about you
I wrote this song about you
Just to let you know that I hate your guts
And I think you suck
This is your song
Congratulations
You're the inspiration
I hate you so much
That I wrote this song
Congratulations
You're immortalized
I hate so much
I hope you fuckin' die
Seventeen years ago
They told me to teach you everything I know
I let the fire rain down
Rain down
Watched it flare up inside his heart
Saw it tearing him completely apart
Head to toe
I know
And blood will run
Through the streets of Rome today
And roll across the ocean
Fourteen years ago tonight
Watched him tearing through the garden, killing everything in sight
I let my curiosity
Get the best of me
I saw the sourceless anger eating at him from inside
No one around him to stem the rising tide
Evil from his head down to his feet
Quinine's bitter, sugar's sweet
And blood will run
Through the streets of Rome today
And roll across the ocean
Today was gonna be the day
He'd already wrote the note
And parked that Chevrolet
At the end of that dead end road
Had his finger on the trigger; just about to end everything
He was taking one last long breathe; when he heard his cell phone ring
And his best friends say man where you been?
We're headed down to the lake this weekend
You better not miss it 'cause buddy I swear
It won't be the same If you ain't there
And I told that girl that you like so much
You were coming along and her eyes lit up
I better let you go man I really hope I didn't catch you in the middle of anything
He said you kinda did but I don't mind at all
I'm glad you called
In another town down the road
In the backseat of a car
Two 18 year olds had let a kiss go to far
He said how are we gonna have this child
When were both headed off to school?
He convinced her late one night there's only one thing to do
She was scared to death in that waiting room
When the nurse asked how far along are you
She said 5 weeks and just about then her phone lit up
And his call came in
Saying baby I was wrong about everything
I've already bought you a diamond ring we' re gonna start a life
Would you be my wife
Boy or girl; pink or blue; yeah either way
All she could say as she felt those tear drops falls was
I'm so glad you called
If someone you know is weighing on your mind
And needs a friend on the end of that other line
Don't hesitate what you say may seem so small
But who knows
They might be glad you called
So make the call
Yeah make that call
Will you accept a collect call
From Robert Plant?
We picked him up on Vine
On a bus bench singing that song
He cannot stop
This is not the 1st time
He was so cute
Jonny Punk Rock, so cynical
You woulda jumped him too!
Why are the burners always toast?
Why are the stoners always stoned?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
To get away from the Zeplin song
I got a job minimum wage & a tabledance
He drinks my beer and plays guitar
He's on my bed wasted every night when I come home
Play the same 'ol lead again and again...
Sometimes I gotta say shut up
Sometimes I gotta say so what
I don't think that it's so punk
What's with the Zeplin song
Sometimes I gotta ride
Sometimes I gotta hide
Sometimes I press rewind
I gotta throw the trash out
He's on a stairway to hell
Yeah that is him
Playin' the zeplin song again and again and again and again and again and again
I'm a guitar
A les paul single cut away
Please don't play that song on me again
I'll explode
I'll break all my strings, stop playing shit
Like the Sex Pistols or anything
(Sunhouse or the blues)
Why does he rain on my parade?
Why does the song remain the same?
I can't remember my own name
I work for minimum wage
Oh go sell it to Jimmy Page
At the crossroads with the deal he made
'Cause that song ain't goin' away
Oh God the Zeplin song
Nono the Zeplin song
Here comes the Zeplin song
Oh God the Zeplin song
Shut up!
Turn, turn the radio low
I've got to talk to you
Turn, turn the radio low
Got a half-Armenian girlfriend
She tests me like a ScanTron
She'll only tell me what's wrong
If she's hit the bong ba-bong bong
Feeling melodramatic and spastic
She ain't made of West Coast plastic
And I lie awake with an achin'
Is it all in my head like she said?
Turn, turn the radio low
I've got to talk to you
Turn, turn the radio low
We're coming up with the sounds
That you make underground
Then you walk on, I'm running after you
I'm in love with the way
That you're making me wait
I just wanna be catchin' up to you
Got a half Armenian girlfriend
She's hotter than I am handsome
She'll fuck you up and then some
She'll rock the boat to bedlam
Feeling melodramatic and spastic
She ain't made of west-side plastic
And I lie awake with an achin'
Is it all in my head like she said?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm in love with the sounds
That you make underground
Then you walk on, I'm running after you
I'm in love with the way
That you're making me wait
I just wanna be catchin' up to you
I just wanna be catchin' up to you
I just wanna be catchin' up to you
I just wanna be catchin' up to you
Turn, turn the radio low
I've got to talk to you
Turn, turn the radio low
I've gotta get through to you
We walked along the beach
What a moon lit night
He held my hands in his
He kissed me he said
I wanna spend my life with you
I want you for my wife
Just then I thought
What about the times you lied to me
What about the times you said no one would want me
What about all the shit you've done to me
What about that 
What about that
What about the times you yelled at me
What about the times I cried
You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things
What about that
What about that
I took a pause
And then a deep sigh
He looked right into my eyes
As he said
I know I didn't say somethin' wrong
I didn't have the courage to say
But then I thought
What about the times you lied to me
What about the times you said no one would want me
What about all the shit you've done to me
What about that 
What about that
What about the times you yelled at me
What about the times I cried
You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things
What about that
What about that
Oh
What about the times you hit my face
What about the times you kept on when I said
No more please
What about those things
What about that
What about that oh
What about the times you shamed me
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her
She only gave you head
What about that
What about that
Don't wanna live my life in misery
Don't tell me you did it 'cause you love me
I don't believe
I'm sick and tired
Your deceptive games
Wonder where
You have been
I can't live life wondering
My heart was poundin'
But the time had come
To stop lettin' my whisperin' heart control me
And tellin' my screamin' mind what to do
I looked him straight in the eye
And then I said
What about the times you lied to me
What about the times you said no one would want me
What about all the shit you've done to me
What about that 
What about that
What about the times you yelled at me
What about the times I cried
You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things
What about that
What about that
What about the times you hit my face
What about the times you kept on when I said
No more please
What about those things
What about that
What about that oh
What about the times you shamed me
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her
She only gave you head
What about that
What about that
What about the times you lied to me
What about the times you said no one would want me
What about all the shit you've done to me
What about that 
What about that
What about the times you yelled at me
What about the times I cried
You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things
What about that
What about that
What about the times you hit my face
What about the times you kept on when I said
No more please
What about those things
What about that
What about that oh
What about the times you shamed me
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her
She only gave you head
What about that
What about that
The doctor released me
A case of underjoyed
No lack of nutrition
Something I can't avoid
No mental condition
Maybe I'm paranoid
Or maybe
Maybe
I'm just bored
I'm just damn bored
I'm just damn bored
I'm just damn bored
An old friend convinced me that he was underjoyed
He never caused friction
His ego he destroyed
He made a decision
He jumped into the void
Or maybe
Maybe he's just bored
He's just damn bored
He's just damn bored
He's just damned
Drown your fears in alcohol
Everybody slips and falls
Choke on every dream you ever had
Drown your fears in alcohol
Everybody slips and falls
Choke on every dream you ever had
Keep yourself in six degrees
No one ever comforts me
Why should they bother
When I'm alone and I'm so damn bored
I am so bored
I am so bored
I am so bored
I am so
No No No No
Bored
I am so bored
I am so bored
I'm so damned
That keeps me underjoyed
The God machine is hungry
For individualism and ripe brains
The skull farmers do their rain dance
And pray the machine falls to sleep
She holds me close
And whispers wet
"There are cannibals among us."
Mad in love with dry dead boys
In the backs of
Abandoned cars
Smoking the bones of children
Plotting the murder of love
Strapped into the chair
The needle now descends
As they lick their cracking lips
Their twitching never ends
Blood beneath their finger nails,
Swallow all my pain
Dirty needles break the skin
Suck hard as I drain
Drain me
Drain me
Sunken eyes, a twisted spine
A whiter shade of pale
Rockabilly man come to pound the coffin nails
Inject my stomach full of
Cockroach eggs
Their machine is coming carried on a million legs
Waking in the sleep of reason
Winter is the forever season
Lick thy mother's bleeding lips
From this glass of hate we sip
Fuck the glass we pump the keg
Kill conception at the egg
Her chin is wet with someone's hate
Love, disfigure, amputate
Amputate
Amputate
Can you remember how it felt to be alive?
Your god machine is cold
And dead your eyes they cannot cry
Fuck your deities of dying love
We have shot them down from the skies above
Screaming convulsing
My eyes are bleeding
Be silent now and take your beating
I wonder how long you would live
With a bullet in your gut
I wonder how much shit you'd talk
If your throat was cut
I wonder what you'd sound like begging me
To let you breathe
I wonder how much pain it would take
To make you all believe
Believe, believe, believe, believe
In me
I'm your god machine
Fuck your god
Fuck everyone of you,
Motherfuckin' rats,
You got so much hate,
And I guessin' is cause of the fact,
Everytime were taking one step forward,
You take two steps back.
I do this shit for myself,
This is where I wanna be,
This is home,
'Cause I know everyone here treats friends like family,
Go fuck yourself you ain't no one to us,
Go fuck yourself you ain't one we can trust,
And when you got no one we'll give a fuck,
Ashes to ashes dust to dust.
Fuck everyone of you,
Motherfuckin' snakes,
You got so much hate,
To face no good fakes,
It ain't on us that your life sucks,
And you're a fuckin' disgrace.
I do this shit for myself,
This is where I wanna be,
This is home,
'Cause I know everyone here treats friends like family,
Go fuck yourself you ain't no one to us,
Go fuck yourself you ain't one we can trust,
And when you got no one we'll give a fuck,
Ashes to ashes dust to dust.
Oh.
Your nobody,
We don't need you,
You were never shit,
Your mother should've swallowed you,[x2]
The clues to you and I are sprawling out like roads
And if we find a place for them they won't lead home
I only meant to say it once but it's too late
I'm into you and out again
The rotted love manipulates me
The rotted love that twists the fates seem
A bit confused by my reflection
'Cause if we die there's still direction and
I I you we're not thinking my stromata
I I you we're not thinking my stromata
If I can think on purpose then you'll be right here
A paranoia got the best of what I hold dear
The cold linoleum is talking up my shoes
Deciphering the truth of us
And now I know what I'm about to lose
Now I know what I'm about to choose
Now we go for some reaction
A little game of who's distracted more and
I I you we're not thinking my stromata
I I you we're not thinking my stromata
I I you we're not thinking my stromata
And see the disappointments walking in their line
But every step they take is perfectly in time
I'm singing you in every breath I'm left to heave
I feel your arms surrounding me
And when I'm in a dirty river
And my receiver meets her giver
I set a trap to come and catch you
Oh someone stop me now I can't do this
I I you we're not thinking my stromata
I I you we're not thinking my stromata
I I you we're not thinking my stromata
I I you we're not thinking my stromata
I I we're not thinking my stromata
I I we're not thinking my stromata
I I we're not thinking my stromata
I I we're not thinking my stromata
I lost my heart on a Monday
And I'm still ripped off and passed out
Too much alcohol and weed shot my ass out
One of these girlies made my day for real
And I've got to tell you a little sum about the way that I feel
I don't know how old she was but it doesn't matter
I know that they do it better
No older woman can do it the way they do
Fuck more experience when they choose you
I just cannot explain why these girlies always hit me like an a-train
With their buttersoft skin and their curly hair
They try to look innocent, but they are always up to sin
L-y-n
They knock you out at the drop of the dime
First eye contact yo that's the moment when you wanna die
But when you take a look downsouth
You'll see a hell of a body on the way to blast your eyes out.
Drinking brew after school, kissing ex-friends girlfriends
Hands always where this skirt ends
They wanna make you hot, no doubt!
And you wanna take a shot, no doubt!
Wicked games that's the way how they wanna play
Naughty thoughts and a surprise under their shorts
At any given time she wants to do you, screw you
Use and abuse you like she's always used to
Yo! you can run but you cannot hide
You're a two-second-brother when your hips collide
You know who we're talking about, no doubt!
The little young nastees, no doubt!
L-y-n
Someone please!
Please write a script that's made for me,
That appeals to people listening to this cd.
I got a wish, I got a wish,
That all of this was something special.
I need a drink, I need a pill,
No wait, I was over two years sober.
But this guy, he said that I was on drugs,
I should give some money to that bitch.
Or I could just get a real fucking job.
I am a prick, look at me go.
I can get lucky playing some shows, I'm a bitch.
Ima go get some new expensive shit.
Oh man, I hurt,
Emotions they suck,
But I'll just tell people, "I don't give a fuck about that shit."
Ain't nobody fucking with me, man.
Ain't nobody fucking with me.
Rancid is the sound of my voice,
Croaking its drama across an orchestra of friendly faces,
Singing along with their dying concern.
Rancid is the sound of my voice,
Croaking its drama across an orchestra of friendly faces,
Singing along with their dying concern to my bullshit.
Where did our honor go?
I think I know.
We've all been fucking each other in bathrooms at parties.
Where did my money go?
I spent it on blow,
You know that I fucked all my homies' ho's.
Where did our morals go?
I left them in Cabo,
My parents can pay for the abortion, you know.
Who has a plan?
We hold out our hands in hope for a free ride to successful endeavors.
The weak are the liars, the strong think too much.
I am too cynical to say I don't give a fuck.
The weak are the liars, the strong think too much.
I am too cynical to say I don't give a fuck.
I need money,
I need clothes.
I need women,
I need blow.
Something is very fucking wrong.
Resting your head on your best friend's sister's shoulder.
Your mother's job is to fuck all your neighbors,
Bodies thrusting to the beat of our shame.
Where did our honor go?
I think I know.
We've all been fucking each other in bathrooms at parties.

Give my regards to all you shady fucks,
Thorn in my fucking side.
Loyalty.
Honesty.
Trust.
Respect.
Humility.
Sincerity.
We are all so full of fucking shit.
We are all so full of fucking shit.
The revisionist's death by her own hand
Poison eggs the implement
I am chest deep in her swarm
Poison eggs reverse swallowed
I see them seething between her fingers
She sets them free
I bleed me
The revisionist's death by her own hand
Poison eggs the implement
I am chest deep in her swarm
Poison eggs reverse swallowed
Blood flowing faster, no clotting
The swarm is feeding defeat
Defeat
Defeat
Defeat
You would look so magnificent crawling on those bloodied knees
The swarm is flocking to the wound
Their speed only matched by their efficiency

Glory is relative, relative to the one that lives in defeat

Crawling in my skin
(Without a sense of confidence)
Consuming, confusing
Crawling in my skin
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure too take)
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Crawling in my skin (Crawling in my skin)
These wounds, they will not heal (These wounds won't heal)
Fear is how I fall (Fear is how I fall)
Confusing, confusing what is real
Confusing what is real
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling
I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting, how I can't seem...
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure
Without a sense of confidence (confidence)

Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take

So insecure...
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real
Rest your bones,
I am feeling weak again so please rest with me.
I dare not ask who's been helping you fall asleep,
Oh honey.
I'm so tense, gasoline machines can't save me now.
Is this how you get what you want?
'Cause I'd give you everything
And I could be destructive too.
I'll do anything you make me do. And I can be the one
Who brings this down. No, please don't make me,
Please don't make me.
Change is coming, yes it's on its way to make things fair,
And I'm colliding with the space you're making.
Oh honey now I'm afraid that this is way, this is the way
You're gonna be. And I could be destructive too.
I'll do anything you make me do. And I can be the one
Who brings this down. No, please don't let me,
Please don't let me.
I'll hunt the hands that took my place, and hang them
On the wall so high. I'll make this fair if it's what you want.
I dare not ask, I dare not ask for more.

I can change I can cut it open
Look at me the way you did before
I can change
Diagnose the symptom
Buy the anecdote but not the cure
Hold me under
Cut away this empty
Hold me under
Change the way I feel about you
I can change
I'll correct the defect
Repair the injury called you and me
I can change
I'll surrender to it
I can suffer with the best of them
Hold me under
Cut away this empty
Hold me under
Change the way I feel about you
I can't change
I'll replace the decay
Make you second guess your everyday
I can't change
I'll survey the damage
Kill the narcissist with his reflection
Until tomorrow
Hold me under
Cut away this empty
Hold me under
Change the way I feel about you
Hold me under
Cut away this empty
Hold me under
Change the way I feel about you
Until tomorrow
Oh my god there's scenesters everywhere
With their hair gel and their vintage t-shirts
Why didn't the Shins come to Phoenix?
And why didn't Mirah come to Phoenix?
Because the modified is too small
And the marquis is too big
And the complex is rightfully dead
And the hipsters with their snide comments and aversion to applause
Oh my god hardcore kids everywhere
With their hair gel and their color green
How do they look so good while their convictions remain so strong?
Because their hair gel that they use isn't tested on animals
And their swallow tattoos are fucking lame
And cocaine is essentially vegan
And they don't give a fuck anyway
They're so vain, and yes, this song is about them
Oh my god post-hardcore kids everywhere
With their violence and pomposity
So fucking straightedge getting high off of self-righteousness
And praying to a sideways cross
So urban, so infantile, so angry, so young, and so poor
They don't need to use a crutch 'cause they've got the wheelchair
Oh my god there's assholes everywhere
Pretentious fucking assholes everywhere
Oh my god there's assholes everywhere
Pretentious judgmental assholes everywhere

Never did and never will
It's just the way it's always been
I've made mistakes before
I'll make the same again
And all this tension we ignore
It surely works its ugly way inside
I have known that nothing's fair
And surely what did I expect
When magic slips into the air
And every day is another test
And all this tension we ignore
It surely works its ugly way outside
So let it build, let it explode
Leaving blood and shattered bones
Or bite your tongue until you've forgotten what to say
And take another step back, until you find you've walked away
Silence's like disease, but I dare not say it hurts
'Cause if I honestly react, nothing's ever gonna work
And all this tension back and forth
It's just the beauty of the ride
Slow down (Slow down)
I lived a life with no regrets till you came around
(You're lost I'm found)
You had a hold on me
But now it's slippin away
You used me
Never would I thought you'd try to lie and deceive me
I'm sure you thought I'd be easy
(You had a chance but now there's nothing
That you can call your own)
Why does it feel like
I have been the only one
Who stopped and swam
(Up the river)
If everything you said to me was a lie then,
I really think (that I beg to differ)
No time I'm gone
You had your chance now let me show you the way around
(Your loss mine now)
I let you call it once
You'll never do it again
You fooled me
Once and then you should have figured
Now there's just one space
That you can fill but it's empty
(You'll never find a place that you can call your own now)
Why does it feel like
I have been the only one
Who stopped and swam
(Up the river)
If everything you said to me was a lie then
I really think (that I beg to differ)
I'll never understand
(I don't fuckin' understand why)
You used me
Never would I thought you'd try to lie and deceive me
I'm sure you thought I'd be easy
Why does it feel like
I have been the only one
Who stopped and swam
(Up the river)
If everything you said to me was a lie then
I really think (that I beg to differ)
I'm gone
TV party tonight
TV party tonight
TV party tonight
TV party tonight
We're gonna have a TV party tonight... all right
We're gonna have a TV party ...all right... tonight
We've got nothing better to do,
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews
Everybody's gonna hang out here tonight... all right
We'll pass out on the couch all right... tonight
We've got nothing better to do,
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews
Don't talk about anything else... we don't want to know
We're dedicated to our favorite shows
We sit glued to the TV all night... and every night
Why go into the outside world at all... it's such a fright
We've got nothing better to do than watch TV and
Have a couple of brews
TV news shows what it's like out there... it's a scare
You can go out... if you want... we wouldn't dare!
We've got nothing better to do than watch TV
And have a couple of brews
Don't talk about anything else... we don't want to know
We're dedicated to our favorite shows
I wouldn't be without my TV for a day... or even a minute!
I don't bother to use my brain anymore...
There's nothing left in it
Wait a minute my TV set doesn't work
It's broken!
What are we gonna do tonight
This isn't fair
We're hurtin'!
We've got nothing left to do
Left with no TV just a couple brews
What are we gonna talk about... I don't know
We're gonna miss our favorite shows
No TV party tonight.
All I feel is pain it seems today
A dark angel leads me to evil far beyond the grave
Declares me a phantom demon I don't know
It just cannot be defied
At Hell this reflection stares at me
And then I lose my mind
It betrays me
Oh, In hell I'll burn in flames
Oh oh oh oh, If looks could kill then death would be my name
Oh oh oh oh, In hell I'll burn in flames
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel
Angel of Death is bloodied now
He's the one inside
Tortured, scored that strike
Against the fear, it feeds the fire
Near me now, the demon's son
Bruiser I'm the one
Erase my soul for all your sins can never be undone
I can't contain it
Oh, In hell I'll burn in flames
Oh oh oh oh, If looks could kill then death would be my name
Oh oh oh oh, In hell I'll burn in flames
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel the pain (whoa oh)
Feel the pain
The pain
Oh, In hell I'll burn in flames
Oh oh oh oh, If looks could kill then death would be my name (my name)
Oh oh oh oh, In hell I'll burn in flames
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel the pain
Feel the pain
Feel the pain (whoa oh)
Feel the pain yeah
Feel the pain
I see you crying in the sunshine
I hear you laughing in the rain
You say you can't tell any difference
Between the pleasure and the pain
You say you never ever dream at night time
You say you only dream when you're awake
And say that TV looks like your life
And the life you lead is fake
Desperate People
Desperate People
You get your sunshine from a tab of paper
Then you're sitting in a spinning room
The clock is tocking and it's laughing at you
Your life's a mystery without a clue
The crowd you're in thinks you're so amusing
They're oh so flattering and so sincere
They stand and laugh as they watch you crumble
And when you cry for help they don't hear
Desperate People
Desperate People
You feel the earth revolving
You see the sun dissolving
You hear the night calling out to you
You have no direction and you have no protection
What you gonna do when your trip turns blue?
When you come crashing down and there's no help around
You need friends, you need help
But first you have to help yourself
The music stops and the party's over
The money's gone and your crowd is too
Can't break the chains that have kept you under
Has the monkey got the best of you?
I see you crying in the sunshine
I hear you laughing in the rain
You say you can't tell any difference
Between the pleasure and the pain
Desperate People
Got struck by the first volley
Of the war in the courts
Never held my serve
Send'em a wire, give'em my best
This ammunition never rests
No one serves coffee, no one wakes up
Stop breathin'
Stop breathin'
Breathin' for me now
Write it on a postcard          
Dad, they broke me
Dad, they broke me
Stop breathin'
Stop breathin'
Breathin' for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me
Dad, they broke me
I can see the lines open shutters
And the leaves flocked on a grid
That's what they made my hero say
Nothing gets me off so completely
Then when you put it down, ten feet down in the ground
Call it response (to a) negative home
Stop breathin'
Stop breathin'
Breathin' for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me
Dad, they broke me
Stop breathin'
Stop breathin'
Breathin' for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
It's been so long
I've lost my taste
Say angel come
Say lick my face
Let fall your drapes
I'll play the part
I'll open this mouth wide
Eat your heart
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
Lips cracked dry
Tongue blue burst
Say angel come
Say lick my thirst
It's been so long
I've lost my taste

Instrumental
In the belly of the cloud
I was released
You were released
Was it deafeningly loud?
Or was it peace?
Sweet peace
All the streets
All filled with sound
Because it's right
It's for the best
Still I sense
Their judgment now
As we ask for rest
Just rest
I can't sleep until I see you sleeping
Curse my mind and it's all-seeing eye
Watch the rise
And wonder if you're breathing
Against your will
You are alive
I don't recognize the world
That you have made
That we have made
Still you fool yourself to ask
If you had stayed
If we had stayed
At the ringing of a bell
Or at the falling of a tree
If you think of it at all
Remember me
Just me
I can't breathe until I see you waking
Watching as the scars fall from your eyes
Into a world that you may not remember
I hope you die
I hope you die
I hope you die
I hope you die
My dance has passed
Welcome to Hollywood, girl
Wake the fuck up to Hollywood, whore
Combine the throb within my head
Within the rhythm of my fucking feet
Say a novena for all those lost
And read the bloodstains on the sheets
I've whored myself for less than this
And I've prayed to appear too fed
As I knelt on my pillow
God, I clenched my fucking fists and banged my head
Who could ever,
Who the fuck could ever
Take the place of me?
Who could ever,
Who the fuck could ever
Take the place of me?
Now I kiss up to God my fists
And I pray to keep my head
Though I like your pretty eyes better blackened
And my fists all fucking red
Through sickness and health
I've kissed up to God two years
I have focused on the cameos made by the tiger
In the valley of the fucking locust
Who could ever,
Who the fuck could ever
Take the place of me?
Who could ever,
Who the fuck could ever
Take the place of me?
Wipe it off your mouth
Get up off your knees
And make me your god
Who could ever,
Who the fuck could ever
It's sexual debauchery, you fucking cunt
You cost what you're worth
Followed by a boy like this
Re-ignited by all your visits
As long as your mouth is shut
You'll still be fucking beautiful
Pack your shit and leave
And take my memories of her with you
Pack your shit and leave
And take my memories of her with you
Pack your shit and leave
And take my memories of her with you
Pack your shit and leave
And take my memories of her with you
Pack your shit and leave
And take my memories of her with you
Pack your shit and leave
And take my memories of her with you
Pack your shit and leave
And take my memories of her with you
Pack your shit and leave
And take my memories of her with you
Pack your shit and leave
And take my memories of her with you
Pack your shit and leave
And take her fucking with you
If you don't walk with me, I will walk alone
Hard enough to believe in myself
When I know they don't believe in me
Unwilling to change for society
I'll be who I wanna be
I wanna tear it up, tear it out
Get my aggression out
This is what we're here for, control the dance floor
This is why we're here
I said, this is why we're here
So when will it end, when will it end
When will they comprehend, comprehend
That we will overcome this system
I said this is why we're here
They keep on kicking me down, kicking me down
Tryin' to keep me underground, underground
But did I mention we were paving the way
For the new breed of bad seed
We'll never let up until we hear every voice scream
Screamin' these words, screamin' these words
'Til very voice is heard, voice is heard
They keep on screamin' these words, screamin' these words
'Til every voice is heard...
Calling from the underground!
I can feel it in the air breathe!
I can see we all agree
Unwilling to change for society
We'll be who we wanna be
We are the underground
We are the underground
I've seen it turn from white to red
I've heard you talk about how
You bleed and it doesn't mean shit
Until I see some action a hint of
Rose and a mountain of garbage
Leaves me for dead and nothing drags me from
Breaking myself
Breaking myself to try to keep everyone
From walking over me
Smell the burning wreckage of even you
All of your perfection let's get inside
The bag turn it 180 degrees
Forget we even met cause it all comes
Down to this the good ones always
Leave in the end
Breaking myself
Breaking myself to try to keep everyone
From walking over me
I see the world and it all looks blue
I kiss the world and it all tastes true
The blurry eyes make me appealing
In a normal fashion another 2 or 3
You will become very friendly
Your liquidation is a siren song
You swim I follow I'm feeling my head sink
So as to reach and touch what hurts me
Still I try to reach and touch what hurts me
Lay me spread eagle out on your hill, yeah
Then write a book about how I wanted to die
It's hard to talk with your dick in my mouth
I will try to scream in pain a little nicer next time
White boy... Don't laugh...
...Don't cry... Just die!
I'm so sorry if I'm alienating some of you
Your fucking culture alienates me
I can not scream in pain from down here on my knees
I'm so sorry that I think
White boy... Don't laugh...
...Don't cry... Just die!
Big ring around the moon
It's gonna rain hard soon
I know you're gonna leave
It's like a storm inside
You're the Blood Of Me
You're the truth that hurts
You're the memory
You're the drug that works
Why do people change
When hearts, hearts, still beat the same?
You're the Blood Of Me
You're the truth that hurts
You're the memory, yeah
You're the drug that works
I don't believe you when you tell me
I don't believe you when you hold me
I don't believe you.
You're my medicine
I don't believe you when you fuck me
You're the Blood Of Me
You're the Blood Of Me
You're the truth that hurts
You're the memory, yeah
You're the memory
You're the drug that works
You're the Blood Of Me, yeah
You're the Blood Of Me
You're the truth that hurts, hurts
You're the memory, yeah
You're the memory
You're the drug that works
Big ring around the moon
Gonna rain hard soon
Vitalize your benevolent thoughts today
Encrust the encumbrance that encroach your brain
A devastated world we'll see in tomorrow's society
Crushed by our own alternatives we've got ourselves to blame
Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
We obliterate ourselves
Procrastinated measures decrease our chance to save
'Cause you've always got something else in mind
The reignes rain of pollution melts our opportunities
Conjectural in their comfortable lives
Stupidity's separated by a wall of glass
We have to stop this immediately this fucking mess
Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
We obliterate ourselves
Procrastinated measures decreases our chance to save
'Cause you've always got something else in mind why?
Now it's time to save us
Natures demise
We can't control our accessies spreading
Pollution we fumble till the end
The end
The water is filled with toxic waste
And the air is filled with shit to breathe
Soon a dismembered world we'll see
We are in deep shit
We have to change this world
Start to communicate
We can't go on like this no
NO
...And all this because of greed
Now it's time to perceive our inauspicious oversight
We're leaning on death against compensation
Are we so afraid to lose our welfaresociety
That we have to sacrifice ourselves, the earth
Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
We obliterate ourselves
Procrastinated measrues decreases our chance to save
'Cause you've always got something else in mind why?
Exterminate
Exterminate
Exterminate annihilate destroy
Exterminate annihilate destroy
Give me a faith, something I can believe in
And you'll be my family, my brother, my friend
Tell me a truth that I find not deceiving
Teach me a lesson that I understand
Build me a shelter, a place I can dwell in
Show me a future that I can enjoy
Give me a reason and I'll be your fellow
Show me the target I have to destroy
Show me my leader and I'll pledge obedience
Whisper the name of the enemy mine
Blessed be my fate and my tools of expedience
And I will fulfill what's my mission divine
Exterminate annihilate destroy
Though I let you steer
You, a cavalier
Inch became a light year
It was pathetic
Well, you can write the play
At every word I say
But I don't have to stay
To see the credits
'Cause it's all over now (All over now)
Yes, it's all over now (All over now)
And I'm free
I was one of few
Who'd stick up for you
And so you never knew
You were a punch line
I could not convince or trust you
To pick up on my hints, must you
Leave your fingerprints
On everything I call mine?
Well, that's all over now (All over now)
Yes, it's all over now (All over now)
And I'm free
Yes, I'm free
From your interference
Which had the appearance
Of making it clear that
It's got nothing to do with me
It's got nothing to do with me
(It's got nothing)
It's got nothing to do with me
It's got nothing to do with me
And I warn you now
The velocity I'm gathering
From the top/From the top/From the top
From the top/From the top/From the top
From the top/From the top
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! (When I'm talking to you!)
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! I'm about to-
Wasn't that fun, let's try something else...
Forty-five calibre killer, but out of the philla?�della?�rella
Show y'all brothers how you not a gorilla
Smooth talking, fully automatic weapon concealer
Taste thriller, break thriller
Let's hit 'em with the bounce filler
Filthy stinking, standing on solid ground
And still be sinking, submerging in the parks
Still be linking, plucked beef when it starts
To fuck your thinking, it's not a mirage
I'm in the motherfucking tractor from out the garage
With an if, you can duck, but it's hard to dodge
In the back of the spine where my darts is lodged
Going to flip it straight up/ripping apart your squad
X-Ecutioner style, cuts and blends like a syringe
Hanging you from each of your limbs
See me coming through your party hard without no bodyguard
Smoking something, stomping on each of you Tims
I'm the B?�to?�the?�L, the A, the C, King
And when it comes to planning
The thought to keep thinking, man
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
There's nothing special about it 
It's either there when you're born or not 
Gifted with talent are no big deal 
Welcome to the death of a century... 
Cause yesterday don't mean shit 
What's over is over and nothing between 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face 
No rewinding time 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Reliving old reviews is a useless tool of confusion 
Don't hold your breath for the turn-around 
Come into the world of endless odds... 
Cause yesterday don't mean shit 
What's over is over and nothing between 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face 
No rewinding time 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
They'll tell you about guilt 
And in time you'll face the darkness... 
But darkness is a friend to you 
Embrace and fly through the madness 
Flying past God and wars and conflict 
Oppressor in you
Oppressor in you
Plowing through minds and paranoia 
Oppressor in you 
The oppressor's in you 
Cause yesterday don't mean shit 
What's over is over and nothing between 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face 
No rewinding time 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Yesterday don't mean jack shit... 
To protect you and I'll keep to myself 
It can only be that way - yeah!
Oh, darling
Please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Oh, darling
If you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Oh believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me, oh, you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly fell down and died
Oh, darling
Please believe me
I'll never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
I hope I see you on your way down
I hope you break every bone
I hope it kills you on your way down
And I hope you die alone
All of your hate and all of your lies
Will it be worth it
When all of your friends refuse to be alibis
Will it be worth it
I'll see you on your way down
I'll see you on your way down
I'll see you on your way down
It's kind of sad to watch you break down
You greedy fuck you pissed it all away
So who will catch you on your way down
You've only got yourself to blame
When all your worst fears materialize
Will it be worth it
There's nobody left who cares you're alive
Was it worth it
I'll see you on your way down
I'll see you on your way down
I'll see you on your way down
Way down
Way down
I'll see you on your way down
I'll see you on your way down
I'll see you on your way down
As he sits on the moor
With his new found friend
Who had shown him the way
To bow out at the end
With a dignity only
A murder can bring
With sweet violation
That versatile thing
Please believe me when I say
This is how it has to end
This is easy on us all
Well, easier than other ways
Sleep is all I ask of you
Sleep and not to wake again
See this through and leave, my friend
Tears will come and I will end
While I hope you all miss me
And weep at my grave
I imagine you'll pray some
And give hope to the brave
To the ones who have loved me
And cared for me so
And who die when I tell them
I just had to go
Please believe me when I say
This is how it has to end
This is easy on us all
Well, easier than other ways
Sleep is all I ask of you
Sleep and not to wake again
See this through and leave, my friend
Tears will come and I will end
I won't try to explain what I cannot understand
It's a bird it's a plane it's a one night stand
If I only we could ride far enough
I'd forget you altogether
It's a bluff
There is no way I could not remember
Don't ask me what I came here for
It is too delicate for words
I used to want to make you talk
Now I would rather you did not
I don't mind if you read while I'm coming
It's alright if you need the TV
To keep from noticing my mind going blank
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Is my back all that bad?
Strike the match and watch the doll come open
Don't ask me what I want from you
It is not something you could purposely do
I used to want to make you mine
Now I have better things in mind...
Listen to what you've got
You listen to what you've got

What happened to you
You're not the same
Something inside your head made a violent change
It's call it religion
You're full of shit
Was she really worth it?
She cost you your life
She'll never leave your side
She's gonna be your wife
It's in your head (3x)
Filler
You call it romance
You're full of shit
Your brain is clay
What's going on?
You picked up a bible
And now you're gone
It's in your head

You call it religion
You're full of shit
You never knew
You never did
You never will
You call it religion
You're full of shit
I Don't Want to Hear It
I don't want to hear it
All you do is talk about you
I don't want to hear it
'Cause I know that none of it's true
I don't want to hear it
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
I don't want to hear it
When are you gonna realize
I don't want to hear it
I know you're full of shit (4x)

Then you're telling lies

I know you're full of shit (4x)
Ah, shut the fuck up
(Intro: Tupac Talking)
Oh, I posted bail?

Fuck the motherfuckin' district attourney and the prosecutor (fuck you!)
And fuck you motherfuckers in the jury box (fuck you!)

Y'all ain't never gonna see me in this motherfucker again

Let these old punk ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit
Niggaz ain't going back to court you stank ass bitches
(Verse 1: 2Pac)
I'm stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail if I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk 'cause I'm rappin'
They askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson
I can't sleep they takin' polaroids
And I'm tryna to use the phone but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my glock cause its major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone that's my word
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo' pictures and make me some more riches
To all the suckers on the block talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep and the fame is brief
And you bullshittin' bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutta I was saved from hell
I'm a thug I was raised in jail
Now I'm out on bail
Out on Bail (You know what fuckin' time it is)
ThugLife will never fail (I'm out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm going straight to 50,000 BIATCH!)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm out on bail)
Out on Bail (Hey, hand me some motherfuckin' Colt 40's from the fridge nigga)
ThugLife will never fail ('Cause I'm out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (Hey, pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex)
Thuglife niggaz (Yes bitch that's a President)
(Verse 2: 2Pac)
Stuck in jail and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild through the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart 'cause I'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark wanna start shit
Rippin' up the scene as a teen I was at it (but hey)
And sellin' products to the addicts 'cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I gotta lotta love
Hangin' out with the OG's shootin' up the clubs
And mama told me don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me then it's on G
Got me sittin' in the cell a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven
Got my bitches on the outside writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me and the shit ull get better
I don't believe her 'cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your bitch is on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
'Cause I know that I won't be away long
And when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous
I'm on bail
Out on Bail
ThugLife (see) will never fail (Out on bail - biatch!)
Thuglife niggaz (You know what time it is)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm out on bail)

Thuglife niggaz (Y'all Blow that shit - Get me up out this)
Thuglife niggaz (Yo, EM! Get me up out of this motherfucker man!)

(Outro: Tupac Talking)
Out on bail

Now press rewind nigga!
Well, did you do something for yourself, Mom?
And get the hell out of the house.
Well, would you do something for your son, Mom?
And stop taking all these pills.
'Cause it's cold in December and there's reason to stay in
And I want to see you when you're on the deck of that ship.
Yeah, you're sailing away and the sun looks right on your face.
Without a reason to believe in something,
You can do most anything.
Well, that's what you told me someplace,
But I can't remember when.
It was a long time ago,
Maybe the first day of school or going to visit Dad.
I was scared but you told me I'd come home if I wanted.
I was only nine but I went.
So, go on and make your families proud
Just like you always do.
Just like they want you to.
My old girlfriend's studying medicine.
Would you save my life is I got sick?
Haven't seen you in a while. How have you been?
Of course if you had the right insurance for it.
And I think if we got back together again,
You know, give it a run, you know.
You were my first love.
You're very drunk and we were very young.
Plus I'm going to see this guy and it might be love.
Yeah, I think he might be the one.
If you get married can I come? I gotta see this.
Well, go on and dig your holes in this ground.
Yeah, go on and lay your tired bodies down.
Just like you're going to. Just like they expect you to.
And I've been thinking about moving away.
Now that we've had this talk, I definitely may.
Well, now go on and break your word and it'll break me down.
And I'll go on and I'll break every last thing in this house.
Just like I'm going to. Just like you expect me to.
Now go on and make your family proud.
Now go on and stake your claim to this ground.
Now go on and take that last dream down
And it'll get you through.
What did they put you through?
It will always be
The end of time
The end of law
The end of life
The dogs will howl
And yank the leash
From tree to tree
From each to each
Does the man who makes the shoes own you, clown?
You can't even pry the nameplate off, now can you?
Fix it with your tiny fist there
James Van Der Beek and them sisters from Sister, Sister
The only one that's ever felt this is you
The force that's forcing you
To feel like busting up a Starbucks.
This bitter drink
Has made you drunk
The thoughts you think
Become unthunk
The sea's ablaze
The sky is too
The water's red
And the flames are blue
Nyack! Ronkonkoma! East Orange! Piscataway!
Don't need you to say we're cute
Don't need you to say we're alright
Don't need your atti-fukin-tude boy
Don't need your kiss goodnight
We don't need you, We don't need you
Us girls don't need you
Don't need you to tell us we're good
Don't need you to say we suck
Don't need your protection
Don't need your dick to fuck
We don't need you, we don't need you
Us whores don't need you
Does it scare you that we don't need you?
Does is scare you boy, that we don't need you?
We don't need you, we don't need you
Us girls don't need you
This is a war
So you've gotta stay strong and rise above
And never let the mother fuckers tear you away from what you love
Gotta fight back and reclaim what's truly yours
Take revenge on the world and declare your fucking war
Your war
Stay
Stay gold
Stay true to yourself and your friends and never let go
You want a piece of my fucking time?
Well back up and back off
Get in back of the line
You want a piece of my fucking mind?
Well fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Stay
Stay gold
Stay true to yourself and your friends and never let go
Never let go
You want a piece of my fucking time?
Well back up and back off
Get in back of the line
You want a piece of my fucking mind?
Well fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Stay
Stay gold
Stay true to yourself and your friends and never let go
Never let go
Never let go
If I had my way, I'd never speak to anyone again
I gotta say, I hate people I'm so sick of them
I just can't stand the bullshit I wish I was so far away from it
I'm just stupid and I'm angry is it immature for me to say
Fuck all you Motherfuckers
Fuck all you Motherfuckers
Fuck all you Motherfuckers
Fuck you!
Fuck all you Motherfuckers
Fuck all you Motherfuckers
Fuck all you Motherfuckers
Fuck you!
I feel so lame, 'cause that's the best I can do to express myself
It's always the same, say the "F" word maybe that'll help
I'm so sick of trying to fit in, I don't even know where to begin
I got friends but they don't know me, but I'd tell the world to blow me
And there's just one more thing that, I have just got to sing ya
Everyone and everything FUCK YOU!

The slow death of light
Caving in from all sides
Faces deformed by hate
Shaping the human condition
Human cause
Ghettos of our time
A wall limits our life
Lies heard by our ears
But truth seen trough our eyes
Human cause
You feel the love
You feel the past
It's all the things you thought you had
Oh, well I woke up in hell today
I woke up depressed and drained
But that's okay 'cause
I promised not to hurt you again
And apparently I'm to blame
But apparently I've been framed
By a memory that won't help
Me when it's happening
Out of the mind
Out of the soul
Out of the light
Out of control
Standing in the middle of yesterday
Where it all went wrong
Where we made mistakes
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say
But it won't be long
And it will be okay
Hey...
Well I promised you I would change
I'm an asshole and I'm ashamed
I'm upset 'cause I betrayed everything that you gave
Will you ever let me explain
Can I beg you to let me stay
Don't quit me 'cause
I'll never let this happen...
Out of the mind
Out of the soul
Out of the light
Out of control
Standing in the middle of yesterday
Where it all went wrong
Where we made mistakes
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say
But it won't be long
And it will be okay
You feel the love
You feel the past
It's all the things you thought you had
You feel the love
You feel the past
It's all the things you thought you had
All the things you thought you had
Oh, I'm gonna make it up to you
Make it up to you
Make it up to you, oh oh
Make it up to you
Make it up to you
Make it up to you, oh oh
Jeder kennt ihn schon
Das Arschloch der Nation
Wie konnte er so etwas tun?
Überall schreckt jeder auf
Und alle schreien laut:
"Sperrt ihn ein! Macht alle Türen zu!"
Er war ein Einzelgänger
Doch eigentlich ganz normal
Wahrscheinlich ging es ihm nicht gut
Der Junge hat's nicht leicht gehabt
Doch keiner kann verstehen
Woher kam bloß all seine Wut?
Sie haben ihm Nitroglycerin
In seine Adern gespritzt
Dort wo es am meisten schmerzt
Haben sie ihn erwischt
Wir haben einen neuen Feind
Wegen ihm haben alle geweint
Das Böse in Menschengestalt
Egal woher er kam
Egal wohin er geht
Er ist brutal, sein Herz ist kalt
Er war zwar etwas komisch
Doch hat niemanden gestört
Er ließ kein' an sich heran
Keiner weiß wer dieser kleine stille Junge war
Erst als Junge mit der Bombe 
Wurde er bekannt
Sie haben ihm Nitroglycerin
In seine Adern gespritzt
Dort wo es am meisten schmerzt
Haben sie ihn erwischt
Jetzt ist er explodiert
Und die ganze Welt geschockt
Niemand hätte das gedacht
Wie konnte es soweit kommen?
Sie haben ihm Nitroglycerin
In seine Adern gespritzt
Dort wo es am meisten schmerzt
Haben sie ihn erwischt
Jetzt ist er explodiert
Und die ganze Welt geschockt
Niemand hätte das gedacht
Wie konnte es soweit kommen?
The days keep dragging on
Those rats keep pushing on, whoa
The slowest race around
We all just race around, whoa
And when the hope's gone the weight falls on me
Yeah, when I'm gone the weight falls on me
No sense in signing up
Your name's already in
Go ahead, yeah, fuck it up
The next guy pays for it
'Cause what I get ain't half of what I give
And half don't suit me anyway
'Cause what I get ain't half of what I give
And half don't suit me anyway
Maybe I sacrifice
To feel like I'm alive
Penniless, it's all the same
At least I'll die with a name
I ain't dead yet
Give it back
Or I'll take it
Give it back
Or I'll take it
Or I'll take it
Maybe I sacrifice
To feel like I'm alive
Penniless, it's all the same
At least I'll die with a name
Maybe I sacrifice
To feel like I'm alive
Penniless, it's all the same
At least I'll die with a name
Or I'll take it
Give it back
Or I'll take it
Give it back
Or I'll take it
Or I'll take it
And when the hope's gone the weight falls on me
Yeah, when I'm gone the weight falls on me
And when the hope's gone the weight falls on me
Yeah, when I'm gone the weight falls on me.
I keep breaking all the promises
That I keep making to myself
You'd think by now that I'd be over this
Instead I'm feeling sorry for myself
So why does everything seem desperate now?
I should be feeling so alive
But it feels like something's missing
Something's wrong somehow
It feels like something
Deep inside has died
So why do I feel desperate now
Why do I feel like dying
Why do I feel desperate now
Why do I feel desperate now
I keep breaking all the promises
That I keep making to myself
But promises mean nothing to me anymore
Circling the drain
Spiraling to hell...
So why do I feel so desperate now?
Why do I feel like dying
Why do I feel desperate now?
Why do I feel let down?
Why do I feel desperate now?
I wanted so bad to be your girl, I tried
Thinking 'bout all the lonely nights I cried
I look back, what a waste of time
I should've realized I couldn't change your mind
Now I'm glad you've got a broken heart
'Cause I've been trying to fix mine from the start
Now I'm glad you've got a broken heart
'Cause I've been trying to fix mine from the start
Now that it's over you act so shocked
Guess you never listened all the times I talked
I gave you countless chances
You never seemed to care
Treated me like trash
You thought I'd always be there
You're telling lies to everyone who will listen
You want so bad to be the victim
But what you've got to see
Is our relationship and breakup is not a competition
Now I'm glad you've got a broken heart
'Cause I've been trying to fix mine from the start
Now you're acting like Mister Perfect
Can't figure out what you did to deserve it
I was not the only one to do things wrong
You've been a dick to me all along
I know what I did was pretty rotten
Now it's like everything you did is forgotten
Go ahead and tell your sob story
All I have to say about it is "blow me"
Now I'm glad you've got a broken heart
'Cause I've been trying to fix mine from the start
Now I'm glad you've got a broken heart
'Cause I've been trying to fix mine from the start
I want justice I want you overthrown
I want justice
I want to stand alone
So take all you can from an open hand
The hope of the dying
To save your disease
You're an empty breed
Your love of this lifetime
So you're somebody who brags about their innocence
While playing on the ignorant storm
Now I'm just here to criticize the lies, the lies, the lies
I want justice I want you overthrown
I want courage I want to stand alone
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
I want your everything and I want your head
So cry if you feel
That the tears you shed will make you feel better
See I'm just critical of living like a criminal
While you become a royalty hiding
I wonder how you'll justify the lies, the lies, the lies
I want justice I want you overthrown
I want courage I want to stand alone
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
I want your everything and I want your head
So bury all the evidence
Disguise yourself plead innocent
One penalty, one consequence is sure
Your jury they will recognize the lies, the lies, the lies, the lies
I want justice I want you overthrown
I want courage
I want to stand alone
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
I want your everything and I want your head
I want justice I want you overthrown
I want courage I want to stand alone
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
I want your everything and I want you dead
I want justice I want justice
Give me justice and I want you dead
Love is in the air
Blinding me with smoke
You are the air I breathe
When I choke
Butterflies in the jar
Butterflies in the jar
Butterflies in the jar
So breathless
Get out of my rowboat
Captured my heart
Goodies in the basket
Stuttering the ways
I love you, honey
Insects, in your kiss
Insects, in your kiss
Insects, in your kiss
You are my sunshine
Get out of my rowboat
Get out
Get out
Get out
Get out
Get out of my
Get out
Get out of my
Get out of my rowboat
Get out
Get out of my
Get out
Get out of my
Get out of my rowboat
Fuck!
Turning you on to a world full of shit
Twisted beyond a return
Filling our brain with a lot of cocaine
'Cos I got money to burn
We know that your world will hate this
This is what we do to survive
Reeking of ether and terminal madness
Trapped in a psycho disguise
I've got the heart of a wolf and I'm thinking
This is the best way to die
We know that your world will hate this
This is what we do to survive
This is the world that I share with the clowns
Loaded on vice and disease
Filling your head with an urge to be dead
The least you could do is say please
We know that your world will hate this
This is what we do to survive
We know that your world will hate this
This is what we do to survive
You look like you got your clothes off the ?? floor
Not everything's shiny as a diamond
Tell you mama
Tell your paw
Tell everybody that you ever saw
I'm comin' home and I'm gon' be kinda pissed
My teeth bit my mouth oh like sexy housin
Oh you little person
Tell you mama
Tell your paw
Tell everybody that you ever saw
I'm comin' home and I'm gon' be kinda pissed
I sit around all day
Waiting for the call
That I'm gonna ignore
I sit around all day
Waitin for a call
That I'm gonna ignore
You say that we are friends
Who you tryna fool
You're no friend of mine
Oh you say we are friends
Who you tryna fool
You ain't a friend of mine
Mine
Oh my God all the people in the street
They look like fucking machines
Oh my God all the zombies seem to meet
They all have put on their screens
All my friends are broken toys
All my friends ain't got no voice
I've got to burn your eyes
Until you feel your lies
Until you realize you were so blind
I've got to burn your eyes
Until you feel your lies
Until you realize you were so blind
Oh my God all the noise inside my head
It's like a million sirenes
Oh my God all the zombies start to spread
I'll save them - by any means
All my friends are broken toys
All my friends ain't got no voice
I've got to burn your eyes
Until you feel your lies
Until you realize you were so blind
I've got to burn your eyes
Until you feel your lies
Until you realize you were so blind
I've got to
Let me burn your eyes
Let me burn your eyes
Let me burn your eyes
I've got to burn your eyes
Until you feel your lies
Until you realize you were so blind
I've got to burn your eyes
Until you feel your lies
Until you realize you were so blind
I've got to burn your eyes
Let me burn your eyes
Burn your eyes
Let me burn your eyes
Burn your eyes
Let me burn your eyes
I've got to burn
I've seen them out at Soco
They're pounding sixteen penny nails
The truckers on the interstate
Have been known to ride the rails
Sweat is beating on the brow
Can't keep these fellows down
'Cause these damned blue-collared tweekers
They're runnin' this here town
I knew a man who hung drywall
He hung it mighty quick
A trip or two to the blue room
Would help him do the trick
His foreman would pat him on the back
Whenever he would come around
'Cause these damned blue-collar tweekers
They're beloved in this town
Now the union boys are there
To protect us from all the corporate type
While curious George's drug patrol
Is out here hunting snipe
Now they try to tell me different
But you know I ain't no clown
'Cause these damned blue-collar tweekers
They're the backbone of this town
Now the flame that burns twice as bright
Burns only half as long
My eyes are growing weary
As I finalize this song
So sit back and have a cup o' joe
And watch the wheels go round
'Cause these damned blue-collar tweekers
They have always run this town
(Dulli)
I hear the whispers, baby
If what they say is true
They say I killed the brother
To fall in love with u
These words I heard them once before
A conversation I believe
How does a man begin 2 fall
When he does practice 2 deceive?
There was a voice behind my back
His face I could not see it clear
The voice was so familiar, though
I knew my enemy was near
The sun iz gone
And the sky iz black
So get your ass out from
Behind my back
I told you once
And I told you all
And I told it like it was (sic)
U can't
Have me
If you can't
Catch me
Out of your mind bent on revenge
To think I once called you my friend
U want the dog? I'll let him out
Come and get some baby
Skinny kack para, para dutty dykie nigger
Sell out whitey liberals who hang with blackie sinners
Skinny kack para, para dutty dykie nigger
Sell out whitey liberals who hang with blackie sinners
On my hotel t. v, on my hotel t. v, private hotel t. v
On my hotel t. v, turn it off
They, they, they, they, who the fuck are they?
You think that your conspiracies are the crux of all my theories
They, they, they, gay, who the fuck is gay?
How dare I have a view & a Versace tattoo
On my hotel t. v, on my hotel t. v, private hotel t. v
On my hotel t. v, turn it off
I can see, you want this war, there you will find your god
Black black black black black black
White white white white white white
On my hotel t. v, on my hotel t. v, private hotel t. v
On my hotel t. v, fucking on my t. v, fucking on my t. v, on my hotel t. v, private hotel t. v
You gave me this
Made me give
Your silver grin
Still sticking it in
You have soul machine
Soul machine
The longest kiss
Peeling furniture days
Drift madly to you
Pollute my heart-drain
You have broken me
Broken me
All your mental armor drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth, mouth, mouth
Your loaded smiles
And pretty just desserts
Wish it all for you
So much, it never hurts
You have soul machine
Stolen me
All your mental armor drags me down
We can't breathe when you come around
All your mental armor drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth, mouth, mouth
Your mouth, mouth, mouth
Your mouth, mouth, mouth
We've been missing long before
Never found our way home
We've been missing long before
Where we'll find our way
You gave me this
Made me give
You have soul machine
Broken free
All your mental armor drags me down
We can't breathe when you come around
All your mental armor drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth, mouth, mouth
Your mouth, mouth, mouth
All your mental armor
All your mental armor
And your mouth, mouth, mouth, mouth
Mouth, mouth, mouth, mouth
Mouth, mouth, mouth, mouth
Mouth, mouth, mouth
Motherfucker!
You got your legal baby
You got your legal good
You got your legal baby
Just like a common hood
You got your legal baby
You got your legal good
You got your legal baby
Just like a common hood
'Cause you don't need to look at me
To make yourself the fool
'Cause you don't need to come to me
To make yourself the fool
So I quit!
So I quit!
So I quit!
You got your legal baby
You got your legal good
You got your legal baby
Just like a common hood
You got your legal baby
You got your legal good
You got your legal baby
Just like a common hood
'Cause you don't need to look at me
To make yourself the fool
'Cause you don't need to come to me
To make yourself the fool
So I...
So I quit!
So I quit!
So I quit!
So I quit!
Try to take something from me, motherfucker?
You're gonna fuckin' die, you piece of shit!
You're gonna fuckin' die, you piece of shit!
You're gonna fuckin' die, you piece of shit!
So I quit!
So I quit!
So I quit!
Maybe it's all we can't take
Keeps us always returning
I'm keeping this as a keepsake
And everything else I'm burning
And maybe its cause you can't wait
Keeps you always regretting
I'm keeping this as a keepsake
And everything else forgetting
When were down, down, down,
All the way
Can we run away.
And maybe it 'cause I can't say
Keeps you always believing
And maybe its cause you can't say
Keeps me always believing
Ill give you this as a keepsake
And right after that I'm leaving
And maybe it's all we can't take
Keeps us always returning
Ill give you this as a keepsake
And everything else I'm burning...
I can't sleep...
They're hunting me down like an insect
Chasing me down like an insect
Crushing me down like an insect
Stamping me out like an insect
Running me down like an insect
Sleep walking through the all-night drug store
Baptized in fluorescent light
I found religion in the greeting card aisle
Now I know hallmark was right
And every pop song on the radio
Is suddenly speaking to me
Art may imitate life
But life imitates t.v.
'Cause you've been gone exactly two weeks
Two weeks and three days
And let's just say that things look different now
Different in so many ways
I used to be a superhero
No one could touch me
Not even myself
You were like a phone booth
That I somehow stumbled into
And now look at me
I am just like everybody else
I am just like everybody else
If I was dressed in my best defenses
Would you agree to meet me for coffee
If I did my tricks with smoke and mirrors
Would you still know which one was me
If I was naked and screaming
On your front lawn
Would you turn on the light and come down
Screaming, there's the asshole
Who did this to me
Stripped me of my power
Stripped me down
I used to be a superhero
No one could hurt me
Not even myself
You were like a phone booth
That I somehow stumbled into
And now look at me
I am just like everybody else
I am just like everybody else
Yeah you've been gone exactly two weeks
Two weeks and three days
And now I'm a different person
Different in so many ways
Tell me what did you like about me
And don't say my strength and daring
'Cause now I think I'm at your mercy
And it's my first time for this kind of thing
I used to be a superhero
I would swoop down and save me
From myself
But you were like a phone booth
That I somehow stumbled into
And now look at me
I am just like everybody else
I am just like everybody else
Another day, another knife in the back
It's happened so many times, I stopped tryin' to keep track
You're stuck stickin' it in, you're stuck stickin' it in
Take it up to the hilt to cover up your own fuckin' guilt
And when the shit goes down, you're out of places to hide
No time to ask, could the motherfucker really survive?
Get a load of this fuck, he's the dead guy
It's just a natural ? you never fuckin' possessed
You lost control of my life, you want control of the rest
You're always stickin' it in, you're always stickin' it in
You stuck it so many times you ...
But when the shit comes down, you're out of places to hide
Time to ask if you're alive or just pretend that you died
Just remember this fuck, I'm the dead guy
I'm the dead guy
Dead guy
Cast your eyes into the distance
Try to focus on it all
Find a spirit of resistance
Instead of pride before the fall
Forge some opposition
From disparate strands
It ain't the prettiest position
As a century ends
Unstable situation
Faces made of wax
Streams of melting glass
Sheets of butchered facts
The roar of the machine
Hooded hearts and jeweled hands
And anger spilling out like gasoline
As a century ends
Everything I seen, everything that I heard
It ain't even the tip of the iceberg
Fire down memory lane
So pass me my rose tinted glasses again
Through a fog of contradiction
Out to the lake of tears
See society admiring it's own reflection
Chase a light that shines and disappears
Careful what you say
'Cause reality offends
Just sit back and let your soul decay
As a century ends
And it's easy to get weary
As you fight to get it done
'Gainst a popular theory
That it's over 'fore it's even begun
Strain the limit of compassion
Tend a wound that never mends
And honesty still out of fashion
As a century ends
Do you believe I would take such a thing with me
And give it to a police man?
I wouldn't do that, mmhmm
I wouldn't do that
And if I did that would you say
"Sir", and come down and put the charge on me?
I wouldn't do that, ooh
I wouldn't do that
I'm not a fool to hurt myself
But I was innocent to what they done to me
They were wrong, they were wrong
But give it to me one time (Oh give it to me, yeah!)
Give it to me - two times
Give it to me three times
Give it to me four times
Oh, 54, 46, was my number
Was my number now
Right now, somebody else has that number
One more time
54, 47, was my number
Was my number now
Right now, somebody else has that number
Oh
Say boom, say, one go with him up, yes
Say boom, say, want keep him, keep him on his back, say
Say boom, say, me want to take off her dress, huh
Say boom, say, I've kissed and caressed
'Cause we're jillin' and we're chillin' into the club all night
We're jillin' and we're chillin' into the club all night, buds
Hear the dogs, hear the beat, in the dog pound
DJ, "Lord have his grilled cheese"
Some jealous punk
Snuck up around my back
Tried to take the lovin' over me
Lord I got into a fist fight
And wound up in jail all night
Give it to me one time (Oh yes, ooh my pussy)
Give it to me - two times
Give it to me three time
Give it to me four time
People listen up
Don't stand too near
I've got somthing that you all should hear
All lies
All the lies they told to me
Form a little part of history
I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love get married and forget the world
Nine months later, sweet baby's on the way
Kiss 'em on the cheek and life's okay
I don't feel no pain
I don't have no time
To listen to conflicting points of view, oh
It's a crazy world to live alone
A ball and chain I call my own
A ba na na na na
Whooo
People listen up
Don't stand to close
I've got something that you all should know
Holy matrimony is not for me
I'd rather die alone in misery
Because I was always taught boy meets girl
Fall in love get married and forget the world
Nine months later, sweet baby's on the way
Isn't that what they used to say?
With a girl that you knew
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain, mmm
I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own
A ba na na na na
Whooo
Crazy world to live alone
Ba ba da ba ba ba da da
Ba na na na na na na na na na na
Ah, ba da da da ba da
Ba na na na na na na na na na
Ba ba da ba ba ba da da
Ba na na na na na na na na na
With a girl that you knew
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain, oh
I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own, huh, huh
Because marriage doesn't work in the world today
It's an institution that is in decay
And if I have love I wish to portray
I will surely find another way
Because I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love get married and forget the world
Nine months later the sweet baby's on the way
Kiss 'em on the cheek and life's okay
I don't feel no pain
I don't have no time
To listen to conflicting points of view, whoa
I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own
A ba na na na na na
Whoooo
Today's the day our younger son is going off to war
Fightin' in the age old battle we've sometimes won before
Flags that line old main street are blowin' in the wind
These must be the flags of freedom flyin'
Church bells are ringin', the families stand and wave
Some of them are cryin' 'cause the soldiers look so brave
Lookin' straight ahead like they know just where they're goin'
Past the flags of freedom flyin'
Sister has her headphones on, she hears the music blasting
She sees her brother marchin' by, their bond is everlasting
Listening to Bob Dylan singin' in 1963
Watching the flags of freedom flyin'
She sees the president speakin' on a flat-screen TV
In the window of the old appliance store
She turns to see her brother again but he's already walkin' past
The flags of freedom flyin'
Have you seen the flags of freedom?
What color are they now?
Do you think that you believe in yours more than they do theirs somehow?
When you see the flags of freedom flyin'
Today's the day our younger son is goin' off to war
Fightin' in the age old battle we've sometimes won before
Flags that line old main street are blowin' in the wind
These must be the flags of freedom flyin'
I can hear it in your voice I can see it in your eyes
I can smell it in the air I can hear it in your sighs
The way you look at me and the way that you act
The way you make me feel I have to react
Is it beautiful enough to keep you begging for more
It's painful to see I can't take it anymore
Take it anymore
I know what it is I can see it in my dreams
I know what it's like I know what it means
I can make it go away I can make it disappear
I can make it all right I can make it happen here
Feels like I have to do it it has to be done
It's time to get it over with it's useless to run
Useless to run
It could have been something nice you said to me
But I can hear it in your voice you just pity me
You make fun out of me and every word that I say
And I can hear you laugh when I walk away
So don't try to be nice and don't you try to pretend
You don't know who I am I'm not your friend
You don't think I know but I can read between the lines
Don't smile I'm not your clown I can see all the signs
See all the signs
Nobody knows it and nobody can see
I'm not talking to you but you're smiling at me
I know it's gonna happen but I don't know when
But it's happened before and it can happen again
I want to do things to you that you'll never forget
It's not an empty threat you deserve what you get
Deserve what you get
Time's up
Time's up
Time's up
Time's up
And if you ever told me that it would ever be
As hard as this
I think I would have said to go to hell and
Take it all with you
Now that I am here
I don't really care about anything that you
Play on me
So take all your guilt and play with someone
Else's mind
I cannot tolerate you
And I love to hate you
And I love the way you hate me
So take yourself and go
I cannot take it, I cannot take it
I cannot tolerate you
Man, if I never see this place again
I really wouldn't care
I should've said to go to hell and take it all with you
Now that I am here
I don't really care about anything that you
Play on me
So take all your guilt and play with someone
Else's mind
I cannot tolerate you
And I love to hate you
And I love the way you hate me
So take yourself and go
I cannot take it, I cannot take it
I cannot tolerate you
Sometimes I feel like just giving it all up
I have no idea what's been holding me up
So far from all of the things
I always wanted the most
I hope you choke now sucker
I'm the top of the show
I love to hate you
And I love the way you hate me
So take yourself and go
I cannot take it, I cannot take it
I cannot tolerate you
It's just the two of us
A silver cross
And some strength that you won't believe
See I'm not your friend
And I won't pretend
That I've come here for peace
Well I'm not afraid
I'm gonna make you pay
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
And this is war ...
And I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
The time has come
To drop the bomb
On all the pain you've been selling
See I don't like you
Or your attitude
Or the company that you keep
And this is war ...
And I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
And this is war ...
And I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
It's just the two of us
A silver cross
And some strength that you won't believe
Well I'm not afraid
I'm gonna make you pay
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
It's war ...
And I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
And this is war ...
And I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face, oh ...
And wipe that smile
And wipe that smile
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
You're pushin' a furnace
You're workin' too hard
You're setting things off - all over the yard
You play with your 'top' - till your eyes start to spin
Then you shrug your shoulders and ask me where I've been
Travel fulfills you but the distance it kills you
Oh oh ain't that nothin'
Why don't you tell me somethin'
Tragedy
Ain't that nothin'
I just wish you'd tell me something -
The fan keeps whirling
The wind stays hot - but I can't keep from slippin' a lot
I look in that purse
It's a blessing and a curse
Discover dishonor with its thousand commands
It ain't worth a shot
That target is sand
But I love disaster and I love what comes after.
This is the first time that I've ever
Told the truth before.
To scrutinize what we call fate.
Belief no more of what's been forced into
Subconciousness.
Hold my breath hope to refrain.
Is love an infection or a sick addiction
When there's nowhere left to run to?
Is love an infection or a sick addiction
When there's nowhere left... this crutch is broken.
Her empty needle is my unsharpened sword,
I stab, I stab, I stab but I can't puncture.
Don't want to love it, don't want to feel it,
Don't want to hear it, don't even want to think about it,
Hold my breath hope to refrain.
Is love an infection or a sick addiction
When there's nowhere left to run to?
Is love an infection or a sick addiction
When there's nowhere left, this crutch is broken.
And if I can't afford her, my veins begin to ache.
Don't want to feel this pain no more,
Have you ever felt so high that once you came
Down you broke inside?
I know she won't take the blame.
Is love an infection or a sick addiction
When there's nowhere left, when there's nowhere left to go
Is love an infection or a sick addiction
When there's nowhere left, this crutch is broken.
Screaming:
You fucking ripped my heart out
You fucking, you fucking ripped my heart out
You fucking ripped my heart out
You fucking ripped my heart out
You fucking, you fucking ripped my heart out
You fucking ripped my heart out
I can still see
You sucking the life out of me
I can still feel the chill 
Down my spine when you told me
Always one fateful night
That turns the tide
Always one fateful night
With nowhere to hide
To live and die
In a day there's nothing
Left to say
Time will not erase
The counting down of the days
You finally got
What you've been waiting for
A handful of pills
Didn't soften the blow
One month of sucking it in
It started to show
Waking up to realize
It's not a dream
Was the hardest thing

And six cars that are paid fo', suck my dick {Hello}
We came a long way from not givin' a fuck
Sellin' tapes out of a trunk, to movin' this far up
Now we got the whole world starstruck
Made a million plus and still don't give a motherfuck
Motherfucker, I'm Dre, I don't need your respect
I don't need to make another album, bitch, I don't gotta do shit

Who you pray to, my God the black God?
Who you pray to, my God the brown God?
Who you pray to, my God the white God?
Your reaction's kind of odd for a kid who loves to nod.
I wear skin like Jesus
Sick of bullshit preachers
Concerned with aborted fetus
But don't give a fuck who feeds us.
Speech so tedious,
If Abraham freed us,
Why there still Abner Louima's?
Been slaves since days of Julius Caesar
Man's need to dominate overshadows need to breath
Pray to your pagan gods while your twisting all those trees
Scraped knees don't prove what you believe
Your blind faith passed to your seeds,
Killed our garden type weeds,
Turn around and blame it on Eve.
While you blame me for blemishing our family tree
I'll uproot all of humanity.
Who you pray to, my God the black God?
Who you pray to, my God the brown God?
Who you pray to, my God the white God?
Your reaction's kind of odd for a kid who loves to nod.
Sick of true blasphemy,
Religion pure alchemy
And gold lines no lead streets
Blessed are the meek who reek in honesty
True green lie in botany,
They're hawking me from high atop the food chain
Deciding who to blame for each and every heartless act
Weight of elements exact
I retain no tact and spit the pure fact
Mixed with blood from split tongue
Collapsed lung only help to breath diseased atmosphere
Expect me to adhere to your bullshit code of silence
Speak till dawn of violence
They say no man's an island...
I've watched the youth,
These kids is wildin'
Who you pray to, my God the black God?
Who you pray to, my God the brown God?
Who you pray to, my God the white God?
Your reaction's kind of odd for a kid who loves to nod.
She said "Sweet of you to notice"
He said "I kinda like it myself"
She said "Sweet of you to notice"
He said "I kinda like it myself"
I saw Chris Johnson with a boner
I saw Todd Trainer singing in German
Scared the shit out of me
And I don't scare easily
Scared the shit out of me
And I don't scare easily
By now, I should have been somewhere
Or gone to school or fixed my hair
Back down, tell it to someone else
Who gives a shit and needs your help
'Cause I found what I needed
And I don't need you to tell me how you feel
And if I fall, you are not the one that has to cope and deal
All my problems are for me
My God, look at his tattoos and those earrings
He could never get a good job
Go home and beat your kids 
So they don't turn out as bad as me
'Cause I found what I needed 
And I don't need you to tell me how you feel
And if I fall, you are not the one that has to cope and deal
All my problems are for me
I don't need your eyes to see
I will be what I will be
Stop coming around, 'cause you bother me
Stupid motherfucker, pull your head out your ass and see
What don't you get? Was I stuttering?
I don't need to take your shit, get away from me
I don't need to take your shit, get away from me
All my problems are for me
I don't need your eyes to see
I will be what I will be
All my problems are for me
I don't need your eyes to see
All my problems are for me...
Feeling low, like I'm ready to crack and
Slowly moving from bending to breaking
I stay diluted to avoid the pain
But I give her more than she can take
I'm only killing the only haven
The still asylum I haven't destroyed yet
And when it's gone I'm left with nothing
This isn't what we counted on
This isn't what we said it'd be
The fantasy is dead
And I can't feel it
This isn't what we counted on
This isn't what we said it'd be
The fantasy is dead
And long forgotten
I told her she was killing me and
She said she was already dead
Every ounce of emotion fades
And I promise you it'll end someday, I hope
I'm only hoping that this is common
She's all I'm living with when all this fades away
And when it's gone I'm left with nothing
She doesn't need it
She doesn't need it
My optimism is masking my failure
I'm not no red football
To be kicked around the garden
No no
I'm a red Christmas-tree ball
And I'm fragile
I'm not no animal
Though I am to you
I'm not no crocodile
Like the one in Dublin Zoo
Who lived in a cage 
The length and breadth of his body
When a window which people would look through
And throw coins on his back to taunt him 
Though he couldn't move
Even if he wanted to
I'm not no animal in the zoo
I'm not no whipping boy for you
You may not treat me like you do
I'm not no animal in the zoo
My skin is not a football for you
My head is not a football for you
My body's not a football for you
My womb is not a football for you
My heart is not a football for you
I'm not no animal in the zoo
This animal will jump up and eat you
I'm not no animal in the zoo
And I've every intention
Of leaping up and getting you
And I don't know whether
To laugh or cry
And I don't know whether
To live or die
I kept my love for her
Locked deep inside
It cuts like a knife
She's out of my life
Out of my life, out of my hair
Out of my mind, there's no love in fear
I move on, move on
Dear God, I wasn't breast fed
And most of my conversations with men seem to revolve around music
I'm no musician, but the pain has been instrumental
My senses: finely tuned instruments
Of-of-of being lonely, of being lost
Of being loved, of being human
Man, I could use a metaphor, but I can't get beyond this shit
I could use someone to talk to
But most of my conversations with men seem to revolve around music
I-I-I am a poet who composes what the world proses
And proses what the world composes
I am a poet who composes what the world proses
And proses what the world composes
Damned indecision
And cursed pride
I kept my love for her
Locked deep inside
And I don't know what to do
To get it through to you
Get out of my life, tonight
Get out of my life
Out of my life, out of my hair
Out of my mind, there's no love in fear
I move on, move on
She had nothing but time on her hands
Silver rings, turquoise stones and purple nails
I rub my thumb across her palm
A feather bed where slept a psalm
Yea, though I walk, I used to fly, and now we dance
I watched my toenails blacken and walked a deadened trance
'Til she woke me with the knife edge of her glance
I have the scars to prove the clock strikes with her hands
And I don't know what to do
To get it through to you
And I don't know what to do
To get it through
Out of my life, out of my hair
Out of my mind, there's no love in fear
I move on, move on, I move on
What say you, Lord
For the olive boys down in the house of corrections
As they try for love and any form of ascension
Am I on the right train headed in the wrong direction
What say you, Lord
What say you, Lord
Am I living wrong
Do you see a long road with no one on it
And the right of men that you learnt only to forget
You see my sad wife and my high margin of profit
But you don't care at all
You don't care
At all
What say you, Lord
Now that they're breeding all our animals insane
And the remedy is growing harder to obtain
There's a white horse running wild through the switch-cane
I can hear him now
And I fear him
Till Kingdom come
Caught in this frenzy of elimination
Such an irreparable disintegration
My body's twitching with a ready expectation
For Kingdom come
My Kingdom
Come
What say you, Lord
Why is the truth of this so hard to unveil?
Though it's true I never knew what this would entail
From the hands of Christ to the heads of the Daily Mail
I'll see you all
And I'll raise you
Lord
Now what say you, all
I wonder when the light is brought up for sale
With the weight of love and the grace of the Baleen Whale
Will the severed Heads of State be at all curtailed
Will they be here at all -
Will they be dead and gone?
What say you Lord
Of the serpent-taled, forbidden fish of the harbours
And the ready-men, defiant drinkers and charmers
All lost and summoning the face of their fathers
Can you see them now?
I can see them
What say you, all
Do I believe it if I do not want it
Do I lie alone and keeps my cold hands off it
Honey, it ain't hard to lose your grip in the midst of all of this
But it ain't far to fall
It's not far at all
Pain
What
Lookin' for a leader
To bring our country home
Re-unite the red, white and blue
Before it turns to stone
Lookin' for somebody
Young enough to take it on
Clean up the corruption
And make the country strong
Walkin' among our people
There's someone who's straight and strong
To lead us from desolation
And a broken world gone wrong
Someone walks among us
And I hope he hears the call
And maybe it's a woman
Or a black man after all
Maybe it's Obama
But he thinks that he's too young
Maybe it's Colin Powell
To right what he's done wrong
America has a leader
But he's not in the House
He's walking here among us
And we've got to seek him out
Yeah we've got our election
But corruption has a chance
We got to have a clean win
To regain confidence
America is beautiful
But she has an ugly side
We're lookin' for a leader
In this country far and wide
We're lookin' for a leader
With the great spirit on his side
Someone walks among us
And I hope he hears the call
And maybe it's a woman
Or a black man after all
Kompromisy się łaszą do stóp
Całe stada ich pasą się tu
Święte krowy, bezmięsne, co wciąż
Kręcąc mordą ocalić mnie chcą
Wolę masakrę (masakrę)
Wolę masakrę (masakrę)
Wolę masakrę (masakrę)
Chcę usłyszeć ten huk
Są ośmiźle przychylne i wciąż
Patrzą z troską, gdy płyniesz pod prąd
Ich ławice łaskoczą cię, gdy
Gdy się zbliża wodospad, a ty
Wolisz masakrę (masakrę)

Too many weeds in the flowers
Too many pills in the pharmacy now
Too many bugs in the shower
There's too much shit in the air we breathe now
There's too much anger inside me
There's too much scarring when I bleed
There's too much therapy I need
There is no god that I have seen
There's too much doubt in my mom's words
There's too much fear in the way she sees life
I wonder if I'm just like her
I wonder if I can make myself right
You try to help
You listen well
You cannot change the way I see
When I wake up, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you 
When I go out, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
And if I get drunk, yes, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
And if I haver, whatever that means
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you
But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
To be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door
When I'm working, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you
And when the money comes in for the work I do
I'll pass almost every penny on to you
When I come home, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
And if I grow old, well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you
And I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
To be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door
Surrender
Surrender
When I'm lonely, yes, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
When I'm dreaming, yes, I know I'm gonna dream 
I gonna dream about the time when I'm with you
And if I get drunk, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man that gets drunk next to you
And if I haver, whatever the fuck that means
I'm gonna be the man who havers next you
And I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
To be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door
Surrender
Surrender
When I'm lonely, yes, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man whos lonely without you
I'm gonna be the man who's coming home
'Cause I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
To be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door
Surrender
Surrender
Surrender
I caught my eye
In a swinging door
I'd never seen
That man before
I saw myself
In someone else
And hated them
Ever since
Some broken glass
And a bleeding hand
The mirror's down
But I'm still standing
Stand
I know who I am
Some people look at me and talk about me like a clown
They just don't realize it's just my simple way to get down
I've got that supertouch
Chances are I've got too much
I've come to let you see
That you also can be free
It seems like every time we all try to go underground
The stinkin' troopers them, they think that we are fooling around
We have had about enough
Now we're gonna get real tough
It happens everyday
That's why we got P. M. A. (Positive Mental Attitudes)
We got - You got - You got
We got - We got - You got - You got
We can see most everything
We've got that supertouch
We can see most everything
We've got that supertouch
Shitfit
(People just pretending, that's a let down
Undercover lover, that's my heart now
Struggle just in living, that's the realm of
Accept me as I'm not, and that's a shitfit
My best ain't good enough for you
My test is what you gonna do
Ain't no any kind of way
Love was lost in yesterday
Now we've felt this, so you'll get yours now
Everybody's living and nobody's giving
And nobody gives a damn
You must understand me, the end is surely coming
Prepare for the final plan
People just pretending, that's a let down
Undercover lover, that's my heart now
Struggle just in living, that's the realm of
Accept me as I'm not, and that's a shitfit)
You'll always miss my big ol' body
In its prime and never shoddy
While bloodhounds wait down in the lobby
You'll eulogize my big ol' body
You'll miss me with effigies
Lighting up your house like X-Mas trees
As tears roll down below your knees
You'll miss me with effigies
So find a man to fit my shoes
Left one's old and the right one's new
And I bought the right one just for you
Go find a man to fit my shoes
You'll see my teeth in the stars above
Every tree a finger of my glove
And every time push comes to shove
You'll see my teeth in the stars above
Your money talks but my genius walks
Morticians wait with a shovel and a fork
As detectives trace my hands with chalk
Your money talks but my genius walks
You'll miss me so
You will miss me
It must be raining 'cause a man ain't supposed to cry
But I look up and I don't see a cloud
What a cunt this world
What a difficult feeling
To have swift right hand
And never have the left to cover the bleeding
I know, but you know, why let the feeling / show it son
I know, but you know why let it go? So?
Please you got to give us more time
My god it's the end of the world
Set phasers to stun
At the heart of the sun
With an ice pick raised
In an arc over what we've done
I know, but you know, why let the feeling / show it son
I know, but you know why let it go? So?
Please you got to give us more time
My god it's the end of the world
Put my hopes beside the river, lay them down, let the water hold them under
Please you got to give us more time
My god it's the end of the world
Our boys need something to rape, I want to taste you today, like kids kissing
I've lost all sympathy, only living for me, preservation
We need smoething to break, I want something to break
Those words weren't meant to escape, but they do anyway, I hate the others
So show me your strength
Explaining changes nothing
"Chocolates only so much shit, floating out of the snake, to the see..."
And I'll take their fate, and I bet no one will care
So sink in your tusks, mighty walrus
Take what's yours, Walrus's of the night, take your prey, with tusks bared in the burning light,
Take their life and rob me.
"Ever think the world is just one big blubbery walrus ready to sink it's ivory tusks into you? Me too."
You're a weapon of devotion
Keep the faithful entertained
You're a lover of attention
Found a way to pawn the soul
Disposition may be fetching
But the world moves on and leaves you far behind
I hear you, I hear you, whispering such gorgeous stories
I see you, I see you, trying to break free
You liar, you liar, you can't live the dreams you're spinning
You liar, love to be deceived
You're falling, you're falling, falling from your god-like distance
You're fashion, just fashion, fashion doesn't keep
You're sour, so sour, all is hope and trust is misplaced
You're sour, now you are alone
Walking on fire, feel the way the world's inclining
Walking on fire, hate to deceive
Walking on fire, now the world will keep its distance
Walking on fire, you rather than me
My son says, dear father, what did you do when the world turned over
Keep spinning, keep spinning, send us off to sleep
You liar, you liar, all your words are just dust in moonshine
You liar, love to be deceived
Walking on fire, found a place away from humans
Walking on fire, hate to deceive
Walking on fire, now the world will keep its distance
Walking on fire, you rather than me
Ch-ch-ch-check yo
Real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
They get throat slit 'cause they're talkin' to me like I'm thick
And I'm real tired of all these bullsh*t guys
They best go hide 'cause I'm lookin' for them on the sly
'Cause I've had it up to here, Right up to here
I might have to do it Reservoir Dogs style, slice off the ear
'Cause I've had enough of bredders acting tough
Trying to get rough when it's obvious they ain't rough enough
Listen
I'll just talk the talk, I walk it
This is why my mouth is always coming out with raw shit
My rap styles distorted
Like Little Mo getting raped and keeping the baby instead of getting it aborted
Yo, I talk morbid, just to make you feel awkward
Death's a part of life, you just can't ignore it
Especially when I rip out your heart and on my sleeve sport it
Like it's something you think's precious, jus 'cause your dead gran bought it
I talk so foul, I talk so coarse, I show no regret, I show no remorse
Like a necromaniac raping a corpse, up the anal passage, while contracting genital warts
My metaphors are twisted
Like that game where you gotta put the hobnob in your gob if you're the last one to cum on the biscuit
I'm so sadistic
So I fantasize about finding my mum's ex floating in the tub with his wrist slit
And I'm real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
They get throat slit 'cause they're talkin' to me like I'm thick
And I'm real tired of all these bullsh*t guys
They best go hide 'cause I'm lookin' for them on the sly
'Cause I've had it up to here, Right up to here
I might have to do it Reservoir Dogs style, slice off the ear
'Cause I've had enough of bredders acting tough
Trying to get rough when it's obvious they ain't rough enough
You best ban TV if you want me stop
'Cause I'm so heavily influenced by the things that I watch
It ain't just Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs
It's (irreversible (?)) where's my City OF God?
It's the news on every channel I watch when I turn on the box
You seeing paedophiles signing on Top Of The Pops
Gary Glitter, Michael Jackson what?
On the net, Ken Bigley got his neck tek off
That's some nasty shit, I you wonder why I'm sick when I see this shit
And I say exactly what I think
That's some nasty shit, and you still don't ban it
But you ban computer games
Some things around just really stink
What about cigarettes and alcoholic drinks?
Or the animal that died just so that your wife could wear that minks?
You're disgraceful, like getting caught pissing in the sink
My white girlfriend won't suck my dick jus 'cause it's pink
And I'm real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
They get throat slit 'cause they're talkin' to me like I'm thick
And I'm real tired of all these bullsh*t guys
They best go hide 'cause I'm lookin' for them on the sly
'Cause I've had it up to here, Right up to here
I might have to do it Reservoir Dogs style, slice off the ear
'Cause I've had enough of bredders acting tough
Trying to get rough when it's obvious they ain't rough enough
Check it
The last verse is just as bad as the first
But compared to the second, yo, this is definitely worse
'Cause this is about a guy gettin' chauffeured in a hearse
Let me do what Nas did and tell this shit in reverse
The hearse brings corpse back to the morgue
The guy from the morgue undresses the corpse
The embalmment fluids goes back out, the blood goes back in
The body goes back to hospital where it comes alive again
The paramedics walk backwards, like an Irish dance
Put the wounded man back in the ambulance
The ambulances engine turns back on
And its lights flashes as the sirens play his favourite song
The guy goes back the exact spot where they found him
And the medics and all the passers-by go back to where they came from
Until eventually, no one surrounds him
And the blood pours up him, rather than down him
The man then falls upwards, back on his feet
Stumbles towards a dark figure on the other side of the street
He walks into the blade, that cut his belly
Then he holds his neck which was bleeding already
He removes his hand so you can see the cut
And as the knife undoes the slice it closes back up
He unsays the words, He said, "What you!? What the fuck?"
And un-screams the scream from the first initial cut
And then the blood from severely severed ear
Crawls back up his cheek and slowly disappears
As the knife in silhouette slowly un-hacks it from the ear
Puts the knife away after reattaching the ear
Then walks backwards through the bushes where he's disregarding nature
Used to go on the bench, I'm reading his paper
Takes the snail he stepped on, back from its creator
Only to be killed again when I fast forward this shit later
Back in his house, now back in his bed
He unlistens to his CD and unbops his head
Takes the CD out of the player and puts back in its case
Which has my name on the cover, along with my face
Fast forward: There's been a murder and the police know who done it
They're looking for a motive 'cause they don't know why he done it
Sure enough it don't take that long until they find a reason
And they publicly state it on TV that evening
A couple months later this shit gets banned
Like it was me that put that switch in his hand
And told him to kill that man
Like this whole song was just some kind of sickly devised plan
To hurt some poor c*nt I don't even know, and have never met before in my life
It's worse: Whoever said the pen is mightier than the sword was right
And you'd better think twice before you step to me and pick a fight
I'm really on your side
Although you may not ever believe that it's so
I've been taken to looking back
Across it all, it was never that bad
Oh you know
For the minute a pretty face
In the mirror, to take my place
To submit to the ... race
I'm going to see to your immediate needs
Love's for idiots, so leave me alone on my liberties
My liberties
For twenty days or more
I've been staring a hole in the wall
So this business is what I left you for
We were never that bad together at all
For the slightest little change
I will stitch it up and rearrange it
When I feel more than a little strange
Get someone else to do the thinking please
Love's for idiots, so leave me alone on my liberties
My liberties
I'm really on your side
And I would never ever try and hurt you again no no
Take my blessings where ever you go
And if there's someone else to who you wish to go
I just don't want to know
You're none of my business now
I do forget it sometimes
I don't know how
I get too weary and I get too loud
I always knew there would be times like these
Love's for idiots, so leave me alone on my liberties
Leave me alone, my liberties
My liberties
I received this gift from you
Pleasantly surprised, I never thought you'd realize that maybe
I have taken this from you
If I was deserving, who am I to disagree
How can I refuse this, even if I don't deserve it
And now I give this gift to you
I could have got you anything, but this will have to do
It's how I give this gift to you
It doesn't seem like much, but it's the best that I could do
I'm giving everything away before I go for good
And once you give the gift away, there's nothing you can do about it
Nothing that you do or say can change the way I feel about it
Try to look inside of me to find the gift that I am giving
Glad you had a chance to see the gift that I'm delivering
And now I give this gift to you
And now I give this gift to you
I taught you how to cyclops rock and then you turn around and break my heart
And waste my cyclops time and mess up my cyclops mind.
I'm sick like Chuckie was sick, my defeated heart keeps beating on.
I won't die, like Chuckie won't die, but I'm not here to socialize.
Gotta find a new place to hang out, because I'm tired of living in hell.
I'm a mess since you cut me out but Chuckie's arm keeps me company.
I'm a fright with my tombstone smile
All the children run away from me.
Gotta find new friends to hang out with, because you're all afraid of me.
It was sweet like lead paint is sweet but the after-effects left me paralyzed.
I just stare with my one glass eye hoping you won't be back again.
There's a whole new generation waiting to be wrecked by you.
You say you've got some very excellent news
You say I'm going to die when you tell me
And in my way I will
But though your words will kill
I know you'll think that I don't seem to care
It's just because my frown
Is upside down
It's upside down my frown
Is upside down
I'm happy at your happiness as well
You anger makes me mad though you can't tell
Believe me when I say
I'm with you in my private way
And though you think I'm trying to blow you off
It's only that my frown
Is upside down
It's upside down my frown
Is upside down
My frown's upside down
You'd probably like to give me a smack
But there's something about my face that always keeps you coming back
When I'm with you the landscape goes all weird
Black is white and the rainbow has a beard
Are your eyes playing tricks
Or should you get your glasses fixed?
Well, I don't think your eyesight is to blame
The problem is my frown
Is upside down
It's upside down my frown
Is upside down
My frown's upside down
It's upside down my frown
Is upside down
My frown's upside down
I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb
I am a world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys
So honey gotta help me please
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby detonate for me
Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Soul radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight
Honey gotta strike me blind
Somebody better save my soul
Baby penetrate my mind
And I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
And honey I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searches only to destroy
Forgotten boy, forgotten boy
Forgotten boy said hey forgotten boy
Intro: KRS-One
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you see a devil down
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
Ah yeah, stay alive all things will change around
Ah yeah, what? Ah yeah!
Verse One: KRS-One
So here I go kickin science in ninety-five
I be illin, parental discretion is advised still
Don't call me nigga, this MC goes for his
Call me God, cause that's what the black man is
Roamin through the forest as the hardest lyrical artist
Black women you are not a bitch you're a Goddess
Let it be known, you can lean on KRS-One
Like a wall 'cause I'm hard, I represent GOD
Wack MC's have only one style: gun buck
But when you say, "Let's buck for revolution"
They shut the fuck up, kid, get with it
Down to start a riot in a minute
You'll hear so many Bowe-Bowe-Bowe, you think I'm Riddick
While other MC's are talkin' bout up with hope down with dope
I'll have a devil in my infrared scope, WOY!
That's for calling my father a boy and, KLAK KLAK KLAK!
That's for putting scars on my mother's back, BO!
That's for calling my sister a hoe, and for you
BUCK BUCK BUCK, 'cause I don't give a motherfuck
Remember the whip, remember the chant, remember about rope and
You black people still thinkin' about vot-ing
Every president we ever had lied
You know I'm kinda glad Nixon died!
Verse Two: KRS
This is not the first time I came to the planet
But every time I come, only a few could understand it
I came as Isis, my words they tried to ban it
I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my commandments
I came as Solomon, to a people that was lost
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
Other times, I had to come as Nat Turner
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
They tried to harm me, I used to be Malcolm X
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
Kickin the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin' to like
Get wit you, showin you, you are invincible
The Black Panther is the black answer for real
In my spiritual form, I turn into Bobby Seale
On the wheels of steel, my spirit flies away
And enters into Kwame Ture
Verse Three: KRS-One
In the streets there is no EQ, no di-do-di-do-di-do
So I grab the air and speak through the code
The devil cannot see through as I unload
Into another cerebellum
Then I can tell em, because my vibes go through denim
And leather whatever, however, I'm still rockin'
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin'
Have you forgotten why we buildin in a cypher
Yo hear me kid, government is building in a pyramid
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is
We got no time for fancy mathematics
Your mental frequency frequently pickin' up static
Makin' you a naked body, attic and it's democratic
They press auto, and you kill it with an automatic
Almost midnight
I'm just sittin' at the bar
You slide ride up
Whisper "I know who you are"
And you want a little company tonight
You need a little love, I can give it to you right
Be careful what you wish for
If I'm gonna drive, girl it's gonna be one hell of a ride
Wakin' up the devil
Rattlin' the cage inside of me
I miss him a little
When he gets out, we're one hell of a team
I know when I leave
He locks up and throw away the key
But his hand's on the wheel and my foot's on the pedal
Wakin' up the devil
Up walks some guy
Starin' a hole through me
Grabs her too tight
Then he pulls her off my knee
I didn't come here lookin' for a fight
But if you're gonna bark boy, you better have a bite
I ain't been crazy in a really long time
But you're about to need a good friend tonight
Wakin' up the devil
Rattlin' the cage inside of me
I miss him a little
When he gets out, we're one hell of a team
I know when I leave
He locks up and throw away the key
But his hand's on the wheel and my foot's on the pedal
Wakin' up the devil
Pretty girls and whiskey
Quarter bags and dimes
Put it in my face, I'm gonna do it every time
But try to keep me quiet
Try to hold me down
Damn it feels like heaven every time he comes around
Wakin' up the devil
Rattlin' the cage inside of me
I miss him a little
When he gets out, we're one hell of a team
I know when I leave
He locks up and throw away the key
But his hand's on the wheel and my foot's on the pedal
Wakin' up the devil
Am I to blame?
If I won't speak her name, if I won't face her grave
Maybe I'm to blame, maybe I'm to blame
Since you're gone, I've never felt the same
Well maybe I'm just a bad seed
Of the family
I'll get my sleep without tear-stained sheets
And I'll never come cryin' for sympathy
Well I need a place to run to
Yeah I need a place to hide
Yeah I need a place where I don't need a smile as my disguise
Am I to blame?
If I won't face your grave
Am I to blame? Am I to blame?
If I cannot bear to face your grave
And mother please shine down on me
Show me that I'm not the bad seed
Maybe I'm to blame, maybe I'm to blame
Since you're gone I never felt the same
Well maybe my mind's deceiving me
But I think you took the easy way out
You left me standing there empty handed
As soon as you put that gun in your mouth
So please don't keep on asking
If there's something wrong
'Cause you know damn well if I was fine
I would've never ever written this song
Am I to blame?
If I won't face your grave
Please go away won't you leave me alone
I'm just so drunk and miserable
You started with me 
You started with me
Please go away won't you leave me alone
I'm just so drunk and miserable
You started with me
You started with me
What's it gonna be
What're you gonna say to set it all off
It doesn't take much these days, my dear
You started with me
You started with me
It started with you
You started with me
It started with you
It started with you
It ends with me
Wait and see
Hey look what's that sound
Everybody look who's going down
It started with you
It started with you
You're so quick to forget everything that was said
Over and over again in my head
It started with you
It started with you
It started with you
You started with me
It started with you
It started with you
It ends with me, wait and see
Things could have been easier
If it was all so much slower
Don't you think?
You think too much
And you know too much
I'm gonna have to kill you now
Take all your letters and postcards and pictures
And burn them and flush 'em 
Forget it!
I've forgotten it!
I'll see you in Hell!
Reiterating
Don't blame the obvious
Throw me a curve
Be spontaneous
Reiterating
Don't blame the obvious
Throw me a curve
Be spontaneous
I don't want to play this game
Go home 
I don't want to play this game
Go home
I don't want to play this game
Go home
I don't want to play this game
Go home
In high school it was cool to say
You look funny
You're a retard dummy
A retarded dummy
Yeah you suck out of luck
You're no Playboy bunny
Hee hee
So you laugh, it's a gas
They're right on the money
They're just being funny, hysterically funny
Yeah I'm stupid it's true
Now can we be chummy?
Maybe
But then it hits you, then it kicks you
Then you realize you're not unique
And you ignore it, you implore it
Just to let you turn the other cheek
Don't wanna think about the schools in Bosnia
Don't wanna sing about food in Somalia
I don't need this, I don't see this
All I want is inner peace
Graduate but too late
College will just hurt you
Soon they'll all desert you
Get your just desserts you
All essays MLA format they'll convert you
Could they?
So you try it's like pie
Get just more alert you
They'll not try to hurt you
Only you can hurt you
So you say, so you play
They would not subvert you
Would they?
But then it hits you, then it kicks you
Then you realize you're not unique
And you ignore it, you implore it
Just to let you get on through the week
Don't wanna think about the new armed forces
Don't wanna sing about no carriage horses
I don't need this, I don't see this
All I want is inner peace
You pretend it's the end
Ah yes I'm all grown now
Uh-huh I'm at home now
Fool, you're never home now
Even this laugh'll pass
Go answer your phone now
You'll see
See I told you you're old
Now you're all alone now
Look ma how I've grown now
Ain't you proud I'm grown now
Look this head is all dead
See how much you've done now
You pussy
But then it hits you, then it kicks you
Then you realize you're not unique
And you ignore it, you implore it
Just to let you find the "om"? you seek
Don't wanna think about the fall elections
Don't wanna sing about no vivisection
I don't need this, I don't see this
All I want is inner peace
Inner peace
Jean take me down
Just take me to your place
And do what you do to me
Take me to the place you wanna go
Now that you've been there
I've seen it. I've been it. I'd mean it
I don't know where you're going
Long lost in your mind
It's up to you
Do what ya do to you
You don't know what's right or in your mind
But now it's time to find a reason to be here
And work out the reasons before you die
Pick yourself up now and walk the road
You don't know where you're supposed to go
But now it's time you take a look
I know you don't know if you
Mean it, or seen it, to feel the reason in your mind
Pick yourself up off the dirty floor
You've got to be there, don't you know?
Now it's your time to open up
And yeah, you seen me down
I'll be there, and see ya and now you gotta open up your eyes
Now you got a reason to be here and see it before you even die
See that reason down before you die
Seven hundred miles to play to fifteen angry men
I need some sleep
They hate the songs, we hate them too
This show is free
Twenty minutes in broke another fucking string
Just call it luck
They start to leave, I start to plead
Someone yells you suck
Suddenly that joe kicks hard in my veins, I cool down
Things sound good right now
Suddenly fists turn into brave ears
And move as one
Funny how no one knows we came
They wouldn't come anyway
Should I feel grateful to play?
I'm living life my way
I fell in love with my enemy
I let go of everything I had left at home
I fell in love with my enemy
I let go
Two cool people came, they're hiding by the door
Eyes wide with fright
A guy, a girl, in love with the whole world
It almost makes it right
Suddenly that joe kicks hard in my veins, I cool down
Things sound good right now
Suddenly fists turn into brave ears
And move as one
Funny how no one knows we came
They wouldn't come anyway
Should I feel grateful to play?
I'm living life my way
I fell in love with my enemy
I let go of everything I had left at home
I fell in love with my enemy
I let go
Every little thing, every little thing
Every little, every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing, every little thing
Must go wrong
My mind can't shake one sound
It lodged and grew...
I'm breaking down
It's all around
The bed's thin sound
It's all around
Air rings through (and through) stagnant rooms
Pinching, prodding me
Great insidious sound! leave me! leave me be!
Lately you've found I break between white walls that burn the nerves
No noise can shake me but I feel me breaking
Turning back
It's all around
It all breaks down
If you ain't got no wings
And if you ain't the king
And you can't make it rain
Hell no, you can't heal my pain
If you ain't got no chains
And if you ain't got a cage
And you can't calm the rage
You ain't changing anything
Already made the news
Slipped out of every noose
I've cut my demons loose
Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
Raged on fumes
There's nothing left to use
My middle name's abuse
Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
If you can't part the sea
And you can't pardon me
If you don't like what you see
You don't know how to save my soul
'Cause I've been in the trenches
Fighting off the devil's wenches
I've had all the scars and stitches
To make you see, make you see
Get the fuck away from me
Already made the news
Slipped out of every noose
I've cut my demons loose
Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
Raged on fumes
There's nothing left to use
My middle name's abuse
Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
If you take a look at my life, you'll see in my eyes
A whole world full of hurt, addiction and lies
I've been through it before but somehow I survived
Now I'm flirtin' with death but never been more alive
Already made the news
Slipped out of every noose
I've cut my demons loose
Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
Raged on fumes
There's nothing left to use
My middle name's abuse
Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
I-I can't believe I'm letting you do this to me...
I-I can't believe I'm letting you do this to me...
Hand me a line
Really hand me a line
Really hand me a line
Hand me a line
Really hand it to me
I've always loved you
Love dumpling 
Your shit's like chocolate cake and 
Your ass smells like a rose
I really hate you
Love dumpling
Now my bowels are aching
I-I can't believe I'm letting you do this to me...
Drop down in a line
Really hand me a line
Really hand me a line 
Hand me a line
Really hand it to me 
Hand me a line
Really hand me a line
Really hand me a line
Hand me a line
Drop down in a line
Really hand me a line
Really hand me a line
Hand me a line
Really hand it to me
On shift from 9 to 5
And then from 6 to 3
Steals the soul; machine forever turning
Class rebellion
Under our noses
The boss is feeding on living corpses
Their broken backs
Call for us to rise
But for now we'll all just smile and sympathize
Denied our movement
Now lost, replaced by fear
We ask nothing less then settle for nothing more
Behold the capitalist
Bathing in the blood
Of the working class
Martyrs bleed
Until spoken to
Vultures get fat from the harness coup
Revolution
Another empty promise
Of the leftist elite
Frustration
Another soul is crushed
Under the rulers' feet
And as the boot is forced
Into their teeth
Our safety
Is their defeat
Your station has been assigned
Your rebellion will be confined
Your rebellion will be confined
Your rebellion will be confined
Your rebellion will be confined
Tired doctrines
Killing just as many
As the leaders that they decry
Their backs
All well patted
For a job well done
Without the use of their spines
Indentured servants
Without the shackles
Calloused hands and drying hearts
Rise up and destroy
The disease
That stole your soul
I used to think Cupid was a real jerk
A child star -tormented
A faded star of yesterday now toothless and jaded
He shoots his arrows wildely with bottles
Scattered across the sky - he trips on clouds
With a face like Keith Richards
I Am your voice what you propose
I Am your choice your vow to be
Whatever you do I'll agree
Please forgive me my cruel joke
I'm everywhere - partial and entire
I'm on the inside of everything
And on the outside
I'm trembling like a man away from home
But I can't speak my heart
In case they hear me
Now, no one will listen to our song
I Am your voice what you propose
I Am your voice your vow to be
Whatever you do I'll agree
Please forgive me my cruel joke
I used to think cupid was an asshole
The lonliest soul in the universe
And as the wrinkled birdman approached me
I could smell his smouldering cigarette breath
And he looked at me out the corner of his head and he spoke
So, you ask me why no one stays together anymore
You're never around when I need you
You're never around when I need you
On your breath, on your flesh
On line, on time
On your head, on your chest
On line, on time
Out of the light we begin
Out of the old and thin and control, we spin
Into the night we pass
Into the salted wax and the false attacks
Out of the light we begin
Out of the old and thin and control, we spin
On your breath, on your flesh
On line, on time
To the west, to the left
On line, on time
Out of the light we begin
Out of the old and thin and control, we spin
Into the night we pass
Into the salted wax and the false attacks
Out of the light we begin
Out of the old and thin and control, we spin
On your breath
On your flesh
On line, on time
Yeah
On line, on time
On your head, on your chest
On line, on time
Out of the light we begin
Out of the old and thin and control, we spin
Into the night we pass
Into the salted wax and the false attacks
It's what I see
It's not what I mean
I'm just faking it
It's what I see
It's not what I mean
I'm just faking it and you're holding
Out of the light we begin
Out of the old and thin and control we spin
On your breath
On your flesh
On line, on time
On time
Hold, below
You're rising on you're rising on
Slow, behold
Nothing else can be wrong if the timing is on
It's what I see
It's not what I mean
I'm just faking it and you're holding
On your breath, on your flesh
On line, on time
On your head, on your chest
On line, on time
Out of the light we begin
Out of the old and thin and control
Now, this will be the last bitter song
It will be my last, real bitter song about you
From now on, I'll write about flowers and butterflies
Chickens and kittens and shit
From now on, I'll try to look myself in the face
From now on, I'll try to find someone who knows I exist
So I won't have to feel like I do
When I write my bitter songs
This is my last real bitter song
About you
I won't have to mention she was blonde and thin
With a peanut for a brain and volleyballs for chest
I won't have to mention: that's always what happens
When you leave him your key, he ends up having sex in your apartment with miss Non-Bitterness
So this will be the last bitter song
I'm feeling cheerful already
I'd like to break his neck, if I may
But most, I'd like to cut off that hair
And cut off that head
And cut off those volleyballs
And I hope her heart gets broken
And I hope she turns bitter, really really bitter
Like me
So you dropped me
Held me by my feet and let me go
I fell between the seat, but nothing broke
I've yet to feel that brilliant afterglow
The one I knew of years ago
Now I'm twisted
Twisted from the waist and spun around
Promised only sky but given ground
Realized the makeup is for a clown
The clown I knew of months ago
(Chorus) I only wanted to be somebody
So fucking bad, I came unglued
I only wanted to be somebody
So here we are now, face to face
And I'm fucking you
So you caught me!
Wishing I were better than the rest
You hit me and left bruises on my chest
And when I wouldn't cheat
I spit upon your test
The test I tore up weeks ago
And now my fist is
My fist is for your face to cock the jaw
When I begin to rise, you start to fall
Now you know how it feels to drop the ball
The ball I threw back days ago
So I'll just stand right here for now
I should have won, but how?
I break a smart ass grin
Who let the loser win?
Let's break a smart ass grin
Let's let the losers win!
I'm runnin' out of room
Don't make me say it
There's nothin' left in me
Don't make me
Too much for hotel rooms
Don't make me say it
Sleeping pills don't make me
There is no love left in your eyes
There is love between your thighs
Roll over say g'night
A morning dog howl in the street
Cuff your tiny hands and feet
Napkin in the drain
I'm runnin' out of room
Don't make me say it
There's nothin' left in me
Don't make me
Too much for hotel rooms
Don't make me say it
Sleeping pills don't make me
There is no love left in your eyes
There is love between your thighs
Roll over say g'night
I hate my life, I hate my life
Never want another wife
I want the life you think I have
Think I have...
Think I have...
There is no love left in your eyes
There is love between your thighs
Roll over say g'night
I've had enough of feelin' sick
Had enough of feelin' sick
The sugar never helps
I hate my life, I hate my life
Never want another wife
I want the life you think I have
Think I have...
Think I have...
Think I have...
So pull me out of this dream
Turn off the television
Put on a romantic vinyl
And come to bed again
Please be my next morning flower
But don't be there all the time
Leave me a couple of hours
Then bring me food and wine
Play with me, play with me
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel
I'll make this week disappear
Like I've erased several months
It's turning into a year now
And I'm still a manikin
You're so poetic when you're sad
So tiring when you cry
We could fly out and get married
I think I love you now
Play with me, play with me
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel
Play with me, play with
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel
Hey now, all you sinners
Put your lights on
Put your lights on
Hey now, all you lovers
Put your lights on
Put your lights on
Hey now, all you killers
Put your lights on
Put your lights on
Hey now, all you children
Leave your lights on
You better leave your lights on
'Cause there's a monster
Livin' under my bed
Whisperin' in my ear
And there's an angel
With her hand on my head
She say I got nothing to fear
There's a darkness
Livin' deep in my soul
Still got a purpose to serve
So let your light shine
Deep into my hole
'N God don't let me loose my nerves
Don't let me loose my nerves
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
U-oho, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, all you sinners
Put your lights on
Put your lights on
Hey now, all you children
Leave your lights on
You better leave your lights on
'Cause there's a monster
Livin' under my bed
Whisperin' in my ear
And there's an angel
With her hand on my head
She say I got nothing to fear
She say
La ilaha il allah
You gonna shine like star
La ilaha il allah
You gonna shine like star
Let me fade away...
First of all, guck Bush
That's all, that's the end of it
Second, give it up to R.S.E. for hookin' up a kid
I got the two best, the newest plus the truest
Doomtree, Rhymesayers Entertainment (you know the name)
Rip the quality control from your burrows to your borders
Droppin' hot emcee's off balconies like Tony Rocky Horror
The, uh, the baby-danglin', words hanglin'
Hottest masturbatin' off the back of the neck of my soldiers' rhyme and
P.O., you know the dirty one disturbing categories
The matador in black, killin' bullshit allegories
Provide the hurt, these other beastly storing stories make em'
Get Up
Get Down
Get Up
And Get Fucked Up
I spray terms like throw-ups, I'm 'bout to spit a feelin'
'Cause me and Turbo Nemesis are soon to be arthritic villains
Still instillin' hatred, laced with manifesto modes
And our backbeat's to beat your heartbeat off beat, let's go
Excuse me
Just turn it on, and leave it runnin'
Macin', nothin' of gunnin'
Nothin' linin' our pockets
We frontin' like Cool Runnings
Somethin' so simple sparkin'
We wait, but nothin's comin'
Chrome in our fingertips
They eat shit, like faulty plumbin'
Just games for days, busy bees makin' our honey
And skee ball tickets still on count, it's real money
It's somethin' so ridiculous, funny, so fuckin' sick of this
Consistent lack of vision from children claimin' they listenin'
Still I'm sittin' skits and laughin' while they all missin' this
There's still songs about bitches from 9/11 witnesses. (ha ha)
So here I am in the Middle West
The heartland ma'fucka, sippin' whole milk ma'fucka
Our nights are colder right?
Minnesota nights, but our frostbitten fists
For the smile stings twice so um
Fight or flight, who gives a damn anyways?
So make a fuckin' difference in these apathetic names
(I tell 'em) Lean back, just relax, we tell 'em
Get Up
Get Down
Get Up
And Get Fucked Up
We don't dance, we just pull up our pants, and then we
Get Up
Get Down
Get Up
And Get Fucked Up
What, you want something like a cake? Want a Guinness or somethin'?
Get Up
Get Down
Get Up
And Get Fucked Up
Somethin' so ridiculous, funny, so fuckin' sick of this
Consistent lack of vision from children claimin' they listenin'
You look sick, homie eat a gun (I tell you (haha))
I'mma eat a gun
I look tired, it's probably the insomnia
I sleep like Tyler Durden
Stickin' feathers in your ass does not make you a chicken
Holla if you hit the bottom runnin'
A fool among the scholars
Bumpin' somethin' about clubs, bumps and hubs
I got a message in a bottle, written in gas and oil
Signed with a rag and a match, here catch
Slap to rebel yell
The rebels fell, embedded in brick
Ain't no fuckin' marble memorial
For pissed-off kids waitin' for desperate shicks
Like Bronson, ain't got enough to flip his face to vigilance again
Once it has been, the fifth amends
Barely our friends, who think about what's up with Jen & Ben
Once it has been (I think we should put up in this-Fuck outta here!)
Let's get out
Lean back and relax, we tell 'em
Get Up
Get Down
Get Up
And Get Fucked Up
Put the ma' fuckin' Fresca down
Get Up
Get Down
Get Up
And Get Fucked Up
Damnit with the blood
Get Up
Get Down
Get Up
And Get Fucked Up
Somethin' so ridiculous, funny, so fuckin' sick of this
Consistent lack of vision from children claimin' they listenin'
Goddman, Joe
You like Fresca?
You're fired
You're fired too
Tell him I'm driving, it's all right
Turn on this wheel
Turn on headlights
A hundred different bibles by my side
In my white gown
I go flying down
Oh my eyes, it cannot be,; He said no, it cannot be
All that time, it cannot be,; Easy said, it cannot be
The ghosts fly their asses off tonight
I'm just driving till it dies
Tell him I'm driving, it's all right
You tell him that I had a skin full
You tell him that I couldn't sit still
Imagine your whole self is filled with light
Your voice ringing out
Through the whole fucking town
Oh my eyes, it cannot be ; He said no, it cannot be
All that time, it cannot be ; Oh my eyes, it cannot be
You tell him I'm driving (X4)
Sunrise, wrong side of another day
Sky high and six thousand miles away
Don't know how long I've been awake
Wound up in an amazing state
Sunrise, wrong side of another day
Sky high and six thousand miles away
Don't know how long I've been awake
Wound up in an amazing state
I can't get enough and you know it's righteous stuff
Goes up like prices at Christmas, this
Motorhead, you can call me, motorhead, all right
Brained out, total amnesia
Get some mental anaeathesia
Don't move, I'll shut the door and kill the lights
If I can be wrong I must be right
All good clean fun, have another stick of gum
Man, you look better already
Motorhead, remember me now, motorhead, all right
Fourth day, five day marathon
We're moving like a parallelogram
Don't move, the mornin's not a pretty sight
I guess, I'll see you all on the ice
I should be tired, and all I am is wired
Ain't felt this good for an hour
Motorhead, remember me now, motorhead, all right
I think he's in a jealous rage
She's probably not the easiest one to live with either
There's nothing worse than bitterness
Just splashed across the page
I don't think that either one of them are fit to be alive
Oh, She'd just shut up and do what she does best
Show a little bit of skin
But keep it all when she's undressed
And doesn't she know that she is doing it all wrong
You can't tell a joke, yeah
While I'm listening to your song
All of this talking and all of this chatter
Is making me sick
Even though they say it doesn't matter
Let's put them in a room
Or maybe they should stay apart
Or maybe words are meant a mile
Yeah, let's fuck with their hearts
There's no reason to change
So lets watch everybody bleed
Cause everybody loves an accident
And everybody loves what they read
I think he's gonna be a big star
A voice of social change to rearrange the worlds perspective
But there's nothing better than watching him go down
He could pick up a habit or get in trouble
That might be affective
Oh, If he'd just shut off his conscience for one day
And take a cue from all of us
And give us a song we can really play
Doesn't he know he's going down
And going down fast
If he keeps on being difficult
He'll always come in last
All of this talking and all of this chatter
Is making me sick
Even though they say it doesn't matter
Lets take away the stars
Give while enough a add-on
He's calling for backup
But, I'm strong enough to take that phone
There's reason to change
So lets go all have a beer
Cause everybody loves an accident
And everybody loves what they hear
Two sides working together
And working against one another
Two bad souls are destroyed
It's the nature of business
You know how this part is
Oh look, they're losing all of their trust
Oh look, they're trying to bite the helping hand that feeds them
We put clothes on their backs
And they try to take the money up front
Now they don't like what we're saying
So lets up and leave them
We would have done what they are doing anyway
So this shit about taking in the souls
And lifes lasting misery
We're gonna take them down
And do it on the front page
Watch those little crooks come crawling back on bended knee
All of this talking and all of this chatter
Is making me sick
Even though they say it doesn't matter
I'm becoming a bore
Now I am wasting ashore
Now I'm still broken
But the subjects been spoken
There's no reason to change
But it sure is fun to advertise a fight
We're feeding off each other once again
But now neither one of us will give an inch until I break
I hope
I hope
I really hope
I hope
I hope
I hope
I hope
It's us, find power
Live life, mind power
It's us, find power
Life live, mind power
Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm
Life is a tour, I sit and ride along
Taking some notes and then I write the song
I'm staring down the road my life has gone
Is this where I belong
Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong
My mental state is fucking me up and I cried a pond
While asking You for some answers, but we don't have that type of bond
That my desire's gone with the way that I've been living lately
If I died right now, you'd turn the fire on
Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sellout
'Cause I hopped in Christianity so strongly then I fell out
Now I'm avoiding questions like a scared dog with his tail down
Feeling so damn humiliated because they looking at me like I'm hell bound
What story should I tell now, I'll just expose the truth
I'm so close to the fucking edge, I should be close to You
But who the fuck are You, You never showed the proof
And I'm only fucking human yo, what am I supposed to do
There's way too many different religions with vivid descriptions
Begging all fucking men and women to listen
I can't even beat my dick without getting convicted
These ain't wicked decisions, I got different intentions
I've been itching to get it, I've been given assistance
But the whole fucking system is twisted
Now I'm dealing with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian
And I've been told that my sinful life is an addiction
But I can't buy it, it's just too hard to stand beside it
I need an answer and humans can't provide it
I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it
It's truly mind blowing, I can't deny it
Is heaven real, is it fake, is it really how I fantasize it
Where's the Holy Ghost at, how long's it take man to find it
My mind's a nonstop tape playing and I can't rewind it
You gave me the Bible and expect me not to analyze it
I'm frustrated and You provoked it
I'm not reading that motherfucking book because a human wrote it
I have a fucking brain, You should know it
You gave it to me to think to avoid every useless moment
It was a mission that I had to abort
'Cause humans be lying, we're such an inaccurate source
It's gon' be hard to put me back on the course
Next Jehovah's Witness to come on my porch, I swear I'm slammin' the door
A lot of folks believe it though, but I'm not surprised
Humans are fucking dumb, still thinking that Pac's alive
I ain't trying to take your legacy and torch it down
I'm just saying: I ain't heard shit from the horse's mouth
Just sheep always telling stories of older guys
Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized
Now I'm supposed to bow my head and close my eyes
And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise, sounds like a fucking poltergeist
Show yourself and then boom it's done
Every rumor's gone, I no longer doubt this shit, You?�re the one
I'll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun
And all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge
I'll donate to a charity that could use the funds
Fuck the club, instead of bitches I'd hang with a group of nuns
And everyone that I ran into would know what I came to do
I wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of You
I hate the fact that I have to believe
You haven't been chatting with me like you did Adam and Eve
And I ain't seen no fucking talking snake unravel from trees
With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me
I don't know if you do or don't exist, it's driving me crazy
Send your condolences, this is me reaching to You so don't forget
If hell is truly Your pit of fire and I get thrown in it
I'ma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit
My gut feeling says it's all fake
I hate to say it but fuck it, shit I done lost faith
This isn't a small phase, my perspective's all changed
My thoughts just keep picking shit apart all day
And in my mind I make perfect sense
If You aren't real then all my prayers aren't worth a cent
That would mean that I could just make up what my purpose is
And I could just sit in church and just say ?�fuck??in the services
Man what if Jesus was a facade
Then that would mean the government's god
I feel like they've been brainwashing us with a lot
So much that we don't even notice that we're stuck in the box
Man everything is ?�what if??? why is it always ?�what if???
Planet Earth ?�what if??? the universe ?�what if???
My sacrifice ?�what if!??? my afterlife ?�what if!???
Every fucking thing that deals with You is fucking suspect
I'm fucking done
I'm fucking done
This is my fucking life and I'm living it
I'm having fun
If You really care for me, prove that I need to live carefully
But I'll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside for an afterlife that isn't even guaranteed
We are You, and You're us, stop playing games
My life's all I got, and heaven is all in my brain
And when I feel I'm in hell, my ideas are what get me through pain
Do as You please, and I'll just do me
I'm a human, I'll stay in my lane
Ill mind
It's us, find power
Live life, mind power
It's us, find power
Life live, mind power
Major...
Fuck...
Off!
With these milky lips
We're kissing violence
On these loving tongues
We burn up kings
Turn your fucking cheek
I'm gonna drive the knife through
Your stench of deceit
Before you get a chance to
Your sharp intellect
With crippling silence
Slip between the sheets
Stealthy compliance
Den of lying snakes
Two-faced junkie social mores
Mandrake, concentrate
I'll give you fucking sores
Shadow whisper, breaking chalice
Burning candl, e blackened malice
Casting circles, weeping callous
(Don't get mad)
Voodoo pinning, devil jealous
(Get even)
First light a fire
Next wicked speak
Burn singe the hair
Vex seal with spit
I'm your sweet regret
With protective shell
Gently drag you down
Though this dirty hell
Blood brothers, narcissism
Duplicity isn't new
Spit sisters, egotism
Watch me while I throttle you
Full of frailty
Growing desperate
To insanity
Pervert flesh on a plate
Scream out treachery
Everyone just likes to look
They just want to see you
Dancing on a meat hook
Shadow whisper, breaking chalice
Burning candle, blackened malice
Casting circles, weeping callous
(Don't get mad)
Voodoo pinning, devil jealous
(Get even)
First light a fire
Next wicked speak
Burn singe the hair
Vex seal with spit
Don't get mad
Get even
First light a fire
Next wicked speak
Burn singe the hair
Vex seal with spit
Dance of darkness beats
Spent words misconstrued
Under dermis seethes
Entertainment for the few
Mouth loaded with a gun
Trap door with vocal chords
God puppet beats a drum
Entertainment for the bored
Zombie doll with wings
Feasting on rot
Evil siren sings
Cast the fat lot
Vulture rip away
Scavenging parasite
Full-blown soul decay
Under the silver knife
Don't get mad
Get even
First light a fire
Next wicked speak
Burn singe the hair
Vex seal with spit
Cupid shot me in the eye so they say that love is blind
Is she gonna say yes? Is she gonna say no?
What's she gonna say?
Am I moving too fast? Am I thinking too slow?
I just wanna know
So I took all night to write this stupid love letter to you
Yeah you, from me to you
And all the time that I wasted on this stupid love letter to you
Fuck you, from me to you
You said no, you said no
So I took all night to write this stupid love letter to you
Pick your heart up off the floor with good intentions at the door
Is she gonna say yes? Is she gonna say no?
What's she gonna say?
Am I moving too fast? Am I thinking too slow?
I just wanna know
So I took all night to write this stupid love letter to you
Yeah you, from me to you
And all the time that I wasted on this stupid love letter to you
Fuck you, from me to you
You said no, you said no
So I took all night to write this stupid love letter to you
Too late, all the damage is done, oh
There's no return to sender
So I took all night to write this stupid love letter to you
Yeah you, from me to you
And all the time that I wasted on this stupid love letter to you
Fuck you, from me to you
You said no, you said no
So I took all night to write this stupid love letter to you
Like when you told me that my love was just aesthetic
And I fell into the beauty of another
And it was in the summer
Confusion was a-bloom in every little corner
Oh don't you understand
Don't you understand
Don't you understand
Don't you understand?
How lonely it gets
How lonely it gets
How lonely it gets
How lonely it gets?
And then you said to me that I was cold and stern
And said it like you meant I wasn't a woman
And then you intellectualized my emotion
And called me baby baby baby baby in a wrong way,
Oh Such a lack of taste
Such a lack of taste
Such a lack of taste
Such a lack of taste
Such a lack of taste lack of taste
Such a lack of taste lack of taste!
I never wanna see your pretty face again
I don't think I'll be your lifelong friend
I don't wanna carry any of your pain
I'm never gonna talk to you and
I'll never explain 'cause
You never get me right
Never get me right
Never get me right
Even if you'd try
You'd never understand
You never get me right
You never listen tight
You never get me right
Oh
Rails until the city sun 
And the longest hallway on Valencia 
Are screaming your name 
Through a mess of sweat-soaked covers 
And the bottles that you've been pissing in 
Used to be filled with your medicine 
But the signature on the prescription is your own 
I want you to say that you understand 
How it fell right through your shaking hands 
It's making me sick 
Hush now, don't say a word 
Down that hall comes the end of my world 
Screaming my name 
Through a mess of sweat-soaked covers 
And the shadows that you've been hiding in 
They know all the names of your relatives 
The signature on the will, it is your own 
I want you to say that you understand 
How it fell right through your shaking hands 
It's making me sick 
The engines idled in the tanks that day 
The bombs were attatched to the wings of the plane 
And I heard a sound 
Instead of sinking in the bay 
I thought of someone I could save 
My arms hit the water past the disappearing shore 
I was swimming my way to the liquor store 
This is the cause, the root of my anger
I don't need your contradictions
I'm not gonna play that role
I don't need you telling me I've got my back against the wall
If all I've got is everything and everything is all you want
If I give you just a little bit you're gonna try to take it all
I feed my anger with the fucking bullshit that you preach
I bleed forever and not a thing you do can comfort me
Obey authority
Live in conformity
I do for you what you do for me
I don't fear the confrontation
I'm not afraid to take the fall
I'm not gonna step aside I'm not letting you make the call
If everything is all I've got and everything is all you want
If I give you just a little bit you're gonna try to take it all
I feed my anger with the fucking bullshit that you preach
I bleed forever and not a thing you do can comfort me (x2)
Obey authority
Live in conformity
I do for you what you do for me
(Spoken) I feed my anger with the fucking bullshit that you preach
I bleed forever and not a thing you do can comfort me (/spoken)
I feed my anger with the fucking bullshit that you preach
I bleed forever and not a thing you do can comfort me (x2)
Obey authority
Live in conformity
I do for you what you do for me
Losing sleep wasting time killing myself till the day I die.
I am what?
I am pure fucking evil.
My fist.
My face.
My head.
The ground
I think you got a low self opinion man
I see you standing all by yourself
Unable to express the pain of your distress
You withdraw deeper inside
You alienate yourself,
And everybody else
They wonder what's on your mind
They got so tired of you
And your self ridicule
They wrote you off and left you behind
You sleep alone at night
You never wonder why
All this bitterness wells up inside you
You always victimize
So you can criticize yourself
And all those around you
The hatred you project
Does nothing to protect you
You leave yourself so exposed
You want to open up
When someone says
Lighten up
You find all your doors closed
Get yourself a break from self rejection
Try some introspection
And you just might find
It's not so bad and anyway
At the end of the day
All you have is yourself and your mind
You sleep alone at night
You never wonder why
All this bitterness wells up inside you
You always victimize
So you can criticize yourself
And all those around you
The self hatred that blinds you
Binds you grinds you keeps you down
The world falls down around you
You build up walls around you
You wear disgust like a crown
If you could see the you that I see
When I see you seeing me
You'd see yourself so differently
Believe me
I know the self doubt that runs inside your mind
I know the self doubt that treats you so unkind
If you could see the you that I see
When I see you
You would see things differently
I assure you
It's no bad mood
It's a look
You thought might kill
But you knew better
Wake up cold
Do you know you're not dead?
You make the same mistake
You've lost your head
Rearrange
Events again
Let them suit
Your next complaint
Self-absorbed
You're all wrapped up
So deep inside
Just think bland thoughts
Bad, good
Bad, good
Bad, good
Bad, good
I need someone, a person to talk to
Someone who'd care to love
Could it be you?
Could it be you?
The situation gets rough, and I start to panic
It's not enough, it's just a habit
And, kid, you're sick
Well, darling, this is it
Well, you can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time, do it all the time
I hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record!
Oh, yeah? Well, don't get so distressed
Did I happen to mention that I'm impressed?
I take one, one, one 'cause you left me
And two, two, two for my family
And three, three, three for my heartache
And four, four, four for my headaches
And five, five, five for my lonely
And six, six, six for my sorrow
And seven, seven for no tomorrow
And eight, eight, I forget what eight was for
But nine, nine, nine for the lost gods
Ten, ten, ten, ten for everything, everything, everything
Well, you can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time, do it all the time, do it all the time
A vague expression and a silent motive
To take this shithole by the fucking throat
And then it's on our hands
And that's how a new world began
A passing phase of quiet indignation
A molotov to start the conflagration
Till we've lost our voice
We'll make a joyful noise
And when a penny for your treason
Is worth a thousand more of hollow freedom
The world is feeling twice as cold today
And there's no more disguising this decay
All this shit, I gotta believe
It was an accident, a random chance
Ignorance, intolerance abounding
How could this be a part of any greater plan?
A new discussion of an age-old question
An age-old method towards a new direction
When the going's tough
We'll bite the hand that feeds
Break the fist that abuses
Be the voice of truth in a world so truthless
And juvenile
A stab in the back with a smile
Penny for your treason
Is worth a thousand more of hollow freedom
The world is feeling twice as cold today
And there's no more disguising this decay
All this shit, I gotta believe
It was an accident, a random chance
Ignorance, intolerance abounding
How could this be a part of any greater plan?
And I'm going hey hey hey hey
The world is feeling twice as cold today
And there's no more disguising this decay
All this shit, I gotta believe
It was an accident, a random chance
Ignorance, intolerance abounding
How could this be a part of any greater plan?
All this shit, I gotta believe
It was an accident, a random chance
Ignorance, intolerance abounding
How could this be a part of any greater plan?
You are a walking contradiction
You speak with false intentions but I know what you really want from me.
You're gonna make me flip this switch, I'm gonna make you my bitch
Now I understand all of the lies you hide and you're gonna make me flip this switch
I'm gonna make you my bitch, but now I understand this.
Take your insecurities out on me while I destroy you 
Realize that you should never test me.
You're gonna make me flip this switch, I'm gonna make you my bitch
Now I understand all of the lies you hide and you're gonna make me flip this switch
I'm gonna make you my bitch, but now I understand this.
Lie - don't lie, x3
x2
I will never break (don't lie), x3
I will never break.
Now you're gonna make me flip this switch, I'm gonna make you my bitch
Now I understand all of the lies you hide and you're gonna make me flip this switch
I'm gonna make you my bitch, but now I understand this.
I understand you.
You're gonna make me flip this switch, I'm gonna make you my bitch
Now I understand all of the lies you hide and you're gonna make me flip this switch
I'm gonna make you my bitch, but now I understand this.
She's a bimbo playing on the damn phone
I can really fuck you up, yeah
Because I'm the demon buttercup
You have to spit to see the shine
I see the carcass in your eyes
Before I go to sleep
Get it away from me
See the demon whore has eyes
Well, everything you look at dies
I gotta run up the phone bill
Because I'm a loser buttercup, uh-huh
Before I fall in too
Baby, I don't owe you
I could really suck you in
And you'll never see the light again
I gotta run up your phone bill
Because I'm a loser buttercup, uh-huh
Oh, I just want more
Baby, I just get bored
Too many happy faces, I wonder what that means
Are you personally offended by an iron on your jeans
Too many happy faces, is that more than you can bear
Or is it part of what you should be, lack of hygiene in your hair
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
If I thought you were clever, I'd be even more upset
And if you knew what you were saying, I might even have respect
As a Christian I should love you
But I don't need to hear your depressing remarks
See your know-it-all face on TV
And I couldn't care less about what you want to say
And I wish that it wasn't just me
Oh I don't think I'm better or kinder of heart, I'm as guilty as I can be
But every chance I get to put a smile on someone's face I will take it,
Believe me
But I don't need to hear your depressing remarks
See your know-it-all face on TV
And I couldn't care less about what you want to say
And I wish that it wasn't just me
No I wish that it wasn't just me
Too many happy faces
How eloquent you are
You know someday I think you'll
Become a big, big superstar
But I don't need to hear your depressing remarks
See your know-it-all face on TV
And I couldn't care less about what you want to say
And I wish that it wasn't just me
No, I don't need to hear your depressing remarks
See your know-it-all face on TV
And I couldn't care less about what you want to say
And I wish that it wasn't just me
No, I wish that it wasn't just me
No, I wish that it wasn't just me
So scream, I heard about your message,
And how it reeked of your indifference.
It bleeds horizontal straight from your wrists.
(So scream louder now.)
I'm bound to come around, I'm bound.
(I'm bound to come around.)
Well can't you, can't you feel it
Rollin' off your lips, tensing up your shoulders.
Come on, say it.
Well it's love.
(It's love.)
Make it hurt.
(I deserve it.)
Well it's love.
(It's love.)
Make it hurt.
(I deserve it.)
Well it's love, it's love, it's love.
Make it hurt.
I said I used the inconsistencies to undress the machine.
You're the poster boy,
Their selling point,
The focus for the new campaign.
(Something has to be done.)
I'm bound to come around, I'm bound.
(I'm bound to come around.)
Can't you, can't you feel it,
Rollin' off your lips, tensing up your shoulders.
Come on...
Well it's love.
(It's love.)
Make it hurt.
(I deserve it.)
Well it's love.
(It's love.)
Make it hurt.
(I deserve it.)
Well it's love, it's love, it's love.
Make it hurt.
The keys to the castle are right where I left them.
The princess walked in just to take more attention.
'Cause after all, well isn't that all that I've been after,
And after all, well isn't that all that I'm after yourself.
(No way out.)
I give up in me.
Well, I give up in you.
(No way out)
I give up in me.
(No way out)
Well, I give up in you.
I give up in you.
(No way out)
I give up in you.
I wanted you for nothing more
Than hating you for what you were.
If that's what you wanted to hear.
(Well, if that's what you wanted to hear.)
I wanted you for nothing more
Than hating you for what you were.
(Don't leave, leave.)
If that's what you wanted to hear.
(If that's what you wanted to hear)
I wanted you for nothing more
Than hating you for what you were.
(Don't leave, leave.)
If that's what you wanted to hear.
(If that's what you wanted)
(It's love, it's love.)
I wanted you for nothing more
(Make it hurt, I deserve it.)
Than hating you for what you were.
(If that's what you wanted to hear.)
That's what you wanted to hear.
(To hear.)
That's what you wanted to hear.
(If that is how we let it burn.)
Magic people - voodoo people
See the storm - moving in
Gaining speed - in my creed
Pain - and tears
Hate - and fears
Our sense of real is extinct
Why don't we accept as it is
All the things we see
All the things we hear
Why don't we accept as it is
See the light - breaking fast
Opens up - all you can see - knowledge to be
When there's innocents - there is guilt
With a will - there's a way
Our sense of real is extinct
Why don't we accept as it is
All the things we see
All the things we hear
Why don't we accept as it is
The more we see and learn
The more we seek and find
We are what we can reach
We are the ones alive
It's all according to plan
To survive the best that we can
Where is it we're all trying to go
We can't escape as it is
Take what there is accept as it is
Take what is yours accept as it is
I can't breathe 'cause I don't want to breathe no more
I can't see 'cause I don't want to see at all
I can't feel 'cause I don't want to feel no more
I can't deal 'cause I don't want to deal at all
I a state
I'm paranoid
Socially paranoid
I'm waiting on an asteroid
To come along and make us well
I'm paranoid
Mentally in a void
I'm waiting on an asteroid
To come along and make us well
Fuck your perfection
Your perfection
You want that personal attention
Your perfection
In a state of malice
In a state of shame
I wouldn't be so careless if I had you to blame
Now I lay me down to rest
Now I lay me down
Now I lay me down for death
Now I lay me
Fuck your perfection
Your perfection
You want that personal attention
Your perfection
Now I lay me down to rest
Now I lay me down for death
Tonight you stooped to my level
I am your mangy little whore
Now you're trying to find your underwear
And then your socks and then the door
And you're trying to find a reason
Why you have to leave
But I know it's 'cause you think you're adam
And you think I'm eve
You rhapsodize about beauty
And my eyes glaze
Everything I love is ugly
I mean really, you would be amazed
Just do me a favor
It's the least that you can do
Just don't treat me like I am
Something that happened to you
I am truly sorry about all this
You put a tiny pin prick
In my big red balloon
And as I slowly start to exhale
That's when you leave the room
I did not design this game
I did not name the stakes
I just happen to like apples
And I am not afraid of snakes
I am truly sorry about all this
I envy you your ignorance
I hear that it's bliss
So I let go the ratio
Of things said to thing heard
As I leave you to your garden
And the beauty you preferred
And I wonder what of this
Will have meaning for you
When you've left it all behind
I guess I'll even wonder
If you meant it
At the time
Amy Moore blew her top
Stole a car, shot a cop
Sped away 2000 miles
Didn't stop until she hit New Orleans
But that's all right
There's just one thing
Her wedding ring, or anything
She left behind, forgot to pack
How the hell is she gonna get it back?
Paperface
Paperface
I never heard of paperface
Until I moved to the west coast
Where I found that to be smooth
I had to wear a paperface
That's all right
There's just one thing
How am I supposed to sing
With this thing in my way
With this thing...
In my face
Paperface
Paperface
Only hope to see
See what's underneath
Only hope to be
The me that's underneath
Amy Moore blew her top
Stole a car, shot a cop
Sped away 2000 miles
Didn't stop until she hit New Orleans
But that's all right
There's just one thing
Her wedding ring, or anything
She left behind, forgot to pack
How the hell is she gonna get it back?
Paperface, paperface, paperface, paperface!
Hup, hup, etc (freakout)
If you want it did you never want for more
The girlscout fell from grace
If you want it did you never want for more
I spit inside her face
If you want it did you never want for more
The lines that cut right through
If you want it did you never want for more
The numbness that was you
What I want, what will I need
To sacrifice what I believe
My little girlscout, your mouth is getting sore
Will you love me any less if I hurt you any more
If you want it did you never want for more
Cleansing every sore
If you want it did you never want for more
Sold from door to door
If you want it did you never want for more
Finish what you start
If you want it did you never want for more
Dehumanize my heart
What I want, what will I need
To sacrifice what I believe
My little girlscout, your mouth is getting sore
Will you love me any less if I hurt you any more
And I was never your #1 fan
How can I grow a girl when you never were a man
And I was never nice and I've gone too far
You don't need to be nice when you've been kissed by a star
Kissed by a star, kissed by a star
Hurt by a star, fucked by a star
Kissed by a star, kissed by a star
Kissed by a star
Fuck what I want
Fuck what I need
I'll sacrifice what I believe
My little girlscout, your mouth is getting sore
Will you love me any less if I hurt you any more
Last seat on the bus
Who you gonna trust?
Which one do you follow?
Last seat on the bus
Don't make such a fuss
This much should make you hollow
'Cause every time you make yourself the reason
Is every time you make yourself beaten, yeah
(Yeah) This is an American cliché
American, American (get on the bus)
(Yeah) This is an American cliché
American, American (get on the bus)
First seat on the bus
Who you gonna trust?
Which one do you make follow?
First seat on the bus
Don't make such a fuss
Which one do you make hollow?
Now every time you make your friend the reason
And every time you make your friend the beaten, yeah
(Yeah) This is an American cliché
American, American (get on the bus)
(Yeah) This is an American cliché
American, American (get on the bus)
You want a way to be the same
You want a way to be the same
You want a way to be the same
Oh no
Shot
God
God
God
God
God
(Yeah)
(Yeah)
Strangulation
I don't wanna feel a thing.
When your hands close tight around my neck,
And force the air that I breathe.
I don't wanna feel a thing.
Yes she was a young girl.
'Bout the age of 23.
But somehow the lord never smiled down upon her,
So she flew out on a breeze.
Said: "I don't wanna feel a thing, I don't want to feel a thing."
Sure he was a good kid. But his phone it'd never ring.
He got tired of walkin' a tightrope,
Needin too much to drink.
So he got on a knee.
"I don't want to feel a thing"
But I know there's someone that loves up above
And want to fix you a dream.
He wants to sit down and think.
He wants to pour you a drink.
And you won't feel a thing. You wont feel a thing.
If you were a woman and I was a man,
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's heart and we do what we can.
If you were a woman and I was a man...
I was a man!
How's it feel to be a woman?
How's it feel to be a man?
Are we really that different?
Tell me where we stand.
I look at you, you look away.
Why do you say we're night and day?
I'd like to try another way.
Oh, baby! For just one day.
If you were a woman and I was a man,
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can.
If you were a woman and I was a man.
If you were a woman and I was a man.
How's it feel to be the hunter?
How's it feel to be the prey?
Is there really a reason
For this game we play?
I look at you, you look away.
Why do you say we're night and day?
I'd like to try another way.
Oh, darling, for just one day!
If you were a woman and I was a man,
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can.
If you were a woman and I was a man.
If you were a woman and I was a man.
Hey!
Hey, hey!
We're just two people trying to love,
Oh, but how... how can we love?
With this wall between us...
Holding us!
Holding us back!
If you were a woman and I was a man,
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can.
If you were a woman and I was a man.
If you were a woman and I was a man.
If you were a woman and I was a man.
Oh! If you were a woman and I was a man,
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can.
If you were a woman and I was a man.
If you were a woman and I was a man,
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can.
If you were a woman and I was a man.
If you were a woman and I was a man.
Oh! If you were a woman and I was a man,
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can.
If you were a woman and I was a man.
I was a man!
I should have seen my end coming from a long way off
My friends said "Man she'll give you the blues, so man, don't get caught."
But I went right ahead and told myself a pack of lies
And spent night after hammered night getting back my mind
Oh! I am a fool when I need you, I'm a fool to believe
My heart is so wide open, I'm so easy to deceive
I'm a fool I keep believing, I'm a fool I'll believe at all
I'm a fool who'll keep on trying, and like a fool, I will crawl
I waste time in my mind, thinking of you
I am a fool I know
I should be healing myself, instead of hurting myself
I am a fool I know, I know, I know!
And it hurts to keep learning the same lessons in pain
I am a fool I know
Self mutilation is the only thing I know
I am a fool I know
I see your front teeth sharpen and I watch your muscles flex
You have the kind of eyes that turn mere mortals into wrecks
And I know first hand so well all the high times you direct
Seduced, Rejected, Reduced, Ejected again!
Yeah!
Oh! I am a fool when I need you, I'm a fool to believe
My heart is so wide open, I'm so easy to deceive
I'm a fool I keep believing, I'm a fool I'll believe at all
I'm a fool who'll keep on trying, and like a fool, I will crawl
You can do anything you want
You look down, you'll see me crawling after you!
I am a fool I know, because it's all I know.
I am a fool I know, I know, I know
Oh, I am a fool I know
Now what I spit, it's medicine for the sick
An attempt to get a grip before it all starts to slip
And be the call and response from the bottomless pit
I remain nonchalant when the drama get thick
The last call, ballin' up my palm in a fist
The most common misperception is this
Drop a tape rock a show sign a line
Hit the road hit some hoes videos
Next you know, you'll be bawlin' and shit
But you'll be calling it quits
When all the cards start to fall in the ditch
Cause temptation is so hard to resist
No there's no such thing as an unjustified existence
Except perhaps a few thousand rappers in this business
Finish what I start scientifically, strategically
Specifically addressin' the oblivion we livin' in
My brethren and sisteren, I'm speaking are you listening
Freedom being imprisoned by the television image
If you let it instead get affected by your habitat
Ask a few questions, quit a few bad habits and after that
Handle this similar to how Xavier McDaniel did in '86
We're talking just a little less shit
And lately being mindful of the babies I admit
But at nighttime I sit serenaded by the blues of a skyline hue
Reminding me of a time when the old was new
And I spark a fire for the cold and the dark
Peace and war both pumpin' soul in my heart
And though they can't keep what they stole from the art
And they love to see beef 'cause it throws us apart
More fire for the people
Say more jobs for the people
And more books for the people
And more music for the people
As the world hurls towards seven billion more listeners
Seven hundred plus see the killed and held prisoners
Seven thousand one hundred islands I been missing
'Cause I grind seven to five, at night I'm writing scriptures
As hot as the block as cold contradictions
Pen drips with honesty I don't author fiction
Go to competition the bone that they try to pick with me
And learn the moral lesson and marching forward to victory
No flag waving celebrating your invasion
You call it thanksgiving, we call it thankstaking
Everybody looking for the ladder not the answer to the question
Waiting till the cancer's in regression
Fresh from the northwest the hottest thing lately
Like white celebrities buying black and brown babies
Got the town crazy over beats rhymes and life
Peace with adobo grease, eggs and brown rice
And I spark a fire for the cold in the dark
Peace and war both pumpin' soul in my heart
And though they can't keep what they stole from the art
They love to see beef 'cause it throws us apart
More fire for the people
More food for the people
More homes for the people
More clothes for the people
More schools for the people
More land for the people
More life for the people
Yo, I've seen souls get sold so coldly
See what a dollar can do to the tired and true
I speak boldly, composed of a melody told
Whenever we hold the memory close
No telling when the reaper fed a post and snatch a fan
Something that you can't capture with the camera lens
Amalgamation of a bolo and a hammerin' pen
The truth hurts, no wonder people rather pretend
I annihilate a fake persona for spare change
Everybody, self included, is fair game
Inherited the trait to make both ends meet
Often make a brother feel like he gotta compete
But with each release I reach for peace
Others quit to reach for the pigs from here to beacon to bridge
'Cause see, freedom of speech don't apply if you're silent
I shout like I'm trying to get heard on the island
And I spark the fire for the cold in the dark
Peace and war both pumpin' soul in my heart
And though they can't keep what they stole from the art
And they love to see beef 'cause it throws us apart
More fire for the people
More peace for the people
More life for the people
More love for the people
More love for the people
More love for the people
More love for the people
I live inside
All invited inside
Eyes flutter feathers
My hair's fair like weather
I've blown my recovery
Living is nice
When you're spun like a kite
Sugar and tea and cream
Looks like the sea is green with rivalry
Now that I know just what you're all about
I want out
Now that I know just what you're all about
I want out
I live inside
All invited inside
Sugar and tea and cream
Looks like the sea is green with reverie
Now that I know just what you're all about
I want out
Now that I know just what you're all about
I want out
Life is real when you're dreaming
Life's a dream when you're realing
Now I want out
Now I want out
I don't have time for your solutions
And I don't wanna deal with your mistakes
No matter how much medication
The doctor says I need to take
I still say...
You're the ones that kill your babies
You're the ones that fuck your kids
You're the ones that throw each other away, yeah
You're the ones sitting in church every Sunday
And I don't want your religions
And I don't need your sympathies
And I don't want a part of all your hatred
No matter how much you yell at me
I still say...
You're the ones that kill your babies
You're the ones that fuck your kids
You're the ones that throw each other away, yeah
You're the ones sitting in church every Sunday
...
You're the ones that kill your babies
You're the ones that fuck your kids
You're the ones that throw each other away, yeah
You're the ones sitting in church every Sunday
Perhaps it's just the way the light falls 
But everything looks like a target to me 
And I don't know where the gun is 
But I'm certain that it's pointed at me 
And in the jungle, retched jungle 
They say the lion eats tonight 
And all around it is a colliseum 
Dripping with a voracious appetite 
I say hey there, fella 
Whose soul are you tormenting now? 
Hey there, fella 
Whose soul are you tormenting now? 
In the course of all the previous events 
It is evident that something's bound to happen 
Come on, rear your ugly head to me 
I've got nothing to lose but my apathy 
The root of the problem has been isolated 
The root of the problem has been isolated 
The root of the problem has been isolated 
The root of the problem has been isolated 
Come on, motherfucker 
Come on, motherfucker 
Come on, motherfucker 
Let's throw down 
Come on, motherfucker 
Come on, motherfucker 
Come on, motherfucker 
Let's throw down 
Just try me 
Just try me 
What are you waiting for? 
Come on, motherfucker 
Let's throw down 
Come on, motherfucker 
Let's go 
Just rear your ugly fucking head 
I'll put it on a platter 
Just rear your ugly fucking head 
I'll put it on a platter 
Come on, motherfucker 
Come on, motherfucker 
Come on, motherfucker 
Let's throw down 
Come on, motherfucker 
Come on, motherfucker 
Come on, motherfucker 
Let's go 
Hey there

Come on, motherfucker 
Come on, motherfucker 
Come on, motherfucker 
Let's throw down 
Come on, motherfucker 
Come on, motherfucker 
Come on, motherfucker 
Let's throw down 
Just try me 
Just try me 
What are you waiting for? 
Come on, motherfucker 
Let's throw down 
Come on, motherfucker 
Let's go 
I'll make you wish that you'd never been born 
I'll make you wish that you'd never been born 
I'll make you wish that you'd never been born 
Come on, motherfucker 
Let's go 
Hey there 
Hey fella 
Hey there 
Hey fella
I stand around at American weddings
I stand around for family
At my best when I'm terrorist inside
At my best when it's all me
I was there when you took all the people
I was alone in a mental ravine
You breathe life when you break the walls down
You breathe life when you set me free
Where is my head
Where are my bones
Why are my days so far from home
Where is my head
Where are my bones
Can you save me from myself
Can you save me from myself
Free-thinking renegade social
Mr. Moon a man now
In a slipstream of my possibilities
I got the boat so we don't drown
These are the days that are split down the middle
No words to calm me down
I'll be sure that what you dream of
Won't come to hunt you out
Where is my head
Where are my bones
Why are my days so far from home
Ghostman
Where is my head
Where are my bones
How come we get so lost
Ghostman
Where is my head
Where are my bones
Can you save me from myself
Can you save me from myself
I stand around at American weddings
I stand around for family
At my best when I'm terrorist inside
At my best when it's on me
Ghostman
How come we get so lost
Ghostman
Where is my head
Where are my bones
Can you save me from myself
Can you save me from myself
Where is my head
Where are my bones
Can you save me from myself
Where is my head
Where are my bones
Where is my head
Where are my bones
Where is my head
Where are my bones
White kitchen walls with a thousand windows.
You turn on Winston in the den.
I'm still asleep but I can hear the piano,
When you make breakfast after ten.
And I smell the coffee on your fingers.
I still smell the perfume in the bed.
The crushed linen roses on everything,
And you're still inside my head.
Make her know how it feels to miss you.
Let her know you're swapping sides.
You're not the one with all the problems,
You're the one with all the pride.
So pick your head up boy, and walk away.
Walk the coolest walk you know.
'Cause in a month or two she'll call you,
Ya gotta... hang up the phone.
And I hope she knows I've got this memory,
That won't ever seem to break or bend.
A thick lock and sheet rock is on my windows in the kitchen,
I don't think I'll ever take em' down again.
And I've learned a lot from all these break ups and make ups
And fuck ups and fake ups
Things that I wish you could comprehend yeah, comprehend
But for now I'll lace up
My wingtip shoes, boys
And I'll go have breakfast with my good friends (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got to make her know how it feels to miss you
You got to let her know you're swapping sides
You're not the one with all the problems
You're not the one with all the problems
You're the one with all the pride
(Here we go!)
You got to make her know how it feels to miss you
Let her know you're swapping spit
You're not the one with all the problems
You're not the one with all the problems
She's the one that's full of shit!
So just pick your head up, boys and
Walk away
Walk the coolest walk that you know
I know you know, that
In a month or two she'll, she'll call you
You got to...
Hang up the phone...
*Dial tone*
Dzisiaj protestuję
Bo mnie nikt tu nie szanuje
Dzisiaj protestuję,
Bo każdy czepia się
Dzisiaj protestuję,
Bo się sama zaniedbuję
Dzisiaj protestuję,
Strzelę sobie prosto w łeb
Samej mi do siebie
Jest okrutnie za daleko
Ciągle mi dystansu
Do samej siebie brak
Burzę się  na wszystkich,
Że mnie za nic, kurwa mają
A to mnie od środka
Wpierdala jakiś rak
Jak siebie przeżyć mam?
Czas nie leczy moich ran!
Śmieję się ze wszystkich
Tylko z siebie wciąż nie mogę
Biję się ze wszystkim
Tylko rzadko kiedy w pierś
Może zawsze będę czuła się
Od siebie gorsza
Może tak zostanie do usranej śmierci mej
Jak siebie przeżyć mam?
Czas nie leczy moich ran!
Jak siebie w sobie znieść?
Jak mam pokochać się?
Czasami nawet rację mam
Czasami nawet sama sobie kłaniam się
Ale wystarczy obcy śmiech
I wszystko znowu trafia szlag!

Hold me down
I am floating away
Into the overcast skies
Over my home town
On election day
What is it about Birmingham?
What is it about buffalo?
Did the hate filled wanna build bunkers
In your beautiful red earth
They want to build them
In our shiny white snow
Now I've drawn closed the curtain
In this little booth where the truth has no place to stand
And I am feeling oh so powerless
In this stupid booth with this useless
Little lever in my hand
And outside my city is bracing
For the next killing thing
Standing by the bridge and praying
For the next doctor
Martin Luther King
It was just one shot
Through the kitchen window
It was just two miles from here
If you fly like a crow
A bullet came to visit a doctor
In his one safe place
A bullet ensuring the right to life
Whizzed past his kid and his wife
And knocked his glasses
Right off of his face
And the blood poured off the pulpit
Yeah the blood poured down the picket lines
Yeah, the hatred was immediate
And the vengeance was divine
So they went and stuffed god
Down the barrel of a gun
And after him
They stuffed his only son
Hello birmingham
It's buffalo
I heard you had some trouble
Down there again
And I'm just calling to let to know
That someone understands
I was once escorted
Through the doors of a clinic
By a man in a bulletproof vest
And no bombs went off that day
So I am still here to say Birmingham
I'm wishing you all of my best
Oh Birmingham
I'm wishing you all of my best
Oh Birmingham
I'm wishing you all of my best on this election day
Meet me where the city turns to trees and nothing comes for free
Lets see just how imposing you can be to me
So far from road-marks or homecoming games
Go on and drop your fucking names
Try to shift the blame
Watch me take a crowbar
To your brand new car
Without the things your daddy bought you
You won't get very far
Without your plastic friends
And your odds and ends
Would you still be a star?
The idle rich cocooned away from earth
You're cynical from birth
Tell me what you think your pride is worth to me
When all that you can do is call me gay
I'm sorry I don't swing that way
And even if I did I'd still say
Do you think I'm scared to play your games?
Battle is my middle name
I hope that you're insured
Hey I'm a selfish servant low
They lied a fear and loathing
A chosen one it's so undone
Load your gun the damage done
Never me they will fail to see
I will get so high that I trip with Jesus
Apathy and a bitter me I will fail to see
That he walks among us
So what save it for your own
Are you happy, mad I am
Watch me fly I'm Superman
Never me they will fail to see
I will get so high that I trip with Jesus
Apathy and a bitter me I will fail to see
That he walks among us
It's such a bore when I'm bringing down that horse
Just let me bleed one more
Oh, just one more
It's such a bore when I'm bringing down that horse
Just let me bleed one more just one more
It's such a shame that it is this way
I'm a junkie and god is gay
Hate to bleed but it heals my pain
Whatever man never, never, never, never
Never me they will fail to see
I will get so high that I trip with Jesus
Apathy and a bitter me I will fail to see
That he walks among us
Trip with Jesus
Trip with Jesus
Trip with Jesus
Trip with Jesus
Trip with Jesus
Trip with Jesus
Trip with Jesus
Bella stronza,
che hai distrutto
tutti i sogni della donna
che ho tradito
che mi hai fatto fare a pugni
con il mio migliore amico
e ora mentre vado a fondo
tu mi dici sorridendo
ne ho abbastanza.
Bella stronza,
che ti fai vedere in giro 
per alberghi e ristoranti
con il culo sul Ferrari 
di quell'essere arrogante
non lo sai che i miliardari
anche ai loro sentimenti danno un prezzo
il disprezzo.
Perché forse io ti ho dato troppo amore
bella stronza che sorridi di rancore.
Ma se Dio ti ha fatto bella
come il cielo come il mare
a che cosa ti ribelli di chi ti vuoi
vendicare
Ma se Dio ti ha fatto bella 
più del sole e della luna
perché non scappiamo insieme
non lo senti questo mondo come puzza.
Ma se Dio ti ha fatto bella
come un ramo di ciliegio
tu non puoi amare un tarlo
tu commetti un sacrilegio.
E ogni volta che ti spogli 
non lo senti il freddo dentro
quando lui ti paga i conti 
non lo senti l'imbarazzo del silenzio.
Perché sei bella bella 
bella stronza
che hai chiamato
la volante quella notte
e volevi farmi mettere in manette
solo perché avevo perso la pazienza,
la speranza sì..
Bella stronza,
ti ricordi 
quando con i primi soldi
ti ho comprato quella spilla
che t'illuminava il viso
e ti chiamavo la mia stella,
quegli attacchi all'improvviso
che avevamo noi di sesso e tenerezza.
Bella stronza sì...
perché forse io ti ho dato troppo amore
Bella stronza che sorridi di rancore.
Ma se Dio ti ha fatto bella
come il cielo come il mare
a che cosa ti ribelli di chi ti vuoi
vendicare
Ma se Dio ti ha fatto bella 
più del sole e della luna
esci dai tuoi pantaloni
mi accontento come un cane
degli avanzi
perché sei bella bella bella
Mi verrebbe di strapparti quei 
vestiti da puttana 
e tenerti a gambe aperte fin che viene domattina
ma di questo nostro amore
così tenero e pulito
non mi resterebbe altro
che un lunghissimo minuto 
di violenza
... e allora ti saluto bella stronza!
If you want it did you never want for more
The girlscout fell from grace
If you want it did you never want for more
I spit inside her face
If you want it did you never want for more
The lines that cut right through
If you want it did you never want for more
The numbness that was you
What I want, what will I need
To sacrifice what I believe
My little girlscout, your mouth is getting sore
Will you love me any less if I hurt you any more
If you want it did you never want for more
Cleansing every sore
If you want it did you never want for more
Sold from door to door
If you want it did you never want for more
Finish what you start
If you want it did you never want for more
Dehumanize my heart
What I want, what will I need
To sacrifice what I believe
My little girlscout, your mouth is getting sore
Will you love me any less if I hurt you any more
And I was never your #1 fan
How can I grow a girl when you never were a man
And I was never nice and I've gone too far
You don't need to be nice when you've been kissed by a star
Kissed by a star, kissed by a star
Hurt by a star, fucked by a star
Kissed by a star, kissed by a star
Kissed by a star
Fuck what I want
Fuck what I need
I'll sacrifice what I believe
My little girlscout, your mouth is getting sore
Will you love me any less if I hurt you any more
I thought maybe we'd made a pact,
But you gave into foul temptations making all the
Wrong moves and the wrong decisions
Making lies up for all the right questions
Maybe I was just asking too much
I don't think it's likely you're just made from all the wrong stuff
Your bed's been made
Mona Lisa, you've really done something,
Done a number on all of my organs
Mona Lisa, you've really done something,
Done a number on all of my organs
I must say I commend you on all of your fire,
Soaring highs and drowning lows,
Full speed ahead you go with all of your heartache
It's all greater 10 minutes till doomsday
All the while just showing your teeth,
Smiling or growling, never sure I just wait and see
Your bed's been made, now go die in it.
Mona Lisa, you've really done something,
Done a number on all of my organs
Mona Lisa, you've really done something,
Done a number on all of my organs
And I've been racking my brain figuring out what to say,
But it may be safe to bet,
That the day might come where I'd forgive what you've done
But it still hasn't happened yet
Your bed's been made, now go die in it.
Mona Lisa, you've really done something,
You're the black ice on my road to wholesome
Mona Lisa, you've really done something,
Done a number on all of my organs
On all of my organs
So what makes you think that I don't see
You're not doing what you're told
So what makes you think that I need
I'm not buying what you've sold
So there you go, leaving it all away
How bad do you want it
Better go and get it
So what makes you think that I don't see
Every time you didn't show
So what makes you think that I'm gonna believe
Every lie you've ever told
So there you go, leaving it all away
Millennium theater
Get out there and buy that water and gas
Ramadan, orange alert
Everybody put on your gas mask
First leak it out about the president
Then stand up and shout impeachment
Pull them coattails out from under that little v.p.
Before he has a chance to get in the driver's seat
Millennium spectacle
Everybody put on a show
Slip the little prince in the back door
21st century here we go
Digital whiplash
So many formats so little time
While out in tv nation
Under darkening skies
The resistance is just waiting
To be organized
Halliburton, enron
Chief justices for sale
Yucca mountain goddesses
Their tears they form a trail
Trickle down pollution
Patriarchies realign
While the ice caps melt
And new orleans bides her time
New orleans bides her time
Ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to tonight's show
The millennium theater
Asks that you not smoke
Please turn off your cell phones
And forget what you think you know
Now, if the greenbacks don't stack large on my side of the yard

Now lift up your fuckin' dress, where's the rest
Bitch can hide a treasure chest, in her breasts

Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed
(Repeat 2x)
We smokin' weed, you and me

Now bitch niggaz don't mean shit, from where I sit
Magnificent blow your back out, if you act out
Eighteen deep when the plane soar
The bitch threw her tits asked my click who we pay for
Penetrate the clouds, loud, and obnoxious
Surround the airport with feds and helicopters
Escorted, detained and deported
Scared of the ly-rics, and when they bitches hear us
We the clear-est, you can fear us
Smile on the day of your disappear-ance, smoke in mirr-ors
Break 'em all, pull over and jump out
'Cause I can take 'em all, all bustas shake 'em all
I'm at the mall, buyin shit, like hot dog on a stick
These bitches all on the dick
Ice cube ain't a lick (nope) make me bleed
And now you got to deal with the niggaz that I feed, greed
Uh uh uh *pigs squeal*

When you get your hands on it, wanna fawn it
Wanna dance on it, everybody want it

You punks is petty, still we steady, countin' fetti

Niggaz hit me I'ma turn into the crow *caw caw* and take a shit
On everything counterfeit, the don mega
Blade runner, in a beige hummer all summer
It'd take about twelve honkeys, to convict
The nigga makin' you sick, ask the 12 monkeys
Up in detroit holdin' weed court, all through the south
Picked up a ounce in shreveport

To any motherfucker disgruntled exit wound, look like a funnel
Worldwide, international jet set

Remember how you gave me shit
And I made lemonade out of it
Pass me the sugar and things still won't be right
Look what you've built
Now are you proud of your deceitful quilt?
Well I won't cover myself in it
The warmth has just been choking me
Thanks, thanks for nothing
I've taken all you got and started walking (I'm walking)
Not broken! Still standing!
Been ripped apart but now
I'm demanding
No more shit
This is it
I'm leaving for myself and no one else
So long!
Been swell!
See you in hell!
Now what do you say?
Can't hear you buried in the lies that you've laid
I'm breaking myself away from that chain
Too bad that you don't understand why
I'm walkin' away
And if you're lucky then someday I may
Possibly forgive you for all of it
But not today
But not today!
Last time now!
(Gun Club)
I can see clearly from my diamond eyes
I'm going to the mountain with a fire spirit
No one will accept all of me, so the fire will stop
And for the straights that got fire cars
I'm going to the mountain with a fire spirit
No one will take all of me, and the fire will stop
I will be cheating the whole ritual
I'm going to the mountain with a fire spirit
No one will accept all of me, and the fire will stop
Someone weird read: "Pen down a circle"
Yeah, someone left on a burned out world
Someone knows I'm dead as hell
Where the old north wind blows through southeast hell, yeah
And then John was betrayed by the machine
A proper circuit was a promise to me
I'm going up to the mountain to see
How blessing will set me free, yeah
I had to do something
I was wearing down
I was going down
Why can no one ever touch a fire spirit?
Why can no one ever hold a fire spirit?
Why can no one ever feel a fire spirit?
I am going to the mountain
Yeah, I can see clearly from my diamond eyes
I'm going to the mountain with a fire spirit
And no one will accept all of me, so the fire will stop
With too much patience and too much pain
I'm going to the mountain with a fire spirit
To make amends for all of me, and the fire will stop
We wanna live our life
Forever each day
To burn your candle
At both ends
Mach 10 velocity
Not slowing down at all
Your metal heart
Just never bends
Don't stop to
Wait for life just
BURNNN it to the ground
Burnnn!
Its time to sweat
Have no regret
Just burnnn it down
Burnnn!
All you're livin' for
Is the glory in your heart
Live hard, die great
Burnnn it down!
This is the last trip
This is the last trip
CXT, KRS-One
Boogie down, Crazy Town
I'm a bad ass B-Boy, two triple O
A space age hip-hop superhero
I rock the block with glocks and brass knuckles
A pocket full of weed and a B-Boy belt buckle
Space age rage to rattle your cage
Running amok as we fuck up the stage
Taking hip-hop to a whole new level
8-0-8 bass over twisted metal
Shifty, the rebel, supernatural
A mac with a pull, act a fool, excalibur
Destroying M.C.'s with my vocal algebra
We got something new for you
For you to take your ass and move it to
Hit to lose it to, it's that crazy crew
Taking you on a ride to the other side, check it
Bar codes on freaks programmed to freak mode
Black holes of lost souls, let the story be told
I rock a B-Boy stance 'cause it's time to explode
If you ever want to know what time it is
Compared to what time it isn't
When you hear KRS in the house
Just run and get our ticket
Because when you come into the jam
The party will be kickin'
All the wic wacs and DJ's in the house
Jealous, it gets so sickenin'
Now CXT are some cool guys
Still getting paid without no ties
At least no jack and I can't hack it
When you gonna ask the question why
I never liked working at Mickey D's
All my life I got B's and C's
Down with the crew called BDP
Shifty and E.P.I.C., now when you be?
Put your mind over matter
Gather 'round the sound
Yeah, gather 'round the sound
It don't get better, gather
'Round the sound
Come on, gather 'round the sound
Put your mind over matter
Gather round the sound
Yeah, gather round the sound
It don't get better, gather
'Round the sound
Come on, gather round the sound
I roll at light speed through space and time
With a boom box of beats and a book of rhymes
Cosmo kinetic, I just don't get it
These fools want to rock but their rhymes are pathetic
The Epic, digital bliss, the mega sound
Consists of hard drive bits written underground
Crazy Town rocks so hard, you'll go berserk
With the sound that travels around the universe
Ill thoughts disperse, we're the first and last
High class, white trash, rolling a classic hovercraft
In strange days, the wickedest ways become the norm
But it's far from the norm when we perform, check it
B-boys make some noise, get connected.
Respect it, you should expect the unexpected.
B-girls reping at the front of the show
I'm a bad ass b-boy, two triple O
Dope thoughts come when I hear a kick drum
A bass beat transforms the level of the street
And the lyrics boulevard status, yo, I'm the baddest
Beach front punks, they insist I'm the raddest
Thing to ever hit since L.S.D., hallucinate while I dominate
I bring Satan to the table
When I rock, there is not a label for it
Critics adore it, homicidal as it gets
Your wrist slit when I make suicidal imprints
On your brain I induce pain, so I'm insane
Hell bent burnt you like acid rain
Extraordinarily, I lyricize, specialize
In body rocking, rapping, and macking
Two triple O, I came to get down
With my clique Crazy Town, we came to get down
Yes, yes y'all, we came to get down
Put your mind over matter
Gather 'round the sound
Yeah, gather 'round the sound
It don't get better, gather
'Round the sound
Come on, gather 'round the sound
Put your mind over matter
Gather 'round the sound
Yeah, gather 'round the sound
It don't get better, gather
'Round the sound
Come on, gather 'round the sound
CXT
This is the last trip
This is the last trip
You left me like a broken doll
In pieces as I took the fall
For you, you dumb chump
You left me free fallin' like space junk
Burnin up in the atmosphere of life
Well I sound like a philosopher
But I'm a fool who's off her rocker
'Cause I let you in my heart that one last time
I've had enough, made up my mind
I'm gonna get up, and out, and wild
I love myself today
Not like yesterday
I'm cool, I'm calm, I'm gonna be ok, uh huh
I love myself today
Not like yesterday
Take another look at me now
'Cause it's your last look
Your last look forever
Well look at you,
Your all puffed up
In a big red truck
But your out of luck this time
Oh well that's tough
'Cause I'm on fire too hot to touch
With a chat room full of lovers
On the line
I'll stand right up
Spit shine my soul
I'm gonna be proud and loud and outta control
I'm looking the mirror
And I like what I see
I've lost the fear and the horror
That's been eatin at me
Cause bein with you was like a hangman's noose
I was livin' my life in dead man's shoes
I've had enough, made up my mind
I'm gonna get up, and out, and wild
I love myself today
Not like yesterday
I'm cool, I'm calm, I'm gonna be ok, uh huh
I love myself today
Not like yesterday
Take another look at me now
Hey Hey Hey
I love myself today
Not like yesterday
Your dead, and gone, I'm gonna get my way, uh huh
I love myself today
Not like yesterday
Take another look at me now
'Cause it's your last look
Your last look forever
I love myself today (x7)
Today, today...
My place is of the sun and
This place is of the dark (and I)
I do not feel the romance
I do not catch the spark (x2)
I don't know when I noticed life was life at my expense
The words of my heart lined up like prisoners on a fence
The dreams came in like needy children tugging at my sleeve
I said I have no way of feeding you so leave
But there was a time I asked my father for a dollar
And he gave it a ten dollar raise
When I needed my mother and I called her
She stayed with me for days (days)
Now someone's on the telephone, 
Desperate in his pain
Someone's on the bathroom floor
Doing her cocaine
Someone's got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom
But I tried to make this place my place
I asked for Providence to smile upon me with His sweet face
Yeah but I'll tell you...
My place is of the sun and
This place is of the dark (and I)
I do not feel the romance
I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
And I do not feel the romance, I will not be...
(By grace, my sight grows stronger and I will not Be a Pawn 
For the Prince of Darkness any longer)
Maybe there's no haven in this world for tender age
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
My greatest hope my greatest cause to grieve
And my heart flew from its cage and it bled upon my sleeve
The cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing
I couldn't hear them for the thunder
I was half the naked distance between hell and heaven's ceiling
And he almost pulled me under (under)
Now someone's on the telephone, 
Desperate in his pain
Someone's on the bathroom floor
Doing her cocaine
Someone's got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom
But I tried to make this place my place
I asked for Providence to smile upon me with His sweet face
Yeah but I'll tell you...
My place is of the sun and
This place is of the dark (and I)
I do not feel the romance
I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
And I do not feel the romance, I will not be...
(By grace, my sight grows stronger and I will not Be a Pawn 
For the Prince of Darkness any longer)
Sittin' here with an empty bottle
Down to my last cigarette
No missed calls and alcohol
I guess that's all that I got left
No one saw what you did to me this time
And a million times before
I look like a devil's child
You're the one who slammed the door
Everybody thinks they know me
You're the saint and I'm the phony
But you're the one who faked it all along
Everybody sees you cryin'
Lyin' lookin' like you're dyin'
Everybody knows what's goin' on
But everybody's wrong
Ain't I the kind of guy your momma
Told you not to hang around?
Sure enough you know who's gonna
Break your heart and bring you down
But she never saw you out at midnight
Actin' like you own the bar
To me you ain't no angel's child
I know who you are
Everybody thinks they know me
You're the saint and I'm the phony
But you're the one who faked it all along
Everybody sees you cryin'
Lyin' lookin' like you're dyin'
Everybody knows what's goin' on
But everybody's wrong about the one who needs
To let it out and just come clean
I've lost it all but I can't be your loser anymore
Everybody thinks they know me
You're the saint and I'm the phony
But you're the one who faked it all along
Everybody sees you cryin'
Lyin' lookin' like you're dyin'
Everybody knows what's goin' on
Everybody thinks they know me
You're the saint and I'm the phony
But you're the one who faked it all along
Everybody sees you cryin'
Lyin' lookin' like you're dyin'
Everybody knows what's goin' on
But everybody's wrong
How long? How long?
How long? How long?
How long? How long?
How long? How long?
Kiss your mother now 
I think you should
Kick you while your down
You knew I would
So I'm wearing thin
Same old trip again
Face down, heroin
Same old trip again
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
Until you crack
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
Until you crack
Drag your sister down
You never learn
Teach your brother how
And watch him burn
So I'm wearing thin (wearing thin)
Same old trip again (trip again)
Face numb, heroin (heroin)
Same old trip again (trip again)
Same old trip again (trip again)
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
Until you crack
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
Until you crack
I feel you coming, I see you red velvet loveliness
You shoot the fun, I feel your black hollow consciousness
I've turned you on to what they call the fucking devil's son
I kiss you all, the feeble and the damage done 
Your paranoia is starting to boil
The feeling is so that I'm sick and I'm breaking up
Your paranoia is starting to bore ya
My bleeding is for you, so that I'm dead
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
Until you crack
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
Until you crack
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
Until you crack
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
Until you crack
Try to convince you that you can't live without one
Hey look around man everybody's got one
So hurry up get your dollar bills together
They're going to try and get you something even better
You're not so sure but you heard it's great
You get there first so you won't be late
Everybody else will have to wait in line
I overestimated you
You knew that I probably would
We're so predictable
We've been sold a bill of goods
You want a choice want to make your own decisions
You want to make up the rules and the provisions
And everything is going to be so great
When you're the latest keeper at the gate
Everybody else will have to wait in line
Go go go go go
Well, I can see the sun
I got the minerals
It's fucking righteous baby
I got the stellar tights
A ballerina's type
It's fucking righteous baby
Baby
Well, I can see the sun
I got those minerals
It's fucking righteous baby
We got the jackets flak
You got to sit in back
It's fucking righteous baby, baby
Baby
Well, I can see the sun
I got the minerals
It's fucking righteous baby
Fucking righteous baby
Baby
I can see the sun
I got the minerals
It's fucking righteous baby
Baby

Darling, I fell like a god
When I am next to you
Something sacred 
Someone straight and true
Tell me 
Do you feel the same way too?
Darling, your face is radiant 
With the light of love
The kind that's sent straight down
From up above
And you're all I'm thinking of
Thinking of
Thinking of
Thinking of
Don't you give me lovin' like a revelation
Don't you make me burn
And make me feel the danger
Salutations to the maker of my finest hour
Goddess, queen, mother, sister, lover
Don't you ever leave 
Darling, I feel like a god when I am next to you
Something worth the worship
Of this honest fool
Tell me
Do you feel the same way too?
Like I do
Like I do
Like I do
Don't you give me lovin'
Like a revelation
Don't you make me burn
And make me feel the danger
Salutations to the maker of my finest hour
Goddess, queen, mother, sister, lover
Don't you ever 
Don't you give me lovin'
Like a revelation
Don't you make me burn
And make me feel the danger
Salutations to the maker of my finest hour
Goddess, queen, mother, sister, lover
Don't leave
Don't leave
Don't you give me lovin'
Like a revelation
Don't you make me burn
And make me feel the danger
Salutations to the maker of my finest hour
Goddess, queen, mother, sister, lover
Don't you ever 
Don't you give me lovin' like a revelation
Don't you give me love
Don't you give me love
Don't you give me love
Don't you feel the same way like I do?
Like I do
Like I do
Like I do
Caught, caught in the way
In the way of a bus
The lease is up. The lease is up.
They break our legs to prove a point
The lease is up. The lease is over
A bible in one hand, he makes decisions
The lease is up
Ordered his gun and its done and its done and done
An Hysteric at the top
Saying everything is safe
Ordered his gun and its done and its done
Ordered his gun and its done and
God is Going to get sick of me
And the accident
That takes the beat from my heart
Will look like it was my fault
Spend one more day backed into a corner
The lease is up
Impossible to lose support gets stronger
Each time something frightens them
You'll set it right
I know I know
God is Going to get sick of me
And the accident
That takes the beat from my heart
Will look like his
You said I get it, I get it, I get it alright
And that nothing can be taken and that nothing can be taken from me
After I've stopped waiting for an ambulance to come and get me
God is Going to get sick of me
And the accident
That takes the beat from my heart
Will look like it was my fault
One, two, three, four!
Welcome! Nothing short of anarchy
It's so hard to find out who you wanna be
Welcome! Nothing short of anarchy
It's so hard to find out who you wanna be - oh!
Go!
I couldn't find what you needed - ooh to be a double
A big pill but you know that you need a poison
Open, you need it but I returned the point of acceptance
How brave, your parades never do much
Violence!
Hopeless fight!
Call it straight!
Big black steel cap dealt rejection
Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Yay
Ugggh!
Uh, now, it's the opening salvo,
Where po's scope the people like Muhammad and Malvo.
A sample of the battle we waged against an animal
Made to snuff us out like the wick of a candle.
And all the youth dressed in camo,
We're ready to handle,
And no this war was not scripted,
We can't change the channel.
We're canceling all subscriptions,
This is the last issue,
When the casket's closed you can't take the cash with you.
No postmortem residuals,
We're individuals who
Indivisible become the most invincible.
But that is not the issue at hand,
We demand a simple right to question y'all,
People where the fuck is freedom at?
It's all we ask but instead we get our asses
Assassinated fast if they catch you talking trash.
If the first shall be last,
It's time to prepare,
Black clouds, sky falling
Put a hand in the air.
Yeah my people building monuments to weather the flood,
I'ma leave how I came screaming covered in blood.
Died once, born twice, both times we knuckled up,
Alongside our people we're gonna struggle with love.
And my people building monuments to weather the flood,
I'ma leave how I came screaming covered in blood.
Died once, born twice, both times we knuckled up,
Alongside our people we're gonna struggle with love.
So struggle with love,
Struggle with love,
Struggle with love.
Now this here's for those who choose fights
Whose fruits might never not ripen until after their life.
It's not right how they martyr our leaders
And target our children,
Disrespect our sisters
And wonder why we're militant.
Peace to my third world equivalent,
Even if I can't fight beside you
I write what I can
To get our fam in other lands to understand your pain,
'Cause your beef is mine and we're one and the same.
And I know about this privilege,
But if you're from where I'm from
Then you know a bigger burden comes with it.
And that's what I carry when you see me on a hustle,
I'm talking as a walking document of our struggle.
Kasamas hold me down and remember that I love you
With Ajani hold your head up if they ever take me from you.
And please tell 'em that I tried,
Don't cry,
'Cause no matter where you are, a struggle's nearby.
Right now I want to thank God for being me,
My soul won't rest until the colony is free.
1896 revolution incomplete,
Silence is defeat, my solution is to speak.
Resurrect the legacy of martyrs I beseech,
Time to choose a side, it's the mighty vs. the meek.
My big brother Free brought the word from the East,
We're the bullet in the middle of the belly of the beast.
Hey.
Cut me open 
Let me bleed for what I've done
Tell me straight-faced 
That I'm the only one
Destroy me 
Am I not everything you need?
Don't move, don't breathe
As I take every breath from you
Know one knows what I've done
And as I wait, I'm dying (For you)
Take me out of this picture frame
Breathe slow, don't move 
As I say goodbye
Replace you 
Cross my heart I hope you die
Ripped in pieces 
You're my perfect tragedy
Know one knows what I've done
And as I wait, I'm dying (For you)
Cut me, breathe slow
Break me, tell me as I die for you, for you... 
(Know one knows what I've done)
Know one knows what I've done
And as I wait, I'm dying
Know one knows what I've done
And as I wait, I'm dying (For you)
Olen myynyt maani ja halvalla.
Unohtanut olen, en voi kahta palvella.
Nyt vasta nähdä saan,
kuinka kuuluu rakastaa.
Koitan nousta ylös, polviltani.
Kurimus ei salli, koittaa viedä osani.
En voi vielä luovuttaa.
Jää tähän paikkaan lepäämään,
kasvot kohti itää.
Ei enää kiire mihinkään.
(Vielä tästä nousen.)
Jää tähän paikkaan lepäämään,
kasvot kohti itää.
Ei enää kiire mihinkään.
(Vielä tästä nousen.)
Raja tulee vastaan, tässä omani.
En aio jäädä makaamaan tuleen helvetin.
En voi vielä luovuttaa.
Jää tähän paikkaan lepäämään,
kasvot kohti itää.
Ei enää kiire mihinkään.
(Vielä tästä nousen.)
Jää tähän paikkaan lepäämään,
kasvot kohti itää.
Ei enää kiire mihinkään.
(Vielä tästä nousen.)
Jää tähän paikkaan lepäämään,
(Vielä nousen.)
kasvot kohti itää.
(Vielä tästä nousen.)
Ei enää kiire mihinkään.
(Vielä tästä nousen.)
Jää tähän paikkaan lepäämään,
(Vielä nousen.)
kasvot kohti itää.
(Vielä tästä nousen.)
Ei enää kiire mihinkään.
(Vielä tästä nousen.)
Everything I thought I knew
Changed the day that I met you
All my rides and fake tattoos
I thought we were so damn cool
I'd get right back on the aeroplane
The Greyhound bus, the subway train
If I thought it'd ease the pain
I'm not someone you ignore
Give us what we came here for
Pick my heart up off the floor
Give us what we came here for
Nothing less and nothing more
Just give me what I came here for
Every time I look at you
I forget what I'm supposed to do
I could turn around and walk away
It'd break my heart but who's to say
You'd notice anyway
I'm not someone you ignore
Give us what we came here for
Pick my heart up off the floor
Give us what we came here for
Nothing less and nothing more
Give me what I came here for
Nothing less and nothing more
Give me what I came here for
One step in and one step out
One thing's clear beyond a doubt
I had happiness and now I'm just about
To watch it burn
I'd get right back on the aeroplane
The Greyhound bus, the subway train
If I thought it'd ease the pain
If I thought it'd ease the pain
I'm not someone you ignore
Give us what we came here for
Pick my heart up off the floor
Give us what we came here for
I'm not someone you ignore
Give us what we came here for
Pick my heart up off the floor
Give us what we came here for
Nothing less and nothing more
Give me what I came here for
Nothing less and nothing more
Give me what I came here for
Nothing less and nothing more
Give me what I came here for
When I wear my Mary Jane's shoes,
I can escape from the blues
The whole world seems a little bit brighter, brighter
My heavy steps get a little bit louder, louder
Whoa, my Mary Janes
Whoa, my Mary Janes
Whoa, my Mary Janes
Whoa, my Mary Janes
When I wear my Mary Jane's shoes
Just like a child under bruise
My heart and my soul they feel like I'm seven
But from my head to my toes, it's like I'm in heaven, heaven
Whoa, my Mary Janes
Whoa, my Mary Janes
Whoa, my Mary Janes
Whoa, my Mary Janes
When I wear Mary Jane's shoes
I enjoy to spin the ones and toes
Music has another dimension
And I can dance with a different perception
Whoa, my Mary Janes
Whoa, my Mary Janes
Whoa, my Mary Janes
Whoa, my Mary Janes
Chanting in the darkness for just one taste.
Screaming bloody mary until my mirror breaks.
Cheating on reason for just one glimpse
Of the disease riding on your lips.
Lay reason to waste.
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
Breaking into you.
Breaking into you.
Is like waking, waking the dead.
Burning inside you.
Is like waking, waking the dead.
Burning inside you.
As you bury, bury your dead.
How much did she see?
She stole my skin,
I lost it all of what shed.
I lost it all to that flicker of pearly white.
Those nails did lay rest another chaste and serpentine (lunar) sacrifice on the eighth or ninth.
(Verse 1 - Sadistik)
Ayo I'm starting to face that a part of me's fake
And everything that they say is just hard to relate
And then it (ends quick) and it starts to decay
Until my (friendship) is a part of the phase
And I, can't pre-tend, can't stand these trends
Can't stand weak friends that have pretense
Sad can't stand back at that deep end
And now I see that I don't need friends
And I feel like a modern day patriot
With a mind of a God and a hearth of an atheist
God's love is a conjugal visit
'Cause you just get fucked while you're locked in a prison
My passion's emphatic (its mixed with) tragic romantic (instances)
Sadness and hazards (six six six) havoc that crafted (Sadistik)
An eye for an eye and a tooth can trade
Then you turn the other cheek till the bruises fade
If you lose an eye, lose a tooth and lose a cheek
Then your religion is losing face
When I vacate, to a sanctity
To a safe place, that was made for me
And I placate, all my atrophy
Then I won't say faith, isn't made for me
I walk (a fragile path), of thought (and habitats)
I've lost (and can't have back) across (the aftermath)
Of befriendin' each sentence, endin'
Retention defense and tension
Repentance needs ventin' when in
Dependent deep ended friendship
Followed first on a path of hollow verse
Solemn words that were both spoke but not emerged
Gotta learn that I gotta get through autumn first
Follow dirt that is gonna let the God occur
Read your bible (script the verses)
Stand for nothing (but sit at service)
Find the meaning (but miss the purpose)
Read in depth (but you get the surface)
Some say, Ill have to be synthetic, to get my quotes red (read) like your Jesus said it
Some day, Ill form opinion, either stand up to God or fall for religion
The road you cross, isn't quite a crossroad
Your bible's lines signify a barcode
And I'll go, put a rhyme to reason
'Cause Nietzche said "god is dead" and I believe him!
Fake laughter
Fake laughter
Fake laughter
Yeah, it's funny isn't it
I'm a dark storm cloud that's floatin' over top of suburbia
Ill bust, if you act all determined
I'm waterin' my garden with some black bottle bourban
So open up and listen to my rag water sermon
The universe is mine, a few disturbing times
My quija board told me I should go back to bed
So I could sleep some more
I didn't disagree the world is too gruesome
I'm far too beautiful to care about the revoltion
So get you're fire out my face and don't follow me, dipshit
Your whole entire existence is so opportunistic
I give a damn about the damage to the body from botox
Who cares get the fuck off your soapbox
I got a fresh pair of nike shoes
And I like 'em so much
I wanna thank the sweatshops in china too
Yeah man, it sucks the world is a war
But what the fuck you preachin' in my face about it for
I think that it's a cunning motif
How you be floodin the streets with propaganda
All about how there's no justice or peace
But one thing you never mention
Is how you do it all for your own damn attention
Come on man, you wanna be an activist be a real activist
Tell me goodbye since you cannot rely
On sympathy from me cause my tear ducts are dry
Look in my head for the sadness you seek
But you won't find a piece that will make you complete
I'm sick of trendy ass political rappers
Got me scribbling chapters I deliver for the cynical laughter
Nowadays every godd damn little disaster
Needs a dedication song about it doesn't it (yeah, YES!)
Yeah man, fight the power fuck the government
That's a great message but I smell your lies under it
Yeah I see you acting all conscious gettin' passionate in rap songs
But truth be told you take tradegies and latch on
Hopin' it'll garter you new fans
Every other day you probably prayin' when you walk to the newstand
That someone had a meltdown and bottom or two
Blew a head gasket flipped shit and shot up a school
And not two hours later there's a song up on your website
All about the tragedy and how you haven't slept right
And all sorts of other cliches and dry phrases
You're dancing on corpses hoping to get famous
... Go ahead and cash in your anti-war songs sucks
Tell me goodbye since you cannot rely
On sympathy from me cause my tear ducts are dry
Look in my head for the sadness you seek
But you won't find a piece that will make you complete
How can I eat such a harmless animal
It's easy first I kill it then I throw it on the grill
You think I got time to give a fuck about disorder
When the doctor got me overmedicated on these pills
Call me a labrat, call me apathetic
Call me anything you want, call me everything you will
Just let me have one single day to myself
So I can fantasize that the chaos is not real
And...
Tell me goodbye since you cannot rely
On sympathy from me cause my tear ducts are dry
Look in my head for the sadness you seek
But you won't find a piece that will make you complete
Stand there with your ball and chain
Bitch about what you created
All caught up in the masquerade
You've already been paid and made it
So don't pretend to know what it's like
To feel the things that we must live through
You only see with your dying eyes
There's only one thing I will ask of you
Can you take this life
Can you make this right
Do you have the words to say
To make it all go away
You act so wise and so refined
Keep your bullshit lies 'cause I'm
Never gonna go your way
Promises of a better life
But what's wrong with the one I'm leading
Everyone has a different fight
A different wound that keeps them bleeding
So what's wrong with a little fun?
Everybody needs to find their something
Is this how you're gonna treat your son?
Fuck 'em up and give him nothing
Everybody needs to find their own way through life,
Everybody needs to find their own way
Everybody needs to find their own way through life
Everybody needs to find their own way
Gotta make this money and I make this money
This money is me this money is everything I do and see
Who are you to judge me
Just let me be and let me breathe
I see this whole world headin' for damnation and I'm ready to leave
I can't believe, this whole world twisted me
You fuckin' biggots, you fakes, you wanna-be's
I see the future and it's lookin' grim
A lake of fire lookin' looking like a long trip
I'm a fist of rage
One foot in the grave
I'm a fist of rage
Far from saved
I'm a fist of rage
In a broken state
I'm a razor blade slittin' through a wrist of hate
I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage
Now crack another bottle and let me knock one back
Slim Jim's and a Tin Man grins deadhead's with dreads
And now the Feds growin' shark fins
My girl's knocked up we're in love
But she's young and yo I think I'm gonna get locked up
I couldn't cut the mustard with a Ginsue (sp?)
And I'm twisted brown from all of the bullshit that I've been through
I'm lookin' for love, but it's got too many damn faces
I can't win... even with these four aces
My place is here... in the mix... with tricks
And the sickos... I spend G's but only make nickles
My soul tickles, but this ain't even fun and games
My heart bleeds from the pleasure of the pain
My fuse is short and it's lit
Like me I should have fought sketchy... it's gettin' hard to see
My heart bleeds... believe in every dying breath
These people they take and they take until there's nothing left
I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage
One foot in the grave
I'm a fist of rage
Far from saved
I'm a fist of rage
In a broken state
I'm a razor blade slittin' through a wrist of hate
Come on
You're feeling old with me you're up a creek and you don't know it
Finger on the trigger but your punk ass is scared to pull it
And I know it...'cause the fear you hide your eyes show it
Payback on your ass 'cause you're over due and I know I owe it
And when you're going down bet I'll be blowing up
With the sound of a shotgun cocked and realized you're fucked
I hope you see my middle finger from the stage
Feel me coming feel me coming feel me coming
I'm a fist of rage
One foot in the grave
I'm a fist of rage
Far from saved
I'm a fist of rage
In a broken state
I'm a razor blade slittin' through a wrist of hate
I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage
I'm a fist of rage
Is there something wrong with me?
Ripping through the walls
Tearing at the doors of education
Not that it's my fault
I just can't help but sort
Through the pieces
Secluded from the whore
I focus at the board - I'm out of focus
There must be a way
There's got to be a way to overcome this
It's these words and music
That keeps me living, keeps me breathing
It may not be much
But this is all I got
And I'm smiling
It all seems so pointless
The hours seem so endless
And for what?
I'd rather be working
Breaking my back doing something
At least Ihave my brothers, my band and my lover
What more could I need?
I buried my friend the other day
And I saw my life in a different way
It was a cold afternoon for a funeral
I did not shed a tear as I watched the snow fall
Is there something wrong with me?
When did I become this empty?
As I gazed down at his grave
I knew that someday I'd end up
That way!
A little older, little wiser
With every breath I learn just a little more
And with all I've seen, I've finally made up my mind
Enough of this world
Enough blood in these eyes
So, so, so sick of this life
It's about time that I realized
Release this hate from inside
Enough blood in my eyes
Call it what you will
Call it suicide
Disregard how you feel
I'm just freeing my mind
Clench my teeth as I sleep
So, so, so sick of this life
Cannot take, cannot fake
Can't shake this blood from these eyes
All I have and all I will be
Nevertheless I'll live for all eternity
'Cause you can't erase my words, can't erase my mind
You can't wipe out my thoughts
Can't shake this blood from my eyes
So, so, so don't even try
Just give me one good reason to live
I'll give you three to die
Let's leave this world behind
Gas chamber!
Where's the light?
Stay at home
Don't feel right
I'm in my room
All the time
Trapped inside
This twisted mind
Gas chamber!
Cannot breathe
Time for lunch
Cannot leave
I'm in my room
All the time
I'm trapped inside
This fucking mind!
No action
No no!
No action
Gas chamber
No
No action!
Smoke my hoochie, you say that I'm the Devil, reali T.H.C.
Marco Polo hailed it heaven, Socrates inhaled it, too.
Mister President, tell the truth.
You're the great exaggerators since 1932.
Telling evils of the reefer, but all through time we've smoked the sky.
Smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the, when inside we'll toke the, when inside we'll smoke
The sky.
Home grown vision compliments the senses, opens up my mind.
J.F.K. sold us freedom, or was it just a business toke?
63 went up in smoke.
He was the great seducer crawling from our TVs.
Breathed hope into our future, before he died, he smoked the sky,
Smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the, when inside we'll toke the, when inside we'll smoke
The sky.
B.C. hailed it heaven, I inhaled it, too.
Reali T.H.C.
When inside we'll smoke the sky.
Smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the sky.
When inside we'll smoke the, when inside we'll toke the, when inside we'll smoke
And I wonder if you ever think about me anymore
And I wonder if you ever think about me when you're bored
And I wonder if you ever think about me when you're hangin' in New York
And I wonder if you still think Bono writes his songs for you
And I wonder if the reasons why you left me were untrue
And I wonder if you give him more excuses than the ones I got from you
Because...
Girl you mean
So much to me
I wish that we...
Could start it over, start it over
I don't need your sympathy or apologies
Still I'm staring in my coffee cup at six a.m.
And I cannot give... up
And I wonder if you're happy or just glad to see me scarred
Did he buy your heart with visa, or his platnum master card
I am bending over backwards to get close to you but still I feel so far
Because...
Girl you mean
So much to me
I wish that we...
Could start it over, start it over
I don't need your sympathy or apologies
Still I'm staring in my coffe cup at six a.m.
And I cannot give... up
Girl you mean
So much to me
I wish that we could start it over
I don't need your sympathy or apologies
...Anymore
Girl you mean
So much to me
I wish that we...
Could start it over, start it over
I don't need your sympathy or apologies
I just want you here with me
In a face a view, through eyes this world collides
I am voiceless in my angst
And nothing can take us back to innocence
Short, sharp, bloodlust reality
In despair I reach for night
In water purity reigns to be resolute
And as a land we clean our minds, reap our belongings
Sew our angers and our strengths
All too obsessed by weakness
We have brought ourselves to meaninglessness
So easy to control, bring to harm
A gathering of fools unjustified, on a mountain
And I collect my thoughts
And I rise above all that despises me
Comprehend the ways of man and under a flag
We salute or burn, there is blood on both shores
With hardened mind I traveled, with hardened mind I conquered 
A freedom so ironic, so despicable, so hypocritical
There is anger resolute
Rears its familiar head on the TV screen
In a dozen bags a life was placed
In a breath he smiled and waved
For five minutes at a time the power held true
And without consternation our laws are lost
Lost to butchers, lost to child killers, lost to narcotic ritual
Another tag, another headline
Another smiling photograph shall stay 10 winters long forever
And where are the angels to guard?
Where is the god of men and children?
He is stalking the minds of dark poor souls
And I know it's right, because I know it's time for freedom
To kill another and to kill another
And to kill another child of the flag
'Til there are none left... and another
And to kill another, and to kill another...
Gaze upon what you've become
And take a look at what you've done
You'll repent for what you've done
Raping my daughter, raping my son
From the movie Pitch Black:
They say most of your brain shuts down in cryosleep.
All but the primitive side - the animal side.
No wonder I'm still awake.
From the movie Ghost in the Shell:
To humans is it like staring at the sun, a blinding brightness that conceals a source of great power.
Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't apologize so much
That it's jive it's a crutch
I just used when I'm judged
Bein' fudged by a face I can't erase and can't see
'Cause I misplaced a dossier or Monty Python CD
Or somethin' stupid like that
But Jesus is that so bad
To make my ego go splat
Like a tire goin' flat
Or fat on a big mac
I'm bein' attacked
Tit for tat
You fuckin' bureaucrats
You can just apologize back
But I don't know when it comes and it goes
All the highs and the lows
In this motionless psychosis
Ieeieei and I die fadin' straight away
Ieeieei and I cry every waking day
I don't know what else to say
I'm sorry for the mess
The stupid way I'm dressed
I guess I failed my test
Oh don't you know I'm sorry for my views
I musta been confused
And yet you know that really I'm sorry for you
Well now I don't mean to offend, much
Just comprehend
When you're female and you're fenced in and
Phen-phened to no end
And no zen guide to men will help you fend off the brethren
And then the pen appears
And better than the oxygen network
Or the sword or the spear or the fork
Or the bored pork-fed horde
It's a mooring post
The whore you'll miss the most when you're away
When you're in Snowshoe PA
Doin' some play from Backstage
That deals with AIDS and race and gays and
Relationships and ballet
And then you're like "hey yay what'd you say?
I can just sing my troubles away?"?
But then you're fucked
'Cause you gotta make a buck
And the whole world sucks
And you're like a lame duck
That's lyin' dyin' tryin' to sell out
But there's no one buyin' and there's all this doubt
And you can preen and dream and scream and shot
But your life's affliction is the fiction of Faust
But I don't know when it comes and it goes
All the highs and the lows
In this motionless psychosis
Ieeieei and I die fadin' straight away
Ieeieei and I cry every waking day
I don't know what else to say
I'm sorry for the time
The stupid way I rhyme
I knew I shoulda chose a life of crime
I'm sorry for my blues
I guess it's all old news
And yet you know that really I'm sorry for you
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
I also mirror this apology
This ideology of sorry
In part of the liberal theology that's leading us to hari-kari
It's like a mythology, almost
Like a malingering ghost
As we slowly decompose
Writing in the grave of the polls
Cryin' for Senator Wellstone and then proceeding to moan
At our own supposed sabotage of the elections at home
"Oh somebody phone home!
The American people have spoken!"?
Now is that certain?
Maybe those nice Midwestern folks were just jokin'
In any case there's no use in dopin' chokin' mopin' and sobbin'
Come on you disheartenin' dobbins
Sayin' sorry is my problem
So to conclude
I'm a little of a prude
So it's difficult for me to have to allude
To all this rude crude verbal baggage
But I manage 'cause I'm a savage inside
I may listen to Enya's greatest hits
And try to control my hissy fits with pride
Won't get my hair dyed
But oh the onus of lyin' all the time
I don't wanna say, "diiiie motherfucker!"?
But I wouldn't mind if you did
Janet Reno has no ego when devoured by the id
And so before I flip my lid my crib
And get myself out of this bind
You can hear what's on my lips but you don't know
What's in my mind
I'm sorry for the time
The stupid way I rhyme
I knew I shoulda chose a life of crime
I'm sorry for my blues
I guess it's all old news
And yet you know that really I'm sorry for you
I'm sorry for you I'm sorry for you
Aww, I'm sorry
Eh shit
Sensation washes over me
I can't describe it
Pain I felt so long ago
I don't remember
Tear a hole so I can see
My devastation
Feelings from so long ago
I don't remember
Holding on to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind
The mask this time
And try to believe
Blind your eyes to what you see
You can't embrace it
Leave it well enough alone
And don't remember
Cut your pride and watch it bleed
You can't deny it
Pain you know you can't ignore
I don't remember
Holding on to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind
The mask this time
And try to believe
If I can
Remember
To know this will
Conquer me
If I can
Just walk alone
And try to escape
Into me
Sensation washes over me, I can't describe it
Pain I felt so long ago, I don't remember
I'm just holding on to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind
The mask this time
And try to believe
If I can
Remember
To know this will
Conquer me
If I can
Just walk alone
And try to escape
Into me
Into me
Into me
My name.
This is my day.
The time to shine.
I can see the end.
From six stops away.
Money buys you beds but it can't buy sleep.
I'm almost sorry that I must do this to get my name in lights.
But this is my chance and I'm going to take it.
Don't forget my name.
This is the most important day of your life.
How does it feel to know that I'm a part of it.
This is the most important day of your life.
This is my day in the sun.
Don't you forget.
My name.
This is my day.
The time to shine.
I hate you all more than you will ever know.
How does it feel to know you will be destroyed?
The words rolled off those pretty lips.
More at nine.
I'm the bastard blue line cretin.
I, the destroyer.
I, the cripple.
The disabled.
I am your end.
Now we're at the end and it's over now.
Money buys you 'friends' but it won't buy you fame.
Not like this, anyway.
Right now!
Lock up your doubt
Ride out!
All five are here for you
Fight now
Bury you hurt
Ride out!
Five young punks for you!
How come it's always up to me and you?
Neon
Lights in our eyes
Fear us!
We're not afraid of you!
Black out!
Tear us apart
Riot!
We fightin here for you!
How come it's always up to me and you?
Didn't take you long boy to stop from being a friend
I hope you hear this song boy 'cause I want your life to end
And as I lie awake now crying and bereaving
I guess you're happy somehow 'cause you made me stop believing
Die Taylor, die, you ain't no friend of mine
You're a scum-sucking shitty guy, so die Taylor, die
You stabbed me in the back, you're lower than a snake
Your brains are in your sac, you two faced fucking fake
You haven't even tried to tell me how it feels
I guess that's just your style to you it ain't no big deal
Die Taylor, die, you ain't no friend of mine
You're a scum-sucking shitty guy, so die Taylor, die
Did you ever think you'd get away with it
Your attitude just stinks, you cowardly little shit
Consider this a spell and watch where you tread
And I'll see you in hell, I'll be laughing 'cause you're dead
Die Taylor, die, you ain't no friend of mine
You're a scum-sucking shitty guy, so die Taylor, die
Die Taylor, die, you ain't no friend of mine
You're a scum-sucking shitty guy, so die Taylor, die
Hardly waiting till the bed was warm
You close your eyes and said "I'm feeling torn"
How could I be so unindeemly forced into this chorus
I'm sad, I feel sad
For you, so sad
You'll be left alone, and broken bleeding
From the heart, when he doesn't come home
Softly sighs my nightingale
Another broken promise tips the scale and it goes pale
He seems shifting from side to side
Can't make up his god given mind, no
Why don't you just go if she's waiting
Whoa oh honey, you better think about it
So resented, so disliked
So involved in all the wrong fights
Overbearing influence
Not endearing to any one
Wealth and power crashing through
Wealth empowers its own views
Wealth and power crashing in
On the warpath once again
So resented, so disliked
So involved in all the wrong fights
Domination won't win friends
Just gives rise to hostile trends
It feels good to see freedom excepted
But by free thought, not a gun to the head
It feels good to see freedom embraced
But by strong folk, not a puppets feeble imitation
Relentless (4x)
Wealth and power crashing through
Wealth impoeses its own views
Wealth and power crashing in
On the warpath, unrelenting
The only good thing that's creeping in this city
Elvis had 55 but this one is mine
Japanese cars man such a pity
A.M. Radio suits me fine

We've got the method of groove that grabbed your attention
Now that you're aware we're gonna give you the message
My father taught me many things
Living deaf, dumb and blind will get you nothing
SO listen up and hear what I have to say
It's never too late to learn in this day and age
We'll point you in a new direction
Passed down to this generation
If you've learned anything from me
It would be to hold on to your dreams
Learn from my mistakes
And it will take off some of the weight
He said, "You got your whole life to live,
And so much more to give
Never compromise and you will never live a lie."
He said, "Son, remember where you came from."
We never doubted ourselves for a minute
Oh they may criticize and compromise, but we were always in it
So come on down and see what this is all about
It's in our soul, on the road, wherever we may go
So wake up, nothing can stop us
We got the chaos so just let us
Provide the lines that make your mind spend the time
Think before you sink to the bottom
He said, "Son, remember where you came from."
I've stood by, and I've eried,
While my friends have died
You ever had a friend kill
Themselves, shot down, or
Knifed?
Just when I think it's happened
For the final time,
It comes knocking back again to
Devastate my life
20 years of hell
20 years of hell
For I've been living far too long
And I wish my life was done
I said, "Good-bye" to you, on a
Summer's night
Now I wish that I had stayed
With you but, oh it's too late
Next thing I knew was that
You'd been in an attack
And you were laying in a cold
Morgue stuffed into a body bag
I saw you last night you said I
Was wrong
And where'd I get the idea you
Were gone?
I woke up to sounds of my own
Screams
I woke up in a sweat it was just
A dream
And that dream goes on and on
And on...
With it ever end? Well I don't... I
Don't know
I don't ... know...
You don't know me, no you don't know a thing about love or life in between
I'm screaming through your door
Leave me tonight
How could you mean that she said
Oh I turn my back, my eyes full red
I don't believe that she said, you're out of your mind
I don't know why, all I need is someone to save me, I believe
I don't know why, all I need is someone to save me, I believe,
I don't know why
You turn on me, and left me alone with my fate
I know id leave myself inside
I can't stop that fight
How could you mean that she said, oh you turn my eyes so full of red
I don't believe that she said, you're out of your mind
Yeah
I don't know why all I need is someone to save me
I believe I don't know why all I need is someone to save me
I believe
What about those times you left me alone in the bed, well I didn't mean it
All of those nights you swore that you'd call when you didn't
Well I didn't mean it
All of those times you tore me down and said, well I didn't mean it,
What about the times you told me you wish you were dead
I did mean it
Why all I need is someone to save me I believe
I don't know why all I need is someone to save me, I believe and I don't know why
Why
I don't know why
Why

Do I have to put the law on you baby
For all the wicked thing you do
Am I gonna have to put the law on you baby
That was not what I wanted to do
Do I have to put the law on you baby
To try to make you come out clean
For every evil deed
You're just about the lowest
And the dirtiest thing I've ever seen
Did you really think you could pull it off
The perfect crime, crime of the heart
Do you really think you'll get away
Do the crime and never pay
Do I have to put the law on you baby
Lock you up and throw away the key
For the countless counts of low down double-cross
You've been about
Have you no decency
Did you really think that you could pull it off
The perfect crime, crime of the heart
Do you really think that you'll get away
Escape my justice until your dying day
Though you made it clear from the very start
There was no trusting you with my foolish heart
Though you maybe made it clear
That didn't make it right
So you really think you'll get away
You can't escape my justice till my dying day
Dirty little secret, dirty little lies
Say your prayers and comb your hair
Save your soul tonight
Drift among the faithful, bury your desires
Aberrations fill your head
You need a place to hide and I am
Do you remember me?
And the kid I used to be?
Do you remember me?
When your world comes crashing down, I want to be there
(Your God is looking down on me)
I'm not Jesus, Jesus wasn't there
You confess it all away but it's only shit to me
(Your God is looking down on me)
I'm not Jesus, I will not forgive
No, I won't
No, I won't
I thought you were a good man
I thought you talked to God
You Hippocratic, messianic
Child abusing-turned-satanic
Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?
And the kid I used to be?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
When your whole world comes undone, let me be the one to say
(Your God is looking down on me)
"I'm not Jesus, you can't run away"
And the innocence you spoiled found a way to live
(Your God is looking down on me)
I'm not Jesus, I will not forgive
I will not forgive
I won't be whatever you wanted
I will not forgive
I won't be whatever you wanted
Do you remember me?
And the kid I used to be?
Not the same as I used to be
Oh, do you remember my name?
When your world comes crashing down, I want to be there
(Your God is looking down on me)
I'm not Jesus, Jesus wasn't fair
You confess it all away but it's only shit to me
(Your God is looking down on me)
I'm not Jesus, I will not
I'm not Jesus, I will not forgive
Oh, I will not forgive
No, I will not forgive
And I'll tell you something else right now. I have the solution to the drug problem in this country. Nobody wants to hear it, but I have it. Not less drugs... more drugs. Get more drugs, and give 'em to the right fucking people. Mmm mm, 'cause every time you hear about some famous guy overdosing on drugs, it's always some really talented guy. It's always like Len Bias, or Janis Joplin, or Jimi Hendrix, or John Belushi. You know what I mean? The people you wanna have overdose on drugs never would! Like Motley Crue would never fucking overdose man, never! You could put them in a room with two tons of crack. They come out a half an hour later, "Rock on, man!" "Shit, they're still alive. Fuck! They're probably gonna make a double live album now, goddamn it!"
I take music pretty seriously. You see that scar on my wrist? You see that? Hmm? You know where that's from? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? I heard the Bee Gees were getting back together again. I couldn't take it, okay? That was the only good thing about the 1980's. We got rid of one of the Bee Gees. One down, three to go, that's what I say, folks. Yeah--here's ten bucks, bring me the head of Barry Manilow, all right? I wanna drink beer out of his empty head! I wanna have a Barry Manilow skull-keg party at my apartment, okay? You write the songs, we'll drink the beer out of your head.
We live in a country where John Lennon takes six bullets in the chest, Yoko Ono is standing right next to him and not one fucking bullet! Explain that to me! Explain it to me, God! Explain it to me, God! I want it explained to me now! Jesus! Now we've got twenty-five more years of "ah!" Yeah, I'm real fucking happy now, God. I'm wearing a huge happy hat, Jesus Christ! I mean... Stevie Ray Vaughan is dead, and we can't get Jon Bon Jovi in a helicopter? Come on, folks. "Get on that helicopter, Jon. Shut the fuck up and get on that helicopter! There's a hair dresser in there. Yeah, go ahead in there, yeah yeah."
I don't get it. You know, I just don't get it. I missed the fucking point some place. The boat left and I wasn't on the boat. Explain it to me. Heavy metal bands on trial because kids commit suicide? What is that about? Judas Priest on trial "because my kid bought the record, and listened to the lyrics, and he got into Satan..." Well, that's great! That sets a legal precedent. Does that mean I can sue Dan Fogelberg for making me into a pussy in the mid-70's? Is that possible, huh? Huh? "Your Honor, between him and James Taylor, I didn't get a blow job till I was twenty-seven years old. I was in Colorado wearing hiking boots, eating granola. I want some fucking money right now!"
Let me make sure I'm crystal clear on this issue, okay? Heavy metal fans are buying heavy metal records, taking the records home, listening to the records, and then blowing their heads off with shotguns? Where's the problem? That's an unemployment solution right there, folks! It's called natural selection. It's the bottom of the fuckin' food chain, okay? I say we put more messages on the records. "Kill the band, kill your parents, then yourself, okay? Make sure you get your whole head in front of the shotgun. Thank you for calling! Thank you for calling!"
And I'll tell you something else I don't get, okay? This whole thing-- these bands going backwards, you know what I'm talking about? This whole nostalgia for the late '60s, the early '70s that's happening right now? The Black Crowes wearing bell bottoms again? I DON'T FUCKING THINK SO, okay? I wore 'em once, they sucked, they didn't get laid, I'm not wearing them again!
Let me tell you something. We need a two-and-a-half hour movie about the Doors, folks? No, we don't. I can sum it up for you in five seconds, okay? "I'm drunk, I'm nobody. I'm drunk, I'm famous. I'm drunk, I'm fucking dead." There's the whole movie, okay? Big Fat Dead Buy in a Bath Tub, there's your title for you.
And I also don't go for this other thing now, with MTV being so big where you get a band that gets a hit video, and all of the sudden they think that they're like icons and they can tell us how to feel about environmental issues and how to vote and stuff. You know what I'm talking about? Like R.E.M.? "Shiny happy people--" Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey! Pull that bus over to the side of the pretentiousness turnpike, all right? I want everybody off the bus. I want the shiny people over here, and the happy people over here, okay? I represent angry gun-toting meat-eating fucking people, all right? Sit down and shut the fuck up, Michael! Don Henley's gonna tell me how to vote. I don't fucking think so, okay? I got two words for Don Henley--Joe Fucking Walsh--okay? Thanks for calling, Don. How long's your pony tail now, okay?
All these rock stars should've been killed, man. Every single goddamn one of them. Right after Jon Lennon died, we should've gotten the Partridge Family bus and driven around and killed them all one by one, you know? Elvis Presley should have been shot in the head back in 1957. Somebody should've walked up behind Elvis in '57 with a .44 magnum, put the barrel of the gun right up to his brainstem and just pulled the trigger... so you can remember Elvis in a nice way, eh? Wouldn't it be nice to remember Elvis thin, with a big head of hair? Maybe that gold lamé suit. Wouldn't that be nice, eh? Because how do you remember Elvis? You know how you remember Elvis. He was found in the toilet... with his pants around his ankles and his big fat hairy sweaty King of Rock and Roll ass exposed to the world, and his final piece of kingly evidence floating in the toilet behind him! Ugh! Creepy! One of his aides had to walk in and go, "Dang, Elvis is dead. I'd better flush the toilet. (flush) Oh, man! I should've saved that! I coulda made some money off that! Dang, man! A ding dang doo!"
That's why I'm glad Jesus died when he did. Oh yeah. Because if he lived to be forty, he would've ended up like Elvis, come on! Oh yeah, he had that big entourage. Twelve guys willing to do whatever he wanted to do. He was famous already at that point. If he lived to be forty, he'd be walking around Jerusalem with a big fat beer gut and black side burns going, (in Elvis voice) "Damn, I'm the son of God. Gimme me a cheeseburger and French fries right now. Where's Mary Magdelene, I want a blow job now. Come on now! Fuck you, I'll turn you into a leper! Give me a cheeseburger now, goddammn it. Bluhah. Love me tender, love me true, empty my colostomy bag! Ah! Bluhah! Huhah! Oh, I think I shit my pants on that last 'huhah.' Change my diaper now! Huhah!"
I'm going to Hell for that bit. And you're all coming with me! And don't try to get out of it. "We didn't laugh at that bit, Jesus, please!" "Shut up! Get on the bus with Leary and Scorsese. You're going right to fucking Hell!" And you know what Hell is, folks. It's Andy Gibb, singing "Shadow Dancing," for eons and eons. And you have to wear orange plaid bell bottoms and sit next to the Bay City Rollers. "How you guys doing? This is gonna suck!"
I was reading an interview with Keith Richards in a magazine and in the interview Keith Richards intimated that kids should not do drugs. Keith Richards... says that kids should not do drugs. Keith, we can't do any more drugs because you already fucking did them all, all right? There's none left! We have to wait till you die and smoke your ashes! Jesus Christ! Talk about the pot and the fuckin' kettle!
Excuse me
Is it true what they say?
About guys who go out by themselves?
Is is true that they go home by themselves?
You've seen me dance here alone before
Is it tough to watch
Friday after Friday?
Bells are chiming for victory
There's a page back in history
45
They came back to the world that they fought for
Didn't turn out just like they thought
45
Here is a song to sing to do the measuring
What do you lose, what do you gain, what do you win?
Nine years later a child is born
There's a record, so you put it on
45
Nine years more, if we're lucky now
Nine-year-old puts his money down
45
Every scratch. every click, every heartbeat
Every breath that I held for you
45
There's a stack of shellac and vinyl
Which is yours now and which is mine?
45
Bass and treble heal every hurt
There's a rebel in a nylon shirt
But the words are a mystery, I've heard
'Til you turn it down to 33 and 1/3
'Cause it helps with the elocution
Corporations turn revolutions
45
So don't just weep and shed
Just change your name instead
What do you lose when it all goes to your head?
I heard something peculiar said:
Perhaps he's got a shot and now he's dead
45
Bells are chiming and tears are falling
It creeps up on you without a warning
45
Every scratch, every click, every heartbeat
Every breath that I bless
I'd be lost, I confess
45
I woke up late, guess I'm never really early
I hesitate, only to fail
I get so tired, of procrastinating
I need a change
I can't do this
I can't do this
I can't do this by myself
I can't do this
I can't do this
Oh God, I need your help
I'm standing still, moved so peaceful
I can't pretend, that I'm fine
I get so ill, Crazy agitated
When I'm not really dying
I can't do this
I can't do this
I can't do this by myself
I can't do this
I can't do this
Oh God, I need your help
Press into me (Press into me)
Breathe the air (Breathe the air)
Bask in me (Bask in me)
You'll be free, to do anything
I can't do this
I can't do this
I can't do this by myself
I can't do this
I can't do this
Oh God, I need your help
I can't do this
I can't do this
I can't do this by myself
I can't do this
I can't do this
Oh God, I need your help
Jesus loves me, this I know
For the bible tells me so
Yes Jesus loves me, the bible tells me so
And how it fucks with my head
I set you free, on an island of flesh
Want to spell it
Carve "DEATH" across your face
We've got nothing left
There is nothing left to say,
I know it's killing you, it's a bitter taste
But it's just like me
You're just like me
You're just like me
I know there's nothing left to say
Just turn around and walk away
It's not the first time we've fucked it up
It's not the last time we'll fuck it up
I know there's nothing left to say
Just turn around and walk away
It's not the first time we've fucked it up
It's not the last time we'll fuck it up
Cause deep inside you're just like me
And it's killing you, killing you
Cause deep inside you're just like me
And it's killing you, killing you
We're making monsters, we created you
Feed you with you with hope, and abandoned you
Monsters with no free will, just copies, with an urge to kill
Abandoned you, created you, you're just like me
You're just like me
Cause deep inside you're just like me
And it's killing you, killing you
Cause deep inside you're just like me
And it's killing you, killing you
Cause deep inside you're just like me
And it's killing you, killing you
Cause deep inside you're just like me
And it's killing you, killing you
You're just like me
We're making monsters, we created you
Feed you with you with hope, and abandoned you
Monsters with no free will, just copies, with an urge to kill
Abandoned you, created you
Cause deep inside you're just like me
And it's killing you, killing you
Cause deep inside you're just like me
And it's killing you, killing you
Cause deep inside you're just like me
And it's killing you, killing you
Cause deep inside you're just like me
And it's killing you, killing you
You're just like me
You're just like me
When you reach the point
Is it different enough?
Tell me what it's like when you reach the point
When you draw the line
Is it straight enough?
Tell me what it's like when you draw the line
When you go too far
Is it near enough?
Tell me what it's like when you go too far
When you've seen too much
Is it almost the same?
Tell me what it's like when you've seen too much
When you know it all
Is it really there?
Tell me what it's like when you know it all
When you've had enough
Is it just the start?
Tell me what it's like when you've had enough
Collecting pieces of my family
In an old pillow case
This one has a skull
But it don't have a face
These look like the arms of father so strong
And the ring on this finger
Means my Grandmother's gone
Here's some legs in a pile
Where my sister once played
Here's some mud made of blood
And these teeth are decayed
The ear of my brother
The hand of a friend
And I just can't
Put them back together again
Pick up the bones
And set them on fire
Follow the smoke going higher and higher
Pick up the bones
And wish them goodnight
Pray them a prayer and turn out the light
There are stains on the floor
Where the kitchen once stood
There are ribs in the fireplace
Mixed with the wood
There are forces in the air
Ghosts in the wind
Some bullets in the back
And some scars on the skin
There were demons with guns
Who marched through this place
Killing everything that breathed
They're an inhuman race
There are holes in the walls
Bloody hair on the bricks
And the smell of this hell
Is making me sick
Pick up the bones
And set them on fire
Follow the smoke going higher and higher
Pick up the bones
And wish them goodnight
Pray them a prayer and turn out the light
Pick up the bones
And set them on fire
Follow the smoke going higher and higher
Pick up the bones
And wish them goodnight
Pray them a prayer and turn out the light
Now maybe someday
The suns gonna shine
Flowers will bloom
And all will be fine
But nothing will grow
On this burnt cursed ground
'Cause the breath of the death
Is the only sound
Wake me from my sleep
A cautionary tale
A walk in infancy
A way to derail
I wanted to be free
And I wanted only you
The walls are falling down
And somebody says
Ah give a little love
Give a little love
But take your time
A private life
C'mon now
I said livin'
Gets to be
Just like a rat race
Rat race
C'mon
I'm-a-read between the lines
Fierce struggler
A natural one
A tough job
Gets to be
Just like a rat race
Rat race
C'mon
I'm locked up in myself
Check before rinsing
Check before we work
Childproof the scene
No screams can be heard
The roof is caving in
The Space between our hearts
The walls are falling down
And somebody says
Ah give a little love
Give a little love
Take your time
Somebody sighs
Yes, a little love
Give a little love
But take your time
It's a rat, it's a rat, it's a rat race
It's a rat, it's a rat race
It's a rat, it's a rat, it's a rat race
It's a rat race
Ah life
Living in a rat race
C'mon
Hmm, life,
Are you living in a rat race?
C'mon
Here inside yourself
I'm a locked up in myself
I'm a locked up in myself
The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from Missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from hist'ry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly
They told Marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune
They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?
They all laughed at Rockefeller Center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar
Ford and his Lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, "Hello, Goodbye."
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie
They all said we'd never get together
Darling, let's take a bow
For ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh?
Hee, hee, hee!
Let's at the past laugh
Ha, ha, ha!
Who's got the last laugh now?
And you will hear yourself when the rain begins to fall.
Feel the fire
Burning inside us all.
Remove me
For going in unchained.
Blow away for yourself and gather again.
And, listen to the conversations of the sea.
Inside us all
There's a quiet beach.
If we fall into ourselves we will become free.
I myself could use a little clarity.
I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way.
I am so full of you.
I am so full of me.
I am so full of these words
That don't tell her a fucking thing.
I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way.
Then I opened up my mouth.
I'm a cloud.
And these words they seldom come out.
When I looked into her eyes I cared enough to wonder why
She'd want a cloud that's *floating around.*
But I feel it's time to say goodbye to fear.
And feel the fury of these tears
As they run down my face
I can feel her so far away.
'Cause I am a cloud.
And I am so afraid.
I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way.
So don't you come and gather at me in this haze.
I sit at home and feel the sun's daze.
*I should tell me not to little everyday.*
I blow away remaining unfazed.
When I feel the there's something crawling out of me
I'm just a cloud watching the moon rise.
These motherfuckers stepped on me,
Tried to fuck me from behiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind!
'Cause I am a cloud.
And I am so afraid.
And I... I am.
So... full of love.
I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way.
I am so full of you.
I am so full of me.
I am so full of these words
That don't tell her a fucking thing.
I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of these feelings
That tear me every which way.
I am... so full of love.
Love!
I am so full of love.
I am so full of hate.
I am so full of love.
I am so full of...
I feel upset, let's do some celebratin'
Come on honey, don't hesitate now
Needed you, you withdrew, I was so forsaken
Ah, but now the tables have turned, my move
I believe I'll be taking my revenge
Sweet revenge
I thought you were some perfect read-out
Some d-digital delay had obscured
And phased my view of the wicked hand you played
Ah, the sands and hands of time have run out
Run out, ah you better face it
Ah, this thing's run amok, this luck
I do know how to replace it with revenge
Oh, sweet revenge
I gave you a wristwatch, baby
You wouldn't even give me the time of day
Ah, you want to know what makes me tick
Now it's me that's got precious little to say
For the ghosts of our love have dried, have died
There's no use fakin' it
Ah, the spirit's gonna close in on you tonight
High time I was takin' my revenge
Sweet revenge
Revenge 
Revenge
All the gold and silver couldn't measure up my love for you, it's so immaterial
I wouldn't wait around if I was you, na, you're good but if you ain't team clean, nobody gets anything
Nobody gets nuthin', na, no time for kisses
Don't leave me no space in your little boat
You ain't gonna need
No you ain't gonna need no little boat
You're livin' on my time, my dear
Revenge 
Sweet revenge 
Sweet, sweet revenge
My brother's blood boils in my arms
It balls my fingers into fists
It bubbles, blisters, burns my palms
It floods with fury, fights and fits
It's got the good guy in me hiding 
It kicks my humble heart around
It's got me fiending for the fire
That could finish off this town.
My brother's blood on a cherry tree
It stains the bark from branch to root
It puddles thick with pits and leaves
It strains the sweetness from the fruit
It kept me looking for communion
A meeting point off underground
An empty plot I could climb into
An (iron) (lightening) cartoon promise in my mouth
A blackout oath I swore and meant
But couldn't conjure up again
I don't know one thing about my brother's blood
My brother's blood
In my dirty lungs
In my crooked mouth
On my swollen tongue
On my father's gun
In each stranger's face
Across the bluebird sky
On each hand I shake
Night after night
Each chuckled prayer
Such sweet relief
Fists full of hair
My brother's back
My father's arms
Each twisted fact
In my sorry heart
All that dialogue
Doubling back at me
All that tangled talk
All that growling need
And each desperate drive
For elusive peace
And each endless night
And each wasted week
I spit and scream "what's done is done
Go make your peace with everyone"
They don't need to know about my brother's blood.
Suck it down deeper
Oh, suck
A little bit deeper
Oh, suck
Go
Force my hand, I will sign anything
Just 'cause I'm lonely
Lay me down, please just do anything
Just 'cause I'm lonely
Sign your name, I won't tell anyone
Just 'cause I'm lonely
Steal my game, go on, take everything
Just 'cause I'm lonely
A little bit deeper
Oh, suck
Just one for the record
Oh, suck
Go
Give me your cash for questions
Because I am lonely
Sign your name, I won't tell anyone
Just 'cause I'm lonely
Steal my game, go on, take everything
Just 'cause I'm lonely
Give me your cash for questions
Because I am lonely
Make sure that you're watching
Oh, suck
I put it in deeper
Oh, suck
Go
Just 'cause I'm lonely, yeah, yeah
(Gibberish)
Just 'cause I'm lonely, yeah, yeah
(Gibberish)
Just 'cause I'm lonely, yeah
Get away, hey
Just 'cause I'm lonely, yeah, yeah
(Gibberish)
I said suck, suck suck
Suck, suck it, suck
Suck, suck, suck
Get away, suck
Tastes like a rainbow
You suck the life out of the crowd without a sound. 
I see your kind all around and of course you're all one in the same. 
You suck the light out of a room with merely a glance. 
You are the slave of a clone of a petrified fool on a throne. 
So shame on you. 
You're in a trance. You're in a trance. 
You betrayed me. 
You're in a trance. You're in a trance. 
You're not the same. 
You're in a trance. You're in a trance. 
You still need me. 
You're in a trance. You're in a trance. 
Be careful, we're watching and you can feel us stalking. 
We're patient and thorough. You'll never see us let go. 
You suck the life out of the new with all that you do. 
They are na've and are driven to find their own identity. 
You strip the joy out of their souls with all of your rules. 
You are the fashion of now and the sickening flavor of cool. 
So shame on you. 
You're in a trance. You're in a trance. 
You betrayed me. 
You're in a trance. You're in a trance. 
You're not the same. 
You're in a trance. You're in a trance. 
You still need me. 
You're in a trance. You're in a trance. 
Be careful, we're watching and you can feel us stalking. 
We're patient and thorough. You'll never see us let go. 
We'll tear your heart right out or your chest: you're already dead. 
You can surrender or savor the scent of your old victories. 
We'll steal the fire out of your eyes and turn it on you. 
We are the thorn in your side and the bullet to blow you apart. 
Blow you apart.
Hey, yo I don't even know you and I hate you
See all I know is that my girlfriend used to date you
How would you feel if she held you down and raped you?
Tried and tried, but she never could escape you
She was in love and I'd ask her how? I mean why?
What kind of love from a nigga would black your eye?
What kind of love from a nigga every night make you cry?
What kind of love from a nigga make you wish he would die?
I mean shit he bought you things and gave you diamond rings
But them things wasn't worth none of the pain that he'd bring
And you stayed, what made you fall for him?
That nigga had the power to make you crawl for him
I thought you was a doctor be on call for him
Smacked you down 'cause he said you was too tall for him, huh?
That wasn't love, babygirl you was dreamin'
I coulda killed you when you said your seed was growin' from his semen
1 - Love is blind
And It'll take over your mind
What you think is love is truly not
You need to elevate and find
I don't even know you and I'd kill you myself
You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf
Wouldn't let her go to school and better herself
She had a baby by yo
Ass and you ain't giving no help
Uh-huh big time hustler, snake mothafucka
One's born everyday and everyday she was your sucka
How could you beat the motha of your kids?
How could you tell her that you love her?
Don't give a fuck if she lived
She told me she would leave you, I admit it she did
But came back, made up a lie about you missing your kids
Sweet kisses, baby ain't even know she was your mistress
Had to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your bitches
Lost like, you possessed her, tellin' me to mind my business
That it was her life and stay the fuck out of it
I tried and said just for him I'll keep a ready clip
I don't even know you when I want you dead
Don't know yo facts but I saw the blood pour from her head
See I laid down beside her in the hospital bed
And about two hours later, doctor said she was dead
Had the nerve to show up at her mother's house the next day
To come and pay your respects and help the family pray
Even knelt down on one knee and let a tear drop
And before you had a chance to get up
You heard my gun cock
Prayin' to me now, I ain't God but I pretend
I ain't start your life but nigga I'm a bring it to an end
And I did, clear shots and no regrets never
Cops come and lock me under da jail
Nigga wheneva my bitch, fuck that my sister
You could never figure out even if I let you live
What our love was all about
I consider her my blood and it ain't come no thicka
Repeat 1 till end
The air comes off the ocean
The city smells fishy
The air is full of fish and mystery
Whispering who, what, when
I am warning you I am weightless
And the wind is always shifting
So don't hang anything on me
If you ever want to see it again
I am telling you I'm different than you
Think I am
And you can dangle your carrot
But I ain't gonna reach for it
'Cause I need both my hands
To play my guitar
And life is a sleazy stranger
Who looks vaguely familiar
Flirting with a bimbo named disaster
At the end of the bar
And I am telling you that I am different
Than you are
At night when you're asleep
Self hatred's going to creep in
You can try to blame it on the devil
The one who's bed you sleep in
And don't tell me what they did to you
As though you had no choice
Tell me, isn't that your picture?
Isn't that your voice?
If you don't live what you sing about
Your mirror is going to find out
Oh yeah
I'd like to go to all the pretty parties
Where all the pretty people go
And I ain't really all that pretty
But nobody will know
'Cause everybody loves you
When you're a star
And nobody questions
What it takes to go that far
And life is a sleazy stranger
And this is his favorite bar
No I don't prefer obscurity
But I'm an idealistic girl
And I wouldn't work for you
No matter what you paid
And I may not be able
To change the whole fucking world
But I could be the million
That you never made
Oh yeah
I could be the million that you never made
I could be the million that you'll never make
You're looking at the million that you'll never make
There's a rich boy
But he doesn't spend
He just drinks his Poland Spring
He's a quick boy walkin' round the bend
Or at home alone reading
And he tries to do good
And he tries to do right
So he does what he should
But he's got to subscribe
To the rules of the tribe
Now you're
Playin' for the team
Everybody loves to love a winner
And you're bustin' the beguine
Everybody knows you're no beginner
But ah the bums say oh
Things ain't what they seem
You're the respectable member of society
But you don't have nothin' on me
You gotcha east side certified pedigree
But you won't have nothin' you'll see
Because I warned you
They would scorn you
But you never did a thing
When you go in for the kill
Everybody wants to make it happen
And you make a hundred mil
Everybody wants to scratch your back then
But ah the freaks say oh
Things ain't what they seem
You're a respectable member of society
But you don't have nothin' on me
You gotcha uppercrust dinner tux sanctimony
But you won't have nothin' you'll see
Because I told you
They would mold you
But you never did a thing
Are you gonna tell
Are you gonna hide
Are you
Gonna join the crowd or split
Who are you payin'
Ah what are you sayin'
Are you gonna sell
Are you gonna buy
Are you gonna fizzle out or hit
Where are you layin'
Ah what are you sayin'
He's a grown man
And he wears a tie
And his laugh is hard and fast
He's a old man
Far before his time
And his jacket holds a flask
And he tried to do good
And he tried
To do right
So he did what he could
But he had to subscribe
To the rules of the tribe
Now you're lookin' for a queen
Everybody talks too much and argues
And it makes you wanna scream
Don't these little punks
Realize who they're talkin' to
But ah the scrubs say oh
Things ain't what they seem
You're a respectable member of society
But you don't have nothin' on me
You gotcha caterers and prada and your maitre'd
But you won't have nothin' you'll see
Because I warned you
They would burn you
But you never did a thing
You're the respectable members of society
But you don't have nothin' on me
You're the respectable members of society
You're so respectable
You're the respectable members of
You're so respectable
Ultimate, desolate condition of man
Laid to waste
Born again, dead again, once again
Take me out of this place
You're in violation, you cross the line
The line you found within your mind
And when the process come undone
You die alone, the victory's none
Hear the warning, the end's Beginning
When you break the circle, you have no right to live
It's the breaking of the circle right at the start
Which make this mother fall apart
In this division of the law
You're driven to the one last flaw
Heal these wounds
Terminal, criminal sedition of man
On the earth
Born Again, dead again, once again
Tyranny awaits rebirth
Greed kill the need and bleeds the lines
Now your brilliance no longer shines
Charred remains the way you feel
And still in time these wounds won't heal
When you kill the mother, there's no other
Hold on to your everybody
The people that you know are the ones you hate, the ones you hate
Break me you covetous creature
Then piece me back together like a star
Come on now, come on now
The bigger that you get the more you wait
Show me how, show me how
The less you know the better off you are
Covet love it learn to break
Want this my love your mistake
Show me you treacherous teacher
You own everything in your sight in your sight now
Possess that special feature
That everything you say and do is right
Come on now, come on now
And everyone does just what you say
Teach me how, teach me how
To get everyone the fuck out of your way
Covet love it learn to break
Want this my love your mistake
Covet love it learn to break
Want this my love your mistake
I learned just how to beat you
Cause everything you say just disappears
So glad I got to meet you
I covet everything you ever feared
Hold on now, hold on now
You taught me how to hate and how to hurt
Show me how, show me how
To spit in their faces with your dick in the dirt dear
Covet love it learn to rape
Want this my love your mistake
Tonight I'll see you
And I'll know just what to say
Tonight you'll be there
And I'll know just what to say
Tonight I'll meet you
And I'll know just what to do
But then I see you
And you split my head in two
With your pretty little face
Your pretty little eyes
Your pretty little legs
Your pretty little smile
Pretty little hips
Your pretty little thighs
Pretty little tits
Your pretty little eyes
Your pretty little
One day I'll see you
And I'll know just what to say
One day I'll see you
And I'll know just what to do
But now I see you
And I want to fly away
Yeah now you're right here
And I don't know what to do
With your pretty little face
Pretty little eyes
Pretty little legs
Your pretty little smile
Pretty little hips
Your pretty little thighs
Pretty little tits
Your pretty little eyes
Your pretty little face
Your pretty little eyes
Your pretty little legs
Your precious little smile
Your pretty little ass
Your juicy little thighs
Your lovely little tits
Your pretty little eyes

With your pretty little face

Your precious little smile
Precious little hips
Your juicy little thighs
Your lovely little tits
Your pretty little eyes

Your tiny little
Wai
Let's go
When you got her in the back seat
Driving down the back streets
Trying to block me out
(Do you remember my name?)
Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard 
Does it light up a spark?
(Do you remember my name?)
Is she a ride or die bitch?
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart?
You can try to fight it
I have left my mark on you
There is nothing you can do
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember)
I'm the ghost in your machine
Your real life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be hip, might be hot
But baby she's not me
She's not me
When you take her to Chateau Marmont
'Cause you've booked the top suite
Lay her on the bed
(Do you remember my name?)
Strip her down to her bare ass
In her Kiki Montparnasse
Like I used to have
(Do you remember my name?)
Is she a ride or die bitch?
Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did?
It won't be the same
It's can't
'Cause she don't compare to who I am
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember)
I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be hip, might be hot
But baby she's not me
You try to forget
And you tell her that you miss her
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get hot rush feeling on your lips
It's me taking over you
Throwing you a curveball
Reminding you of our true romance and
Just like the first time we went to dance and
I showed you all those moves she can't do
She's not me
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember)
I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be hip, might be hot
But baby she's not me
I don't know what's wrong with the youth of today
Wondering lost it's true what they say
And who is to blame?
TV and magazines,
They'd have you believe, everyday was halloween.
Why when I was a kid,
Playing in the ditches
Living in fear of Satan and the witches
The whole world was made of wood and smelled like gasoline
The days were atleast twice as long
And the grass was green.
Running for my life
I was cursed by a talking snake
I'd walk all day
And throw rocks across a bottomless lake.
There was a killer in the woods who would whistle
Once in a while I could hear him shoot his pistol
And the other kids hated me...
But like a murderer
I drove my self harder and harder
Blood in my eyes.
Scrubing to get the dirt off
Didn't say much didn't like to take my shirt off
Was quick
But I didn't know the meaning of pain yet
I'd visit father bob
And he would show me his train set
Tell me a story, offer me a glass of milk
Send me on my way with a question to ask myself
The rain didn't bother me
The search had meaning
Church was good but I'd rather be dreaming
High speed horse shoes harnneses and heavy string
Problem is today they've got an answer for everything
4-6-3 an x an o and I can't think of a better way to end the day
4-6-3 a punch a kick and I can't think of a better way to end the day
4-6-3 a yes a no and I can't think of a better way to end the day
4-6-3 it's life, death and I can't think of a better way to end the day
Learn the words
Turnin' the double play
Doing my damaging in my own subtle way
I've been all over
I've seen to much
I no longer feel the need to rush
I'm upside down I'm inside out
Broken glass all in my mouth
Cut wide open and everybody knew why
'Cause when it comes to rocking something fierce
Mmmm do I
4-6-3 an x an o and I can't think of a better way to end the day
4-6-3 a punch a kick and I can't think of a better way to end the day
4-6-3 a yes a no and I can't think of a better way to end the day
4-6-3 it's life, death and I can't think of a better way to end the day
I can't stand this anymore
When you scratch where you lay
There is nothing there
And I don't give a fuck
You can't hurt me anymore
Chope off me arm
There's a hole in my heart
And I don't give a fuck
Everyone I love
Everyne I trust
What's going to happen to all of us?
Seems like I've done something wrong
Well, let that punishment come
Hide the sun
I don't give a fuck
Scratching my nuts right at god
On second thought
There is no one there
And I don't give a fuck
Chope off me arm
There's a hole in my heart
I don't give a fuck
What is this world without pain?
Ain't a god damn thing
Just a rock flaoting
Through the universe
The world is a shitty place and I can't wait to die
(Just kidding world, you know I love you)
You are disposable means
And this is not what it seems
Untouchable
Controllable
Disposable
(I chose them all)
'Cause you need to censor your dreams

This song has not yet been released.
Been gone more days this year than I have been home
Trading friends for trips to the coast
This hotel room feels more like a tomb
Been gone more days this year than I have been home
Trading friends for trips to the coast
This hotel room feels more like a tomb
It's not gossip if it's the truth
I'm sick of always writing songs 
For you to slit your wrists to
So which is it
The boy who writes the songs or the boy who's in them?
Who's the girl? 
Is this truth or is he writing fiction?
Hand over my heart, gun to my head
I swear to God I'm through with this
I am the worst liar I know
It's not gossip if it's the truth
I'm sick of always writing songs for you to slit your wrists to

To the nines
Prepare myself fro drowning
Anytime
I made my own world
Losing it
I rob myself of everything
Destroying my body and my mind will fail
 
I drawn to the sound of broken glass
Drawn to the taste of broken glass
Stillborn again
 
Enemy
I see my own reflection
Look at me
I made my own wounds
Live alone
Survive in isolation
Poison my body and my mind will fail
Rev Jim Jones: Don't ever say hate is your enemy. Love has practically caused me to just get you destroyed. If I had hated a little more, just a little more, we would have had a little less trouble. Sure you got love. Principles! But don't say 'hate is my enemy', what'd they say, what's that words? "Hate is my enemy and I've got to fight it day and night" and "what else is death" is the line. Love is the only weapon, SHIT. BULLSHIT! Martin Luther King died with love! Kennedy died talking about something he couldn't even understand, some kind of generalized love, and he never even backed it up! He was shot down! Bullshit, "Love is the only weapon with which I got to fight". I've got a hell of a lot of weapons to fight! I got my claws, I got cutlasses, I got guns, I got dynamite, I got a hell of a lot of fight! I'll fight! I'll fight! I will fight! I will fight! I will fight! I will fight!
Let them hear it in the night! Yes, we'll fight! They're listening. Let the night roar! Let the night roar, because they can hear us, they know we mean it. We'll kill them if they come!
Mao Tse Tung said change must come
Change must come through the barrel of a gun
Not through talkin' and not through waitin'
And sittin' around just contemplatin' the facts
'Cause we know what they are
So let Mao Tse Tung be your guidin' star
Pick up a gun and learn how to fight
All through the day and all through the night
'Til come the day when the last fight's won
I want you to listen, son
'Cause Mao Tse Tung said change must come
Through the barrel of a gun
I want you to listen, son
Change must come
Change must come through the barrel of a gun
Mao Tse Tung said
Change must come
Mao Tse Tung said
Change must come
Mao Tse Tung said
Change must come
Change must come through the barrel of a gun
- Okay. What was the basic premise of Mao? Mao Tse Tung said there's only one way a revolution can come. Do you know, Millie? How did Mao Tse Tung say the only way you can bring a revolution and keep it?
- Where you- onliest way I think you can keep it is by being at peace and being honorable.
- Oh, shit, I ain't- no- "being at peace"? Mao Tse Tung said that?
- Oh-
- No no no no-
- Wait a minute- Oh-
- -He's the head of China. He's the head of the Revolution of China.
- No, I'm sorry.
- He marched 6000 people... on the Long March.
- I had my mind on something else.
- Okay then, wha- wha- what'd he say? There only one way you can bring about a revolution for people.
- Only way you can- only way you can bring it on, that by- is by killing.
- Well, what- yes, that's okay, I'm going to let you pass it -but what'd he say? He had a nice little phrase that everybody should know. "Change only comes-"
- Oh-
- You got it. "Change comes through..."
- "-Through- by a barrel of gun."
- That's right, senior. And that's good. 'Cause you, by rights, would have every reason to forget some things. "Change must come through the barrel of gun," said Mao Tse Tung. This place would be a paradise tomorrow if every department had a supervisor with a submachine gun.
Let them hear it in the night! Yes, we'll fight! Let the night roar, because they can hear us, they know we mean it. We'll kill them if they come!
Mao Tse Tung said
Change must come
Mao Tse Tung said
Change must come
Mao Tse Tung said
Change must come
Change must come through the barrel of a gun
Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby, bevor du gehst
Ich werde es erst glauben können, wenn du nicht mehr vor mir stehst
Jetzt ist es wohl soweit, du wirst nie mehr wiederkehren
Glaub mir, es tut sehr vielen leid all denen die dich so verehren
Deine Ketten sind verschweißt, keiner wird dich wiedersehen
Jetzt wo du für immer verreist, werd ich noch mal zu dir gehen
Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby, bevor du gehst
Ich werde es erst glauben können, wenn du nicht mehr vor mir stehst
Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby, bevor du gehst
Ich werde es erst glauben können, wenn du nicht mehr vor mir stehst
Damit musstest du rechnen, nicht nur ich hab es geahnt
Denn du hast nicht den deinen Taten entsprechenden Weg für dich gebahnt
Wie doch alle an dich glaubten, alle strömten zu dir
Die, die so viele beraubten, teilten mit dir ihre Gier
Herr, lass mich auch mit denen streiten
Die ihr ewigen Ruhm prophezeiten, denn sie logen und phantasierten, 
Für die, die mit ihr die Welt regieren
Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby, bevor du gehst
Ich werde es erst glauben können, wenn du nicht mehr vor mir stehst
Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby, bevor du gehst
Ich werde es erst glauben können, wenn du nicht mehr vor mir stehst
Jetzt steht bald keiner mehr für dich ein
Du bist Tag und Nacht allein
Es kann nur noch wenig, sehr wenig Leben in dir sein
Die Verkäufer und die Käufer deiner Waren, sieh sie dir an
Denn jetzt fliehen sie im Scharen
Sie sind ihres klaren Verstandes beraubt
Denn sie hatten mit der Sicherheit des Todes so fest an dich geglaubt
Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby, bevor du gehst
Ich werde es erst glauben können, wenn du nicht mehr vor mir stehst
Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby, bevor du gehst
Ich werde es erst glauben können, wenn du nicht mehr vor mir stehst
It breaks my heart
To know the eyes you stare at me with aren't honest.
It breaks my heart
To know the words you speak to me aren't honest.
Can I ever truly forgive you?
Can I ever fully believe you?
Wear your disguise and I see right through.
I hate you.
You know I hate you.
Tell all your lies while I bleed right through.
I hate you.
I fucking hate you.
How can you tell me
You came to me faithfully?
How can you tell me
No it's not all true?
How can you look
In my eyes and tell lie after lie after lie
And make me a fool?
Can I ever truly forgive you?
Can I ever fully believe you?
Wear your disguise and I see right through.
I hate you.
You know I hate you.
Tell all your lies while I bleed right through.
I hate you.
I fucking hate you.
You break my heart
To know the eyes you stare at me with aren't honest.
You break my heart
To know the words you speak to me aren't honest.
Can I ever truly forgive you?
Can I ever fully believe you?
Wear your disguise and I see right through.
I hate you.
You know I hate you.
Tell all your lies while I bleed right through.
I hate you.
I fucking hate you.
You broke my heart.
From day one I could not comprehend
Was it us, was it me or was it them?
Friends will come and go as it seems
And now I have no shoulder on which to lean
Still I do not understand
You break your back for something
Well where's the fans?
Show me respect
And I'll (show me)
Show you right back
Show me respect
And I'll (show me)
Show you right back
I see the boys that I once called my friends
They'll fake a smile and then they'll shake your hand
When will this ever end?
I look around at my brothers
My only true friends
Show me respect
And I'll (show me)
Show you right back
Show me respect
And I'll (show me)
Show you right back
You got a lot to learn my friend
You've got a lot to learn about respect
You got a lot to learn my friend
You've got a lot to learn about respect
I'd give you the world
If it would mean anytihng
Despite your reaction
I can't help but believe
That maybe inside
You feel the same
I'm killed by the question
That surrounds your name
Do you feel the way I do?
So break my wings and watch me fall
'Cause I'm broken
When I look at you
And if I cut myself would you bleed too
Would you feel everything I do
Would you feel the way I do
I'm falling apart
It's like so hard to see
I didn't give you my heart
You just took it from me
This feeling of anger
It just won't go away
I'd give anything
Just to hear you say
Do you feel the way I do?
So break my wings and watch me fall
'Cause I'm broken
When I look at you
And if I cut myself would you bleed too
Would you feel everything I do
Would you feel the way I do
Can you feel it inside yourself
What would you feel
Would you feel it in your heart
Can you feel this inside
The pain that won't go away
So break my wings and watch me fall
I'm broken
When I look at you
And if I cut myself would you bleed too
Would you feel everything I do
Would you feel the way I do
Would you feel the way I do
sung:
I will not rhyme on tracks
Niggas on a chain gang used to do that (Huh!) way back
I will not rhyme over tracks
Niggas on a chain gang used to do that (Huh!) way back
Don't drop the beat on me
Don't drop the beat no
Ah
I am not the son of sha-klak klak
I am before that
I am before
I am before before before death is eternity after death is eternity
There is no death there's only eternity
And I be riding on the wings of eternity like
Cla cla cla sha klack klack
Get me the fuck off this track
As if the heart beat wasn't enough
They got us using drum machines now
The hums of the machines
Tryin' to make our drums humdrums
Tryin' to ???? our magic
Insturments be political prisioners up inside computers
As if the heart were not enough
As if the heart were not enough
And as heart beats bring percussions
Fallen trees bring reprocussions
Citys play upon our souls like broken drums
Redrum the essence of creation from city slums
But city slums mute our drums and our drums become humdrums
'Cause city slums have never been where our drums are from
Just the place where our daughters and sons become
Offbeat heartbeats
Slaves to city streets
And hearts get broken and heartbeats stop
Broken heartbeats become breakbeats for niggas to rhyme on top, but...
I won't rhyme on top no tracks
Niggas on a chain gang used to do that (Huh) way back
I won't rhyme over tracks
Niggas on a chain gang used to do that (Huh) way back
Don't drop the beat no
Don't drop the beat no
Not until you've listen to Rakim on a rocky mountain top
Have you heard hip hop
Extract the urban element which created it
And let a open wide country side illustrate it
Riding in a freight train
In the freezing rain
Listening to Coltrane
My reality went insane
And I think I saw Jesus
He was playing hopscotch with Betty Carter
Who was cursing him out
In a scat-like gibberish for not saying 'butterfingers'
And my fingers run through grains of sand
Like seeds of time
The pains of man
The frames of mind
Which built these frames
Which is the structure of my urban superstructure
The trains and planes can corrupt and obstruct your planes of thought
So you that forget how to walk through the woods
Which ain't good 'cause you ain't never walked through the trees
Listenin' to nobody beats the biz and you ain't never heard hip hop
And you must stop that damn track from going...
Please don't drop the beat
Don't drop the beat no
And...
I will not rhyme on tracks
Niggas on a chain gang used to that (huh) way back
(Repeat)
Don't drop the beat no
Don't drop the beat no
Don't drop the beat no
Don't drop the beat
...Heartbeat
My heartbeat
Goes on
And on
And on...
Yeah
Sailing through
Your disease and you. your disease and you
Your body like a basket
Shivering in static for us in this place of angry tears
All those years you were alive inside the closet
But nobody in it there but me
But now you are coming
Life is off running
You're tearing yourself apart at the seams
And You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar
You are a liar
Now I'm off sailing
Sickness inhaling
Every drop of blood you could bleed
The world is all coming
They're Coming of millions
The billions of people to sick to believe
And I really wanted just to be in your body
To be in your body
To be inside you
I really wanted to be in your body
To share in your sickness
The shield around you
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a liar
Wrapped you up in masters
They Cover you in plaster
They Spit in your mouth and then say I love you
Is this supposed to save us
Is this supposed to break us
Into the toilet without faces removed
And I really wanted just be in your body
If I could only be in your body
If I could only be inside you
I really wanted to be in your body
Into the toilet with faces removed
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar you are a liar
And you are a liar
The morning after
Still hear your laughter
Why can't we sleep always?
The party's over
I'm gettin' sober
Why can't we sleep always?
You better believe - you sucker!
You better believe - you sucker!
You better believe - you sucker!
You better believe - you sucker!
Ready to softly kill my pain
Ready to slightly lose my brain
Ready to softly kill my pain
Ready to slightly go insane
And while I'm dreaming
Still hear you screaming
Why can't we sleep always?
I'm so relendless
But nothing's endless
Why can't we sleep always?
You better believe - you sucker!
You better believe - you sucker!
You better believe - you sucker!
You better believe - you sucker!
Ready to softly kill my pain
Ready to slightly lose my brain
Ready to softly kill my pain
Ready to slightly go insane
I feel it slipping away
I feel it slipping away
I gave it all
But no one cared
I feel it slipping away
I feel it slipping away
My god it's slipping away
I gave it all
But no one cared
I feel it slipping away
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping away
I feel it slipping away
I feel it slipping away
No more pain
No more fear
I feel it slipping away
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping away
I just can't learn to forget
Now I'm choking on the memories
Choking on regret
I tried but I can't find a way
To untangle all the pieces
After they've been thrown away
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping away
I will not suffer this loss
Of you again and again and again
I refuse to continue to live
In this perpetual nightmare
I decide it ends right here
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping away
I feel it slipping
I feel it slipping
Everything is slipping away
When the time is right you got to get up and fight
When your number's up you gotta get up and die
Would you walk five blocks to meet me
That skin will get numb
How many times have you been mistreated
How many times have you been mislead
They brought this nightmare to life
All we wanted was to be respected
Learned our lessons, and don't you ever forget
We stand larger than life
What if I lost it
It was said and done but I needed some more, 
I hadn't had enough, kept kicking in doors
Would you walk five blocks to meet me
That skin will get numb
How many times have you been mistreated
How many times have you been mislead
They brought this nightmare to life
All we wanted was to be respected
Learned our lessons, and don't you ever forget
We stand larger than life
What if I lost it
Convicted with no excuse
Just pull the trigger, I got nothin' to lose
Disputed I will not be locked down
Split lipped with nothin' to lose
I never really change my point of view
Dispute it, the victim is you...
I will not be locked down
How many times have you been defeated
How many times have you been depressed
How many times have you taken the beating
How many times have you been put to the test
All we wanted was to be respected
Learned our lessons, and don't you ever forget
We stand larger than life
What if I lost it
Would you walk five blocks to meet me
That skin will get numb
"Perhaps you had better start from the beginning"
We all go down for the sacrificial moment
Crucifixion nails stain the bed of the holy
Space thing blues diamond studded, sugar coated
Well, I am hell a miracle overloading
Turn me on, yeah
A electric head all over
Turn me on, yeah
A electric head all over
We all go down for the God of the moment
Super demon seed running wild and below
And head trip news turn a trick to the flow
And sugar land express what you know it
And get inside get in there
Well evil in your eyes baby I don't care
Get inside get in there
Well see the flesh falling everywhere
Turn me on, yeah
A electric head all over
Turn me on, yeah
A electric head all over
And get inside get in there
Well evil in your eyes baby I don't care
Get inside get in there
Well see the flesh falling everywhere
Turn me on, yeah
A electric head all over
Turn me on, yeah
A electric head all over
We all go down for a piece of the moment
Watch another burn to the death to the core
And the roadshow thrills packs the freaks and the phonies
Sing now is now yeah all I ever wanted
Turn me on, yeah
A electric head all over
Turn me on, yeah
A electric head all over
Turn me on, yeah
A electric head all over
Turn me on, yeah
A electric head all over
Talkin' 'bout the Moron Bros., tattooed fingers tattooed toes.
They're idiots, they're losers, they're scum.
Yeah they'll take advantage of everyone.
You're a dog, they're your fleas.
Yeah they'll do anything just to spread disease.
Drink your beer, take your drugs.
They will leave you with microscopic bugs.
Their company you surely won't miss,
When your ashtrays are filled with piss.
Talkin' 'bout the Moron Bros., tattooed fingers tattooed toes.
They'll whine, they'll bitch,
They'll fuck you if your rich.
They'll leach they'll latch,
They're like an itch you can't scratch.
They are the Moron Brothers,
Don't get along with others.
They are the Moron Brothers,
Don't get along with others.
Yeah, they may not go down in history.
But they'll go down on your sister.
Bad milk comes in your mouth
Bad milk burns on your tongue
Makes you afraid
Bad milk runs in your gorge
Bad milk - Now you are here
Now it's too late
Suck - Taste - Spit
Welcome to life
Bad words crash in your ears
Bad words - Down in the womb
You couldn't hide
Bad words smashing your soul
Bad words - Could you get back
Back to the night?
Suck - Taste - Spit
Welcome to life
Bad flood flushing your veins
Bad blood - Up to your head
Down to your heart
Bad blood crushing your dreams
Bad blood eats you all up
Tears you apart
You should be thankful
Suck - Taste - Spit
Suck it!
I'm a man without a soul... Honey, yeah
I lost it while parading it, in a town full of thieves
Y'see I didn't wanna be with any people I know.
But god knows, I didn't wanna be alone
I thought if I acted like someone else
I'd feel more comfortable with myself
So I showered down, left my little room
Jumped in my car for protection from hostility
Well it ain't easy to be bold in an unknown city
Yeah I was feeling strong mouthed and weak willed
When I ran into the cure for my ills
Don't tell me what your name is
I want your body, not your mind,
I want a feeling, worth paying for before I say goodbye
But as I was talking, I couldn't look her in the eyes,
I just kept wondering,
How many men unleashed their frustration between her thighs?
There'll be no sleep till the morning
There'll be no lullabyes
'Cause the devil borrowed my clothes just for tonight
Well my adrenalin, was curdling like cream,
As I was being led by the hand.
Through the sound of sirens
And the distant noise of some drunken jazz band,
Through the stench of disinfectant--
That "INFECTED" my head,
Through the darkness of a corridor
And into a stranger's bed.
Well I didn't wanna hurt your feelings, honey
But I couldn't suppress my own,
I had to pull myself outta this nosedive
By proving something to myself.
She was lying on her back
With her lips parted.
Squealing like a stuffed pig
I was going through the motions
Faking the emotions,
And wriggling around like a lizard in a tin.
Trying so hard to cleanse myself,
I was turning into somebody else.
I was trying so hard to please myself,
I was turning into somebody else.
I was trying so hard to be myself
I was turning into somebody else.
I was trying so hard to be myself
I was turning into somebody else.
I was trying so hard to be myself
I was turning into somebody else.
Come my love with your desire
Out of the blue... and into the fire!
Anatomy of my pain
Entangled beyond all my control
Falling farther away
Waiting for something that is gone
I don't need you
Tell me what to do
No rhyme or no reason I fight to feel the feeling
Look in my eyes
No rhyme or no reason I fight to feel the feeling
As time passes by
So what's it gonna be
Let me in on what to do
Life pouring out of my veins
Waiting for what I need to change
There was a wicked messenger
From Eli he did come,
With a mind that multiplied
The smallest matter.
When asked who had sent for him,
He answered with his thumb,
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter.
He stayed behind the assembly hall,
It was there he made his bed,
And oftentimes he could be seen returning.
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand that read,
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Oh, the leaves began to fallin'
And the seas began to part,
And the people that confronted him were many.
And he was told but these few words,
Which opened up his heart,
"If you cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
We will not spiral down
I'll do whatever I can to stop that
Three and a half years
Of emotional rollercoaster's
Is enough to decide that some things?
Are worth the effort spent
Finally it's a realisation
That dawned on both of us and
With enough effort and knowledge
Of the past we don't need to follow
The path lay out by others
And it's gone too far
The words that guide us
Take your voice away
And I guess we can still chastise
Ourselves for taking too long to discover
What everybody else already knew
And all that was needed was the opening
Of the blinkered eyes long enough to
Register what was in front of us all along
I can't remember worse times
Than when we were apart
We won't stumble
Like we did before
Reach uppity reach gotta reach
Power to the people and the beats
Some people accuse some people of crimes
Some people get away wit' losin' my rhyme
They don't like where I'm comin' from
So dey play dumb
Dumb diggetty dumbb diggetty dumb
But I'm tellin' you what they do
Play a fool
While the real thief cools in a pool
He who got the finger on the war button
Talkin' loud ain't sayin' nuttin
TV got 'em bigger than life
All he needs is a knife
Who's the criminal?
To the blind def and dumb
Hard to see 'em comin'
Don't be dumb diggety dumb
Politikin' writin' bad checks
Still dey gettin' wreck
Goin' fo' a nigga neck
Rollin' in a blue 'n' white gang
Ready to bang biggedy bang
Hangin' 'round da hangin' rope
Nope n-o-p-e
I ain't bendin' for the soap
Never understood why the 'hood
Half od who's in da joint
Now dey got me losin' my point
Gotta have it goin' on
Born criminal born
Take a piece of America back
But who had it first
Hear the Indian curse
Robbed and stole so many so much
It ain't funny
Now who got 'em face on money
Politician passin' a bill paid in full
C-note rockin' in a pocket
How they livin' makin' sure they
Lockin' us up I got a feelin' I'm...
When it come to somethin' we say
What dey don't like is a brother like me
On da mike
In fact to the gritty ain't none of us wack
Noriega had back
Jeffrey Dahmer enter the room without cuffs
How the hell do we set stuffed
In da back of a cell
On an isle
Ain't it wild
What's a criminal?
Only if I had one more time to kick
The rhythm that keep rippin' down the door
So the real crominals get exposed behind the clothes
Doors 'n' the suits that make 'n' break da law
Lookin' for my own 'cause I had enuff bull
I can't understand it must be crooked
Way they planned it
Police supposed to keep the peace
But I can't truss 'em
So I keep my piece
Loaded and cocked
'Cause I don't miss the block
I'm talkin' about the ones who don't get chained to the rock
While we go away for the neighborhood crime
Never liked what I saw in the law
Indiana tress hangin' us instead of leaves
We hangin' the rope
Real criminals...
Er war noch jung, g'rad dreizehn Jahr 
Da verließ die Mutter den Papa 
Mutter sagte: Sohn hör mir zu 
Laß die Mädchen bloß in Ruh 
...denn er wußte noch nicht 
Es gibt keine Liebe auf dieser Welt 
Es ist ein Traum der uns gefällt 
Es gibt nur Lügen, Gier und Haß 
Und viele Tränen dick und naß 
Es gibt keine Liebe auf dieser Welt 
Es ist ein Traum der uns gefällt 
Es gibt nur Triebe, Gier und Haß 
Und viele Tränen dick und naß 
Doch konnt' er nicht von ihnen lassen 
Tat nach ihnen flehen, greifen, fassen 
Er sprach von Liebe bunt verziert 
Er war von Träumen irritiert 
...doch 
Es gibt keine Liebe... 
So konnt' sein Ziel er nie erreichen 
Mußte alles mit seinem Traum vergleichen 
Er war vom Whisky bald verroht 
Und rief ganz laut in seiner Not 
Es gibt keine Liebe...

(Hey God) Why are you doing this to me?
Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be?
Why am I seething with this animosity?
(Hey God) I think you owe me a great big apology
Terrible lie

My albums in store next to Kanye Wests
See I was supposed to be a footballer
But they kept pickin' the other kid who was a foot taller
I got lazy and less enthusiastic
I stopped trainin and turning up 2 matches
Started sabotaging the managers tactics
But when I did play I used to score hat-tricks
Then I gave up
Now I'm in the music biz
And I won't ever let my laziness ruin this
Theirs just no point
I'm on point
I'm the henry (hon-ry) on the mic, I'm so on point
Sitting on a fence is a man who sees no sense in fighting
Sitting on a fence is a man who sees no sense at all
Sitting on a fence is a man who strokes his twenty beards
Sitting on a fence is a man who drinks real ale
But the real problem with this man
Is he says he can't when he can
He'd rather not get his hands dirty
He'll still be there when he's thirty
I told myself to keep my mouth shut
But I still end up saying if and but
I lied to myself right from the start
And I've just worked out that I'm falling apart
Sitting on a fence
Sitting on a fence is a man who looks up to his guardian
Sitting on a fence is a man who swings from poll to poll
Sitting on a fence is a man who sees both sides of both sides
Sitting on a fence is a man who looks down on opinion.
But the real problem with this man
Is he says he can't when he can
He'd rather not get his hands dirty
He'll still be there when he is thirty
I told myself to keep my mouth shut
But I still end up saying if and but
I lied to myself right from the start
And I've just worked out that I'm falling apart
Sitting on a fence
I know I'm big and proud all over, not just on the stage
My secret self has many sides
That laugh and crush and sting
I'm red and thick like fire
I like it from behind
Round to back
Red to white
I'm pure inside and silent
I've got a piece of my heart
On the sole of your shoe
I've got a little bit of thunder
Trapped inside of that cloud
That dog in you spit me out into the Mississippi
I know who can love my many selves
The wife, the bitch, the Rapunzel?
The one who cries and calls for you
The one who is always alone
Oh Mississippi come and wash my pain away
Oh Mississippi come and take my pain away
I feel I'm drowning
I feel I'm drowning
I feel I'm...
I feel I'm... dying
Chorus (3 times)
Ain't had a job in about a year
Living down in my parents basement
I wish that I could get outta here
Sometimes I think I need a vacation
Can't get my mother off my back
She don't have far to go to drive me crazy
Someday that bitch is gonna make me crack
Might be the last time she calls me lazy
You're a let down
Pardon me if I'm a let down
To my family
I'm a let down
1-2-3 I'm a let down
(Are you like me?)
And now my sister's got a fancy car
I got a piece of shit from 1980
But at least I got my two guitars
And a one-way ticket to nowhere, Baby!
I'm a let down
Pardon me if I'm a let down
To my family
I'm a let down
1-2-3 I'm a let down
(Are you like me?)
(Are you like me?)
(Are you like me?)
Oh, no! no! Now, I've got a dream
They don't understand. It won't be long
I'm not what I seem. See, I've got
A plan (that's right!)
Sometimes they act like I don't exist
Or else, they treat me like I'm still eleven
Heaven knows I can't take more of this
They never thought that I'd be 27
And a let-down!
Pardon me if I'm a let down
To my family
I'm a let down
1-2-3 I'm a let down
(Are you like me?)
(Are you like me?)
(Are you like me?)
Sex, death
Sex, death
Sex, death
When I go 
To the show
All I see on the screen is a stream of pure vulgarity
I wrote 
Down a note
I complained for a day to the House of Representatives
They laughed
In my face
They said "Son you're a one-in-a-million minority"
The name 
Of the game
Is to titillate the brain, Stimulate the immorality
I was so offended as I sat for three hours
It was mental cruelty I was so shocked
Just a little more flesh just a little more blood
A little closer to the edge a little deeper in the mud
I'll never be the same
Sex, death and money, sonny
Makes this wicked world go round
Sex, death and money
It's the Gospel here in Dragontown
Sex, death and money, honey
Grease the wheels and make them fly
Sex, death and money, sonny
That is why we all are gonna fry
Stuck my nose 
In the door
Ended up on the floor in the middle of a nudie show
She danced 
On my lap
A couple hundred dollars later I was up on a morals rap
I was so offended as I sat for three hours
It was mental cruelty I was so shocked
Just a little more flesh just a little more blood
A little closer to the edge a little deeper in the mud
I'll never be the same
Sex, death and money, honey
Grease the wheels and make them fly
Sex, death and money, sonny
That is why we all are gonna
That is why we all are gonna fry
That is why we all are gonna fry
Sex, death and money
It's the Gospel here in Dragontown
Sex, death and money, honey
That is why we all are gonna
That is why we all are gonna fry
Sex, death, sex, death, sex, death, sex
Everyday I'm in a daze
Looking for that someone
And everyday I sit and kneel and pray
Oh, sweet love, can I get some?
So why do you desert me, baby boy
I need your love right now
And if you desert me, baby boy
Don't you leave me in your crowd
Yeah yeah yeah
spoken:
Hey, baby, what time are you gonna' get home?
Oh really?
(Sigh) All right, well...
I'll see you later then
Oh, wait, would you mind getting some, um...
Yeah, when you come home
Yeah, that's it
Love you too
Bye
(Ah... ah...)
Someday you will see my face
And you will think that you have won
And someday when it's all away
I'll 've just begun
So why did you desert me, baby boy?
I thought that you, you were the one
So if you preferred the other one
She won't bring you the sun
Lost on the street because you don't know what to do,
There's something in your heart that's coming over you,
Something in you-
Something in your heart!
It takes you back to a better time and place,
The leaders of this world have shortchanged the human race,
Something in you-
Something in your heart!
We've spent our lives living in their past,
Now we're building, building a new future.
We've spent our lives living in their past,
Now we're building, building a new future.
We've spent our lives living in their past,
One look at the world and it promts these words,
"We don't need it!"
The state of The State, it makes you feel sick,
Back stabbing, dollar driven status quo shit!
Something in you-
Something in your heart!
That's when you made a pledge to yourself,
"I'm gonna live my life to build a better world!"
Something in you-
Something in your heart!
We've spent our lives living in their past,
Now we're building, building a new future.
We've spent our lives living in their past,
Now we're building, building a new future.
We've spent our lives living in their past,
One look at the world and it promts these words,
"We don't need it!"
Take a good look at the sad state of the world,
(Sad, state)
Don't you know it starts with you and that it starts with me?!?!
This is the new fucking millennium (BRAND NEW AGE!)
We're going to turn the world UPSIDE DOWN! (ON IT'S HEAD!)
It's time to show some true humanity,
And time to show we truly care...
For the world,
For each other,
For those we've known...
Through all our years.
We've spent our lives living in their past,
Now we're building, building a new future.
We've spent our lives living in their past,
Now we're building, building a new future.
We've spent our lives living in their past,
One look at the world and it promts these words,
"We don't need it!"
Oh yeah, he wants to take you
Take you away from your life
Oh yeah, he wants to take you
Take you away from your life
Oh yeah, he wants to take you
Take you by the hand
Oh God, just let him rape you
Baby, I think you'll understand
Just you wait till everyone is hooked
Oh yeah, he wants to take you
Take you by the hand
Oh baby, let him break you
Then I think you'll understand
Are you gonna sit and watch me?
Watch me while I go down
Are you gonna sit and watch me?
Watch me while I drown
Oh God, he wants to take you
Take you away from your life
Oh God, he wants to break you
Take you away from your lies
Oh yeah, he wants to take you
Take you by the hand
Oh baby, let him break you
Then I think you'll understand
Are you gonna sit and watch me?
Watch me while I go down
Are you gonna sit and watch me?
Watch me while I drown
Oh God, he wants to take you
Take you away from your life
Oh God, he wants to break you
Take you away from your lies
Well, I sit on the corner and I drink drown soda
I'm gonna bomb the whole state of Minnesota
And it's been a while, I'm a little annoyed
I'm gonna fuck the whole state of Illinois
Yeah, I'm toiling in shit, he's got no place to go
I'm gonna fuck the whole state of Ohio
She sits on Broadway with her rattle
She's gonna fuck the whole city of Seattle
A simplified love sick taking no prisoners
Sunny day, cold heart- listen up listeners
Darkside love affair, out of time and in a rush
You can't help me till the sunrise lifts up
Let's levitate up over the horizon
I can see it in your eyes, everything you're hiding
I can see the truth in you even when you're lying
Even through the darkness, I can see you shining
Well it's midnight
And it's colder
Pull you closer
I can see through
When it's sunshine
And it's solar
And it's over
It's just me and you
BLOOD (blood). BY (by). SUN (sun). LIGHT (light).
A played out love song playing in the background
Seems to describe every part of where we're at now
Every feeling that we ever had for each other
Every karaoke love letter, lyrics undiscovered
Now your mother used to tell me you ain't nothin' but some trouble
Now it's a couple trouble makers making mayhem on the double
Tryna figure out the meaning and break apart the puzzles
Why they love you when I hate you when they hate the way I love you, solar (?)
Well it's midnight
And it's colder
Pull you closer
I can see through
When it's sunshine
And it's solar
And it's over
Guess it's me and you
BLOOD. BY. SUN. LIGHT. (3x)
A complicated heartbreak losing its direction
Cold day, warm heart- object of affection
My darkside love affair come to my protection
Midnight's on the way I'm losing my connection
Levitate up over the horizon
I can see it in your eyes, I know that you're hiding
I can see the truth in you even I know that you're lying
Throw away the darkness, I wanna see you shining
Well it's midnight
And it's colder
Pull you closer
I can see through
When it's sunshine
And it's solar
And it's over
It's just me and you
You're in for some trouble.
She's got a body and you've got the answers to all of her problems.
But bearing the taste that moves either one of you.
Soon the drinks have kicked in.
She's been around and I'm coming around.
I know she means well, but I was proven wrong once or twice
When your playing these games.
I swear I'm down for whatever you're down for tonight.
I'm a man's girl drippin' with the sweat just to torment you.
Help put me through.
There's something strange about the way you move your body.
What do I know? What do I know?
I'm always finding a way just to touch your body.
What do I know? What do I know?
You're in for some trouble.
The drinks have faded along with her good words.
Now's the time for thinking.
What have I done?
Where have my standards gone?
It all seems so strange now.
Her heated head and arms across my chest.
I know there's been worse.
But I'm grabbing my clothes as I jet just to catch a ride.
I'm sure she's down for what anyone's down for tonight.
I'm a mess now drippin' with regret from the worst damn night I've spent with you.
There's something strange about the way you move your body.
What do I know? What do I know?
I'm always finding a way just to touch your body.
What do I know? What do I know?
There's something strange about the way you move your body.
(The way! The way!)
What do I know? What do I know?
(You know! You know!)
I'm always finding a way just to touch your body.
(The way! The way!)
What do I know? What do I know?
(You know! You know!)
You live inside a dream
Everything tastes so sweet
As long as it agrees with how you feel
You're dancing in your sleep
Till all the eyes that look at me
Awaken your anxieties
You're so afraid, so you try to break me, yeah
I don't want to care
And I don't want to hate
And I don't want to see you fall too far away
All because of fear
'Cause when you're afraid
You lash out at me
When you say all the things that you never meant to say
And try to break me
But in the end, what leaves you broken
In the end, makes you better, yeah
Your face looks so green
When the sun is shining differently
And you're standing in the shade
'Cause face to face you're sweet
Like candy sticking to my teeth
But underneath so damaging
There is no strength in trying to break me, no
I don't want to care
And I don't want to hate
And I don't want to see you fall too far away
All because of fear
'Cause when you're afraid
You lash out at me
When you say all the things that you never meant to say
And try to break me
But in the end, what leaves you broken
In the end, makes you better
Yeah, I don't want to hate
I don't want to be broken
I don't want to hate you
I don't want to hate
I don't want to be broken
I don't want to hate you
I don't want to care
And I don't want to hate
And I don't want to see you fall too far away
All because of fear
'Cause when you're afraid
You lash out at me
When you say all the things that you never meant to say
And try to break me
But in the end, what leaves you broken
In the end, makes you better, Yeah
Your body is private.
Your mind is sacred.
You should be violated.
You should be violated.
You should raped.
You should be... Raped.
I need you.
I need you.
I want them to do this to you.
I want them to do this to you.
Bastard. 
Tear it down.

And you suck it. 
And you suck it.
Suck it.

Someone less privileged then you should use you.
Someone weaker then you should rape you.
You should be violated.
You should be violated.
You should be raped.
You should be raped.
You should be raped.
You should be raped.
Don't fight back.
Don't fight back.
I need you.
Don't fight back.
Don't fight back.
I want them to do this to you.
Bastard.     
I want them to do this to you. 
Bastard.

5 A.M., laying still, lonely
Yeah head over heels falling
What's out tonight calling to nothing
Can't seem to rest with a fuckin' pain in my chest
There's no sense in running from nothing [x2]
Can't seem to shake myself awake longing
So I call out your name somebody to save me
But there's nobody there 'cause nobody cares
No one cares
Can't seem to rest with a fuckin' pain in my chest
There's no sense in running from nothing[x2]
It's all in my head
Everything is done, everything is gone
Can't seem to rest with a fuckin' pain in my chest
There's no sense in running from nothing
We seem so lost and jaded
Well, what a price to pay
Fear can be overstated
And you seem infatuated
With finding who's to blame
While it can seem so hard now
I got a feeling we ain't meant to live this way
Don't tell me it's too late
'Cause I feel it too, we all love to hate
And let others lead the way
Some searching to find
That love with a new peace of mind
And still we march further away
Singing our songs of yesterday
While so much still stands in our way
Voices with nothing to say
Some feel that life's a favour
While some don't have the time
Wash up and kiss the altar
All hail the mighty father
But love will keep you blind
Same questions we keep asking
Won't hear the answers
'Cause we're scared of what we'll find
We try and compensate through our troubled faith
That should keep us safe
And keep searching for a sign
Some searching to find
That love with a new peace of mind
And still, we march further away
Singing our songs of yesterday
While so much still stands in our way
Voices with nothing to say
There won't be another day
No changing of the seasons
And no one's gonna save us from the lies
The greatest story ever told
Is only what you make it
There will be struggle and fear
All by design
And still we march further away (We've been so logicated)
Singing our songs of yesterday (Nothing's got all the point to blame)
While so much still stands in our way (Yeah!)
Voices with nothing to say
Some time ago I checked my conscience
And found it wasn't all that clean
A trail of people I had hurt
A sea of sins left unredeemed
Regret is a dull and rusted blade
That covers me with scars that never fade
These wounds, like a catalog of flaws
Serve to remind me of all the pain I've caused
So I resolved to make amends
To heal the damage I had done
But I could never stop the torrent
Of those regrets still yet to come
Regret is a dull and rusted blade
That covers me with scars that never fade
These wounds, like a catalog of flaws
Serve to remind me of all the pain I've caused
This bitter sadness overwhelms me
And mires me down with velvet arms
It's time for me to face the music
It's time to undo all this harm
Regret is a dull and rusted blade
That covers me with scars that never fade
These wounds, like a catalog of flaws
Serve to remind me of all the pain I've caused
"Come on baby, what's on your mind
You're stumbling in the darkness
Like you're running blind
Hey can't you see we've been fooling around
This same old graveyard
On the same playground
Be my late night movie star
By my nature I can tell who you are
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes
There's no innocence
In your bedroom eyes
Baby Baby
Got no self-defense
For your bedroom eyes
Over and over then we do it again
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around
Is there any way to stop this merry go round
Be my late night movie star
By my nature I can tell who you are
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes
There's no innocence
In your bedroom eyes
Baby Baby
Got no self-defense
For your bedroom eyes
Over and over then we do it again
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around
Is there any way to stop this merry go round
"
Take a look around you all is dead
A good look around makes me see red
What have they done to us?
Taken all our fun from us
We might as well just stay all day in bed
Of course we're right
You know we're right
It's worse than Monday
Yes of course we're right
You know we're right
Change from Monday
Yes of course we're right
And you know we're right
There's nothing to do on bloody Sunday
The truth of it all it's only face
A sadness to keep you in your place
Don't do this take no drink
Don't do that don't even think
But seven days a week
Let's pick over the traces
Of course we're right
You know we're right
It's worse than Monday
Yes of course we're right
You know we're right
Change on Monday
Yes of course we're right
And you know we're right
There's nothing to do on bloody Sunday
They say a day of rest
Ought to be Sunday best
But they do what they can
To make it Sunday worst
The week is weak enough
Even without a non-day first
Bloody Sunday
Brain Stew
I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep but running out
As time ticks by
Still I try
No rest for cross tops in my mind
On my own, here we go
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own, here we go
My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My senses dulled
Passed the point of delirium
On my own, here we go
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own here we go
Jaded
Somebody keep my balance
I think I'm falling off
Into a state of regression
The expiration date
Rapidly coming up
It's leaving me behind to rank
Always move forward
Going "straight" will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
I'm taking one step sideways
Leading with my crutch
Got a fucked up equilibrium
Count down from 9 to 5
Hooray! We're gonna die!
Blessed  into our extinction
Always move forward
Going "straight" will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
Always move forward
Going "straight" will get you nowhere
There is no progress
Evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
In nowhere! In nowhere!
Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show, bitch
Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show
Wake up, grab beer, grab rear, shave beard
Put on some scene gear
Gotta get drunk before my mom wakes up
Break up with my girlfriend, so I can bang sluts
I'm undead, unfed, been sleeping on bunk beds since ten
So if I don't booze it, I'm gonna lose it
Everybody get to it, do it, get ruined
Let's get this party started, let's keep them 40's popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started, let's keep them 40's popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we'll keep them panties dropping
When I start drinking, my dick does all my thinking
Hoes want to be seen with me, and I like their big thick titties
D-cups with extra filling, take it out, let me lick it quickly
Calm down, it's just a hickey
I'll blame it on this whiskey sipping, gets me tipsy
Drink fast and enjoy your buzz, take back streets to avoid the fuzz
I wanna take you home, but your friends won't let ya
I got a 40 in my Ford Fiesta
Buy beer or pay the rent, my signing bonus was quickly spent
So I'll beat my meat like I'm a fucking butcher
And I'll punk the pussy like I'm Ashton Kutcher
Let's get this party started, let's keep them 40's popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started, let's keep them 40's popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party jumping, let's see some 40 chugging
I wanna see your booty rubbing against my dick when I start buzzing
Come on, girls, I wanna see you drinking
I wanna see your brain start shrinking
Make a move, I saw you winking
Drunken pussies, what I'm thinking
I don't give a fuck if you're drunk or not
Turn it up loud and feel the ambiance
Grab two hoes and do some body shots
I wanna party all night 'til they call the cops
Fuck a wrist band, let's all do a keg stand
I'm like Cheech without the Chong, hitting up the beer bong
When the cops show up, they're gonna get the finger
And I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm the designated drinker
Let's get this party started, let's keep them 40's popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we'll keep them panties dropping
Let's get this party started, let's keep them 40's popping (what?)

I woke up this morning
On the wrong side of bed
I had a knife in my back
And I put it back in
Oh my God I was dead
I hope I get to sleep tonight
I never can
I've always got a knife in my back
No matter where, no matter when
What a tragic affection to harbour
A soul is seeking salvation to squander
Such a beautiful burden to bear alone
I know...
Rants and fictions of violence
Breaking the silence
Hiding the wake of our deception
Guarding desperate secrets buried below
And you know...
Tell me again your fucked up excuses
Dying fighting a life of abuse
When fame is your game
You say I'm to blame
But you know, but you know...
This moment carries my last hesitation
Seducing anger to haste my separation
This solemn piece of a guilty net it grows, so cold
Your every breath now strengthens my affliction
My tears have faded, all hope of your conviction
You were never the martyr you pretended to be
And you know...
Tell me again your fucked up excuses
Dying fighting a life of abuse
When fame is your game
You say I'm to blame
But you know, but you know...
Tell me again your fuckless excuses
Holding on at the end of the noose
When fame is your game
You say I'm to blame
But you know, but you know...
How they love you now
Tear drops rain down
Nobody cares, nobody cares
Tell me again your fucked up excuses
Dying fighting a life of abuse
When fame is your game
You say I'm to blame
But you know, but you know...
You know...
How they love you now...
You know...
Tear drops rain down...
You know...
How they love you now...
Who the fuck wants to live forever?
Remorse
When you stab me in the back
With your dream
To keep this body sober
I show my life for all to see
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
In a battle inside of my soul
Always better a fashion show
Than no show at all
Driving me crazy
You're driving me, you're driving me
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me insane
With you, would it be you?
And when the runway rovers
Grease back their manes, for our own sake
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
In the battle inside of my soul
Always better a fashion show
Than no show at all
Driving me crazy
You're driving me, you're driving me
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me into
Blue as I write this
For your mark
Blue as I write this
Once more
Be you
Would it be you?
Be you
Would it be you?
Napalm the children
Napalm the children
You've got to learn
You've got to learn
You won't believe what you're not told
You've got to feel
What you steal
Driving me crazy
You're driving me, you're driving me
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me into
Blue as I write this
For your mark
Blue as I write this
Once more
Be you
Would it be you?
Be you
Would it be you?
I need a man
To bring me love
To make me sing
I sing I need a man
To make me feel
Like I'm a queen
I said to take me to the god eyes
And kiss the devil on the lip
I need a man
To make me moan
To make me bad
I need a man
To drive me slow
To drive me mad
I said to take me to the god eyes
And kiss the devil on the lip
To leave me oh no no no no, oh... rha.
I need a man
His heart is stone
His mother's bad
I need a man
His heart is stone
And deepest black
His heart is stone
His mother's bad
His heart is sick
The deepest black
M-a-n-i-a-c
I need...
Was it me? Honestly
Torn away from my purity
Never look back and don't look ahead
At those lies that night or empty promises
It's the blood in your tears
The pain in your veins
The lies, the cries, only the
Only the stain remains
Everyday - I live it
Everyday - I face it
Everyday - I hate it
All I need is me and that's it
I wish I could turn back the hands of time
And maybe I would believe in a dream I cannot even see
Close your ears if you don't want to hear
Let me make myself perfectly clear
I don't believe your dream even exists
Save your prayers and solve your problems with your fist
Sometimes I don't see any point in life
Can't seem to break away
From the pain that's here to stay
All I need, set me free
All I need, set me free
All I need, set me free
All I need... is me!
I smash the glass into my face
Cutting through to my disgrace
Disregard for bone and flesh
How can I be in such a mesh of unlikeliness?
I smash my likeness
At my fingertips
With this blade turned in on me
Cutting an ancient tree
A cutter in a forest of industry
Upturning usurping
Love me
Hate me
Help me
Save me from me
Hold me
Hurt me
Stop me
Take this love out me
Anger tinged with sadness
It's always been like this
Place the dagger 'twixt my breast
My nearest and dearest
I hurt it I hurt me
Hurt everything around me
There's nothing no trace
Still cutting to find the place
Love out me! Love out me!
Anger tinged with sadness
It's always been like this
No nothing no one no more
No no no no I can't take this
Love me
Hate me
Help me
Save me from me
Hold me
Hurt me
Stop me
Take this love out me!
Love out me!
Love out me!
I've been shot
In the wherewithalls
And I don't think I can stop
From all this hullabaloo
Mary Jane's
On the game again
Seratonin's all I use
I just wish it were true
Don't treat me like a god
Treat me like a dog
I'll come home to you
To you
I'm addicted to you
You're my love my señorita
I'm addicted to you
Hope were gonna pull through
I'm addicted to you
You're the love that makes me younger
I'm addicted to you
Hope were gonna pull through
Pull through
Sing a prayer
Lonely nights are here
If I can't square my fears
With what I want to do
Don't treat me like a god
Treat me like a dog
I'll be good to you
To you
I'm addicted to you
You're my love my señorita
I'm addicted to you
Hope were gonna pull through
I'm addicted to you
You're the god that makes me stronger
I'm addicted to you
Hope were gonna turn blue
Turn blue
I'm standin', in a shadow, hating the world
I keep a wall around me, block out the herd
It's a nerve-wreck place to be, it kills real
Quick
You gotta scrape the concrete off your dick
But we're gonna live so happily
In a faraway place, just you and me
If I don't crap out
The sun will shine and give us a hug
The world will sing like a happy bug
If I don't crap out
No and I won't crap out
 No I won't crap out
 No I won't crap out
 Crap out, crap out
I'm glad I am crazy, it keeps me trying
 I despise the trendies, I know they're lying
 If you want to stir up real mud
 You had better pay with real blood
But the birds will sing a sweet melody
 In a couple of green indifferent trees, if I don't crap out
 And you're gonna know how fine you are
 Gonna write your name on a violet star, if I don't crap out
We'll have a window and we'll have a door
 And a reason to be living for, if I don't crap out
 And the material singers will fade into dust
 Like forgotten merchants of disgust, if I don't crap out
No I won't crap out
 No I'll never crap out
 Oh, I won't crap out
 I won't crap out
No I won't crap out
 No I won't crap out
 Crap out
 No I won't crap out
 No I won't crap out
Though I run into the twilight [Incomprehensible]
 No security, no guarantees, nothing like that for you and me
 'Cause we want to live not like a fucking dead fucker
 And I won't crap out, I won't crap out
 I'll get there, I'll get there where man can't
There's a young man with
Dirt on his hands
There's a room of sweat
Full of one night stands
A life of regret in a rock and roll band
A whole lot of debt
And a pocket full of sand
There's a sick mother
Can't find her lost son
And there's a father
Didn't know he had one
Run down caddy
In the neighbor's backyard
Where the kid got shot
And it all fell apart
Just another day in the city life
Just another day where we live or die
We're all prayin' through the smoke filled sky
Just another day in the city life, city life
There's a law man and
He's losin' his touch
Trapped a loose cannon
Says he won't lose much
A prospect picked and
He's earnin' his patch
Dealt a dirty deed and
It's paid for in cash
The pressure's so thick
You forget how to breathe
You gotta get drunk just
To blow off some steam
So many lights but
We're kept in the dark
Yeah they can take it all
But we still got heart
Just another day in the city life
Just another day where we live or die
We're all prayin' through the smoke filled sky
Just another day in the city life
There's no need to be nervous
We were born to fight
Sons and daughters we can
Take it outside
Follow the lead
Lead me to water
Do what it takes
Then take it from me
When there ain't nothin' left
You can read me my rights
Carry the load in the city life
Just another day in the city life
Just another day where we live or die
We're all prayin' through the smoke filled sky
Just another day in the city life
Just another day in the city life
Just another day where we live or die
We're all waitin' for some kind of sign
Just another day in the city life, city life
Reflex/I seen it coming
Reflex/coming too soon
Reflex/laugh if you wanna
Reflex/looks bad for you
Reflex/anticipation
Reflex/anticipate
Reflex/anticlimatic
Reflex/always too late
Whatever is coming
Ready or not
Reaction's slow
Reflexes shot
Everyone I know of
They all see the same
Just watch the reversals
Sucked in the jets
Sucked down the drain
I'm in tight with a demon called Deception
It's alright he's a treating me quite well
I'm in tight with a demon called Deception
He's right beside me when I fail
To whisper words like brother nothin' here is any good
See the birds they're a dropping like a star Wormwood
And all I wanted was a little patch of green
We were peasants and the cotton was our king
And in the fields till I sing a prisoner's song
Well Deception whistles right along
Right along
Charlie sang for a pocket full of pills
While Deception was a clickin' his high heels
We're in tight playing seven one night stands
And Deception made me as I am
As I am
As I am
As I am
As I am
I'm in tight
I'm in tight
I'm in tight
Truth is I'm in tight
I barely saw the light 
Just as it clicked in
Something saved my skin
Something saved my skin
Instrumental
Millions of lives lost
So you can fill your pockets
Millions of children slaughtered
So you can fill your pockets
When there's blood on the streets
It's time to buy
When there's blood it's time to buy
Choices made
The innocent will pay
Who are you to say who's to live and who's to die
Profit made
Millions die today
Who are you to say who's to live and who's to die
One day you will burn for your decisions
And what you did with human life
So live it up now
Unwanted children
Forget about them
As you fill your pockets
Profit off a death
You could have stopped it
But you did nothing
Only the dead have seen the end of this war
When you look into the eyes of your children
I hope you see the millions you have murdered
When there's blood on the streets
There's blood on your hands
The way you look at me
Is tearing me apart
And the way I make you feel
Is tearing you apart
And the things we're doing to each other
Is tearing us apart
Look at you and me, tearing each other apart
I don't mean to do it
You don't mean to do it
So we better stop it now
Because we're tearing each other apart
It's hard to be alone
But it's harder to be with you
I'm a lying liar with my pants on fire
Tearing myself apart
Slamming down the phone right in your face
Tearing you apart
So close, too close, not close enough
Tearing each other apart
When I see you
I want to tell you
But then I lose the words
And it tears me apart
Better walk away
Before we crawl away
I've got a hole inside
And I keep it deep inside
And I'm going to go inside
And it's there I'm going to hide
Because I've got to get away
To see if I'm okay
Sometimes things don't work out
It tears you apart, it tears me apart
Sometimes happens all the time
And I'm feeling torn apart
I stole your haircut and
Your balling personality
The perfect pallet for
A painting of morality
And now I come across without
A loss of what to be
Add up the two of us and
Then subtract the one of me
Come meet your maker
A different kind of strain
I'll turn you into one and
Then I'll turn you out for fun
Older than days and age
In fact you never were that young
Decended from a line
Of endless oppotunities
I'll build a mountain will
You bring it down and ruin it please
Come meet your maker
A different kind of strain
A sweet super tiger
Won't it be great
We could all do
What ever we want
What ever we want
What ever we want
We could all do
What ever we want
What ever we want
What ever we want
We could all do
What
Ever we want to
We could all do
What
Ever we want to
I'm dreaming up the thing
That no one ever knew was love
I'll get your higher than the
Hawks of Hollywood above
It's up for grabs the ragged
String of possibilites
To walk away from this could
Leave me feeling ill at ease
Come meet your maker
A different kind of strain
A sweet super tiger
Won't it be great
We could all do
What ever we want
What ever we want
What ever we want
We could all to
What ever we want
What ever we want
What ever we want
We could all do
What
Ever we want to
We could all do
What
Ever we want to
Come meet your maker
A different kind of strain
A sweet super tiger
Won't it be great
We could all do
What ever we want
What ever we want
What ever we want
We could all do
What ever we want
What ever we want
What ever we want
We could all do
What
Ever we want to
We could all do
What
Ever we want to
I've got this feeling deep inside,
But what it is I don't know.
My vision starts to change,
My mind gets filled with rage.
I raise my fist up to the sky.
What do you see!
The fear I see when I look in your eyes,
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind.
One of a kind!
Fear I leave in the back of your mind,
Makes you believe I'm...
One of a kind!
One of a kind!
One of a kind!
And now I feel like I'm alive.
Don't know just how I got so low.
These voices in my mind,
Tell me it's killing time.
And it's a thrill I can't describe.
What do you see!
The fear I see when I look in your eyes,
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind.
One of a kind!
Fear I leave in the back of your mind,
Makes you believe I'm...
One of a kind!
Hey, hey, hey
One of a kind! hey, hey, hey
One of a kind! hey, hey, hey
One of a kind! hey, hey, hey
The fear I see when I look in your eyes,
Makes you believe, makes you believe.
Fear I see in the back of your mind,
Makes you believe, makes you believe.
The fear I see when I look in your eyes,
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind.
One of a kind!
Fear I leave in the back of your mind,
Makes you believe I'm...
One of a kind!
The fear I see when I look in your eyes, (hey, hey, hey)
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind. (hey, hey, hey)
One of a kind!
Fear I leave in the back of your mind, (hey, hey, hey)
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind. (hey, hey, hey)
One of a kind! hey, hey, hey
One of a kind! hey, hey, hey
One of a kind! hey, hey, hey
One of a kind! hey, hey, hey
I'm sliding like a lizard on my belly and back
It's a miracle I haven't fallen through any cracks
The life on display is trouble for sure
The drugs that I took have made me impure
The neon forest is lighting up
The neon forest is lighting up
My brain
I've learned some nasty lessons so I'm shutting
My mouth
A fury in my gut is spinning me round
And round
To be a total phony is the winning design
When the fabric of life is a horny goldmine
The neon forest is my home
And like a cartoon cat I roam
Where only kids are still alive
And anyway they're gonna fry
My brain
You can get a weird prize for being adored
You can join the "in crowd" for being a whore
Although you are lonely you wish for a fence
America takes drugs in psychic defense
You can say what you want but nobody's there
Have you got any money?
Are you anybody?
What do you say if you've taken me over? 
You say you're taking me over 
You say you're taking me over 
But I don't wanna be illicit 
We try to calm down 
We seem to end in nosedive
We try to calm down 
We seem to end in nosedive
One on one, you've taken me over 
You say you're taking me over (you say)
You say you're taking me over 
But I don't wanna be illicit 
You say 
Wave goodbye (you say) 
Hey hey hey hey 
One on one, you've taken me over 
You say you're taking me over 
You say you're taking me over 
But I don't wanna be illicit 
We try to calm down 
We seem to end in nosedive
We try to calm down 
We seem to end in nosedive 
You say you're taking me over 
You say you're taking me over 
You say you're taking me over 
But I don't wanna be illicit 
You say 
I said wave goodbye (you say)
You are the adrenaline 
Rushing through my veins 
Stimulate my heart 
Heavy crystalline 
You are the sulphur 
Extinguished by the flame 
You are everything to me 
All this in your name 
Oh, walking in your blue coat 
Weeping admiral 
All the twisted cellars 
They had to hand your name 
Ended all that's static 
In a myth of sin 
Mirror minor static 
Pale adrenaline 
Take it 
Ah, take it 
That day you said to me, 
"It could never be" 
Say the hour of sea to seep 
"Have you said Godspeed?" 
Love is a vampire 
Energy of dead 
Love is like a boomerang 
Comin' back again 
On a rack of red leather 
On a rack of skin and sin 
Tell me how to pale 
In adrenaline 
And you said to me, 
"It could never be" 
Say the hour of sea to seep 
And you said to me, 
"Have you said Godspeed?" 
I could make it all 
All the twisted sand and foam 
I'll never, ever return 
I could make it 
Make it all 
I'm walking, follow me 
Down the twisted stair 
Stuck inside a memory 
Shot and shot again 
Hand upon a railin' 
Courtin' fate and fate 
We're sailin', sailin', sailin' sailin' 
Down a black, black river 
And I plunge right in 
And I plunge right in 
In adrenaline 
In adrenaline 
I move inside my vein 
Ah, you're the speed I need 
Throw the pistol in 
Oh, your love's a vampire 
Comin' in to suck 
Stop, stop, stop, stop 
Oh, I fell and fell and fell 
Down, down, down, down 
Oh, I'm gonna duck
Between skies and field
This land in midnight lights
Cold summer, cold summer
Till the end of time
The earth's like a belly
An heavy sleeping beast
But with her big eyes open
And cities are inside
Still standing on the hill
This city's like an ocean
Enjoy the metal waves
In which we drown ourselves
Don't you breathe anymore
Are you far from the next corner?
Your race is burning the pavement
Welcome to the city
The city's done for you
Yell with the underdogs
Make sure they won't bite you
When it's all burning... when it's over...
When it's all said and done,
Were we ever even alive?
This keeps repeating in my head:
We should prepare for the worst...
When it's all burning... will we see clearly?
Will we suffer at all?
Oh, it'll be perfect-running scared...
This keeps repeating in my head:
We should prepare for the worst...
The sky is falling-people running scared...
This could be better for the world
When it's all said and done,
Who will remember you?
When it's all coming down,
Who will remember me?
This keeps repeating in my head:
We should prepare for the worst...
The sky is falling-people running scared...
This could be better for the world
This keeps repeating in my head:
We should prepare for the worst...
I've got seven ways of going, seven where's to be,
Seven sweet disguises, seven ways of serving Thee.
Lord, I do extol Thee, for Thou has lifted me.
Woke me up and shook me out of mine iniquity.
Oh, I was undulating in the lewd impostered night.
Steeped in a dream to rend the seams to redeem the rock of right.
Swept through the seas of Galilee and the Seven Hills of Rome.
Seven sins were wrung from the sight of me,
Lo I turned my neck toward home.
Ah, I opened up my arms to You, and we spun from life to life,
Till you loosened me and let me go toward the everlasting light.
In this big step I am taking seven seizures for the true.
I got seven ways of going, seven ways of serving You.
As I move through seven levels
As I move upon the slate
As I declare to you
The number of my moves
As I speculate the eighth
Seeking love without exception
A light upon the swarm
Seeking love without exception
A saint in any form.
I was born to see two thousand years
Of man's effect upon the planet
Extinction seems to be a plausible risk
Whatever happens well I'm part of all this
My life I've been waiting for this moment
All my life I've been waiting for this moment to come
Taste the salt of my tears
Take the wealth of my years
Singing in the millennium with you
(Resolutions for show)
Old ways don't seem to know
Singing in the millennium with you
Fire burn all our uncertainties
Water wash away impurities
Contradictions and predictions abound
Yes I believe that we can turn it around
My life I've been waiting for this moment
My life I've been waiting for this moment
All my life I've been waiting for this moment
All my life I've been waiting for this moment to come
Ich sah dich vor dem Regenbogen steh'n
Du hast mein Herz sofort entflammt
Du bist so anmutig, so wunderschön
Das Haar voll Glanz, die Haut wie Samt
Ich pflück' dir Gänseblümchen auf der Wiese
Ich schick' dir Liebesbriefe, Mon Chéri
Ich pflück' dir Gänseblümchen, weil ich dich liebe
Ich schreib' dir Gedichte, Poesie
Mein Herz wird ewig nur das deine sein
Du bist wie Sonne, Mond und Stern
Wenn du bei mir bist bin ich nicht allein
Deswegen hab ich dich so gern
Ich pflück' dir Gänseblümchen auf der Wiese
Ich schick' dir Liebesbriefe, Mon Chéri
Ich pflück' dir Gänseblümchen, weil ich dich liebe
Ich schreib' dir Gedichte, Poesie
Ich reiß' dir die Gedärme raus
Und ich grille dich am Spieß
Vorher zieh' ich dir alle Häute ab
Ich weiß, das klingt ein bisschen fies
Ich reiß' dir deine Fingernägel raus
Und ich teile dich durch vier
Und wenn du das vermeiden willst
Dann bleib einfach bei mir
Denn ich pflück dir...
Gänseblümchen auf der Wiese
Ich schick' dir Liebesbriefe, Mon Chéri
Ich pflück' dir Gänseblümchen, weil ich dich liebe
Ich schreib' dir Gedichte, Poesie
Gänseblümchen!
Mon Chéri!
Gänseblümchen!
Poesie!
This is a sinking anchor that we hold so dear
Were you worn out from the start cut out and never
Replaced
You held at arms length
You so afraid
You by the waterfront
You still alive
You move away
You want to wash away what ills your heart
You stand by the waterfront never sure of your choice
This is a sinking road that we all travel on
You by the waterfront
You swollen with a crime
The rich get richer
The poor get the picture
The bombs never hit you when you're down so low
Some got pollution
Some revolution
There must be some solution but I just don't know
The bosses want decisions
The workers need ambitions
There won't be no collisions when they move so slow
Nothing ever happens
Nothing really matters
No one ever tells me so what am I to know
You wouldn't read about it
Read about it
Just another incredible scene
There's no doubt about it
The hammer and sickle
The news is at a trickle
The commisars are fickle but the stockpile grows
Bombers keeping coming
Engines softly humming
The stars and stripes are running for their own big show
Another little flare up
Storm brewed in a tea cup
Imagine any mix up and the lot would go
Nothing ever happens
Nothing really matters
No one ever tells me so what I am to know
You wouldn't read about it
Read about it
One unjust, ridiculous steal
Ain't no doubt about it
You wouldn't read about it
Read about it
Just another particular deal
There's no doubt about it
Oh, Team Machine
I'm a pound of flesh in a drum machine's dream, we watched
Crabs and lobsters eat a dead cop's throat
And stuff our mouths with gutted stereos
Oh, Team Machine
Every single piano I've ever met in my life, never
Sounded as good as melted Casio keys
Burning in a sea that sings out in 3D
Oh, that Laser Rain
Kept me up all night again
Scratching at the windows like a bright colored beast
Howling at the dawn like an adulterous priest
Shake your hands (Like they're full of feathers)
Shake your wings (Like they're laced with sound)
Shake your skin (Like a scrambled TV)
Gnash your teeth (Like a flamingo swarm)
And if your night
Unplugs its life
Digital sunrise
Digital sunset
Digital sunrise
Yeah!
Oh, Team Machine
The world's got no end and got no beginning
Now I'm coughing up maracas and tambourines
Looking over cliffs of eternity
Shake your hands (Like they're full of disaster)
Shake your wings (Like they're painted with tar)
Shake your skin (Like it's sewn with insects)
Gnash your teeth (Like an exploding car)
And if your night
Unplugs its life
Blame it on the laser rain
You just blame it on the laser rain
And if your life
Unplugs its eyes
Blame it on the laser rain
Just blame it on the laser rain
La- ser rain
La- ser rain
La- ser rain
La- ser rain
Because you can't blame the sun, it's been bought and sold
To a day that's never dawning
And you can't blame the sky, it collapsed twelve times
Now it's buried in a digital coffin
So you climb out to your windowsill
As the drum machines laugh to themselves
And if your night
Unplugs its life
Blame it on the laser rain
Just blame it on the laser rain
And if your life
Unplugs its eyes
Blame it on the laser rain
Just blame it on the laser rain
Confine me it's all that I see
Sickness keeps you following me
Keep it inside, all that is sharp
Hold it inside, all that is dark
Tear
I'll shut you up
Down, down, down
I'll destroy you
Kill or be killed
Down, down, down
You've become the enemy
Enemy
I thank you for making me feel
Make me feel like I want to kill
You show me you're evil inside
Now won't you just curl up and die
Tear
I'll shut you up
Down, down, down
I'll destroy you
Kill or be killed
Down, down, down
You've become the enemy
Enemy
You make me
You make me hate
You make me
You make me hate you
Thanks Parris.
Immerse yourself in this moment
Think about our rebirth
Let's get connected
Let's get united
Lets run away out of these vows of these men of structure
Whoa I wanna get connected
So we can get electric
Then we'll set our souls free dancing into rapture
Oh oh
Here comes the rebirth
Pushing outwards
From our swollen hearts
It's time to fuse ourselves when love set free loves burning spirit
'Cause everyone seems
Cold and emotionless
I can smell the hunger, taste the angry air who resurrects this
T h I s t h I s I s t h a
Rebirth
You'll find a place where
You'll beholden to no one
Except yourself so let them come and see ya standing naked
Full of passion
Flowing inside out
Into creation becoming one with present
So go get connected
Unshackled essence
Lets fuck away morality, you might be independent
Oh I wanna get connected
So we can get electric
Then we'll set our souls free dancing into rapture
Oh oh
Immerse yourself in this moment
Think about our rebirth
Before we die
Before we die
Before I die
Before I die
Before I die
Let's get connected
Let's get united
Lets run away to accept that we all are different
I wanna get connected
So we can get electric
Then we'll set our souls free dancing into rapture
Before we die
Before we die
Before I die
'Cause
This
Is
The
Rebirth
Go on, save yourself, leave the key here
You love someone else, I shouldn't be here
Don't ask me why, you know the answer
If she's so willing, little one, there was no chance there
I have come to know this world of changing faces
I can't fight the world, I can't change it
So be true to me, my walls are flaming
If she's so willing, little one, I won't be staying
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
I am older now, but I still remember
I took the greatest fall, I can't accept her
So be true to me, my walls are flaming
If she's so willing, little one, I won't be staying
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
What you did not need was a woman who was stronger
You needed someone to depend on you
I could not be her, I did not want to
My first mistake was to smile at you
Smile at you
Go on, save yourself, leave the key here
You love someone else, I shouldn't be here
Don't ask me why, you know the answer
If she's so willing, little one, there was no chance there
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Go on, save yourself, leave the key here
You love someone else, I shouldn't be here
Go on, save yourself
Go on, save yourself
I shouldn't be here
I shouldn't be here
Well here you are
Lying bleeding on a grimy street
See the broken glass
Sparkling darkly as it cuts your feet
Smell the rotting stench
The rancid odor of old Cantonese
Feel the toxic flames
All around you, you can hardly breathe
Come with me
Come on
I've got something to show you
Come on
You thought that it was over
Come on
You're really gonna love this
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come onnnnnnnnn
We can dig you a hole
Deep in the ground
Bury your soul down in Dragontown
We'll be lower than low
Spiraling down
As far as you wanna go, down in Dragontown
Open any door
Remember everyone you've meet before
Oh, there's a wicked young man
Cooking slowly in a frying pan
And a family of bones
Are back together, sleeping all alone
Then there's Alice, dear
And all the little things that got him here
Now you're here
Come on
I've got something to show you
Come on
You thought that it was over
Come on
You're really gonna like this
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come onnnnnnnn
We can dig you a hole
Deep in the ground
Bury your soul
Down in Dragontown
We'll be lower than low
Spiraling down
As far as you are to go
Down in Dragontown
We can dig you a hole
Deep in the ground
Bury your soul
Down in Dragontown
We'll be lower than low
Spiraling down
As far as you are to go
Down in Dragontown
We can dig you a hole
Deep in the ground
Bury your soul
Down in Dragontown
We'll be lower than low
Spiraling down
As far as you are to go
Down in Dragontown
You can burn my house
You can cut my hair
You can make me wrestle naked
With a grizzly bear
You can poison my cat
Baby I don't care
But if you talk in the movies
I'll kill you right there
It's the little things
It's just the little things
Aw it's the little things
It's just the little things
Yeah it's the little things
That drive me wild
I'm like a mad dog
I'm on a short leash
I'm on a tight rope
Hanging by a thread
I'm on some thin ice
You push me too far
Welcome to my nightmare
No more Mr. Nice Guy
You can steal my car
And drive it into the lake
You can stick me in the oven
And put it on bake
You could throw a big brick
Through my window pane
But if I ever hear you ask me
How I got my name
It's the little things
It's just the little things
Aw it's the little things
It's just the little things
Yeah it's the little things
That drive me wild
I'm like a mad dog
I'm on a short leash
I'm on a tight rope
Hanging by a thread
I'm on some thin ice
You push me too far
Welcome to my nightmare
No more Mr. Nice Guy
I've done it all
I mean I been everywhere
I've been beaten
I been stabbed
I been hung
I been buried alive
And I can deal with that
But it's the little things
I've done it all
I mean I been everywhere
I've been beaten
I been stabbed
I been hung
I been buried alive
And I can deal with that
'Cause it's the little things
It's the little things
It's just the little things
Yeah it's the little things
Just the little things
Aw just the little things
That drive me wild
I'm like a mad dog
I'm on a short leash
I'm on a tight rope
Hanging by a thread
I'm on some thin ice
You push me too far
I'm just a psycho
Pathic psycho
Pathic
I'm like a mad dog
I'm on a short leash
I'm on a tight rope
Hanging by a thread
I'm on some thin ice
You push me too far
Welcome to my nightmare
No more Mr. Nice Guy
It's just the little things
Aw it's the little things
It's just the little things
Storm clouds won't bother to gather
She cashed in cut the tether
She's gone
It's no mistake
The angels
Have come too late
They've come too late
In my hands I hold the proof
That something's sure to hit you
Pure flesh and bone to rip through
Don't let 'em tie you to the stake
Whatever it takes
Flood waters raise the ramparts
I'll meet you now wherever you are
I'm here until the frontline breaks
Whatever it takes
Then she turned off the headlights
Cranked the radio
Ran the red lights
Never found
The missing bride
Windows dark
But they're all inside
They're all inside
In my hands I hold the proof
That something's sure to hit you
Pure flesh and bone to rip through
Don't let 'em tie you to the stake
Whatever it takes
Flood waters raise the ramparts
I'll meet you now wherever you are
I'm here until the frontline breaks
Whatever it takes
A general without an army
I stopped lookin' then they found me
On the hill
A horn is blowin'
It's over man
You just don't know it
That something's sure to hit you
Pure flesh and bone to rip through
Don't let 'em tie you to the stake
Whatever it takes
Flood waters raise the ramparts
I'll meet you now wherever you are
I'm here until the frontline breaks
Whatever it takes
Climb backwards through the red room
A jungle of thieves to get through
Time's up how long you gonna wait
Whatever it takes
So, Jack, grab paper and pen
I'll say it once won't say it again
Loosen the core until it shakes
Whatever it takes
They said that we were trash,
Well the name is Crass, not Clash.
They can stuff their punk credentials
'Cause it's them that take the cash.
They won't change nothing with their fashionable talk,
All their RAR badges and their protest walk,
Thousands of white men standing in a park,
Objecting to racism's like a candle in the dark.
Black man's got his problems and his way to deal with it,
So don't fool yourself you're helping with your white liberal shit.
If you care to take a closer look at the way things really stand,
You'd see we're all just niggers to the rulers of this land.
Punk was once an answer to years of crap,
A way of saying no where we'd always said yep.
But the moment we saw a way to be free,
They invented a dividing line, street credibility.
The qualifying factors are politics and class,
Left wing macho street fighters willing to kick arse.
They said because of racism they'd come out on the street.
It was just a form of fascism for the socialist elite.
Bigotry and blindness, a marxist con,
Another clever trick to keep us all in line.
Neat little labels to keep us all apart,
To keep us all divided when the troubles start.
Pogo on a nazi, spit upon a jew,
Vicious mindless violence that offers nothing new.
Left wing violence, right wing violence, all seems much the same,
Bully boys out fighting, it's just the same old game.
Boring fucking politics that'll get us all shot,
Left wing, right wing, you can stuff the lot.
Keep your petty prejudice, I don't see the point,
Anarchy and freedom is what I want.
So far... Left with nothing, hanging by a memory
No stars to give me one wish, so lost in the dark
Feels like I'm caving in from the outside
All right - All wrong... See you again, so long!
Nothing matters anymore, at all!
Nothing matters anymore!
Life's not meant to be disposable
Lost. Found. Dead.
Ready and willing... Can't stop the bleeding
Life's not meant to be expendable
Rain. Sun. Gone.
Left robbed, unwilling... Can't fight the feeling
So low... Overwhelming, clinging to a tragedy
So clear: Hear weeping voices,
Tears fall in the dark
Feels like I'm coming in from the outside
So lost. So gone. So wrong!
Life's not meant to be disposable
Lost. Found. Dead.
Ready and willing... Can't stop the bleeding
Life's not meant to be expendable
Rain. Sun. Gone.
Left robbed, unwilling... Can't fight the feeling
It's never ending!
Never goes away, but you did!
It's never ending!
Never goes away, but you did... Why?... Why?
The body's just a vehicle to hold
Until we find another space,
Find another place to start this over
The enemy... The action I can't condone
Do you suffer with me?
Can I give you my loss, to feel, to hold close?
Can I give you my pain, to feel...
To be eaten alive by conscience?
Suffer! Fucking suffer! Suffer, like me!
Life's not meant to be disposable
Lost. Found. Dead.
Ready and willing... Can't stop the bleeding
Life's not meant to be expendable
Rain. Sun. Gone.
Left robbed, unwilling... Can't fight the feeling
Did you think that I would disappear?
Did you think that I would wash away?
Did you think that I would last this long?
Did you think that I would get this strong?
Every time they try to make me change
They just wear me down with more chains
And it feels like that you're with me
Or against me
And it feels like that your promises
Are all mine
And it feels like that to push me
Is to shove me
And it feels like that the only way
Is the wrong way
Did you think that I could be your crutch?
Did you think that life could mean so much?
Did you think that this could end in bust?
Did you think that it's just plain old lust?
Every time they try to make me change
They just wear me down with more chains
And it feels like the only way is the wrong way
And it feels like the only way is the wrong way
The only way is the wrong way
You always push me down
(Intro: News Excerpts)
The damage here along the gulf coast is catastrophic.
There's a frantic effort under way tonight to find
Survivors. There are an uncounted number of the dead tonight...
People are being forced to live like animals...
We are desperate...
No one says the federal government is doing a good job...
And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people...
No water, I fought my country for years...
We need help, we really need help...
In Baghdad, they they drop, they air drop water, food to people... why can't they do that to their own people?
The same idiots that can't get water into a major American city in less than three days are trying to
Win a war...
(Verse 1 - Jay-Z)
People was poor before the hurricane came
But the down pour poured is like when Mary J. sang
Every day it rains, so every day the pain
But ignored them, and showed 'em the risk was to blame
For life is a chain, cause and effected
Niggas off the chain because they affected
It's a dirty game so whatever is effective
From weed to selling kane, gotta put that in effect
Wouldn't you loot, if you didn't have the loot?
Baby needed food and you stuck on the roof
Helicopter swooped down just to get a scoop
Through his telescopic lens but he didn't scoop you
The next five days, no help ensued
They called you a refugee because you seek refuge
The commander-in-chief just flew by
Did he stop? No, he had a couple seats
Just proved jet blue he's not
Jet flew by the spot
What if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped
Hu, That woulda been something to watch
Helicopters doing fly-bys to take a couple of shots
Couple of portraits then ignored 'em
He'd be just another bush surrounded by a couple orchids
Poor kids just 'cause they were poor kids
Left 'em on they porches same old story in New Orleans
Silly rappers, because we got a couple Porches
MTV stopped by to film our fortresses
We forget the unfortunate
Sure I ponied up a mill, but I didn't give my time
So in reality I didn't give a dime, or a damn
I just put my monies in the hands of the same people that left my people stranded
Nothin' but a bandit
Left them folks abandoned
Damn, that money that we gave was just a band-aid
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis this is my minority report
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis this is my minority report
(Verse 2 - Ne-Yo)
So many times I'm, covering my eyes
Peeking through my fingers
Tryin' to hide my, frustration at the way that we treat
(Seems like we don't even care)
Turn on the TV, seein' the pain
Sayin' such a shame
Then tryin' to go on with my life
Of that, I too, am guilty
(Seems like we don't even care)
So we send a lil' money, tell 'em it's all right
To be able to sleep at night
You will pay that price
While some of these folks' lost their whole life
(Seems like we don't even care)
Now it wasn't on the nightly news no more
Suddenly it didn't matter to you no more
In the end almost nothing changed
What the hell, what was that for?
(Seems like we don't even care)
(Outro: News Excerpts)
...Buses are on the way to take those people from New Orleans to Houston
...They lyin'
...People are dying at the convention center
...Their government has failed them
...George Bush doesn't care about black people
It's hard to make these letters look as beautiful as you
A word too soft, too frail to be uttered
Or be placed in your dreams
My blood was an untrusty ink tonight
With lips and hands that will never meet again
Please understand that these are the years
And I just can't bare to see them wasted
My blood was an untrusty ink tonight
On the back of photographs
These words fall short of our last goodbye
When gold-capped irony
Brings the pain of light
As the seasons change
As the seasons change
Bottoms up you fuckers
This is your last release
Your libations are undead to me
Bottoms up you fuckers
This is your last release
Your libations are undead to me
I believe the title was "Bin Laden determined to attack inside the United States"
Absolute destruction is the battleground we're given
Strip away the fabric of a thousand years of livin'
Get out! Get out!
Burning down old glory while we jump around and shout:
Get out! Get out!
We don't need your fuckin' war, so get your asses out!
Revolution's our solution to the life we're given
Retribution is the way of life that we are livin'
Get out! Get out!
Burning down old glory while we jump around and shout:
Get out! Get out!
We don't need your fuckin' war, so get your asses out!
The trumpet of freedom has sounded
Great Satan
We've begun inoculating troops and first responders against ballistic airports
Desecration of the concentration camps we live in
Occupation of our nation just won't be forgiven
Get out! Get out!
Burning down old glory while we jump around and shout:
Get out! Get out!
We don't need your fuckin' war, so get your asses out!
The trumpet of freedom has sounded
Great Satan
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
May God continue to Bless America
I think you know what I'm getting at
I find it so upsetting that
The memories that you select
You keep the bad but the good you just forget
And even though I'm angry I can still say
I know my heart will break the day
When you peel out and drive away
I can't believe this happened
And all this time I never thought
That all we had would be all for not
No, I don't hate you
Don't want to fight you
Know I'll always love you
But right now I just don't like you
Know I don't hate you
Don't want to fight you
Know I'll always love you
But right now I just don't like you
Cause you took this too far, too far
Make your decision and don't you dare think twice
Go with your instincts along with some bad advice
This didn't turn out the way I thought it would at all
You blame me but some of this is still your fault
I tried to move you
But you just wouldn't budge
I tried to hold your hand
But you'd rather hold your grudge
I think you know what I'm getting at
You said goodbye and I just don't want you regretting that
No, I don't hate you
Don't want to fight you
Know I'll always love you
But right now I just don't like you
Know I don't hate you
Don't want to fight you
Know I'll always love you
But right now I just don't like you
And wisdom always chooses
These black eyes and these bruises
Over the heartache that they say
Never completely goes away
(I just can't believe this happened
And one day we'll see this come around)
And wisdom always chooses
These black eyes and these bruises
Over the heartache that they say
Never completely goes away
No, I don't hate you
Don't want to fight you
Know I'll always love you
But right now I just don't like you
Know I don't hate you
Don't want to fight you
Know I'll always love you
But right now I just don't like you
Cause you took this too far
What happened to us
I heard that it's me we should blame
What happened to us
Why didn't you stop me from turning out this way
And know that I don't hate you
And know that I don't want to fight you
And know that I'll always love you
But right now I just don't...
I will run for you
And I would kill for you
I think I'd let you strangle me too
And I would stand for you
Choosing left from right
Decisions, decisions
I hope I will make it right
Decide on decisions
I can't find my will
I can't seem to chill
Why don't I just sit still?
'Cause I'd rather be alone
Tell me what to do
Ask me what to do
Force me till I do
The sadness of I do
Screams of pain dismembering the wind
Storms of corruption elevating my wings
Souls withered in my flameless frost
No difference between my hate and your love
Wearing a mask of a bad religion
Like self-inflicted injury
Feeling the tension in every way
Unadulterated victory
The art of killing poetry
Created by misanthropy
The secret abyss of strength within
Tearing the epidermis from your skin
Disseminated decay of my death
Silhouettes without extremities
Wearing a mask of a bad religion
Like self-inflicted injury
Feeling the tension in every way
Unadulterated victory
The art of killing poetry
To bring the dark upon the light
Created by misanthropy
Beneath the crimson tide
Wearing a mask of a bad religion
Like self-inflicted injury
Feeling the tension in every way
Unadulterated victory
The art of killing poetry
Created by misanthropy
The art of killing poetry
To bring the dark upon the light
Created by misanthropy
Beneath the crimson tide
Let me tell you a little story about the slave master.
Use a whip on your ass so you behave faster.
You got chains on your neck, and the Man's respect.
You'll work all damn day, but you will never see a check
In the field. Cotton you yield. Your skin peels off your back
From the crack of the whip. It won't heal.
Ya wish you had a shield 'cause he wields iron,
So when you act up, he smokes ya and keeps firing.
And it's tiring.
Forget about recreation.
One wrong move and it's death you're facing.
White motha fuckaz got the ball and chain
On your leg, and in the form of religion on your brain.
They say, "You the devil."
You say, "Who the devil?!?!"
Some of us was house niggers. Some of us was rebels.
Some tried to get along the best they could.
And didn't nobody use the phrase, "It's all good!"
Would you? They got you living like a shrew.
They throw you pig lips and chicken gizzards. Then you make a stew.
They give us a white Jesus to appease us.
We talk among ourselves and hope nobody sees us.
They had our brothers beating us. Called us createns plus monkeys.
They just junkies mistreating us.
The master said, "If you don't whip 'em, you're dead!"
It was fucking with his head, but he beat us instead.
And we bled.
Red blood flowing like a flood.
Then he'd rape your mother. Stick her face in the mud.
They were ruthless! If you tried to front, you'd be toothless.
Some tried to run even though it seemed useless.
Virginity was torn. Soon babies was born that was half white.
And now his skin is kind of light.
You think you're special, because they let you
Oversee the carnage? But I bet you
Will get hung, even if you stick out your tongue.
'Cause they pull out the shank and stick it right through you're lung.
Now it's 96 and white people say, "Forget it.
It's all in the past." And some even regret it.
'Cause they think we'll set it.
Now my missions to get federal
So I can raise a black family with a true devils
And you know how that goes.
The slave master watching over you,
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do!
The slave master watching over you,
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew!
This is for you kids trying to get signed.
Just a little something you should keep in mind:
The labels are slave masters. Artists are slaves.
Don't get too raunchy. They want you to behave.
You get signed. You're thinking, "This is great!"
But wait You never knew what was at stake.
Creative control they withhold.
You sell your soul when you sign on the dotted line hoping to go gold.
But you'll never see that, not without promotion.
The label'll just throw your shit out, and got it floatin'.
You think your shit is potent, but ain't nobody buying it.
If they ain't never heard of it, ain't nobody trying it.
If they ain't never heard of it 'your record' they murder it.
You can complain. But they are not concerned a bit.
'Cause when they signed you, they thought you'd make a hit
'Cause of who you were affiliated with, and all that bullshit.
Frustrations. All these rules and regulations
Just so you can have your shit heard by the nation.
And be patient.
'Cause by the time they find a lead release, your shit is ancient.
You think they're working your album? You're mistaken.
And if you flop, you get dropped.
'Cause you ain't the star. You didn't go pop.
Just straight up hip-hop. Time to get a mop.
'Cause without no promotion, of course sales drop.
Peep the break down: If tapes cost ($) 10,
You'll probaably only get to see a dollar in the end,
That you cannot spend. Cause your budget gets recouped.
So you never get cash unless your record is "Shoop."
You better hope you get shows, which will not happen
If you don't have a record that's the main attraction.
Even if you sell a million, you'll get burned
'Cause they keep half your cash just in case of returns.
For a while, you wonder why rappers don't smile.
'Cause to them, you're not an artist. You're just another file.
Another nigger used to make another buck.
They don't give a fuck. And if your shit don't blow up, tough.
But the star gets both promotion and devotion
From the whole fucking staff. At you, they laugh.
The star probably don't know that he the house nigger.
Thinking he bigger 'cause he's the, pick of the litter.
These lebels think backwards. They push the acts that need it the least
So they can get all the money they can when it's released.
They take you to a restaurant for a feast,
And then expect you to pck up the check?
That's why I give props to niggaz who is independent:
'Cause they make they own money, plus decide how to spend it.
Splendid.And lets end it.
And don't get offended.
The slave master watching over you,
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do.
The slave master watching over you,
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew.
Hieroglyphics!
Niin sä tulit varhain väsyksiin
petyit niihin puheisiin
joissa kaikki on kohta mut ei vielä, vielä, vielä, ikinä ei
Kouluun sä menit silmin vihaisin
ne sanoi lapsi on sekaisin
ja olisit nyt paremmin
jos olet hiljaa ja kunnollinen, tunnollinen
niin kaikki on helpompaa
muuten joudut katumaan
ja sä mietit
Ne ei tahdo mua
ne tahtoo Ingalsin Lauran
essussaan kiltisti tottelemaan
mut vielä mä nousen ja maailmalle nauran
vielä joskus teen niin kuin huvittaa
ja niitä kaduttaa
Tänään sä et jaksanut enempää
muiden katseet aina kuin jää
joskus perään ne huutaa sä oot hullu hullu hulluhan sä oot
niin sä päätit lähtee ennen kuin lyöt
pakkasit meikit, ketjut ja vyöt
ja keskeneräiset kirjoitustyöt
ja ruotsinopettajan Visan
jonka se jätti välitunniksi luokkahuoneeseen
sillä sä pääset Lontooseen
ja sä mietit
Ne ei tahdo mua
ne tahtoo Ingalsin Lauran
sietämään kaiken ja anteeks antamaan
mut vielä mä nousen ja maailmalle nauran
vielä joskus teen niin kuin huvittaa
ja niitä kaduttaa
Ne ei tahdo mua...
On my way on coming down 
I had a vision of loss 
On my way from the coroner 
I left it out all lying in a box 
It's been a long time coming 
And your time's coming 
Round, round, round the clock 
And your sweet surrender 
I'll hold
How many times will the culprit kill? 
With the help of the president 
A perfect kill 
In the meadow there's a child 
With a bullet in his head 
In your bed 
Assume your dead 
Tick, tick, boom! 
Your days of glory 
Have long been beside you 
Running round in circles 
Gotcha feeling like you're some kind of slug 
And I'm so sorry 
To bleed for the 
Heavenly devil 
Your sweet surrender 
I'll hold 
How many times will the culprit kill? 
With the help of the president 
A perfect kill 
In the meadow there's a child 
With a bullet in his head 
In your bed 
Assume your dead 
Tick, tick!
How many times will the culprit kill? 
With the help of the president 
A perfect kill 
In the meadow there's a child 
With a bullet in his head 
In your bed 
Assume your dead 
Tick, tick, boom!
Quiet
I am sleeping
In here
We need a little hope
For years
I've been sleeping
Helpless
Couldn't tell a soul
Be ashamed
Of the mess you've made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me
Silent
Metal mercies
Castrate
Boys to the bone
Jesus
Are you listening?
Up there
To anyone at all
We are the fossils
The relics of our time
We mutilate the meanings
So they're easy to deny
Be ashamed
Of the mess you've made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me
Quiet
I am sleeping
Quiet
I am sleeping
Quiet
I don't trust you
Shut up
I can't hear you at all
Be ashamed
Of the mess you've made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me
Behind me
The grace of falling snow
Cover up everything you know
Come save me from the awful sound
Of nothing
At school the choices I made
Were rock and roll bands
And getting good grades.
But brains and wearing all black
To some of these guys
It's like a red flag.
The taste of anyone's fist
Is not a good vibe, or something I've missed.
I was intimidated, assaulted, and for what?
I hope they choke...
Shrugged off the shit in my youth
Like growing up pains or losing a tooth
But it's not a matter of age
They're everywhere
These people don't change
When I was in New York
A woman tried to start a fight with me
Because she thought I was Jewish
And somehow it felt wrong to tell her I wasn't
And I pray to God she chokes...
You're going home in a fucking ambulance...
I once saw a man
With blood on his face
From beating up black kids
And I could hardly breathe
Your race, your faith
Or just your clothes incite
They drink and they fight
It's not safe out tonight
Your race, your faith
Or just your clothes incite
They drink and they fight
So don't go out tonight, don't!
If your mum and dad
Hit you as a child
I feel sad for you
But that's no excuse for it
Who says it's okay
To behave in this way?
I can't help but feel it's us
For the sake of our own skin
We walk away, and it's like we all say
"That's alright, it's alright, it's alright..."
I wish I had the guts
To stand up for myself
And for the others as well
Against these fuckers
Choke...
So you got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're driving down the street of gold
But you can't blame me if I set dis stage on fire
Mama always told me I was crazy
My hoes say I'm amazin but I don't listen 2 a lady
But the bitch say I'm hot and I say no bitch I'm blazin'
Like wat the fuck you expect I'm a muthafuckin cajun
And I feel caged in my mind it's like my flow is doin' time
I go crazy inside but when it comes out it's fine like wine
Wait
Watch
See I get betta with time like a watch
Osh kosh b'gosh posh spice husband
Couldn't kick it like I kick it bitch I kicks it
No cereal like a land and I sticks it
Wherever she asks me after she licks it
That's too explicit but y u listenin
*SNIFFS* I smell smoke and somethin' sizzlin
That's her pussy so hey pussy play with pussy or play pussy
But you can't blame me if I set dis stage on fire
They say you're nobody till somebody kills you
But where I'm from you're nobody till you kill somebody
And you know what they say
When you're great it's not murder it's assinate
So assinate me bitch
'Cause I'm doin' the same shit martin luther king did
Checkin' in the same hotel in the same suite bitch same balcony
Like assinate me bitch
(?)
I don't rap I film movies with my rap
You can call me Mr. Director Chair
Yeah and that's a wrap
Cut
On 2 the next
Not to the next scene bitch the next check
Some say the X makes the sex pects
So play with the pussy or play pussy
So you got so many diamonds (hey pussy lay pussy)
You wear all the finest clothes (go or die say pussy and I say)
And your grill is shining (lay pussy lay pussy lay pussy)
As you're driving down the street of gold (Hey Pussy)
BUT YOU CANT BLAME ME IF I SET DIS STAGE ON FIRE (Hey Pussy Don't Play Pussy)
Get em!
Straight off the corner Apple and Eagle
Braveheart bitch like the times are medieval
Married to the game, Divorce the Cathedral
Standin on the corner selling Porcelain to People
Forced into evil, It's all in your head
It's also cerebral, call me Canival
You follow when I lead you
Straight to the needles
The bottles, the battles, the beetles will eat you
Mama named Cita, I love You Cita
Member when your pussy Second husband tried to beat ya
Remember when I went into the kitchen got the cleaver
He ain't give a fuck I ain't give a fuck neither
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
You could smell the ether
You can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
And she don't play neither
With all my said unsaids
I could never swallow
The idea of a happy ending
As another day's memory dies
As I'm made to...
As I'm made to smile
These lifeless days
Have left me with an empty heart 
Another wounded memory dies
I could never swallow your false ideals
Of a lifeless happy ending
I could never swallow your false ideals
Of a lifeless happy ending
I could never swallow your false ideals
Of a lifeless happy ending
How could words slit my wrists and doors close
Present day heartfelt moments killed by a slap to the hand
Another wounded memory dies
Poisonous screams
With messages not thought of when released
Present day heartfelt moments killed by a slap to the hand
Present day heartfelt moments killed by a slap to the hand
Another wounded memory dies
Poisonous screams
With messages not thought of when released
Poisonous screams
I could never swallow your false ideals
Of a lifeless happy ending
Another day here
Another memory dies
Another day here
Another memory dies
Ah
Dumaladipa amadui amadui
Dumaladipa amadui amadui
It isn't even winter and I'm freezing, freezing
This sort of feeling isn't pleasing
And what I want to know, man
(Why, oh, why)
Does she treat me like a snowman?
Ah
It isn't even winter and I'm freezing, freezing
This sort of feeling isn't pleasing
And what I want to know, man
(Why, oh, why)
Does she treat me like a snowman?
Ah
She's been building me
Up quite steadily
Seems like I've been here years and years and years and years
I wait patiently
Froze in history
All ice water is tears and tears and tears and tears
She treats me far too frosty
This hanging on has cost me dear
Oh
Dumaladipa amadui amadui
Dumaladipa amadui amadui
It isn't even winter and I'm shivering, shivering
Waiting for the love that's not delivering
And what I want to know, man
(Why, oh, why)
Does she treat me like a snowman?
Ah
It isn't even winter and I'm shivering, shivering
Waiting for the love that's not delivering
And what I want to know, man
(Why, oh, why)
Does she treat me like a snowman?
Ah
She's been building me
Up quite steadily
Seems like I've been here years and years and years and years
I wait patiently
Froze in history
All ice water is tears and tears and tears and tears
She treats me far too frosty
This hanging on has cost me
It seems you would say I was too soft-hearted
If you made a dunce cap I'd don it
People will always be tempted to wipe their feet
On anything with 'welcome' written on it
It isn't even winter and I'm freezing, freezing
This sort of feeling isn't pleasing
And what I want to know, man
(Why, oh, why)
Does she treat me like a snowman?
Ah
It isn't even winter and I'm shivering, shivering
Waiting for the love that's not delivering
And what I want to know, man
(Why, oh, why)
Does she treat me like a snowman?
Ah
(Why, oh, why) does she treat me, does she treat me?
(Why, oh, why) does she treat me, does she treat me?
(Why, oh, why) does she treat me like a snowman?
(Why, oh, why) just like a snowman
Ah
It's funny how a morning turns a love to shame
Disguised and disfigured and you thought I tasted like rain
There's nothing here but a shadow, nothing here
Now you know, now you know, now you know, now you know
There's nothing here but the shadow, and now you know
I spit, I spit in the eye
I tear, tear out my heart
And I scatter the bits
I stay unseen by the light
I stay untold by the truth
I am sold by a lie
By this I am able
In all of my travels
To make these memories quit
But tonight I clearly recall every little bit
I can chew like a cannibal, I can yell like a cat
I've even had you believing that I really, really like it like that, like that, like that
But there was never a moment, not a moment
Now you know, now you know, now you know, now you know
You ever got within a hundred million miles of my soul
I spit, I spit in the eye
I tear, tear out my heart
And I scatter the bits
I stay unseen by the light
I stay untold by the truth
I am sold by a lie
By this I am able
In all of my travels
To make these memories quit
But tonight I clearly recall every little bit
Every little bit
Every little bit
Every little
Every little bit
You left open the window to the morning and the winter walked in
Reality fired her wooden bullet, splintered under our skin
They say I'm walking on freedom, this is freedom
Now I know, now I know now I know, now I know, know
I still don't blame you for leaving, baby, it's cold living with ghosts
I spit, I spit in the eye
I tear, tear out my heart
And I scatter the bits
I stay unseen by the light
I stay untold by the truth
I am sold by a lie
By this I am able
In all of my travels
To make these memories quit
But tonight I clearly recall every little bit
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit, every little bit
Every bit, bit, bit
Destroy and pull it tighter
Adjust the angle so slight
Tear the scar, be a fighter
Black is death at midnight
Make it feel like there's something
Make it hard as it burns
The liquid light is descending
Das ist mein stern!
Blut! Sex! Fire!
Blut! Sex! Fire!
Blut! Sex! Fire!
Sex! Sex! Fire!
The subconscious is burning
As the blood is dripping
Transcendental illusion
Pulsating God dilusion
Dig the weapons inside
Dig so deep that it cuts
Pull and grind it tighter
Never say enough
Blut! Sex! Fire!
Blut! Sex! Fire!
Blut! Sex! Fire!
Sex! Sex! Fire!
Sex! Fire!
Sex! Fire!
Sex! Fire!
Sex! Fire!
All my life I relied on one thing and that one thing fucked me up even more
She is tempting and promises things that'll never happen of that I'm sure
Years I've wasted waiting for her to come through for me why was I so blind
Waiting innocently as time went on life's gotten worse my resentment's strong
Now I've smartened up I'm turning my back
I don't need her I gave her a smack
She failed me over and over again no surprise there she was never a friend
I've been dragging a bitch called hope (a bitch called hope)
I've been hanging at the end of her rope (a bitch called hope)
I've been dragging a bitch called hope (a bitch called hope)
I've been hanging at the end of her fucking rope
I'd have given her my heart and my dreams
She then strung me along threw away these years
Don't let that bitch take you for a ride like she took me
And took most everyone I know
So I've kicked the bitch to the curb
But in the end she's left me a bitter twisted motherfucker
I've been dragging a bitch called hope (a bitch called hope)
I've been hanging at the end of her rope (a bitch called hope)
I've been dragging a bitch called hope (a bitch called hope)
I've been hanging at the end of her fucking rope
Waited so long for this day
Eternity putting innocence to the test
No one knows the real reason - no one can stop him
His power - his power growing every day
The game is lost, eternal hate united with the eternal day
The game is lost, eternal love united with the eternal hope
Deeply within converted to lone liness
Know as an outsider, recognized as a lone wolf
Lost by the test of humanity
He wanders - he wanders across the promise land
The game is lost, eternal hate united with the eternal day
The game is lost, eternal love united with the eternal hope
The last breath - the last moment
The last game - the last move
The game is lost - the game is lost - is lost
The time is lost - the time is lost - is lost
The power of conviction
Created from ones self
Surrounded by silence
Encircled by darkness
Armed for the right to survive
Who always - who always wins
Can't bear to lose
The game is lost, eternal hate
United with the eternal day
The game is lost, eternal love
United with the eternal hope
The game is lost, eternal hate
United with the eternal day
The game is lost, eternal love
United with the eternal hope
Break ground.
Buckle down.
It's time.
Yeah, it's time for the party to make some sound.
Let's move from this underground,
Shed some of this blacklight to surrounding towns.
How much responsibility do you bear
For the ill uses others might make of your ideas?
Almost as much responsibility that you'd bear
If you failed to speak your mind
When it might have made some kind of a difference.
So make a difference.
Could you make 'em dance
Turn your bleeding hearts into some bleeding hands?
Line up.
State your name, state your claims, claim your stakes.
If you wanna fight with us, you've got to refuse to please the game.
Look ahead now.
Oh, let the countdown usher
The philanthropic minds to speak up now
And scrape the paint that hides the crimes
Of a silent kind.
Look up
And make a difference.
But the right difference would mean
The bleeding hearts would got to be turned into some
Bleeding hands from solid lands.
Yeah, can you make 'em dance
And keep an upright stance?
Is the position that you hold
One that could parallel
A synergistically greater plan?
Or would it force us all to be packed into a can?
How much responsibility do you bear
For the ill uses that the others might make of your ideas?
Almost as much responsibility that you'd bear
If you failed to speak your mind
When it might have changed things.
Let's move from this undergound
Blare some of this blacklight
Through their socket pride
Where their eyes used to hide
When they had sight
Now only servin' as a path
For us to maybe reach that height
With a word
To make a difference.
Come on, let's make 'em dance,
Turn their bleeding hearts
Into some bleeding hands over solid lands.
Now, can you make 'em dance
And keep an upright stance?
Or has the premise of your cause
Been rooted in a slopin', quickly given golden sand?
'Cause the collapse you'd cause would pull us down with claws that don't let go.
Yeah, the collapse you'd cause could pull us down with claws that don't let go
I can't, can't, can't, can't do
Can't, can't, can't, can't do
Sometimes I feel like shit
So don't waste my fucking time
I don't need no family
Just a big fat check of royalties
I know what I wanna do
But I just don't seem to get it through
And I c-c-c-c-can't do anything
No, I c-c-c-c-can't do anything
You live like a wannabe
In this sick society
And you're sitting next to me
Can't you fuckin' see
I know how I ended up here
I took your piece of shit for real
And I c-c-c-c-can't do anything
No, I c-c-c-c-can't do anything
I can't do nothing
And I c-c-c-c-can't do anything
No, I c-c-c-c-can't do anything
'Cause I'm a U.F.O. Romeo
Well, I'm a U.F.O. Romeo
Well, I'm a U.F.O. Romeo
Well, I'm a U.F.O. Romeo

Do you know what they say
Do you know what they say, what they say about you
Do you know what they do
Do you know what they do when you leave the room
(x2)
Never thought twice about holding your tongue
Once upon a time you were so young
Everywhere you carried around your soul
In the night they stole it, left you skin and bones - knife in your back
Laughing aloud at your expense, fed themselves on innocence - knife in your back
Their attacks inserted doubt, now you're stranded in the cold with a knife in your back
Do you know what they feel
Do you know what they feel, what they feel for you
Do you know how they play
Do you know how they play, how they play inside you
Do you know what they steal
Do you know what they steal, what they steal from you
Do you know how they prey
Do you know how they prey, how they prey upon you
Never thought twice about holding your tongue
Once upon a time you were so young
Everywhere you carried around your soul
In the night they stole it, left you skin and bones - knife in your back
Laughing aloud at your expense, fed themselves on innocence - knife in your back
Their attacks inserted doubt, now you're stranded in the cold with a knife in your back
Tell me did you grow after all these years?
Giving up control and buying into fear
Nights slip into mornings and days remain unchanged
But their mighty appetites will not be tamed.
Do you care, Do you care
Do you care what they say
Do you care what they say, what they say about you
Do you care how they prey
Do you care how they prey, how they prey upon you
Upon you
Someday I'll feel no pain 
Someday I won't have a brain 
They'll take away the part that hurts 
And let the rest remain 
Fix me 
Fix my head 
Fix me please
I don't wanna be dead
Someday we'll all be rich 
Someday I won't listen to you bitch 
I'll turn up the volume
So you hear all the shit we play just for you 
Fix me 
Fix my head 
Fix me please
I don't wanna be dead 
Someday I'll feel no pain 
Someday I won't have a brain 
They'll take away the part that hurts 
And let the rest remain 
Fix me 
Fix my head 
Fix me please
I don't wanna be dead 
So fix it!
Oh...
I'm drifting off into nothingness
So terrified of what will be
Tomorrow is the day, I can't back out
But I'm scared of what will happen to me
They say a simple procedure
It's supposed to be all so routine
But what if the doctor was evil and very, very mean
Just call me doctor, just call me pain
I'll show you horror that you've never gonna see again
Pass me the scalpel, pass me the knife
You don't need no medicine 'cause I'm gonna take your life
Please wake me out of this nightmare
I've got to get out of this dream
A victim of the Dr. Psycho
Like nothing that you've ever seen
As I begin to cut you, screaming out in fear
There's no one here to help you, no one's gonna hear
This ancient operation, extracting part of the brain
There's no way to turn it back, you're never gonna be the same
Please wake me out of this nightmare
I've got to get out of this dream
A victim of the Dr. Psycho
Like nothing that you've ever seen
Please wake me out of this nightmare
I've got to get out of this dream
A victim of the Dr. Psycho
Like nothing that you've ever seen
Thought I'd be in a cosmetic bliss
Now I smell the stench of my own piss
All I wanted was to look real good
Just one more chance, I'll leave it like I should
I am the doctor and I'll kill your pain
This is my specialty, extracting part of the brain
Please wake me out of this nightmare
I've got to get out of this dream
A victim of the Dr. Psycho
Like nothing that you've ever seen
Please wake me out of this nightmare
I've got to get out of this dream
A victim of the Dr. Psycho
Like nothing that you've ever seen
I'm wishing the bath water clean
She hides in the back and is unseen
I take off the mask that surrounds me
Look me in the face
What do you see
I feel like a boy the age of 13
My body grows up 
But my mind stays the same
Look me in the face 
What do you see?
How do you tell an angel
That you don't believe in God?
Why do I feel
Like such a stranger
I look around
I look around 
And all my friends are gone
But oh would you be me?
Because I would be you
Oh you'd be happy
Only if you wanted to
And how would you treat me?
Because I would treat you
Oh you'd be happy
Only if you wanted to
How do you tell your Father,
That you want him to notice you?
Why does this seem like such a bother?
When mom says you'd be better off dead
But I want to see you
I still want to see you
Oh would you call me?
Oh it's not hard too
I'm the first one 
Oh, you gave birth to
And oh would you write me
On my birthday
Graduation, was yesterday
Yesterday
Oh'
How do you hold the special victim?
When they push you away
When they've been 
Raped on the inside
Torn on the outside
The dirt and ugly from the stain that they try to hide
Touched in private places
Embarassed faces
To scared to ask for help
Oh would you be me?
Because I would be you
Oh you'd be happy
Only if you wanted to
And how would you treat me?
Because I would treat you
You'd be happy
Only if you wanted to
I'm wishing the bath water clean
She hides in the back and is unseen
I take off the mask that surrounds me
Look me in the face
What do you see?
I try to wish you away
I'll do more than wishing someday
No no no more son of a bitch
No no no more wishing
No no no more son of a bitch
No more happy face
You and I have nothin' more to say
We'll do more than talking someday
No no no more son of a bitch
No no no more talking
No no no more son of a bitch
No more happy face
No no no more son of a bitch
No no no more talking
No no no more son of a bitch
No more happy face
If I could find the will to kill
Get it
Here we go again
No no no more son of a bitch
No no no no more son of a bitch
No no no more son of a bitch
No more happy face
If I could find the will to kill
Well, I'd get you son of a bitch
Everything you say, you say it with a smile
Everything you do, but does she cares for you
Everyone you meet, sees your big ol' heart
Everyone you love, but does she loves you back
You're so in love, you hope she wants
To come and find you
I know you want to be free
Just like that guy on the TV
I know you think it's all right
But it makes no sense to me
Every foolish game, every mid-life rage
Every ounce of pain, what else is there to blame?
I only wanted you, to open up your eyes
You know however cute, she's a monster in disguise
You're so in love, you hope she wants
To come and find you
I know you want to be free
Just like that guy on the TV
I know you think it's all right
But it makes no sense to me
(Mitä? Jee!)
Synnyin muita kauniimpana tähän maailmaan,
sukulaiset matkusti mua ihastelemaan.
(Kuulkaas enot!)
Hypin teidän silmille ja hakkaan maailmaa,
olis kannattanut vähän paremmin mua kasvattaa.
(En mä kuule mitää!)
Päiväkodis piti aina olla prinsessa,
mieluummin kun olisin ollut massamurhaaja.
YSI - KYMPPI - YSI - KYMPPI - YSI - KYMPPI - YSI - KYMPPI
Kato mulla todistus on priimatavaraa,
saa nähdä mihin korkeekouluun lähden hakemaan.
OIKIS - LÄÄKIS - OIKIS - LÄÄKIS - OIKIS - LÄÄKIS
(Aarrggh!)
Jos kuljen käsi pystyssä, niin se on vahinko
oon viitannu liikaa, mun kädessä on kuolio.
Kato mulla todistus on priimatavaraa
ehkä lähden opiskelemaan PSYKOLOGIAA!
(Joo!)
Kun opin puhumaan, sanoin "En haluu sisaruksiaaa..."
Otan sinut vastaan hymyillen, kukkia kaduille sirottelen,
Ihanaa, olen sankaritar, suutelen märäks joka vastaantulijan.
Tää ON SUPERHYVÄ SUNNUNTAI,
Datsun kesärenkaat alleen sai.
(Aaarrrgghhhhhaaaaa!)
Tule lähemmäs ja mun tukkaa kosketa,
kai sä tajuut että se on ihan oikea?
Mä oon tullut äitiin, oon perinyt sen älyn.
Työnnän hakaneulan poskeen, aiheutan siis hälyn.

Isi rakastaa mua enemmän kuin maailmaa,
ja paskat mulla mitään isää olekaan.
(Miten susta tulee noin ärsyttävä ääni?!)

It's all so petty, so petty
I can't get in a word
So go and speak your mind
I hope you're happy you're happy
If there's one thing you remember...
Know I tried to warn you
I don't have all the answers
But I know a thing or two
I see it, believe it
You've been eaten up by pride
If there's one thing you remember
Remember I tried
I don't know how to
Make you understand
Cause you won't listen, won't listen
What's come over you
It's getting out of hand
Just stop your bitchin, your bitchin
If there's one thing you remember...
Know I tried to warn you
I don't have all the answers
But I know a thing or two
I see it, believe it
You've been eaten up by pride
If there's one thing you remember
Remember I tried
Count to ten
Then relax for a while
Simmer down
And regain control
How you are
Sends the shivers to spines
We sit her and hope that it passes by.
And one day it will be fine
So what if you turn back
If taking's a waste of our time
You would leave us only the more upset
Cause that's what you get
Fall in line
And remember your place
Stand up straight
Don't forget the time
How the trials
Never taught you a thing
Its meaning is lost on ears shut tight
And one day it will be fine
So what if you turn back
If talking's a waste of our time
You would leave us only the more upset
Cause that's what you get
Cause that's what you get
I think you should know we've restored our faith
As that was the right thing to do
*Repeat*
So what if you turn back
If talking's a waste of our time
You would leave us only the more upset
Cause that's what you get
Cause that's what you get
*Repeat*
Leave the angels in the city
Leave the angels in the city
Tell them muthaf-ckas I'm forever paid
California king wrestle gators in the Everglades
Drive up out that muthaf-ckin swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that Red rag in your pocket I wanna see your f-ckin resume
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole: I never hesitate
Dre Beats on, smoking that chronic just to meditate
I'ma give 'em hurricanes until another Levee break
You niggas is featherweight, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When a nigga wack found me, shit, I was selling weight
Now a nigga's selling millions, now it's time to celebrate
Performing in front of millions, nigga every race
64 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape
4th album, no 5 mics? Then let 'em hate
But I'm not stopping till I'm the f-cking king in every state
(Hook: Kendrick Lamar)
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
'Cause I wrote that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'mm wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie your knot on a Downtown building, let it tow behind me
Tell 'em they can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga f-ck your feelings, this is me
I'm sick of muthaf-ckers talking about "the West died"
Can't you hear my heart beating?
That's the motherf-ckin West side, you test me, you test God
I'm his son, insane songs, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You won't have no time to run
I'm from the Compton slums and that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where 2 of the best died
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em
Matter of fact, shorten your list nigga, top 5
Game, Biggie, Hov, prolly Pac, Nas, no particular order
Bet a mil that I slaughter, serve niggas, give a f-ck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly
When I'm the nigga sold 5 mil out the gate and numbers do not lie
I gave you the Documentary, shit was a classic
Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the f-ck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waiting for
I'm the lost angel knocking on Satan's door
What the f-ck y'all take me for? I love you cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor, walk up on you
Like "what's going on baby boy?" Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy, or the black Slim Shady, or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin
(Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar)
Kendrick, And I wear pendant on my shoulder, soldier
Like a lieutenant, and the coupe tinted got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac in his prime
Thug life is now on radar
Till the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscing when the LA Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickriding
I'm addicted to Westsiding
Living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
"Compton!", a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, Never TV screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit, now everybody sing that shit
Red, is a very emotionally intense colour.
It enhances Human metabolism, increases respiration rate and raises blood pressure.
It has a very high visibility, it is why stop signs, stop lights and fire equipments are usually painted red.
It also represents one third of California's gang population.
Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area.
Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle
This is what you call me
I strike terror among men
I can't be bothered by what they think
I bare my cross, my soul, myself
I forgive, but I never forget
I've been put upon this earth in female form
But I can handle myself with the best of you
As well as the worst
And I often have
I have the right to remain silent,
But I choose to speak, sing, scream
I am lips, hips, tits
I am the power of a woman
Strong like music
True like friendship
But without my friends
There would be no music
Only spoken word
Fucker!
Fucker!
I am able to change
So I live without regret
Without remorse, only a remix.
I am drunk, I am sober
Heaven doesn't want me 
And Hell's afraid I'll take over
Don't bother trying to censor me
Or shut me up, because it won't work
I am cold and distant
Yet warm and close
To those who deserve to see that side of me
Part of me, the heart of me
You find me so hard to understand in your world
The world you perceive to be so normal
I am deformed, scorned, reborn
I am me, and I know exactly who I am, what I am
And the wrath I bring, the ugly beauty
The lying truth, the virgin whore, the quiet storm
A lover, a fighter, a saint, a sinner
A sister, a daughter, old school, a beginner
I have decorated myself
With love, hate, truth, you
All of you, both of you, none of you
More than one of you
Fucker!
Fucker!
With lips like sugar, eyes like mead
I've watched men
Come and go and cheat
I sleep to dream and dream of sleep
I had a dream, Joe
That you were standing in the middle of an open grove
I had a dream, Joe
That your hands were raised up to the sky
And your mouth was covered in foam
I've been crucified, justified
And mortified by my behavior
Both feminine, and masculine
I am a contradiction and juxtaposition
My relief is my release
And only time will tell
All's well that ends well
I am unsweetened, unclean
Been called drama queen
Ex-girlfriend, ex-member
The tantrum, the temper
I point my finger, take the blame
And this time I will own the name
Because no one is going to ruin me
If I have to, I will ruin myself
And it will be my ruin (my ruin)
Fucker!
Fucker!
Fucker!
Fucker!
Fucker!
I am not dead
I demand I know my rights
I know my rights
You cover illness with flowers
And flowers die
And flowers die
Walk in half view
Of all mirrors
It makes sense to me
Makes sense to me
Never let yourself out
I did, it ruined me
It ruined me
To be morally good
Only rather to love
A devil pretending to be a god
Laws written on paper and paper burns
Eternity is not sunrise
Walk in half view
Of all mirrors
It makes sense to me
Makes sense to me
Never let yourself out
I did, it ruined me
It ruined me
To be morally good
Only rather to love
A devil pretending to be a god
Laws written on paper and paper burns
Eternity is not a sunrise
To be morally good
Only rather to love
A devil pretending to be a god
Laws written on paper and paper burns
Eternity is not a sunrise
You had a better look than I, you caught it from the top of my world
How could they know this?
You're cut wide open, you spill all over the floor
Cut wide open, you're pulling from the ropes
And running from the ones you know
Pray to the pessimist
They told you not forever
They told you not today
Save me, till it's all you can take
You promised me broadway
But you sold me cabaret
Spit it out for better taste
I don't care if you're ready or not, the sentiment tears my hold
You come right up and you tear me open
I spill all over the floor
Cut wide open, it's been rough being broken, all alone, this body better get up
Pray to the pessimist
They told you not forever
They told you not today
Save me, till it's all you can take
You promised me broadway
But you sold me cabaret
Spit it out
Pray to the pessimist
They told you not forever
They told you not today
Save me, till it's all you can take
You promised me broadway
But you sold me cabaret
I don't care if you're ready or not
You're ready or not
Kneel down
Close your eyes
Hit the ground
I want you to, to kneel all day
Alone in this desolate cave
So I said
Scream if you want to
Cause no one is around
I want you to
To scream all day
Cause there's eleven words that I've rehearsed to say
And I say
How I love to hate you! (repeat)
You're
Not so brave
When I'm the snke
And you're my prey
Let me tell you I'll eat all day
Alone in this desolate cave
So I say
Squeal if you want to
Cause no
No one is around
I want you to
To squeal all day
Cause there's eleven words that I've rehearsed to say
And I say
How I love to hate you!(repeat)
James, how I love to hate you
Oh, how I love
How I love to hate you...
Le sourire béat,
Tu flânes la jupe au vent,
Les oscillations de tes courbes ont pris du temps.
Mais attends tu sais,
La roue tourne un jour ou l'autre,
On parlera de toi comme d'un boudin et rien d'autre.
Un tas vicié de cérébré,
Incapable,
Bonne pour l'étable.
Cheveux au vent,
Insouciante et sans regard
On t'a levé au firmament des faire-valoir.
Toujours encline à revoir les finitions,
Toucher ce vide béant attise ma fascination.
Patibulaire,
J'en ai que faire,
Je passe à table les jours de rable.
Envoûtée,
Persuadée,
Que le verni te protège,
Que l'amnésie,
Ça allège.
Alors quand s'arrête le cortège
Alors quand s'arrête ce manège,
C'est toute ta vie qui a fondu comme neige,
C'est toute ta vie qui a volé en l'air.
Oh it's often use many words to say a simple thing
It takes thought and time and rhyme
To make a poem sing
With music and words I've been playing
For you I have written this song
To be sure you known what I'm saying
I'll translate as I go along
Fly me to the moon,
And let me play among the stars.
Let me see what spring is like,
On Jupiter and mars.
In other words, hold my hand,
In other words, darling kiss me.
Fill my heart with song,
And let me sing forever more,
You are all I long for,
All I worship and adore,
In other words, please be true,
In other words, I love you.
...
Fill my heart with song,
And let me sing forever more,
You are all I long for,
All I worship and adore,
In other words, please be true,
In other words, I love you.
See me - put yourself in my place
Be me - put my eyes in your face
Maybe then you'll see why this place terrifies me
And why I've got to get myself away
So hard to deal with the ones who can't feel
They continually blow my mind
No need - I've burned enough times myself
You're like me - sometimes you scare yourself
The things that you think
And the way that you feel
Makes you think you're all alone
When you go outside
And try to find a familiar mind
It really lets you know that you're on your own
So unknown
When those walls close in around you
When all about you doubt you
When the world can live without
Get a grip and keep it
You see how hard they'll shove you
Hat your guts and tell you they love you
Get a grip right now
You see how far you get pushed
How long they'll hold you down
Feed you lies
Drive you insane
Give you poison to kill your pain
Know me - I see the fear in your eyes
Pull back - there are some things to realize
So hard to deal with the ones who aren't real
It's unbelievable what they'll put you through
Twist you up inside
Filthify and punish your mind
You don't have to live like that
You've got to get your self respect
Jump back, get your self respect
You've got to jump back
Keep your self respect intact
You've got to keep it like that
Your self respect
Wir kannten uns seit Jahren sind zusammen abgefahren
Uns gehörte die Welt und dafür brauchten wir kein Geld
Wir haben uns einfach treiben lassen wir wollten nichts verpassen
Wir wollten nicht so werden wie die Leute die wir hassen
Nur ein Blick von dir und ich wusste genau
Was du denkst was du fühlst - diese große Vertrauen unter Frauen
Das hat mich umgehaun
Es war völlig klar ich konnte immer auf dich bauen
Keine Party ohne uns immer mitten rein da zu sein
Wo das Leben tobt ohne jedes Verbot
Sie war geil diese Zeit wir waren zu allem bereit
Und wenn ich heute daran denke und es tief in mir schreit
Tut es mir leid das ich nicht härter zu dir war
Denn ich ahnte die Gefahr sie war da sie war nah
Sie war kaum zu überseh'n doch ich wollte nicht versteh'n
Der Wind hat sich gedreht es ist zu spät
Und warum?
Nur für den Kick - für den Augenblick?
Und warum?
Nur für ein Stück - von dem falschen Glück?
Und warum?
Nur für den Kick - für den Augenblick?
Und warum?
Du kommst nie mehr zurück - komm zurück ...
Ab und zu mal einen rauchen mal in andere welten tauchen
Da war ja noch o.k. was ich gut versteh
Doch dann fing es an mit den Sachen die war'n weniger zum Lachen
Doch du musstest sie ja machen
Ich stand nur daneben konnte nicht mehr mit dir reden
Alles was du sagtest war: Das ist mein Leben
Mein Leben das gehört mir ganz allein und da mischt sich keiner ein
Lass es sein lass es sein - das schränkt mich ein
Ich sah dir in die Augen sie war'n tot sie warn leer
Sie konnten nicht mehr lachen sie warn müde sie war'n schwer
Du hattest nicht mehr viel zu geben denn in deinem neuen Leben
Hattest du dich voll und ganz an eine fremde Macht ergeben
Geld Geld Geld nur für Geld hast du dich gequält
Um es zu bekommen wie gewonnen - so zerronnen
Dafür gingst du auf den Strich aber nicht für dich
Sondern nur für deinen Dealer mit dem Lächeln im Gesicht
Und warum?
Nur für den Kick - für den Augenblick?
Und warum?
Nur für ein Stück - von dem falschen Glück?
Und warum?
Nur für den Kick - für den Augenblick?
Und warum?
Du kommst nie mehr zurück - komm zurück, komm zurück, komm zurück!
Geld Geld Geld nur für Geld hast du dich gequält
Um es zu bekommen wie gewonnen - so zerronnen
Dafür gingst du auf den Strich aber nicht für dich
Sondern nur für deinen Dealer mit dem Lächeln im Gesicht
Und warum?
It began with a mistake
I didn't know what was at stake
I realized I was to blame
I just want things to be the same
I'll be the first to apologize 
And I know these things take time
I think of you and I see red 
Even though you were alright in bed
It's not that we don't get along
It's just that you are always wrong
At least you could pretend 
That I was right in the end
Won't you ever let this die
You can see how hard I've tried
Don't hold this over my head
Let's just say enough's been said
Enough is enough
I know I was to blame
I just want it to be the same
Just shut up and make it right
Enough is enough
I know I was to blame
I just want it to be the same
Just shut up and make it right
It's been a long, long time 
And I've realized my crime
I've tried hard to make amends
To avoid the bitter end
I wanna leave it up to you
But you never seem to come through
Why don't you finish what you start
Before this whole thing falls apart
You know, I'm beginning to think
That you drove me to drink
Not that I'm placing blame
But you're giving me a bad name
Won't you ever let this die
You can see how hard I've tried
I guess it's time to say
Fuck off, I'm gone after today
Enough is enough
I know I was to blame
I just want it to be the same
Just shut up and make it right
Enough is enough
I know I was to blame
I just want it to be the same
Just shut up and make it right
I never thought this would be such a nightmare
Get over your bad self, I don't, I don't really care
I don't, I don't really care
Enough is enough
I know I was to blame
I just want it to be the same
Just shut up and make it right
Just shut up and make it right
Just shut up and make it right
Well the dawn is howling
And the mainframe shakes
Feel like I've been sleeping in a
Cellar full of snakes
My wings have been clipped
My shoes have been stuck with glue
Well if you'll be my enemy
I'll be your enemy too
Now I've got goons on my landing
Thieves on my trail
Nazis on my telephone
Willing me to fail
They were all sent by someone
(Obviously/Well I know it was) you
Well if you'll be my enemy
I'll be your enemy too
I've a bucketful of Babylon
I got a handful of lead
I'm gonna put them in a gun man
Point it at your head
Because you stole all my friends
And you gave me the buffalo blues
Well if you'll be my enemy
I'll be your enemy too
Now from the slime on your tongue
To the nails on your toes
From the scales on your skin
To the stains on your clothes
You're gonna have to make me do something
That I do not want to do
But if you'll be my enemy
I'll be your enemy too
My hands are tied
I'm nailed to the floor
Feel like I'm knocking on the
Unknown door
There's a gun at my back
A blade at my throat
I keep finding hate mail
In the pockets of my coat
Well I've been trying to grow
I been cooling my heels
I've have been working the treadmill
I've been working in the fields
And I can't get to sleep
I can't catch my breath
I can't stop talking and I
Look like death
But I will put right this disgrace
I will rearrange you
If you'll be my enemy
I'll be your enemy too
If you'll be my enemy
I'll be your enemy too
Be my enemy
A long time ago, our point of view
Was broadcast by Mr. Bartholomew
And now the world is full of sorrow and pain
And it's time for us to speak up again
You're slack and sorry, such an arrogant brood
The only purpose you serve is to bring us our food
We sit here staring at your pomp and pout
Outside the bars we use for keeping you out
You've taken everything that you wanted
Broke it up and plundered it and hunted
Ever since we said it
You went and took the credit
It's been headed this way since the world began
When a vicious creature took the jump from Monkey to Man
Monkey to Man (monkey to man)
Monkey to Man (monkey to man)
Yeah, yeah
Every time that man struggles and fails
He makes up some kind of fairytales
After all of the misery that he has caused
He denies he's descended from the dinosaurs
Points up to heaven with cathedral spires
All the time indulging in his base desires
Ever since we said it
He went and took the credit
It's been headed this way since the world began
When a vicious creature took the jump from Monkey to Man
Monkey to Man (monkey to man)
Monkey to Man (monkey to man)
Monkey to Man (monkey to man)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Big and useless as he has become
With his crying statues and his flying bomb
Goes ?�round acting like the chosen one
Excuse us if we treat him like our idiot cousin
He hangs up flowers and bells and rhymes
Hoping to hell someone's forgiven his crimes
Fills up the air with his pride and praise
He's big disgrace to our beastly ways
In the fashionable nightclubs and finer precincts
Man uses words to dress up his vile instincts
Ever since we said it
He went and took the credit
It's been headed this way since the world began
When a vicious creature took the jump from Monkey to Man
Monkey to Man (monkey to man)
Monkey to Man (monkey to man)
Monkey to Man (monkey to man)
Monkey to Man (monkey to man)
Monkey to Man (monkey to man)
Monkey to Man (monkey to man)
Monkey to Man (monkey to man)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why did I come here tonight
With all these feelings inside
You're much too good for this life
And all the pain that you hide
I want to take you away
Wipe the tears from your eyes
But all that stands in the way is
That you don't realize
Why I
I am addicted, addicted to you
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill
I can't get enough of you
I am afflicted, afflicted by you
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill
I can't get enough of you
You you
You you
I want you so bad tonight
That I can almost taste it
I want to take you away
Wipe the tears from your eyes
But all that stands in the way is
That you don't realize
Why I
I am addicted, addicted to you
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill
I can't get enough of you
I am afflicted, afflicted by you
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill
'Cause when it all comes crashing down
Will you still love it
And if tomorrow never comes
Atleast I had it
I am addicted addicted to you
I'm addicted
I can't get enough of you
I can't get enough of you
I am addicted, addicted to you
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill
I can't get enough of you
I am afflicted, afflicted by you
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill
I can't get enough of you
You you
You you
I think of a lot of things when I'm walking
I think of a lot of things walking home
I say them alound, to myself I am talking
I talk to myself when we are alone
Why-ee-i-ee-i is my bleeding heart beating?
Why-ee-i-ee-i am I feeling no pain?
Why-ee-i-ee-i do I cry when I say Good
Bye-ee-i-ee-i, When I'm calling your name?
I look to the left and the right
When I'm crossing
I look straight ahead
When I'm crossing the road
The baggage I carry
The load I am tossing
I look back behind at the
Row that I've hoed.
Chorus, Chorus
I enter the building through the side door, not like an eyesore
Lined up then slaughtered, nothing to die for
Slide past the bar, get through the alcoholics
No gold chain, it's a dookie rope made of garlic
Bloodsuckers looking at me stuck with mice
I got the blood of Christ on a cup of ice
She took my eyes and she put 'em on her somehow
Now I understand why she gets up after sundown
Look at what you did, you don't even see what you did
Won't even look at yourself cause you think everyone is
A reflection of a vampire
Sleep like a vampire
Creep like a vampire
Speak like a vampire
Look at what you did, you don't even see what you did
Won't even look at yourself cause you think everyone is
A reflection of a vampire
Sleep like a vampire
Creep like a vampire
Freak, you are a vampire
Soul's already black and burnt to a crisp but they wear it right
So much in fact that my lips smack with a parasite
Tongues touch, feels like a gun bust
Hit you in the stomach now you're feelin' what love does
But when your lung's crushed
'Cause you've been lied to and humiliated
Facilitated, manipulated, it's so indicative
Of a weaker psyche might be, they feed nightly
Whoopee, two holes in my neck cause you like me? Bite me
Creature of elusiveness, nightlife exclusive fix
Tourniquets of velvet ropes, my four-finger crucifix
I'm pale with a sa-tan from Hell, groomed well
She tried to lift the CC pin from my lapel
Her fingernails longer than her dress is
She bit into my neck, snapped my necklace
And sunk her teeth into breakfast
She licked her lips and said, "I had a really fun night."
Before she jumped in a cab she said, "Get home before sunlight."
(Chorus (Second half))
--Atlanticfayte
I was the boy who said all of my prayers
Laid my clean face on the pillow
Tucked in real tight, so safe and secure
Through the night
I heard a noise, it was probably nothing
It pulled me right out of a dream
If I knew it was you
I'd have jumped out of bed with a scream
I am the one who growls in your closet
I am the one who lives under your bed
Get down - back where you started
Get down - back into hell
Your black soul, you know you're
Black hearted
I smell your sulfurous smell
All of my things that I play with in daylight
You turn into monsters at night
My toys were my friends
Until you taught them all how to bite
You showed me things little boys
Shouldn't see
You scared me with visions of fire
You danced on my bed
With the flames on your head dancing higher
I am the one who growls in your closet
I am the one who lives under your bed
Get down - back where you started
Get down - back into hell
Your black soul, you know you're
Black hearted
I smell your sulfurous smell
I tell ya right now
I don't want your reptile embrace
I don't want to follow you down
To your place
I don't want to be a child of disgrace
You can take your whiskey soaked, foaming
At the mouth, toilet talking, pea soup
Spewing, sweating blood demon breath out
Of my face
Get down - back where you started
Get down - back into hell
Your black soul, you know you're
Black hearted
I smell that brimstone
Get down - back where you started
Get down - back into hell
Your black soul, you know you're
Black hearted
I smell that sulfur
I was the boy who said all of my prayers
Laid my clean face on the pillow
Tucked in real tight, so safe and secure
Through the night
I see the blood on the floor
I touch your naked skin
My spirit can smell your fear
Your screams were made silent
Cut down, left to rotten
Licking your throat
Sucking your anus
Eating your brain
Slash, bash, slash
I still believe in this society
Genocide
Death, murder, kill
Kill in cold blood
Death, murder, kill
Your dead eyes wide open
Homicide
I try to relieve myself 
I try to deceive myself 
What you see is what you get tonight 
What you see is what you get tonight 
Answer me - answer me 
Should I stay - should I pray for you 
Should I stay - should I pray for you 
Answer me - answer me...
I try to extend the line 
I try to pretend I'm fine 
What you see is what you get tonight 
What you see is what you get tonight 
Answer me - answer me 
Should I stay - should I pray for you 
Should I stay - should I pray for you 
Answer me - answer me...
Tell me why - tell me why 
Give me a reason to purify my mind 
Tell me why - tell me why 
Give me a reason to modify my kind 
Answer me - answer me...
os dias parecem séculos
quando a gente anda em círculos
seguindo ideais ridículos
de querer, lutar & poder
as roupas na lavanderia...
o analista passeando na Europa...
as encomendas na Bolívia...
nas fotos um sorriso idiota
os dias parecem séculos
e se parecem uns com os outros
como enfermeiras em filmes de guerra
e violinos em canções de amor
a seguir cenas obcenas
do próximo capítulo
é só virar a página
e o futuro virá...
filmes de guerra, canções de amor
manchetes de jornal, ou seja lá o que for
há sempre uma estória infeliz
esperando uma atriz e um ator
há vida na terra, há rumores no ar
dizendo que tudo vai acabar
(mais uma estória infeliz
esperando um ator e uma atriz)
não tenho medo de perder a guerra
pois no fim da guerra todos perdem
no fim das contas as nações unidas
'tão sempre prontas pra desunião
não tenho medo de perder você
desde o início eu sabia
era só questão de dias
um dia iria acontecer
preciso beber qualquer coisa
não me lembre que eu não bebo
o que só nós dois sabemos
nós sabemos que é segredo
há um guarda em cada esquina
esperando o sinal
pra transformar um banho de piscina
numa batalha naval
agora sinto um medo infantil
mas na hora certa afundaremos o navio
então dê um copo de aguardente
para um corpo sentindo frio
preciso beber qualquer coisa
você sabe que eu preciso
e o que só nós dois sabemos
já não é mais segredo
se alguém, seja lá quem for
tiver que morrer, na guerra ou no amor,
não me peça pra entender
não me peça pra esquecer
não me peça para entender
não me peça pra escolher
entre o fio ciumento da navalha
e o frio de um campo de batalha
chegamos ao fim do dia
chegamos, quem diria?
ninguém é bastante lúcido
pra andar tão rápido
chegamos ao fim do século
voltamos enfim ao início
quando se anda em círculos
nunca se é bastante rápido
Who made you the hero, who made you the judge
Who gave you the right decide
What makes you think that you can't do wrong
Why should the whole world step aside
You can't come and tell me that you're free from sin
'Cause that would be telling a lie
It's not without reason that accidents happen
But still you don't ask yourself why
It takes a hijacking then you go attacking your enemies without any proof
'Cause you like to think the world spins around you
But that's just so far from the truth
Step down from your throne
It's time you woke up before it blows up in your face
No man is an island
So stop breeding violence it's neither the time or the place
Just face up to the fact that you get what you give
So expect a payback in return
No one wants to listen to all your complaining
Your problems are not our concern
Your history haunts you like a knife in the back
Your dreams have all crumbled to dust
According to you you're a god fearing man
But who's version of god should I trust
Everyone is hurting
So don't make it seem as if the only one bleeding is you
'Cause you got off easy in comparisation to the pain that you've put others through
But still you paint up a picture as if you're the victim of some kind of terrible plot
But that isn't true because everyone knows
That you fired the first lethal shot
And still you have the guts to claim to the world
That you're a peace loving country and race
But you don't show compassion all I see is a killer
It's written all over your face
The glow reflects off the street.
When can we meet for a cup of tea?
The lights they tell me I should stop but you say,
"Go, go I'll tell you when to stop."
Is this what you need?
We meet after everyone has fallen asleep.
Even though the car is cold I feel your body heat setting me on fire.
He pays the rent.
He puts the dense indents in the bed.
He pays the rent.
He puts the dense indents in the bed.
The light bounced off her feet and into a tree
Where there's a nest filled with baby birds that starve for their mother.
But she never comes.
This is how I feel.
I wait for food that is already spoiled.
I try and hide myself in fragrances but this smell covers me.
He pays the rent.
He puts the dense indents in the bed.
He pays the rent.
He puts the dense indents in the bed.
She said, "I'm not your minor girl."
She said, "I'm just your dying girl. A girl. A girl"
He pays the rent.
He puts the dense indents in the bed.
He pays the rent.
He puts the dense indents in the bed.
Sing me a song that will last forever
Give me your hand and I'll give you a shoulder
Sing me a song that will seem forever
I'll turn and laugh a ha ha a ha ha
Sing me a song that will last forever
Give me your hand and I'll give you a shoulder
Sing me a song and I will surrender
I'll turn and laugh a ha ha a ha ha
You better calm down
I'm not liking the sound of your voice
I might blow up on you
I can't say, I've been drunk since noon, kaboom
Now the boys won't take me out in public
They wanna drop me like an awkward subject
Let me be clear, I've a mean streak, my dear
Everyone that I meet, I wanna stab in the ear
Except you, 'cause you're like me
We both act miserably
I like you, 'cause you're like me
We both act miserably, it must make us happy
Fuck all these people
I can't stand the looks on their face
Just one more nasty glance
And I might just fuck up the place, a disgrace
Thought I was just a basket case
It's looking more like a kick to the face
Let me be clear, I've a mean streak, my dear
Everyone that I meet, I wanna punch in the ear
Except you, 'cause you're like me
We both act miserably
I like you, 'cause you're like me
We both act miserably, it must make us happy
Kill 'em all
Why can't you see?
Why wont you stop?
You are going down
Does your life stand for anything
Ask yourself this
They watch you fall
Question friendship
Betrayed by the ones that you hold close
The ones that can lie to your face
With no sorrow, with no remorse
There is no tie
That binds moment of thought
Now you have gone too far
You are the one at stake, you are at fault
Why can't you see?
Why wont you stop?
You are going down
Does your life stand for anything?
You are the one at fault
No more time to waste
Do not give them satisfaction
Do not give them the best of you
I can make a perfect picture from a voice
Her serenity oozed into my ear
It didn't take long for her to know me
And I knew it felt good
Pick me up and use me
Pick me up and use me she was saying
You are nothing
You are nothing without me
You are nothing
You are nothing without me
If I am taken,
You think that you can live again
But you are nothing
You are nothing without me
You know I'm here for you,
Right here for you
See I am the punished one
She, she took all the glory
She took everything,
Everything I had to give
Sucking it out of me
But I am always gonna be here
Because I am the punished one
She took everything,
She took all the glory,
Everything I had to give
Sucking it out of me
You are nothing
You are nothing without me
You are nothing
You are nothing without me
If I am taken,
You think that you can live again
But you are nothing
You are nothing without me
Without me, you're nothing
Watching
And waiting
A room without a view
Searching
Through surgery
For something
Lost inside of you
Stand me up and push me forward
Staring back in front of me
Where were you hiding?
I was blind but now I see
Where you were hiding
For so long
Was I so wrong?
Or another casualty?
Where were you hiding?
I feel you looking at me thinking that my happiness
Is just a front and I still want you like I did back then
You walk around this town like
You're somebody's king
But baby trust me there ain't nothing that could
Make me hungry for you again
I'm not affected you've been rejected
Written off my heart
There is no debt here to be collected
I don't want no part
How many times do I have to say it
You used to be smart
I'm not affected you've been rejected
And I don't want no more
You used to walk and I got weak
I used to tremble from your speech
You used to get up in my head
When you crawled into my bed
You had me thinking stupidly
Like you and I would someday be
But that's just it baby, I'm not affected by you baby
You don't make or break me baby
Maybe you just can't tell, I'm not under your spell no more
I've become immune to you.
You so used to running back but I won't let you do that
Rolling up tab ends that the baby's collected
Waiting for the number that clicks on the wall.
It's open season on the weak and the feeble
Their meagre ambitions, their impotent fury
There's bullet proof glass in case there is trouble
No doors in the building between this side and that side.
I've tried to wrestle some unbalanced nightmare
Tell myself over that I don't really live here
But the boys run away leaving blood on the pavement
And a little crowd gathered to watch you pick yourself up
Joining the queue at the video library
To watch ninety five minutes of simulated torture
The conference hall rings to the standing ovation
The people in blue ties rise from the podium
Crazy with power, blinded by vision
The mass-chosen leaders for a brutalised nation
You think you're slick in everyway
Changing up the codes on your phone every day
Is there something that you're trying to hide from me?
I never gave you reason to
Wanna take your calls in the other room
Am I the only one, or is somebody else getting at you?
1 - Is it my imagination
Things ain't always what they seem
'Cause I don't wanna be...
2 - Just another name in your little black book
Just another face in the crowd
And it's got me shook
I gotta mean a little more to you
Than a space on your list of your things to do
Another cheap shotgun in your Benz
Another dumb bitch that you can show your friends
You can call me crazy say I'm insecure
But I don't wanna be just another girl
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, mmm
Strange, how you claim to tell the truth
When the passenger seat in your car's been moved
And you swore that there was no one else with you
And something else you can't explain
Why'd you call me by somebody else's name?
You say it's history
Your playin' days are through, or so you say
Repeat 1
Tell me why ya lying?
Or is it my suspicious mind
I gotta know the truth
If I am just another girl
You're treating wrong
Another one you string along
Is it you and me? Is it two or three?
'Cause I don't wanna be... no, no, no, no
Repeat 2 till end
And when the dawn breaks through the drums start
Beating the morning to the farm
Your grimace widens and your lips part
Sounding the silent alarm
And when the bells explode they scatter
Hitching a hand unto the breeze
The grand bureaucracy grows fatter
Whistling the old melodies
Oh-ee-oh goes the Buckingham jewel guard
Oh-ee-oh goes the cop on the beat
Oh-ee-oh goes the kid in the schoolyard
Oh-ee-oh goes the kid on the street
Hey man what's happenin' with you?
I watched that episode too
Maybe I'll get some Chinese
I'll have the dumplings
No MSG please
And when the night breaks through they wonder
If all they lost was self-respect
They pass the homes of greed and plunder
Still, ling'ring on, the disconnect
Oh-ee-oh sittin' down for the evening
Oh-ee-oh through the civil earthquake
Oh-ee-oh safe in bed and they're dreamin'
Heaven knows if they'll ever awake
Yeah I'll have my coffee black
Hey look we're bombing Iraq
I guess that's the only way
Oh did I tell you we got Fifi spayed?
And when they get to work they hear drums
The boom fills all the empty space
They file papers lada-dee-dum
Trimming their shoebox with lace
Oh-ee-oh but there's somethin' a growin'
Oh-ee-oh through the bustle and hiss
Oh-ee-oh fuck the lawns that need mowin'
Oh-ee-oh there is somethin' amiss
Oh-ee-oh oh-ee-oh oh-ee-oh
Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh-ee-oh
I spend my nights in the factory
Building bombs for the good of the nation
It's my job can't you see?
Massive plutonium radiation
They're gonna rock and destroy
Made from the finest of alloys
They're gonna fly under the radar
Six feet over the Russian horizon
Making The Bombs!
Making The Bombs!
I install electronic components
The little chips that know where home is
It's such a thrill going through my section
When I give them my final inspection
I like the kind that save the buildings
Why take it out on pillars of stone?
You gotta kill you gotta maim
The reak estate is not to blame
Making the world a nicer place
For us to be
Making the world a saver place
For you and me
To keep a lid on the population
We'll drop bombs on selected nations
We've got a big one in current production
We'll teach those slime buckets about reproduction
Making the bombs, Making the bombs
Dropping the bombs, dropping the bombs...
Fade away
Into dust again
And I will see
What I want
And I sing my sad songs
And I hope forever
Denounce the spears
Thrown by mourners
Cherish the fears
Wait for death
And I sing my sad songs
And I hope forever
Oh ahhhhhaaaaa...
You're putting poison here
You're putting poison here
And now you're a cockroach
Crawling on bones
Pretending your war
Has already been won
You never give anything
To any human being
Unless they
Give you something in return
If you get burned
You're gonna burn
And when you finally go away
I'm already gone
And when you finally say what you say
I'm singing this song
Your heads in quite a fix
The demon you never resist is coming
And he's leaning against your front door
The neighbors are asking you what it's all for
And still you could never admit
That maybe you could have prevented destruction
As it came out of your very core
My friend you are starting to become a bore
And when you finally go away
I'm already gone
And when you finally say what you say
I'm singing this song
Instrumental
You put me in the clutches of sin 
Making me a burning specimen 
Of worn animosity, just to aspire 
Leaving absolutely nothing behind 
But now it seems that the tables have turned 
Another dead end, another lesson learned 
One good turn deserves another 
So here it is, motherfucker 
You're just a semi-automatic hate machine 
Semi-automatic hate machine 
Semi-automatic hate machine 
And I've gone ballistic 
Tooth and scratch
Give me an axe to grind
A practice made perfect, matter over mind 
I've got the urge, I've got the urge 
To clean up this place of your scourge 
If cleanliness is next to Godliness 
Then that would make you the devil 
Call it what you will, a pre-emptive strike 
But the first law of nature is to defend one's life 
You're just a semi-automatic hate machine 
Semi-automatic hate machine 
Semi-automatic hate machine 
And I've gone ballistic 
Mine eyes have seen the glory 
Mine eyes have seen the glory 
Grapes of wrath
Grapes of wrath 
You're just a semi-automatic hate machine 
Semi-automatic hate machine 
Semi-automatic hate machine 
And I've gone ballistic 
And you're just a statistic
Effective incentives
How dare you stand corrected
No motives, intentions
A single thought to call your own
Deceptive, defensive
Don't look at me rejected
Conclusions, dillusions
Look at you standing all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone
A passive aggressive
You didn't get the message
A second opinion
A word that turned into a crime
A massive offensive
You seem to me obsessive
Your version diversion
So tell me something I don't know
All alone, all alone, all alone
Effective incentives
How dare you stand corrected
A motive, intentions
Beyond all reconginition
Deceptive, defensive
Don't look at me rejected
A passive aggressive, you didn't get the message
A massive offensive you seem to me obsessive
Conclusions, delusions
Look at you standing all alone.
You are such a hypocrite, so I'm leavin' for a bit
Because I am blessed with soul, something you would never know
When you're this close, it gets hot before its cold
And I will never know you're gone
Whatevers possible becomes impossible
Whoa
This is atonement
You're the painting
You're the pain that I feel
Follow the trail with some bad politics
If they never know I'm gone, they will never notice it
You looked so tame, I saw you in the rearview mirror
You looked so challenged when I caught up, and this is what I do
Sometimes you still think I am crazy when I'm sane
And you will never know I'm gone
Don't ever get too close, 'cause I'm not good up close
Whoa
This is atonement
You're the painting
You're the pain that I feel
Follow the trail with some bad politics
If they never know I'm gone, they will never notice it
No, don't get upset, cause you never played fair
Please, just remember me when I am not around
And I can't forget her lips, so red
Go sit back down, 'cause I can't go back until we just finish
And they will never know were gone
The best has yet to come
The best has yet to come
Whoa
This is atonement
You're the painting
You're the pain that I feel
Follow the trail with some bad politics
If they never know I'm gone, they will never notice it
No, don't get upset, cause you never played fair
Please, just remember me when I am not around for the taking
For the taking
Break
Can we ever forgive love for it's pain
A tragic poem that forever burns on my brain
The city's sweat is scaring her into her dreams
As the songs scream to fill her quiet evening
Lock me up
Put your words on fire till I'm pure
I'm unattainable and crippled with desire
We'll float away from this mother fucking human world
It's a wonder that she laughs I guess I'll call her crying,
"I am not your savior
But I'm crippled with desire"
Let the smile give her everything she needs
But I'm the song, the song she doesn't want to sing
Forgive me as, I burn into the evening.
I run from love, but seem to feel the pain
In these words, tearing me and make me bleed
Then we'd see as if you'll come and find me
Light it enters and melts away emotion
As I watch the sun fuck the ocean crying,
"I am not your savior
But I'm crippled with desire
'Cause I am not your savior
And I wonder
Now I sit here crippled with desire"
Desire, desire, desire...
Break!
I am not your savior
But I'm crippled with desire
'Cause I am not your savior
I wish I were
Now I sit here crippled with desire X 2
Crippled with desire!
Cheated
You don't get what you think you deserve
Coma
Devour everything to deaden the nerve
Chant 1
Gotta cut a profit even if I cut a throat
Perish
All that you build, will be destroyed
Stolen
All your value will crumble to void
Chant 2
Nice guys get crucified gotta find a scapegoat
Build up 1
White
Black
Gray
Red
Status
Wither away inside your golden cage
Victim
Spend more, burry the rage
Chant 3
Wanna get a payrise to justify my worth
Build up 2
White
Black
Gray
Red
Chant 4
White is the colour of purity
Black is the colour of execution
Gray is the colour of urban bland
Red is the colour of revolution
Hello, I'm your saviour
You're such individuals
Everyone agrees
It's going to feel so good
Now I'd pay a high price
To feel nothing at all
I hope all your dreams come true
I hope all your dreams come true
My sympathy you don't need
Your brick wall it stays up
It took so long to build
I hope all your dreams come true
I hope all your dreams come true
People all need a hero
Trust my soul, it's easy
I hope all your dreams come true
I hope all your dreams come true
If they don't what will you do?
I hope all your dreams come true
I hope all your dreams come true
I hope all your dreams come true
I hope all your dreams come true

All your might 
All your pain 
All your tears 
When I'm right before you 
All you've gained 
All my sins 
All my fault 
All my fear 
Swelling up inside me 
All is lost 
You changed the world forever 
Just with your heart of gold 
You changed the world forever 
Now you've been bought and sold
Let me be crucified 
On you 
Let me be tantalised 
By you 
Open up your spirit 
And reveal yourself anew 
Let me be crucified 
On you 
All your sweat 
All your blood 
All your grief 
When I'm right before you 
Where is god? 
All my doubt

Swelling up inside me 
All I feel 
You changed the world forever 
Just with your heart of gold 
You changed the world forever 
Now you've been bought and sold
Let me be crucified 
On you 
Let me be tantalised 
By you 
Open up your spirit 
And reveal yourself anew 
Let me be crucified 
On you
Let me be crucified 
On you 
Let me be tantalised 
By you 
Open up your spirit 
And reveal yourself anew 
Let me be crucified 
On you
Go ahead and rise above, see how far you get on top
Held down just to impair you
We know who's ahead of the game
You know who'll get the blame
You're in the grip of the controller
Do you really want it all back?
See how far you get on top
Held down just to impair you
It's the fear that you can't do right
See how you lose in your life
Cut down, they will impale you
Can you really get it on track?
You tried to make it all stop
Time will tell how much they denied you
You just got burnt by the controller
You just got burnt, they're gonna rule ya
You'll never know how to react
You're sucked to the very last drop
Time will tell what has been denied you
Are you clear in your mind and sight?
Are you clear right out of your head?
Just angry at the things that have failed you
So you wanna get it all back
You tried to make it all last
Tied down just to control you
You just got burnt by the controller
You just got burnt, they're gonna rule ya
Go ahead and rise above, see how far you get on top
Held down just to impair you
We know who's ahead of the game
You know who'll get the blame
You're in the grip of the controller
We know who's ahead of the game
You know who'll get the blame
You're in the grip of the controller
Controller
You just got burnt by the controller
You just got burnt
You just got burnt by the controller
You just got burnt
You just got burnt by the controller
You just got burnt
You just got burnt by the controller

You wouldn't believe in my new belle she flits and weaves a curious spell,
And under my skin there's a place where she resides.
Finding a release in prayers and psalms I will obey her articulate commands,
She is just a coquette and how I wish I could forget.
Breathing new life in to the sad witch and she promised me three wishes and all I wish is she should remain here.
A poisonous saint with a brittle, crippled frame and she fooled me with her motherly gestures, my only guess is she's misguided.
The sins, the sins the heavenly limbs that greet below the red, red lights,
Hold no sway with me now she's my intended.
The jewels around her neck retain a curious sheen, god is in my heart and tearing at the seams,
Her atheist tracts are certainly persuading.
(And I don't know, and I don't want to know, if she floats or drowns, if she floats or drowns.)

Tell me what are you trying to prove
Spreading lies spinning stories
What gain do you get from all of this
Is it fame is it glory
Don't try to be someone that you're not
Cause you know I'm not buying
The more that you open up your mouth
It's more time that you're lying
It's time
To re-
Define
You and me
It's clear
That you
Are my
Enemy
I'm ready
So why don't you come get me
What are you waiting for
There's no point in charades any more
This is war
This is war
I see how you're playing innocent
But I know what you're doing
You smile as you stab me in the back
So that trouble is brewing
To you it's all one big silly game
Just to see me defeated
I hope that you've gotten all your thrills
Did you get what you needed
It's time
To re-
Define
You and me
It's clear
That you
Are my
Enemy
I'm ready
So why don't you come get me
What are you waiting for
There's no point in charades any more
This is war
This is war
You couldn't leave well enough alone
The lights are on but nobody's home
Hey daddy
 Come over here yeah
 Got something for you
 Dicknail
 She liked it
 You know she liked it
 Well she was asking for it
 Dicknail
 I said, I said, "stop"
 I did what you said
 I did what you want
 I was a good girl
 I was a good girl
 I said I said
 I said, "no"
 Hey daddy
 One thing's for certain baby
 You have my guarantee
 You won't forget me
 I said, I said, "stop"
 I did what you said
 I did what you want
 I was a good girl
 I was a good girl
 I was a good girl
 I said I said
 I said, "no"
 Do you remember Christmas morning
 You know it's real because
 Well here comes Santa Claus
 Well she liked it
 You know she liked it
 I'm on your fat claw
Floating round the universe
Fucking in our cosmic hearse
You know time don't ever end
Can't evade those dead zen men
You're the meat in big Buddha's dinner
One day you'll eat us all up too
One day is now
Another unknown soldier
Another lesson learned
Kick the gas can over
Strike a match get back and watch that sucker burn
Keep smiling for the camera
Keep waving to the crowd
Don't let up for an instant
Stay the course and make your mama proud
You're the man
Show'em what you're made of
You're no longer daddy's boy
You're the man
That they're all afraid of
But you're only Cheney's toy
Another unknown soldier
Who's seen it all before
All in the name of Jesus
Behind the razor wire and shackled to the floor
Just keep smiling at the cameras
And keep that twinkle in your eye
We don't need to know the answers
Long as we're safe, just hit your marks and say your lines
You're the man
Show 'em what you're made of
You're no longer daddy's boy
Take a stand
Give 'em what they paid for
'Cause you're only Cheney's toy
They'll take a fork and turn you over
While the fat lady sings
One more pin on one more shoulder
Is all the future brings
For another unknown soldier
Who don't know his own name
And he won't get any older
And he can't see for the shrapnel in his brain
(Multi Chorus)
Good sister, bad sister
Better burn that dress, sister
Scar tissue, blood blister
Suck up on the dregs, sister
I can't and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't and I want to so bad and
Good sister, bad sister
You're different from the rest, sister
Choke, strangle, rip, twist her
Sell me down the river, sister
I can't and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't and I want to so bad
And I try, I try, I try
Come here and sit and talk about it just for a second
Before you sit back down
You're choking on big black bloody mouthfulls of it
You left me lying in your dog descent
And choking on your candy flesh
I'll be the biggest scar in your back
Run down and jagged and naked and blind
I'll be the biggest dick that you ever had
Hey, want it back?
Hey, want it back?
You want it
Good sister, bad sister
Tell me what you want, sister
Better watch your back, sister
Even you can not resist her
I, I can't and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't and I want to so bad
And I try but I can't and I try, I try
Sugar star comes down to talk to ??
She comes to crucify off with your dress
I am not your ruby to gress
And sugar comes from her arteries
I'll be the biggest ... scar
Run down and jagged and naked and blind
I'll be the biggest scar in your sky
You want it bad
You want it bad
You want it bad
She's a-- she is incredulous
And all of my apathy drips off her dress
She wants you in her descent
And choking on her candy flesh
I'll be the biggest scar in your back
Run down and jagged and make it back
I'll be the biggest dick that you ever had
Hey, want it back?
You want it back
You want it
Publicly degrading princess
Ashamed, naked
She's too young to be shaving
At her prime, age ten
Full of Ritalin and Codeine
Very sore, unsatisfied
Silicon inject what's lacking
Just to satisfy some sick fuck
Throw them meat and the dogs want more
Pedi-sinister girl next door
Sleeping beauty
Ate the apple
Pumped full of image
Sweet as saccharine
Handsome princey
Artificial
Keeping her hammered
With girl poison
Slashing away at a duchess
Pop trash, disgust
Sexy little decoration
Pin up girl, age twelve
Pocket money spent on hot pants
Innocence stolen
One more girl on an insect diet
Just to satisfy some sick fuck
Throw them meat and the dogs want more
Pedi-sinister girl next door
So hot, so worth it
Poison, girl poison
Self doubt is an industry
Self harm is a best seller
Sleeping beauty
Ate the apple
Pumped full of image
Sweet as saccharine
Handsome princey
Artificial
Keeping her hammered
With girl poison
Throw them meat and the dogs want more
Pedi-sinister girl next door
An explanation is what we want
We want to know how things could get so fucked up
And how things could get so out of hand
So many times we have waited on others
To stand up for us
And act on what we believe
Is so fucked and wrong with our generation
I know we are all so angry
I know I am so fucking angry
So I'm not waiting anymore!
My rebellion starts here
I can't wait on revolution forever
My revolution STARTS HERE
Certain things I love, Spend my time
I guess I'll have to unhook those hooks
This woman literally
Felt she had a hook in her head
Rip it up Live it down
Make it big Keep it clean
Shake it off
Take him home Take it off
Do him good Keep it up
Shake it off
He's a fucking drag, But if you don't then you watch him go
If you can you see it home, You be strong
And when you die it's a shame
But you old life stays the same
She has a hook in her head
I saw this lady close her eyes
The bottle slipped between her fingers
And slid along the aisle
If I were a man I'd have a gun, But I'm so bone tired
I'm so bone tired, I'm old...
I watch the snow make slow time
I watch the snow cover up the bottle
So I can slip between
I will read the label from underneath
I wear the circle in my sleep
Mój jest ten czas
Każdy z was jest mój
Mój jest ten świat
Każdy z nich jest mój
I każda rzecz, każdy ktoś
Każdy włos, każde zło
I każdy sen, każdy głos
Wszystko to moje jest...
Mój jest ten czas
Obraz twój
Każdy z was....
Ja! (4 razy)
Mnie, wszystko mnie
Należy się wszystko mnie
Ja liczę się
Wszystko i nic
Niewarte mnie
I każda rzecz, każdy ktoś
Każdy włos, każde zło
I każdy sen, każdy głos
Krzywda? Nie! Ona nie!
Ja! (8 razy)
Mnie wszystko mnie!
Więc skoro wszystko twoje jest
Czemu jesteś ciągle sam?
Czemu nikt nie kocha Cię?
Miałam dosyć!
Dlatego nie masz mnie
Co tobie pozostało?
Twoje smutne "ja"!

He put his hands up
Was not an act of war
He put his hands up
Was not an act of war
Abyssinian, he had a Spanish wife
And for your cause
You will test their lives
For five hundred years
Five hundred years
Five hundred years
War, war, war
I saw horses fall
Andalusians
I saw them fall
For no cause, no cause at all
There is brightness here
Far from campaigns
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down
There is brightness here
Far from crusades
Brightness here
Keep your blade
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down
I'm tired of feeling hateful
I'm tired and I can't breathe
So tired that I would be grateful
If you close the door when you leave
That's me diggin' my heels in
That's me with the holy ghost
'Scuse me but I don't remember
Where were you when I needed you most
And I'm tied to the sky
As you claw at my eyes
And I wait for the flood
I swim in blood
As I crawl to my knees
And I beg your disease
Taste the ice on your breath
As you catch your death
I close my eyes
Embrace me
Deliver me
Hey you the voice of reason
Hey you are you listening to me
It's you that I can't believe in
I don't buy what I don't see
Say good-bye 'cause I don't need
And I'm tied to the sky
As you claw at my eyes
And I wait for the flood
I swim in blood
As I crawl to my knees
And I beg your disease
Taste the ice on your breath
As you catch your death
I close my eyes
Embrace me
Deliver me
And I'm tied to the sky
As you claw at my eyes
And I wait for the flood
I swim in blood
As I crawl to my knees
And I beg your disease
Taste the ice on your breath
As you catch your death
I close my eyes
Embrace the wave
Abandon me
Save the day
That I won't see
Deliver me
When I'm locked in my room
I just want to scream
And I know what they mean
(One more day of eating and sleeping)
Speak to me, speak to me
I'm not spoken for, I'm ready to talk
Look at me, look at me
I've been broken up and shaken down
Speak to me, speak to me
I'm at the edge of myself I'm dying to talk
Look at me, won't you look at me
Back once more at the point of no return
When I'm locked in my room
I just want to scream
And I know what they mean
Only the strong
(Hirst/Moginie)
Don't you give me give me give me your borrowed time
Don't you give me give me give me your recycled line
Who do you think you are?
You must think you're something
Don't you give me give me give me you're here to help me
Got to get with the program, I don't need no charity
I don't need shit and you ain't nothing
And if I made a perfect world you'd be gone
Don't give me give me give me your misguided help
Don't give me your nothin', I can do it myself
Well I don't want shit and I don't need nothing
Don't you give me give me give me your look of concern
I don't need your meddling when you gonna learn
Well you ain't shit and you ain't nothin'
Well I just made my perfect world-oops you're gone
Well now you know what it feels like not to belong-so long
So don't you give me give me give me your nothing-no
Don't you give me give me give me your nothing-no
Don't you give me give me give me your nothing-no
Don't give me your second-hand sympathy
Don't give me your nothin', just let me be
Who do you think you are?
You must think you're something
Don't you give me give me give me your worried tone
You can't fool me with that crap just leave me alone
And I don't need it, I don't need nothing
Now I have a perfect world, now you're gone-oh oh oh
Don't give me your nothin', don't give me your nothin'
Don't give me give me give me that "What did I do?"
You don't have to do nothing, you're just being you
I'll tell you why, you ain't nothing
If you make your perfect world you will find
The only place that's perfect is in your mind
What's perfect for you is like a hell for me
Two perfect worlds, it just cannot possibly be-oh oh oh oh
Don't give me your nothin'
Don't give me give me give me your "I'll be there"
I don't believe how you lie, you don't care
Don't give me your shit, don't give me your nothin'
Don't give me give me give me your "I love you"
They just are words and the words ain't true
You're full of shit, your words mean nothing
ANd I just made my perfect world, now you're gone
And in my perfect world your perfect world don't belong-so long
No no-don't give me your nothin'
No no-don't give me your nothin'
No no-don't give me your nothin'
No no-don't give me your nothin'
When I stole a twig from our little nest
And gave it to a bird with nothing in her beak
I had my balls and my brains put into a vice
And twisted around for a whole fucking week
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you let that trash
Get a hold of your cock, get stoned on my hash?
Why'd ya do it she said, why'd you let her suck your cock?
Oh, do me a favour, don't put me in the dark
Why'd ya do it, she said, they're mine all your jewels
You just tied me to the mast of the ship of fools
Why'd ya do it, she said, when you know it makes me sore
'Cause she had cobwebs up her fanny and I believe in giving to the poor
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you spit on my snatch?
Are we out of love now, is this just a bad patch?
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did?
You drove my ego to a really bad skid
Why'd you do it, she said, ain't nothing to laugh
You just tore all our kisses right in half!
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did?
You drove my ego to a really bad skid
Why'd ya do it, she screamed, after all we've said
Every time I see your dick I see her cunt in my bed
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd ya do what you did?
Betray my little oyster for such a low bid
The whole room was swirling
Her lips were still curling
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did?
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did?
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd ya do it, she said
Why'd you do what you did?
Oh, big grey mother, I love you forever
With your barbed wire pussy and your good and bad weather
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did ...
Ah, I feel better now.
You know I've got so much to say
But I'm infected, and you're the new disease of today
You try and seize the day but your infected,
You're the new disease of today
What do you know about relationships?
It's been awhile and I just can't handle this.
Faking smiles, breaking promises,
Somethings wrong and I just can't balance it.
I try and feel the same but in my dreams your all that I see.
You keep her safe but you keep her from me
This is not what I want, this is not what I need.
You know that I know that we're infected
She's still mine she belongs to me
This is not what I want, this is not what I need.
You know that I know that we're infected.
I drink too much just to fall asleep,
Cause in my dreams you're all I see.
No matter what you did or who fucked
I'd go through hell for you no matter.
I'd go through hell for you no matter what,
This is not what I want this is not what I need,
No matter what you did or who you fucked,
This is not what I want this is not what I need,
I'd go through hell for you no matter what,
This is not what I want this is not what I need.
No matter what you did or who you fucked
I'd go through hell for you no matter what.
This isn't over this isn't over
There's something left in me
This isn't over this isn't over
And I hope you feel the same
I'll show you no love
Stomp Box speak my thought
Vent these voices from the dark
Shout Shout Shout Shout 
Scream it out
Blast your missive
Tell the wordless message
Little Stomp Box
Tear it from my heart
Stomp box voice of fear
Pour the poison in my ear
Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill me now
Free the demon
Hear the ceaseless screaming
Litte Stomp Box 
Tear it from my heart
När det är slut på mitt liv och jag ligger på min dödsbädd
När jag ligger på min dödsbädd då kan du komma hit
Då skall jag lyssna som ett svin på dig, din jävla subba
När det är slut på mitt liv
När jag ligger på min dödsbädd
Då kan du komma hit
Då skall jag lyssna på din klagosång
Men just nu ska du inte titta hit
Det var en vanlig blöt höstdag, ovetandes om allt som var
Var jag glad, för jag visste vad jag sa och det jag sa ja det var jävligt bra
Steg upp som en lärka... 
..För att bli skjuten i bitar utan att någonting märka
Tänk dig en flygfärd, underbart och soligt
Vindar som lyfter, klyschor blir roligt
Tinfint, småfint, storfint - jättefint
Man är i form och fin fas
Hela registret, allt du kan komma på
I synonymer till fantastiskt, ja det var vad jag var då
Men jag kom ner med en duns, jag fick skrubbsår i skrevet
Det skall du få höra hela livet
När det är slut på mitt liv
När jag ligger på min dödsbädd
Då kan du komma hit
Då skall jag lyssna på din klagosång
Men just nu hör jag bara skit
När det är slut på mitt liv
När jag ligger på min dödsbädd
Då kan du komma hit
Då skall jag lyssna på din klagosång
Men just nu ska du inte titta hit
Som en tapet sitter du fast
När det är slut på mitt liv
När jag ligger på min dödsbädd
Då kan du komma hit
Då skall jag lyssna på din klagosång
Men just nu ska du inte titta hit
När det är slut på mitt liv
När jag ligger på min dödsbädd
Då kan du komma hit
Då skall jag lyssna på din klagosång
Men just nu hör jag bara skit
Way too detached to fight the waves...
Reptiles have overtaken everything... but there's still so much to save.
Don't ever let them change your face.
Don't ever let them change your face.
Let them feast upon their own shit.
Let them split their tongues to lie with both ends.
Let them fill their plates with the dead.
Never let them make your face real estate.
(×2)
Let them feast upon their own shit.
Let them split their tongues to doublespeak again.
Let them fill their plates with the dead.
Never let them make your face a mask to hide behind...
A part of their design... An accomplice to this crime...
A product they can buy or sell in any way.
If that's all that you can save, never make it real estate.
Maledetto me che sto morendo
Per un attimo di vento
Perdo tutto in un momento
E proprio questo sono stanco 
Di donare confidenza
A chi invece non ti pensa
E ti abbandona come merda
Tanto Luca è forte e regge
E non sa cos'è il rancore
Se ti va dagli un ceffone
Comunque meglio non chiamare 
Anche se soffre come un cane
E' un amico che non vale
Buono solo a cantare
Ma quante notti al caldo stretti, stretti
Chiusi in una stanza
Senza uscite e pregiudizi
Solo con la voglia di star bene e divertirsi
Quello che vuoi tu.
RIT: Usami, usami, usami quando vuoi
Usami, usami, usami.
Maledetto me che stò cedendo
Che sia un sogno o sia un intento
Son disposto a dimostrare
Cosa ho dentro e fino in fondo
Non mi abbasso a certi schemi
Per denaro o altri valori
L'importante è che io riesca
A stare in piedi anche domani
E non servirà un abbraccio
Basta e avanza il mio coraggio
E la ferma convinzione
Che sei il sole e non un raggio
Non si sa mai chi sarai
Se vincente o perderai.
E come dirlo allora che non serve
Darsi addosso e farsi male, male veramente
Quello che ti insegna e non ti farà capire niente
Rende inutili. Io non ci sono, adesso
RIT: Usami, usami, usami quando vuoi
Usami, usami, usami e dopo buttami.

Every girl I meet, always talking bout "I don't even wanna know Hopsin, ewe
Yeah, he got some skills but every time he put them eyes in it look like he popped some pills
I just wanna know Marcus, he's a sweet little innocent boy, oh God
I'd date him with no prob. And if he wanted to I'll let him beat the pussy with no condom."
Bitch, what's your problem. You expect me to be optim
Mistic, With the mischief you bring you senseless bitch you out of
Your mind I know you like the fact I'm so bad when I spit up on the track
Black and I rap with a little bit of swag and happen to have a little money in the back

A loose vaginal passage, uh uh bitch put that back in the package

This is your life.
Worthless denial across your face,
Control feeble minds then destroy our race.
Helpless die for you in vain,
Devour all our pride lead us to disgrace.
Wake up nation,
See the reason,
Why we've become,
Hates own victim.
If the answer is so clear then why are we so blind?
Escape from ourselves and leave it all behind.
Thoughtless trust into the lies,
Resent what your told see the truth inside.
Senseless accusations rise,
Divide ourselves from what they call divine.
This is your life.
Don't be so blind.
This is your life.
Don't be so blind.
Wake up nation,
See the reason,
Why we've become,
Hates own victim.
If the answer is so clear then why are we so blind?
Escape from ourselves and leave it all behind.
If the answer is so clear then why are we so blind?
Escape from ourselves and leave it all behind.
Take a look at what you believe in.
Take a chance and follow my reason.
Now we all unite in unison.
I can't be stoppped.
If the answer is so clear then why are we so blind?
Escape from ourselves and leave it all behind.
If the answer is so clear then why are we so blind?
Escape from ourselves and leave it all behind.
Escape from ourselves and leave it all behind. [x4]
It's still so dark because it's
Still so early and the
Chipper little girlie at the front desk doesn't mind at all
These phony living rooms and
Fake plants are killing me
This bad coffee's filling me with equal parts joy and rage
Put my makeup on and crack in half
I choke back a laugh
Find the camera with the red light
Good Morning Tucson!
The lights come on and so I smile wide and say
Good Morning Tucson!
I throw to you before I throw the rest away
When I was coming up I
Got the donuts which means
I got the donuts that I wanted
There was no young punk
To steal my jelly glazed
And I am still sort of amazed that you can be born in the nineties
When I don't like what they talk about
I take the earpiece out
But they just cue me through the window
Good Morning Tucson!
The lights come on and so I smile wide and say
Good Morning Tucson!
I throw to you before I throw the rest away
While they do the weather I pretend I'm writing something
But I'm really far away
Really far away
I keep my smile warm in case they turn the camera on
'Cause now I have something to say
I have something to say
The camera's melting but I
Just keep going, it's been a
Pleasure knowing you I wish you all the best of luck
When the prompter dies I'm
Comfortable winging it I'm
Practically singing it, the song that tears the world apart
Through the smoke beyond my parking space
I see my giant face
On the billboard by the highway
Good Morning Tucson!
The lights come on and so I smile wide and say
Good Morning Tucson!
I throw to you before I throw the rest away
Warum bin ich so schüchtern?
Ich bin so scheu und unauffällig,
weder witzig noch gesellig.
Ich gebe mich nicht selbstbewußt
und hab kein Feuer in der Brust.
Bin ich in der Öffentlichkeit,
überkommt mich Unsicherheit.
Ich kriege keinen Ton heraus,
wünsch mir ein großes Schneckenhaus.
Warum bin ich so schüchtern,
zurückhaltend und nüchtern,
bescheiden und verklemmt,
unsicher und gehemmt?!
Ich besitze kein Temperament,
bin nicht spontan und mitreißend,
handle vernünftig und gesetzt,
tu nie etwas, das richtig fetzt.
Hab Angst, etwas falsch zu machen,
dass alle über mich lachen.
Mein ganzes Leben bin ich schon
die Langeweile in Person.
Warum bin ich so schüchtern,
zurückhaltend und nüchtern,
besonnen und vernünftig,
wie einer über 50?!
Ich hab die ganze Scheiße satt.
Ab morgen wendet sich das Blatt.
Nun werden mit harten Drogen
andre Seiten aufgezogen:
Hemmungslos mein Geld verprassen,
Frauen an die Titten fassen,
kotzen in der Öffentlichkeit,
nackt rumspringen, mit Beine breit,
laut versaute Witze reißen,
lachend auf die Strasse scheißen,
endlich so sein, wie sich ´s gehört,
und nicht mehr verhaltensgestört!
Ein wilder, starker Tiger,
ein Supermann, ein Sieger,
gelenkt von seinen Trieben,
wie es die Frauen lieben!
Warum bin ich so schüchtern,
zurückhaltend und nüchtern,
sensibel und verletzlich,
mit einem Wort: Entsetzlich!
Turn on the radio, nah fuck it
Turn it off
Fear is your only god on the radio, nah fuck it
Turn it off, turn it off
Turn on the radio, nah fuck it
Turn it off
Fear is your only god on the radio, nah fuck it
Your savior's my guillotine
Crosses and kerosine
Merge on the networks, slagin' nerve gas
Up jump tha boogie then bang, let'em hang
While the paranoid try to stuff the void
Let's capture this AM mayhem undressed
And blessed by the lord
Tha power pedulum swings by the umbillical cord
Shock around the clock, from noon till noon
Men grabbin' they mics and stuff 'em into tha womb
Terror, the product ya push
Well I'm a truth addict, aww shit I gotta head rush
The sheep tremble and here come the votes
Thrown from the throat, new cages and scapegoats
Undressed and blesses by the lord
Tha same devil that run around Managua with a sword
Check the new style that Ollie found
I tune in with a bullet to shut down the devil sound
Shut down the devil sound
Tha programs of Vietnow
Shut down the devil sound
Turn on the radio, nah fuck it
Turn it off
Fear is your only god on the radio, nah fuck it
Turn it off, turn it off
Turn on the radio, nah fuck it
Turn it off
Fear is your only god on the radio, nah fuck it
Your savior, my guillotine
Crosses and kerosine
Flex the cerebellum, fire
Somebody gotta shell 'em
Those evil-angelists
Hittin' the AM playlist, paid to say this
That one inhuman, illegal, single woman
The one without a room
The transmission wippin' our backs
Yeah, comin' down like bats from Stacey Koon
Terror, the product you push
Well I'm a truth addict, oh shit I got a head rush
The sheep tremble and here come the votes
Throw from the throat, new cages and scapegoats
One caution, the mics a detonate unwound
To shut down the devil sound
Shut down the devil sound
Check the heads bow in Vietnow
Shut down the devil sound
Is all the world jails and churches?
Is all the world jails and churches?
Is all the world jails and churches?

Fear is your, fear is your, fear is your only god
What's this
That I see
Have you turned yourself from thee
You are not
What you portray
Any longer.
Well
There it is
No more comfort
Will comfort me
You are not
What you appear
Anymore.
Let it not subside
That beacon falls from your eyes
There's nothing left but change
Well
Quietly
My eyes quality
"Sight to see"
You are not
What you appear any longer.
Let it not subside
That beacon fallen from your eyes
There's nothing left but change
What was, what will be
Have you turned yourself from me
You are not
What you appear to be
Any longer.
Longer
Look at you
You wouldn't do this to... me
Well
Quietly
My eyes ???
"Sight to see"
You are not
What you appear
Any longer.
Longer, oh
If, by chance, you come for me
I won't slip away
If, by chance, you come for me
I won't slip away
From you
Me...
You wouldn't do this to... me.
Everyone's a let down
It just depends on how far down they can go
In every circle of friends there's a whore
The one who flirts
And does a little more
But who's to say?
This is a social scene anyway
And everybody wants to explore the new girl
Caught up in her own hard liquor world
But liquor doesn't exist in my world
But liquor doesn't exist in my world
And if you lie you don't deserve to have friends
If you lie you don't deserve to have them
If you lie you don't deserve to have friends
If you lie
You are a sell out
But you couldn't even do that right
So your price tag has been slashed
And now you're chillin' on a half priced clearance rack
You are a sell out
But you couldn't even do that right
So your price tag has been slashed
And now you're chillin' on a half priced clearance rack
The social scene where she gets her fix
Has been broken since '86
Now just look at that social clique
Do you really wanna be a part of it?
Let's not let us forget
Where she gets the habit
She gets the pills from her skills
She gets the skills from the pills
And just look at that clique
Do you really wanna be the star of it?
You are a sell out
But you couldn't even do that right
So your price tag has been slashed
And now you're chillin' on a half priced clearance rack
You are a sell out
But you couldn't even do that right
So your price tag has been slashed
And now you're chillin' on a half priced clearance rack
If you lie you don't deserve to have friends
If you lie you don't deserve to have them
If you lie you don't deserve to have friends
If you lie
Everybody is a let down
It just depends on how far down they can go
You are a sell out
But you couldn't even do that right
So your price tag has been slashed
And now you're chillin' on a half priced clearance rack
You are a sell out
But you couldn't even do that right
So your price tag has been slashed
And now you're chillin' on a half priced clearance rack
Oh, honey I'm a mess
Oh, a useless set of legs
Oh, honey I'm a waste
Oh, honey I'm a wreck
But I will maintain
Time to spend
In the reading truck ??
That always runs slow
Oh, oh, honey I'm a mess
Oh, honey I'm a wreck
Oh, honey I'm a waste
Aw, honey you're a bitch
What a useless set of legs
But I'm a moving train
Time to sing
And the leading clock
It always runs slow
I will maintain
Time to sing ??
In the leading truck
That always runs slow
I will maintain
Time to sing ??
In the leading truck
That always runs slow
Bitch
Hey!
Love her in the evenin'
Show your home at night
Always a little lover
She will treat you right
Does she act good?
Does she talk nice?
Does she dress cool?
She's nobody's fool
Set her soul on fire
And make love to your one desire
Love her... and she'll return it
Oh
She don't need no mustang
No parkling penthouse too
All she wants is your lovin'
All she wants is you
Does she speak French?
Act cool?
She'll cook soul food, know what I mean
Set her soul on fire
And make love to your one desire
She will love you, if you return it
Oh
Keep her warm in winter
Protect her when it's warm
Love her, love her, love her
And your love will go on and on
Does she speak French?
She will love you
No one above you
Give you children, if you want any
Set her soul on fire
And make love to your one desire
She will love you, if you return it
I got one thing I gotta say...
Return it
Return my love (x6)
I was sitting, waiting, wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you would see the signs
But lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't the lord no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody
Don't make them love you
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?
I sang your songs I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
But putting up with them
Wasn't worth never having you
Maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines because they're directed at you
I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool
I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery
You keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why it had taken me so long
But lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
Because waiting on love
Ain't so easy to do
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?
Put me up
Draw a letter on my skin
With your blood
Scream it out loud
There is so much to laugh about
Show me to everyone
With your finger pointing at my shame
Make some stories up
I am the witch that you blame
All the misery you feel
You pass on to me
Happy now
I am down on the ground
Happy now
Like you wanted
Happy now
I am down on the ground
Are you happy now?
Happy now
Beat me up
Throw your rude insults against my face
You're so sure
I am the worse piece of this human race
Love can't be forced as you know
Your thought of revenge makes you blind
You wish me hell on earth
All those bad things are on your mind
All the misery you feel
You pass on to me
Happy now
I am down on the ground, yeah
Happy now
Like you wanted
Happy now
I am down on the ground, yeah
Are you happy now?
Let me go, let me go
In your pain you blame me
Let me go and forget - and forget - me
Happy now
I am down on the ground,
Happy now
Like you wanted
Happy now
I am down on the ground, yeah
Are you
Are you
Are you happy now?
I hope you're really felling happy now
Yeah
I'm in a perfume heaven
With a cement sky
I wanna rip her head off
And I don't know why
I wanna think of nothing
Think I'll drink the sea
I wanna feel him crawl all over me
I wanna drive to vegas in your nazi car
I wanna be in your head while you're at a bar
I wanna hang your windows when you've gone to the sea
I wanna feel him crawl all over me
I just wanna lie ...
I just wanna lie here
Just wanna lie here
Just wanna lie here next to you
I just wanna lie here
Just let me die here
Just let me die
I just wanna lie
I just wanna lie here
Just wanna lie here
Just let me die here next to you
I just wanna lie here
Just wanna lie here
Just wanna lie
I wanna do you favors
Want to span time
I wanna feel your heart race in mine
I wanna rip you open while you're laughing at me
It'd be the last day I was happy
I just wanna lie here
Just wanna lie here
Just let me lie here next to you
I just wanna lie here
Just let die here
Just let me die
I just want to die
I just wanna lie here
Just wanna lie here
Just let me die here next to you
I just wanna lie here
Just wanna lie here
Just wanna lie
Lie ... I just wanna ...
Lie ... I just wanna ...

Got my head over water, time to tum straight
Got me down through the pressure of the hot plate
Got me deep inside the drum you see it's blackness
Got you bouncin' at the front to catch
The phatness
Got me coming through this time I see the quickness
When we hit you with the lick you'll see the wickedist
Don't try hold us in the corner be

Stay right where you are! Get out of that bed and get down on the floor!
Get out of that bed right now!
Right now, get down on the cement! 
I don't care if you're nude, get down on the cement! 
I don't care if it's freezing!
Where's the drugs?! 
We know you've got some drugs! Shut up, man! 
Make him shut up, man! Stay right where you are! 
Where's the drugs? We know you got some drugs! 
We know you got 'em, we know you got 'em?
We have people who say you did it, man!
We know you did it! 
Sheets off
Flashlight in your eyes
Freeze
Guns in your gut
Strip down
Body search
Cough up
Or stomach pump
To fight the war on drugs
You must give up your rights
You blink, you die
I hate you more than my job
NO!
Stop!
Please!
NO!

Hey, your name isn't on the lease! Where are you supposed to live?!
What is this, NWA?! Turn that off!
Smash that stereo! Drugs could be inside the speaker! Smash the speakers!
Smash that TV! Start cutting open their furniture! 
Random neighborhood sweeps
Copters break up house parties
Zero tolerance for pot
Easier to get hard stuff
Costs over 3 times more
To keep an addict in jail
Than to treat those trying to quit
But no drug war funds for clinics
NO!
Stop!
Please!

Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, how low, how low?
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Yay!
Hey
Yay
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, how low, how low?
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Yay!
Hey
Yay
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, was hard to find
Oh well, whatever, never mind
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, how low, how low?
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us

She asked if you could stay 
Did ya think about me when 
You almost turned away 
Did ya think about me when 
You picked up the phone 
Should have let it just ringing
And made it seem like everything 
Was the same as it had always been 
Did ya think about me being half awake and crying, 
Lying on the floor and waiting for the break of day 
Didn't think about tearing me apart, 
At any moment in the night you could have tried to make it right
Why, why, why? 
Now in an afterthought 
Were you thinking about me 
Don't know what you did it for 
'Cause you were thinking about you, so 
You want me to believe 
You were thinking about me 
It isn't hard for me to see you didn't stop for anything 
How 'bout me being half awake and crying 
Lying on the floor and waiting for the break of day 
Didn't think about tearing me apart
At any moment in the night you could have tried to make it right
Give me one good reason why in time I should believe in you 
You had me, you had it, everything 
So close your eyes and remember all those lies 
That you never say when you pretend that you 
Will be with me again 
Did ya think about me being half awake and crying, 
Lying on the floor and waiting for the break of day 
Didn't think about tearing me apart, 
At any moment in the night you could have tried to make it right
Why, why, why? 
Did ya think about me being half awake and crying, 
Lying on the floor and waiting for the break of day 
Didn't think about tearing me apart
At any moment in the night you could have tried to make it right. 
Why, why, why?
(Virtuoso)
I'm omnipotent
You claim to win battles
So when the beat starts
I'll punch the tree bark
And pass the chainsaw to a ????? heart
Severing every animal
I'm doing dirt like earthworms
I'm sick and original
Boy, I gave birth to the first germs
I spit the acetate
To make your lips evaporate
The Master Ape
Bare hands will decapitate and bash your face
Pass the eight, sack of shake
Twisted in plasma tape
I came for y'all through the castle gate
I come across a substance yet I couldn't lacerate
Virtuoso is an unidentified flying object to make your space shuttle ???????
So while you drunks look for a hook and say you masturbate
Telling 7L to scratch a plate
In due for respect I slap your face
Ask to make my specs, I'm a tackle ya
You're a neck and I'm Dracula
Have sex in the back of a black Lex or an Acura
Met with the, Jedi Mind Tricks
We rhyme sick and side ????? for dime chicks
I'll strangle you, use my same hands to give you the Heimlich
So you can live to face more punishment from my divine lips
(Jus Allah)
Jus Allah prays on the minds of the young
Silencing the devil that speaks with forked tongue
Taste my blade sharpness
Ranked in no class like Marxist
The heartless
Rise out of darkness
I'm the last head you should ever try to fuck with
Be the next member in the cast of my snuffed vics
Rough shit, don't even attempt sleeping
At war with the demons that live in infernal regions
Spawned from eternal semen bred flesh predators
Wings of the arms when you heels like Pegasus
Grabbing your leg, so you live to the heavenless
Drop this prejudice and follow me to Exodus
(Ikon the Hologram)
We ravenous
Exhume the tomb of Lazarus
You blasphemous
We bring war to pacifists
Tarantulas, burn flesh like a nine glock
Your mind stops from nine of my divine shots
Pine box is fine for a killer to run
Swing from vines and rhyme like Atilla The Hun
Bring the gun, your tongue is what I'm slicing
We slap tracks and attack like M. Bison
Ilohem, fuck the pagans we mark them
And take turns to burn religious doctrines
Concoctions of pain hits from eight angles
Locked in the brain to lacerate ankles
(Esoteric)
Yo, I rip mics, stick lames
Wreck nights, spit flames
Lead pipes, split frames
Kid ain't shit changed
Act trife
I grab the mic and bag your wife
Sacrifice you twice
Motherfucker in after life
Decimate your paradise
Burn tracks like thermostats
My personal attacks snap back to murder cats
I might advise
You type of guys should revitalize
Your man power, I sabotage the fire flys
With a dope rhyme
Take control of your soul
Grab a forty fo' for the po's
Get your broken nose
Opponents go to shows
Now they know their robes damn hoes that fold my clothes
I bark at these, mark emcees, park and freeze
My world hypothesis
Kill beasts like heart disease
Man please
You can never fuck with the Eso-pterodactyl
My rap skills will thrash you
Motherfucker

To let somebody touch you?
So hot, so cold, so far so out of control
Hard to come by, and harder to hold

Lightning strikes
And silver motorbikes
Are roaring down the open road
Wind on my skin
I'm hungry to begin
And my cup has overflowed
So let fall the rain
Down into these desert veins
I'm taking back what they stole
While there's diamonds in the mind
Can't afford to be confined
By someone else's pigeonhole
So I made up my mind
I made up my mind
Gonna move on ahead
'Stead of lagging behind
Half past seven
Way up in the heaven
The stars are singing in the sky
Lying half dressed
Your head upon my breast
Listening to the oceans lullaby
Standing where we are
It seems so far
From the cold light of day
Where the faces full of grief
And the grinding of the teeth
Has been eating my belief away
So I made up my mind
I made up my mind
Gonna move on ahead
'Stead of lagging behind
('Stead of lagging now)
Cracks in the veneer
The light so severe
Shining down the avenue
Try to join the throng
But it's feeling all wrong
What are you supposed to do?
Shoulder that despair
Take a lung of dirty air
Turn to watch the sun set red
On the ruins of a culture
And a sky that's filled with vultures
Circling over your head
So I made up my mind
I made up my mind
Gonna move on ahead
'Stead of lagging behind
'Stead of lagging behind
I made up my mind
I made up my mind
Just one last time please be nice to me
Come over here
Just be nice to me and come and sit beside me here
Just one last time please be nice to me
Come over here
One more time again
Come on give me just a little bit now
Come on let me have a final kiss now
Come on give me just a little bit now
Fool me please just one more time again
The first time always hurts you know
Wait till tonight, I'm gonna show
The last time always hurts the most
One more time again
The first time always hurts you know
Wait till tonight, I'm gonna show
The last time always hurts the most
One more time again
Just one last time please be nice to me
Come over here
Just be nice to me and come and sit beside me here
Just one last time please be nice to me
Come over here
One more time again
I'd remind you of your promises now
All your lies are bound to break your neck now
I'd remind you of your promises now
'Cause tonight you lose me one more time
The first time always hurts you know
Wait till tonight, I'm gonna show
The last time always hurts the most
One more time again
The first time always hurts you know
Wait till tonight, I'm gonna show
The last time always hurts the most
One more time again
One more time again
The first time always hurts you know
Wait till tonight, I'm gonna show
The last time always hurts the most
One more time again
The first time always hurts you know
Wait till tonight, I'm gonna show
The last time always hurts the most
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more? 
Why don't you want me no more?
The sky fell over cheap Korean monster-movie scenery
And spilled into the mezzanine of the crushed capsule hotel
Between the Disney abattoir and the chemical refinery
And I knew I was in trouble but I thought I was in hell
So you look around the tiny room and you wonder where the hell you are
While the K.K.K. convention are all stranded in the bar
They wear hoods and carry shotguns in the main streets of Montgomery
But they're helpless here as babies 'cause they're only here on holiday
What do we care if the world is a joke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
We'll give it a big kiss
We'll give it a poke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
Death wears a big hat 'cause he's a big bloke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
We're only living this instant
The black sand stuck beneath her feet in a warm Sorrento sunrise
A barefoot girl from Naples or was it a Barcelona hi-rise
Whistles out the tuneless theme song on a hundred cheap suggestions
And a million false seductions and all those eternal questions
What do we care if the world is a joke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
We'll give it a big kiss
We'll give it a poke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
Death wears a big hat 'cause he's a big bloke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
We're only living this instant
So they flew the Super-Constellation all the way from Rimini
And feasted them on fish and chips from a newspaper facsimile
Now dead Italian tourists bodies litter up the Broadway
Some people can't be told you know they have to learn the hard way
Holidays are dirt-cheap in the Costa del Malvinas
In the Hotel Argentina they can hardly tell between us
For Teresa is a waitress though she's now known as Juanita
In a tango bar in Stanley or in Puerto Margarita
She's the sweetest and the sauciest
The loveliest and the naughtiest
She's Miss Buenos Aires in a world of lacy lingerie
What do we care if the world is a joke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
We'll give it a big kiss
We'll give it a poke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
Death wears a big hat 'cause he's a big bloke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
We're only living this instant
Japanese God Jesus robots telling teenage fortunes
For all we know and all we care they might as well be Martians
They say gold paint on the palace gates comes from the teeth of pensioners
They're so tired of shooting protest singers
That they hardly mention us
While fountains fill with second-hand perfume
And sodden trading stamps
They'll hang the bullies and the louts that dampen down the day
What do we care if the world is a joke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
We'll give it a big kiss
We'll give it a poke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
Death wears a big hat 'cause he's a big bloke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
We're only living this instant
We braved the cold November air and the undertaker's curses
Saying "Take me to the Folies Bergere and please don't spare the hearses"
For he always had a dream of that revolver in your purse
How you loved him 'til you hated him and made him cry for mercy
He said "Don't ever mention my name there or talk of all the nights you cried
We've always been like worlds apart now you're seeing two nightmares collide"
What do we care if the world is a joke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
We'll give it a big kiss
We'll give it a poke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
Death wears a big hat 'cause he's a big bloke
(Tokyo Storm Warning)
We're only living this instant
There is a feeling I can't hide
It leaves me bored and black inside
There was a story I once knew
It started with me and ended with you
 
Somebody tell me
Where did we go wrong
This is not the world that I remember
I once believed
That we had a future
Now I'm afraid that I am not so sure
 
You sow this allegory for life
Predicts that passion turn to strife
You say what you get is what you see
I'm sorry if I disagree
Today, as you listen to this song
Another 394,000 children were born into this world
They break like waves of hunger and desire upon these eroded shores
Carrying the curses of history and a history yet unwritten
The oil burns in thick black columns, the buzz saws echo through the forest floor
They shout give us our fair share, give us justice
Here comes the war
On a grey morning to the south of here
Two young men in makeshift uniforms peer into the misty light
And figures dart behind the trees
As a snap of rifle rounds echoes out across the fields
They hardly know their sacred mother tongue but they know their duty
To defend the flag hanging limp and bloody above the village church
While a thousand miles away, in a warehouse complex down by the river,
Young money men play paintball games
Here comes the war - put out the lights on the Age of Reason
So blow out the candle and tell us another of those great stories,
The ones about serial killers. Let dreams flow into savage times.
Do you hear the sirens scream across the city?
We've had three hot nights in succession - the riot season is here again
Dear Lord, lead us back into the Valley of the Shadow of Death,
Here comes the war. Did you think we were born in peaceful times?
Faster, faster, like a whirling dervish spinning round
Faster, faster, until the Centre cannot Hold
You screamed give us Liberty or give us Death
Now you've got both, what do you want next?
Here comes the war - put out the lights on the Age of Reason.
Seasons don't change
They just glide through my eyes
Like a serpent in the sky,
Tempestuous love passing me by
Singing ah...
Infinity of space
It destroys this special place
Of momentary bliss
It's the thorn in a kiss
Singing ah...
Sadness and you have become my perfect two
In a world I divide what is good and what I do
Singing ah...
Seasons don't change
They just glide through my eyes
Like a serpent in the sky,
Tempestuous love passing me by
Singing ah...
Close your eyes, we're coming down
Close your eyes, we're coming down
Close yourself, you'll fall away fast
Hold on tight, we're coming down
Close your eyes, we're coming down
Close your eyes, we're coming down
Lose yourself, you'll fall away fast
Hold on tight, we're coming down
I call you every hour on the telephone
I work my fingers right down to the bone
I even got you a chihuahua so you wouldn't be alone
Got you a trailer about the size of Maine
Bought a mile of interstate in your name
I've given you everything, baby what do you want from me?
I burned all of my porno 'cause you were PMSing
You say it offends you, all the talking it never ends
Disconnected my X-Box and ditched all my friends
So you could go to the opera, dumped all of my girlfriends
Even the dirty ones, you say they annoy you, they want to destroy you
I've given you everything, baby what do you want from me?
Got you a picture you could put in a frame, wearing a suit all checkered and lame,
I even signed it at the bottom so you'd remember my name
Took you to Target for a birthday meal
Got you an autographed Buns of Steel, So what's the deal?
I've given you everything, baby what do you want from me?
Burned all of my porno 'cause you were PMSing
You say it offends you, all the talking it never ends
Disconnected my X-Box and ditched all my friends
So you could go to the opera, dumped all my girlfriends
Even the dirty ones, you say they annoy you, they want to destroy you
I've given you everything, baby what do you want from me?
I give you everything
Ziroconian diamond rings
Got you Lo-Jack for your Pontiac
And some decals for your fingernails
And your bass master, singing trout
And a tv, and a cd and a dvd from QVC
And baby, whatcha think of me?
Burned all of my porno, you say it offends you
Disconnected my X-Box
Baby what do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
A time divided loyalty
For some of us it's comedy
It's all just a fantasy
Someone stop the colony
Someone stop the colony
Flashy little smile
Kiss more ass like you do
I'd rather be called nuts
Than to be a 'yaaa dude'
You strut down the hall
You think you're the shit
Yes I know you drink beer
But stop talking 'bout it
The party was sweet
I got so fucked up
You should've been there
I crashed my new truck
I got with this girl
Yeah man she was hot
But I lost my white hat
After we smoked too much pot
Those kids suck, yeah they're fucking beat
Those kids suck, nah nah not me
Those kids suck, yeah check emcee
Those kids suck, yeah those kids suck
Your mom dresses you
So your dad will approve
You've already mastered
His shit attitude
But don't even think
You won't get his gut
You'll be more than stupid
Hey cool guy good luck
Those kids suck, yeah they're fucking beat
Those kids suck, nah nah not me
Those kids suck, check it out emcee
Those kids suck, yeah those kids suck
A time divided loyalty
To some of us it's comedy
It's all just a fantasy
Someone stop the colony
Someone stop the colony
Stand up
You've got to manage
I won't sympathize
Anymore
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
You're alright
There's nothing wrong
Self-sufficience please
And get to work
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me, army of me
You're on your own now
We won't save you
Your rescue-squad
Is to exhausted
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
Don't stop!
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me, army of me
You're alright
There's nothing wrong
Self-sufficience please
And get to work
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
And if you complain once more
You'll meet an army of me
You'll meet an army of me
Här finns ingen värme, ingen köld
Enbart ett vakuum
Mina läppar de avger ett leende då jag ser hur du faller isär
Nu när insikten slutligen nått dig och sorgen håller dig kär
Vi vandrar hand i hand till andra sidan bron
Där dyrkan utav döden är den enda sanna tron
Den enda sanna tron
Dina tankar ett fullständigt kaos av de tusen minnen du bär
Och att var dag återuppleva denna inhumana misär
Så kom nu, följ min röst till den andra sidan bron
Där dyrkan utav döden är den enda sanna tron
Den enda sanna tron
Se nu hur alla dina minnen formas till en magnum 357
Och jag tror du vet någonstans där innerst inne
Att självmord är den enda vägen ut
Tveka inte, skjut, skjut, jag sa skjut, skjut
Önskan att försvinna är nu betydligt mer akut
För där en början finns där finns det alltid ett slut
Tiden den går, minut för minut
Spillror av mig själv försöker finna vägen ut ur mig
Ut ur mig, in i dig>
¡Dime!
Tú te crees que protestas
¡Dime!
Me aseguras que protestas
¡Dime!
Tú te crees un rebelde, o algo así
¡Oye!
Tú te quejas de la polución
¡Hablas!
Sobre la automatización
¡Dime!
Tú te crees un juglar moderno o algo así.
Defiendes a la humanidad
lloras porque el mundo está muy mal.
Criticas a la sociedad
dices tú que todo debería cambiar.
En el escenario folclorizas tu voz
muera la ciudad y su contaminación.
Con tus lindas melodías y romántica simpatía,
nunca quedas mal con nadie
¡Oye!
Tú me dices que protestas
¡Pero!
Tu postura no molesta
¡Dime!
Si tu fin es algo atacar, o ganar aplausos.
Tú te quejas de las bombas.
Hablas que con el planeta van a acabar.
Pero nunca das un nombre,
tienes miedo a quedar con alguien mal.
En las peñas, facultades y en la televisión,
junto a los artesas y conscientes snob.
Te crees revolucionario y acusativo,
pero nunca quedas mal con nadie.
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal con nadie (x2)
Nunca quedas mal con nadie
Me aburrió tu postura intelectual
eres una mala copia de un gringo hippie.
Tu guitarra oye imbécil barbón
se vendió al aplauso de los cursis conscientes.
Contradices toda tu protesta famosa
con tus armonías rebuscadas y hermosas.
Eres un artista y no un guerrillero,
pretendes pelear y solo eres un mierda buena onda.
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal con nadie
Porque tú nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal con nadie
Cómete tu miedo a la bomba de neutrones.
Quédate tu poesía y tus razones.
Córtala con la selva de cemento,
no aguanto tus artísticos lamentos.
Tu bolsito y tu poncho artesanal.
Tu cultura cursi me cae muy mal
Tu protesta a mí me da igual
porque nunca quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Nunca quedas mal con nadie.
Nunca quedas mal con nadie.
Nunca quedas mal con...
Nunca quedas mal con...
Nunca quedas mal con nadie.
So I want to kill this waitress
She's worked here a year longer than I
If I did it fast you know that's an act of kindness
But I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I want to kill this waitress
I can't believe this violence in mind
And his her power all in her club sandwich?
But I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I want to kill this killing wish
They're too many stars and not enough sky
Boys all think she's living kindness
Ask a fellow waitress
Ask a fellow waitress
A long time ago before the ice and the snow
There were giants that walked this land
And with each step they took the mighty mountains shook
And the trees took a knee and the seas rolled in
Then one day they say the sky gave way
And death rained down it made a terrible sound
There was fire everywhere and nothin' was spared
That walked on the land or flew through the air
And when it all was over
The slate wiped clean with a touch
There God stood and he saw it was good
He said "ashes to ashes and dust to dust".
Then the sea gave birth and it crawled up on the dirt
Stood up and took a look around
Said "I'm the next big thing and the gift that I bring
Comes directly from God so there ain't no holdin' me down"
So he crowned himself king now no one remembers his name
But the seed that he sowed took the show on the road
There was blood on their hands and a plague on the land
They drew a line in the sand and made their last stand
They said "God made us in his image
And it's in God that we trust"
When asked about the man that had died by their hand
They said "ashes to ashes and dust to dust".
Nobody lives forever
Nothin' stands the test of time
You heard 'em say "never say never"
It's always best to keep it in mind
That every tower ever built tumbles
No matter how strong no matter how tall
Someday even great walls will crumble
And every idol ever raised falls
And someday every man's best laid plans
Will be twisted and covered in rust
When we've done all that we can
But it slipped through our hands
It's ashes to ashes and dust to dust.

For liberty there is a cost - its broken skulls and leather cosh,
From the boys in uniform - now you know whose side their on -
With backing - with blessing,
From earthly gods not heaven,
A stones throw away from it all.
Whatever pleasures those who get - from stripping skin with rhino whip,
Are the kind that must be stopped - before their kind take all we've got -
With loving - with caring,
They take great pride in working,
The stones throw away from it all.
Whenever honesty persists - you'll hear the snap of broken ribs,
Of anyone who'll take no more - of the lying bastards roar -
In Chile - In Poland,
Johannesburg - South Yorkshire,
A stones throw away: Now we're there.
Belaruse no longer feels the sun
But it's under the skin of everyone
Belaruse forgotten by the blind 
That is until the next time 
Remember all your yesterdays
In the deep blue 
Before the world came 
And rested there on you
And if the sun and moon 
Were both to doubt 
Sure enough they'd both go out 
When you can't walk in your field
Feel water in your hands 
You've been touched by the doubt of man 
Remember all your yesterdays
In the deep blue 
Before the world came 
And rested there on you
Remember all your yesterdays
In the deep blue 
Before the world came 
And rested there on you
Mentre le ideologie si estinguono
e le coscienze si disperdono
insieme ai muri crollano
le verità di comodo
i monumenti a cosa servono?
La vera storia non la insegnano
non devo chiedere
devo far da me
la verità sta dentro a un nylon
dimenticata in qualche oceano
sotto la buccia debole
di 10.000 regole
Ti capisco
quando dici che
rivorresti
le tue bambole...
E mi hanno sempre fatto credere (che)
nell'incertezza è meglio prendere
ma se io prendo chi è che dà?
Se io prendo chi è che dà?
Ne ho visti troppi qui di oracoli
e troppe corti dei miracoli
io non vi posso credere
io non vi voglio credere...
Ti capisco
quando dici che
rivuoi indietro
le tue bambole...
Good times, bad times...
good times... bad times...
Ti capisco
quando dici che
rivorresti
le tue bambole...
Ora ha senso
quando pensi che
rivuoi indietro
le tue bambole...

Been to Vegas lately, any of you? 'Cause I was there for a couple of weeks, when we were on tour. Yeah, okay. You know what I noticed in Vegas? I noticed this one little thing: we have some fat fucking people in this country. It is out of control! Have you seen them sitting at the slot machines? They're so fat the stool's all the way up their ass, and they just sit there and have food delivered, and they eat and play the slots. "AHHMUMFMUMF, CLANG!, AHHMUMMFFMUMMFF, CLANG! I need money, CLANG, CLANG, CLANG." They fart, the stool flies across the room. These people make Elvis look anorexic, you know what I'm talking about? Stop eating! I am fed up with the little denial phrases they have, too. "I'm not fat, I'm husky." Yeah. "I'm portly." Ya ya ya ya. "I'm stout." Oh, ok ok ok. "I'm big-boned." You're big-assed! Dinosaurs are big-boned! Put the fork down. We gotta do something, because we all have fat people in our families. You know what, if we don't stop 'em soon, they're just gonna start blowin' up, I swear to God. We're gonna have a country full of sumo wrestlers either way.
And they keep finding more denial stuff. There's a doctor now, I'd like to see what size he is, a doctor in L.A. came up with a theory that being fat is actually a virus. Ah, I guess I'm the asshole here, right? Cause every other virus we know about is a flesh-eating virus: the common cold, AIDS, cancer. But he's the found the one that makes ya bigger. Okay, yep yep yep yep yep. That's all the fat person in each family needs. Now we're at Thanksgiving with the fat person going, "Well I'm not actually overeating. AHHMUMFMUMF, I'm trying to keep the virus at bay, AHHMUMFMUMF." Look, I'm trying to help here, okay? You have a choice: it's either me, or Richard Simmons coming over to your house, okay? He's gonna cry and shave his legs, I think you want me, I really do. I think I'm the better choice. And there are definitely signs, folks, that you should stop eating. Let's make that very clear.
Remember the 7,000 pound guy on Long Island a couple years ago, had chest pains, and they had to cut a wall out of the house to get him to the house to get him to the hospital. Folks, that's the first sign. When you're calling the construction crew before you call the hospital, STOP FUCKING EATING! "Look, I'm having chest pains. Knock this wall down here. Yeah, get a crane and a dumpster to take me to the hospital. And then, uh, call ahead to the hospital, get some walls taken out over there, and get me a dozen donuts, cause this fucking virus is killing me, it really is."
See, I could never be a fat guy. I'll tell you why. One simple reason: the first day I wake up and can't see my dick, I STOP EATING! OK? "Honey, I can't see my dick. Give the dog some of the food, 'cause I'm going to Ethiopia. I CAN'T SEE IT! Can you see it? I can't feel it!" Freak. I have to see my dick first thing in the morning. That's the kind of relationship we have. Wake up, first thing, "Hey, how ya doing!" "Good, how ya doing?" "Terrific, you wanna jerk off now?" "Ya, why not!" Oh yeah, jerkin' off is like an aerobic thing for me now. I'm forty, now I do it every day. I do it eeevery day. I've even gone beyond porno, I'm back to regular network TV Oh yeah. People wonder why "Caroline in the City" is getting such big ratings. I'll tell you why! I know why!
I love my dick. My dick loves me. I love my balls too, it's kind of a love triangle thing we have going on. I love my dick more than my balls, but don't tell my balls that because that would bum my balls out. Wait, let President Leary clarify that last statement: I love my dick, but I'm no John Wayne Bobbitt, you know what I mean? Like, if my wife cuts my dick off, I'm not telling anybody. Nobody's finding out! I don't care if the cops show up at my house, with the dick, "Nope, no, not mine. No, I never had a dick. I'm a eunuch, that's right. 'No Dick Leary,' that's my nickname. I'm actually saving up to buy a vagina, that's what I'm doing right now. But thanks for dropping by, fellas. CLANG!"
I also wanna make an announcment, that I am pro-tit all the way. President Leary is pro-tit all the way. I love tits. I would like to be the mayor of Tit Town if I could. I'd like to drive a big truck full of tits down the Tit Turnpike right through the middle of Tit Town. I'd like to have my own talk show about tits, "Tit Talk". That's how passionate I am about the tits, I love 'em all. I actually love the small tits better than the big tits because the big tits get all the attention. The peach and plum little hand-shaped tits, they're great. I love to look at 'em. "How ya doin'!" talk to 'em, "What's goin' on? Look at me! I've got my face next to a tit!" Men are mollified by tits. We don't know why, we just are. We don't have to see naked tits to get mollified, we just freeze up even at the sight of cleavage. Waitress leans over the table the wrong way... That's how we can end war. Get the Good Year blimp, paint it up like a tit, put a nipple on it. Fly it over the Middle East during a confrontation, "Look at the tit! Look at the tiiiiit! The tiiiiiiit! The tiiiiiiit!"

I'm not a Buddha boy
I'm not a Muslim man
I'm not a Christian or a Jew
I'm not a Mormon freak
I'm not a Catholic geek
And I'm nothing at all like you
My mind, my heart, my soul is calm
While I sit here soldering my C2 bomb
Got some wires crossed in my twisted head
Connect the green wire here or was it red?
'Cause it's my fate
I operate on
Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate
I go by many other names
But now
I am the sentinel
I want the world to know
I'm sending you all to Hell
I'm tired and I'm wired here to blow
There's something disturbin'
Going on in my turban
And I'm home, home on de-range
I feel my meditation so deep within
While my medication's kicking in
'Cause it's my fate
I operate on
Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate
I go by many other names
But now
I am the sentinel
I want the world to know
I'm sending you all to Hell
I'm tired and I'm wired here to blow
I am the sentinel
I want the world to know
I'm sending you all to Hell
I'm tired and I'm wired here to blow
How can you buy or sell the sky
Or the warmth of the land it's strange to us
We don't own the freshness of the air
Or the sparkle of the water
How can you buy them from us?
The white man doesn't understand our ways
For he's a stranger who comes in the night
And takes from the land just what he needs
Oh yeah
He treats his brothers like his enemies
When it's completed he moves on
He leaves his father's grave and his birthright
His birthright is forgotten
The air is precious to the red man
For all things share the same breath
The white man won't notice the air he breathes
Like a man dying for many days
All right now
The whites must treat the beasts of his land
As his brothers not his enemies
Tell me what is man without the beasts
I'll bet he will die of loneliness, yes
One thing we know that the white man will
We know our god is the same god
You may think you wish to own him
Own him as you wish to own our land
But he is the body of man
And the earth is precious to him
Continue to contaminate your bed
And you will suffocate in your waste
In your waste
Who the hell are you to tell me
What to do, why to do, why bother
Leech in a mask of virtue
Such waste, to ever think of you again
Hey Judas, your Christess was our love
Hit and run, your will be done
Never sorry, never wrong
More more more more more
Master passion greed
Master passion greed
"Hello. How are you?
Let me explain one thing.
All for her and more for me
Why is it so hard to see?
I see no sense in doing this
Not enough for me
I fuck up everything but let me explain."
Some
Day
Some day you shall flee
Panting and weak
Master passion greed
Master passion greed
Master passion greed
Master passion greed
All within me gone but pain and hope
Hoping that the pain would fade away
Greed, your master passion
I Feed the mouth that bites me
Mammon, opiate of the masses
The reek of your lies draws flies
Seek her
Seduce her
Tame her
Blame her
Have her
Kill her
Seek her
Seduce her
Tame her
Blame her
Feast on it all
Seek her
Seduce her
Tame her
Blame her
Have her
Kill her
Seek her
Seduce her
Tame her
Blame her
Feast on it all
With awakening
The tears will begin
To my everlasting shame
Silence took me
I was wrong I admite
You don't have to put up with this no-no-no baby
Can we talk to make it right
'Cause I don't want you crying when we lay down tonight
So let me see that smile the one I like so much
Come on baby lets we don't have rush
Baby don't be mad I'm sorry can't you see i
Appoligize the blame is on me
Don't go to bed mad baby
Let the pass be the pass sugar
Don't go to bed mad baby
Let the pass be the pass sugar
Ooh come here and give me a kiss
Em ain't no reason for us to be fighting like ooh
Girl I love you and I no you love me
It's look better when you smile so won't you go that for me
So let me see that smile the one I like so much come on baby lets we don't have
To rush baby don't mad I'm sorry can't you see I appoligzle
The blame is on me.
So you broke down, trying to leave town
I broke down crying on your return
You left me feeling hopeful 
I'll never see your face again
You made for a bad lover's liver
You stole all the covers and busted my head
You made me such an asshole
I wish we'd never met
I'm tired of being bored
I'm through with the headaches
Hiding my hands that tremble like earthquakes
Under the table, under the daytime sky
Good Fucking Bye
And when you lose hope
It's hard to cope
Watching the tyranny with sober eyes
The daybreak and sunset
All hours in between are spent murdering time
You made for a bad lover's liver
You stole all the covers and fucked up my head
You made me such an asshole
I wish we'd never met 
I'm tired of being bored
I'm through with the headaches
Hiding my hands that tremble like earthquakes
Under the table, under the daytime sky
Good Fucking Bye
--Jimbo
Check it, I used to be the goofy man you hounded
The Special Ed kid at lunchtime the bitches wouldn't stand around with
I would jack off so much back at my parents' house
And now my dick has a permanent imprint of my hand around it
Life was lame, I had to pay money to fuck a whore
I couldn't pull a damn anorexic bitch in a tug-o-war
But then I made enough money for me to fund a tour
Now the ladies show me the goodies under their Wonderbra
I'm going door to door, with foreign swords
Causing more than war slaying rappers, commercial or horrorcore
So hold your head 'cause I'm a torture yours, leave them open sores
I promise you it'll be more than hard to ignore the gore
Hip hop's dead, and I'm the lucky savior
I'm kinda mad and I don't wanna pile up the anger
All these no-flow, gimmicky ass fired up behaviors
With wack beats and gap teeth like Tyler the Creator
Motherfucker, you not dope
So you tryna get some attention by cussing and eating a fucking cockroach?
And Goblin? You get no props on it
It sucks so much I get blowjobs from it
I been told you niggas, "I'm real! "
If you wack and no one's confronted you on your bullshit, then I will
Hate on me, but you can't deny skill
I crush all the momentum that you guys build with my eyes sealed
You faggots got me cussing
And only reason you probably buzzing
Is 'cause you slave as an Illuminati puppet
Y'all really on one, beat it, you're gone, done
You think real niggas feeling your shit? C'mon son!
I'm the illest and that's fo' shizzle
My flow sizzles, yo boy Hop go hard like some cold nipples
You niggas are making it so simple
My swag makes the ladies wave like fat stomachs with bone ripples
I know you niggas wish you could prevent it
'Cause I get buck like my Kool Aid's got way too much sugar in it
You better run like I'm booger flicking
Homie I've been good at rapping, now I'm tryna get gooder with it
So I'm a just go beast, and bring that West coast heat
'Cause I'll be damned if you flex on me
The radio is filled with garbage over techno beats
And all these songs about cash are what we just don't need
Yo, nobody care about how much money you stack
I murder everything I touch, buddy, move back
Got enough guts to sew trash and bust up your fluke act
And leave your fans saying, "How the fuck does he do that? "
My ranking is vicious, you thinking it isn't?
Come pay me a visit if you feel that you may be offended
Baby I'm wicked, crazy and sick and with the face of a nimwit
I'll be calling out names but I ain't taking attendance
Some bitch was like, "Hop, you got me crying
'Cause you said I could call you while you out on tour
Shit and I be trying, I even text you, but you not replying
So when your new shit finally drop, that's one album I will not be buying
What, You're too Hollywood? And you don't even have two minutes?
Ever since you got your buzz, you don't know how bad you tripping
You went to that ho's house last night and you said that you didn't
I seen your pic on Facebook, the skank bitch done tagged you in it"
I got put on with the beasty flow
Now the sluts, they wanna bone when they see me, whoa!
So I must, I take 'em home, let the wee wee grow
Then I bust from different strokes like the TV show
See when I be coming through kicking it raw, niggas like, "Gee, he's dope"
If there's anyone throwing dirt at my name then you know he be toast
For all of you rappers that be bringing me drama, homie please be ghost
The only reason I'm being aggressive is 'cause we need hope
"Hopsin, I fucking love you, 'cause you supply the best rhymes
Since your flow is kinda strange, you should sign with Tech N9ne
You design erect lines, who am I to just lie?
Every single night I play your music right at bedtime
And usually I'm not into dark dick
I wanna do something freaky enough to win your heart with"
I say, "What you wanna do? " She say, "It's simple, Marcus
I wanna blow it before you put it in like a Nintendo cartridge"
Bitch, I'm hotter than a UV ray
Hotter than the thought of Nicki Minaj naked, making her booty shake
Hot enough to pull up to your show and steal your groupie date
Hot enough to melt the ice cream that's on Gucci's face
And now you having hot flashes
All the shit that you ever wanted in one MC, Hop has it
Don't rap if you do not practice
I cockblock wack shit, now get ready for Knock Madness
All right
So if you got 'em - light 'em up
Open your minds
Lets go to war.
Today's the day
The time is here
We take back control
And conquer our fears
For as it was written my friend
So shall it be
I ride with the most high
Who can stand against me
Ride with me
An advance towards the light
In the darkness
I break it down slowly
Roll up and spark this
In this moment on this track
I attack all the lies
We accepted as truth
We were duped
By the schoolbooks and teachers
The blind leading the blind
Through the garden of eden
But time after time
We had the prophets to lead us
Still line after line
Was written down to deceive us
But they will never defeat us.
Until the end of time
I will rebel in the face of all tyrants
The fire burns on high
As above so below, now be careful
Until the end of time
We will fight for the rights of our children
The fire burns inside
My curiousity leads me to Zion.
Wake the fuck up!
So if you got 'em - light 'em up
Warriors
Come out and play.
In the year 20-07 AD
The working man got so tired of waiting
Not all those who have eyes
Will see what I'm saying
Not all those who have ears
Will hear a note that we playing
Homie you know me
I don't fuck with no phonies
All these chronies in this industry
Can all kneel down and blow me
I came to do battle
With the counsel of churches
Politicians and gunmen
Who would lie, rob, and hurt us
Keep us deaf, blind, and dumb
So we can't find out guns
Asleep when the storm troopers come
For our moms
So run nigga run
Till you can't catch your breath
It's too late
'Cause you already dead.
But you wide awake
You already dead.
X3
You're in a fucking coma.
Until the end of time
I will rebel in the face of all tyrants
The fire burns on high
As above so below, now be careful
Until the end of time
We will fight for the rights of our children
The fire burns inside
My curiousity leads me to Zion.
Listen carefully
I don't have much time left
There are so many things I want to tell you
But we gotta be careful
I think I'm being watched.
Galileo was imprisoned by the church
For exposing that the earth was not at the center of the universe
So in 1616 they already had control
Of what they thought you and I were allowed to know
They knew the world wasn't flat
But that was knowledge we weren't supposed to have
They knew all about the new world
Way before Christopher Columbus set sail
Witness the rebirth of Atlantis
And we're all apart of it
What a beautiful fucking time to be alive, eh? Ha!
You know I'm not surprised the Illuminati had to keep it a secret
I'm surrounded by fucking idiots
Jesus fucking fucking Christ.
Until the end of time
The fire burns on high
Until the end of time
The fire burns inside
My curiousity leads me to Zion.
Wake the fuck up!
So if you got 'em - light 'em up
Warriors.

We ain't done anything, we get blamed
We are the innocent, we get framed
Lies get told about us, when we're in court
You know that justice is never sought
We're victims of society
Lie are told but no one sees
Victims of society
Can't you see they're after you and me
Read in the paper, see it on the news
Law and disorder is all the media choose
Only show the hooligans, only show the thugs
Makes for better telly, makes us look mugs
Only one thing comes to mind
When I look into your eyes
I think of all the times
All I did was despise you
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
A discomforting extreme
When I think of all those times
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
How old are you?
I'm older than you'll ever be
I've been dead a thousand years
And lived only two or three
I don't mind telling you
My life was ended by your hand
The kind of murder where nobody dies
But I don't suppose you'd understand
Call off the search
We've found her
If I am Lolita
Then you are a criminal
And you should be killed
By an army of little girls
The law won't arrest you
The world won't detest you
You never did anything
Any man wouldn't do
I'm Gothic Lolita
And you are a criminal
I'm not even legal
I'm just a dead little girl
But ruffles and laces
And candy sweet faces
Directed your furtive hand
I perfectly understand
So it's my fault?
No, Gothic Lolita
Thank you, kind sirs
You've made me what I am today
A bundle of broken nerves
A mouthful of words I'm still afraid to say
I don't mind telling you
Now that I'm old enough to love
I couldn't begin to even if
My pretty life depended on it
And funny thing, it does
Call off the search
We've found her
If I am Lolita
Then you are a criminal
And you should be killed
By an army of little girls
The law won't arrest you
The world won't detest you
You never did anything
Any man wouldn't do
I'm Gothic Lolita
And you are a criminal
I'm not even legal
I'm just a dead little girl
But ruffles and laces
And candy sweet faces
Directed your furtive hand
I perfectly understand
So it's my fault?
No, Gothic Lolita
I am your sugar
I am your cream
I am your anti-American dream
I am your sugar
I am your cream
I am your worst nightmare
Now scream
If I am Lolita
Then you are a criminal
And you should be killed
By an army of little girls
The law won't arrest you
The world won't detest you
You never did anything
Any man wouldn't do
I'm Gothic Lolita
And you are a criminal
I'm not even legal
I'm just a dead little girl
But ruffles and laces
And candy sweet faces
Directed your furtive hand
I perfectly understand
So it's my fault?
No, Gothic Lolita
You empty shell
Abulic disciple
Follow like a sheep
And give in to peer pressure
You blinded blockhead
With a wrong ideology
Easy to plant with
Venomed body of thought
Follow your leader
You misguided fools
Follow your leader
Never break any rules
Millions of cowards
And will-less machines
Are losing control
And waste their identity
Hide behind masks
You're saving your face
Your adapted world views
Blurred your sense of guilt
Follow your leader
You misguided fools
Follow your leader
Never break any rules
Instrumental
Tired of falling backwards
Tired of all the deceit...
I'll show no allegiance
All shall feel my wrath
Ten years of discontent never given a chance
But love is passion, may love is vengeance
And this love I shall foresake
And on this day I slit my wrist
And do away with everything, fuck it
Cut up bleeding beaten cheated
I'm tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of all the deceit...
Fuck all of the people driven by the greed
They will all be dealt with accordingly
Just let them be, FUCK IT
I'm tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of all the deceit
I'm tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of people trying to take a piece
Wage war on the bastards
Wage war on the street
Wage war all around you
Wage war on the weak
Tired of falling backwards
I'm tired of all the deceit...
Wage war on the bastards
Wage war on the street
Wage war all around you
Wage war on the weak
So I want to kill this waitress
She's worked here a year longer than I
If I did it fast you know that's an act of kindness
But I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I want to kill this waitress
I can't believe this violence in mind
And his her power all in her club sandwich?
But I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I want to kill this killing wish
They're too many stars and not enough sky
Boys all think she's living kindness
Ask a fellow waitress
Ask a fellow waitress
Born on a farm in a transatlantic moonlight
Split like a cord of wood my family broke up
Sold like a piece of steer, a piece of meat, a cow
A breathing piece of shit
Picked for my age, for my strength and make up
Called for I was tall, I was big, I could hold up
A tree or a piece of steel I could do
What my fat owner can't
Ah, future farmers of America
Future farmers of America
Future farmers of America
Ah
I'm always watching the way his wife looks me over
I have a sex twice as big as her husband's
If I wasn't so large, so strong, so pale
I'd disappear under a bush
Colorless men and ladies of the world unite
Kill your master with one cut of your knife
Kill them during sex, kill them during talk
Kill them whenever you can
Future farmers of America
Future farmers of America
Future farmers of America
These -
- Stupid black owners are foreigners to affairs of the heart
Look at me, I'll never own land that I work on
Every one of us here shares a surname
This father must die
I was born on the dark cusp of twilight
My father was dark, my mother was light
Look at me, I'm strong
I could crush him in my fist
Ah
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my fist
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my fist
Future farmers of America
I could crush him in my fist
Future farmers of America
I could crush him in my fist
Future farmers of America
I could crush him in my fist
You could say everything's no good
'Cause you'll just say what everyone else would
You could say that the sky is blue
'Cause I wonder who would ever not believe you
I should've said this for so long, so so long
Shapeshifter, guest lister, big faker
She'll turn around - you'll dis her
Gatecrasher, rehasher, if you think that's cool
Whatever dude
Whatever dude
You could say what she wants to hear
'Cause it's her car but she lets the bumps steer
You could say that the fix is in
But I don't believe it not for a minute
'Cause you like all the same songs
But you're all wrong, you're just all wrong
Shapeshifter, guest lister, big faker,
She'll turn around - you'll dis her
Gatecrasher, rehasher, if you think that's cool
Whatever dude
Whatever dude
Boys like you don't cost a dime
And you could say that's fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
But you know just as well as I
That's a lie, lie, lie, lie
Gatecrasher, rehasher, big faker,
She'll turn around - you'll trash her
Shapeshifter, guest lister, if you think that's cool
Shapeshifter, guest lister, big faker,
She'll turn around - you'll dis her
Gatecrasher, rehasher, if you think that's cool
Whatever dude
Whatever dude
Whatever dude
Whatever dude
Whatever!
I woke up mourning
I woke up dead today
I aged a thousand years or more
I flinch when you are nice
You kill me with a single word
When angels fuck and devils kiss, I'm sure
I'll bask in your forever
You just waste my time
I want to drag you down, down with me
I wanted to help, to help destroy the world
I wanted to be that, to be that special girl
Everybody's got a little something to hide, but me
Everybody's got a little someone to crush, but me
I'm living in a human teenage mediocrity
Everybody's got a little someone to trust, but me
I dreamed that I was you
I dreamed your ego died
Said who loves you more than I do
I know you lied
I'll bask in your forever
Fucking waste of time
Angels fuck and devils screw
I wanted to heal me and then destroy the world
Piss in your heart and be that, and be that special girl
Everybody's got a little something to hide but me
Everybody's got a little someone to crush but me
I'm living in a teenage human mediocrity
Everybody's got a little someone to trust but me
But me, but you
Not me
Hate you
Love me, love me, hate you
Want me, fuck you, hate me
Kill you
Fuck me, like you, want me
Like you want you fuck you
Fuck me, fuck you, fuck you fuck you fuck me
Fuck you, fuck me, fuck you fuck you fuck me (you never loved me)
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you fuck you fuck me
I will never make it better
I will never make it better
It will always hurt you fucking asshole
If my life were a movie
There would be a sunset
And the camera would pan away
But the sky is just a little sister
Tagging along behind the buildings
Trying to imitate their grey
The little boys are breaking bottles
Along the sidewalk
The big boys, too
The girls are hanging out at the candy store
Pumping quarters into the phone
'Cause they don't want to go home
And I think,
What if no one's watching
What it when we're dead, we're just dead
What if it's just us down here
What if god ain't looking down
What if he's looking up instead
If my life were a movie
I would light a cigarette
And the smoke would curl around my face
Everything I do would be interesting
I'd play the good guy
In every scene
But I always feel I have to
Take a stand
And there's always someone on hand
To hate me for standing there
I always feel I have to open my mouth
And every time I do
I offend someone
Somewhere
But what
What if no one's watching
What if when we're dead, we're just dead
What if there's no time to lose
What if there's things we gotta do
Things that need to be said
You know I can't apologize
For everything I know
I mean you don't have to agree with me
But once you get me going
You better just let me go
We have to be able to criticize
What we love
Say what we have to say
'Cause if you're not trying to make something better
As far as I can tell
You're just in the way
I mean what
What if no one's watching
What if when we're dead
We're just dead
What if it's just us down here
What if god is just an idea
Someone put in your head
I mean what
What if no one's watching
What if no one's watching...
Take me away from
All this shit I'm seeing
It's time to make a change
This life is ruining me
I've got to get away
I've got to get the fuck out
Out of this dreary place
Out of this wasted life
I want more out of life
Than sadness and pain
I search for happiness
But it's never obtained
Where do I belong?
Where do I fit in?
I have to escape
From this misery within
Hips like Cinderella
Must be having a good shame
Talking sweet about nothing
Cookie, I think you're tame
Tame
I'm making good friends with you
When you're shaking your good frame
Fall on your face in those bad shoes
Lying there like you're tame
Tame (x3)
Uh, huh (x24)
Tame (x2)
Whoa (x5)
What the fuck?
(Featuring Jessicka of Jack Off Jill)
You're so pretty when you lie
Love songs always make me cry
I don't think you have a choice
There's no truth left in your voice
Remember when we used to laugh
Just try to forget all that
Wear my heart upon your lips
I hope it tastes JUST LIKE SHIT!
Just call me
Miss Ann Thrope
Just call me
Miss Ann Thrope
You're so pretty when you die
Love songs always make me cry
I don't think you realize
There's no blue left in your eyes
Remember when we used to sing
Just try to forget those things
Fill your hole inside with dirt
I hope that it FUCKING HURTS!
Just call me
Miss Ann Thrope
(Repeat 3x)
You have left a trail of deceit, assault, and flattery
Blasting through my wounds
Imprisoned me in God and poetry
A ritual to mend my angry heart,
A breeding ground for your untruth
If God created man in his own image then FUCK YOU!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
My hate for you defines my lust
Bridges to bridges, you're nothing to me
Welcome world, Miss Ann Thrope
(Repeat)
Fuck
Cunt
Miss ann thrope
Cunt
Fuck
Miss ann thrope
There's something sweet about seeing the world
And there's something great about Kansas
Like staring across an ocean and...
Seeing the first star burn white
Through the swamp and trees of southern night
I'll always have those mornings in
California, where the mountains climb so tall
And waves crash blue around you
Everyone's passed out in the van
And I'm the one driving through the land
Alone and open-roading
Ted's out in the seat right next to me
Yeah, he's drooling on his sleeve, whoa
Who ever made up open skies and two of the bluest eyes
Yeah, must be some young phenom
California, where the mountains climb so tall
And waves crash blue around you
Everyone's passed out in the van
And I'm the one driving through the land
Sometimes taking off can open up your eyes
To everything that lies in your heart
That's when you missed your home
Trees seem a little deader
That's where you miss your home
Trees seem a little deader, alright
I think we're getting back tonight
Would you care if I came over?
I've missed you about three weeks now
I'm dying just to taste your lips
Could we stomp around your back yard
And wreck our clothes in the mud?
California, where the mountains climb so tall
And waves crash blue around you
Everyone's passed out in the van
And I'm the one driving through the land, alright
So we're, we're on the road
So we're, yeah, we're on the road 
Whoa oh whoa
Suffer not Your neighbor's affliction
Suffer not Your neighbor's paralysis
But extend your hand Extend your hand
Lest you vanish in the city And be but a trace
Just a vanished ghost And your legacy
All the things you knew Science, mathematics, thought
Severely weakened Like irrigation systems
In the tired veins forming From the Tigris and Euphrates
In the realm of peace All the world revolved
All the world revolved Around a perfect circle
City of Baghdad City of scholars
Empirical humble Center of the world
City in ashes City of Baghdad
City of Baghdad Abrasive aloof
Oh, in Mesopotamia Aloofness ran deep
Deep in the veins of the great rivers
That form the base Of Eden
And the tree The tree of knowledge
Held up its arms To the sky
All the branches of knowledge All the branches of knowledge
Cradling Cradling
Civilization In the realm of peace
All the world revolved Around a perfect circle
Oh Baghdad Center of the world
City of ashes With its great mosques
Erupting from the mouth of god Rising from the ashes like
A speckled bird Splayed against the mosaic sky
Oh, clouds around We created the zero
But we mean nothing to you You would believe
That we are just some mystical tale We are just a swollen belly
That gave birth to Sinbad, Scheherazade We gave birth
Oh, oh, to the zero The perfect number
We invented the zero And we mean nothing to you
Our children run through the streets
And you sent your flames Your shooting stars
Shock and awe Shock and awe
Like some, some Imagined warrior production
Twenty-first century No chivalry involved
No Bushido
Oh, the code of the West Long gone
Never been Where does it lie?
You came, you came Through the west
Annihilated a people And you come to us
But we are older than you You come you wanna
You wanna come and rob the cradle
Of civilization And you read yet you read
You read Genesis You read of the tree
You read of the tree Beget by god
That raised its branches into the sky Every branch of knowledge
Of the cradle of civilization
Of the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates
Oh, in Mesopotamia Aloofness ran deep
The face of Eve turning What sky did she see
What garden beneath her feet The one you drill
You drill Pulling the blood of the earth
Little droplets of oil for bracelets Little jewels
Sapphires You make bracelets
Round your own world We are weeping tears
Rubies We offer them to you
We are just Your Arabian nightmare
We invented the zero But we mean nothing to you
Your Arabian nightmare
City of stars City of scholarship
Science City of ideas
City of light City
City of ashes That the great Caliph
Walked through His naked feet formed a circle
And they built a city A perfect city of Baghdad
In the realm of peace And all the world revolved
And they invented And they mean nothing to you
Nothing to you Nothing
Go to sleep Go to sleep my child
Go to sleep And I'll sing you a lullaby
A lullaby for our city A lullaby of Baghdad
Go to sleep Sleep my child
Sleep Sleep...
Run Run...
You sent your lights Your bombs
You sent them down on our city Shock and awe
Like some crazy TV show
They're robbing the cradle of civilization
They're robbing the cradle of civilization
They're robbing the cradle of civilization
Suffer not The paralysis of your neighbor
Suffer not But extend your hand
It's not the truth I say
It's just a mockery
Don't need to waste my time
You know I really try
You take and never give
It gets so hard to live
I'm hanging on a ledge
Pushed straight over the edge
Grow up and be a man
Drop dead right where I stand
I'm hanging on a ledge
Pushed straight over the edge
Yeah
Don't do the things you do
Don't have to oblige you
Make choices on my own
Don't buy the shit they sell
You take and never give
It gets so hard to live
I'm hanging on a ledge
Pushed straight over the edge
*Phone rings*
(Hello, could I speak with, Bushwick Bill?)
Hello, this is Bushwick, motherfucking Bill
(Yes sir, I'm calling to inform you that you have been drafted into the United States military)
The Unites States wants me for what? Hahahaha
(Excuse me sir)
Hahaha
(Bushwick?)
Hahaha, yeah yeah yeah, hey what's up?
(You need to contact your nearest recruiting office immediately please)
I see your not hip to what's happenin'
I don't give a fuck about you and all that bullshit you stressin'
Fuck a war
To explain, let me kick it to you a little something like this:
(Bushwick Bill)
Motherfuck a war, that's how I feel
Sendin' a nigga to the desert to get killed
Cause two suckas can't agree on something
A thousand motherfuckers died for nothing
You can't pay me to join an army camp
Or any other motherfuckin' military branch
Of this United goddman States of this bitch America
Be a soldier, what for?
They puttin' niggas on the front line
But when it comes to gettin' ahead, they put us way behind
I ain't gettin' my leg shot off
While Bush old ass on TV playin' golf
But when you come to my house with that draft shit
I'm a shoot your funky ass bitch
A nigga'll die for a brawl
But I ain't fightin' behind no goddamn oil
Against motherfuckas I don't know
Yo Bush! I ain't your damn hoe
The enemy is right here g, them foreigners never did shit me
All of those wasted lives
And only one or two get recognized
But what good is a medal when your dead? tell Uncle Sam I said
Chorus x2 (Willie D)
I ain't goin' to war for a shit talkin' president
(Fuck fuck fuck a war)
(Bushwick Bill)
In Vietnam a lot of niggas died young
P.O.W.'s got hung
What the fuck do I know about a grenade
All I know is the cops and my 12 gauge
And what if that pin gets stuck?
Several more casualties show up
This shit remind me of a drive-by
More motherfuckers die by accident than on purpose, why?
'Cause they don't know what they doin'
They see the coast is clear and they start persuin'
And that's when that booby trap springs, BOOM!
Blow a motherfucker to smithereens
They send a sucker to your folks, lookin' stupid
Tellin' them you died in the line of duty
Or your ass is missing in action bro
Tryin' to be a damn hero
They bring your folks that duffle bag
The only shit they wanna see is that doggy tag
Hopin' that the worryin' will cease
And your ass will be home in one damn piece
But my mom ain't gotta worry about that there
'Cause I ain't dyin' in the middle of nowhere
Another statistic, a body in a drawer
Man! mother fuck a war!
Y'all lucky that I ain't the president
'Cause I'll push the fuckin' button and get it over wit
Fuck all that waitin' and procrastinatin'
And all that goddamn negotiatin'
Flyin' back and fourth overseas
And havin' lunch and brunch with the motherfuckin' enemy
I'll aim one missile at Iraq
And blow that little piece off shit off the map
Yeah, I wouldn't give a fuck who it ices
'Cause I'm tired of payin' these high ass gas prices
Only the rich benefit, it'll be a cold day in hell before I enlist
To eat shit out a can like a worm
And everyday wear the same fuckin' uniform
Sores breakin' on my funky ass feet
Skin crawlin' 'cause I ain't took baths in weeks
Not knowin' if I'm comin' home or not
And if I do, I'll probably be shell shocked
I couldn't get a job just a free burial
You know how Uncle Sam treat it's veterans
Absolutely no respect
Get a plate in your head, lose a leg, you might get a check
Or a gaddamn star, you can have that shit
Mother fuck a war!
As I'm staring through the red mist
I feel my blood boiling
As I'm clenching my fists so hard
My heart rate goes up to the top
And my mind feels like I'm about to erupt
I'll take an ear to feed the pigs
I'll drain them all to get my fix
A hooker's scream heard around the world
My sharpened knife begs to explore
The N.Y.P.D. ain't got shit on me
I'll carve them all with a flick of my wrist
You'll never find a fucking fingerprint
I'll run this world, I'll lie and steal
None can match my scalpel skill
The N.Y.P.D. ain't got shit on me
No rest, no rest, no rest, no fucking arrests
I'll paint this town blood red tonight
Erase this scum from my fucking sight
I'll take an ear to feed the pigs
I'll drain them all to get my fix
A hooker's scream heard around the world
My sharpened knife begs to explore
The N.Y.P.D. ain't got shit on me
I'll carve them all with a flick of my wrist
You'll never find a fucking fingerprint
I'll run this world, I'll lie and steal
None can match my scalpel skill
The N.Y.P.D. ain't got shit on me
No rest, no rest, no rest, no fucking arrests
I'll paint this town blood red tonight
Erase this scum from my fucking sight
Kill the fucking lights
(x3)
A gift from god doing the devil's crimes
I set shit right one whore at a time
A gift from god doing the devil's crimes
I'll carve these bitches one slice at a time
You'd better catch me before I have my fun
I apologize again
Time after time after time
The conversation drifts
In no general direction
And your oral love
Is keeping me from bed
And it's talking and talking
It's all you ever said
You know it's all you want
All you want
You don't fool me
You don't fool me
No surprises
No surprises
Love in the hallway
Sex on the carpet
Antagonism rising
You know you try to categorise me
'Cause it's all you ever wanted
Just it's all you want
All you want
But you're changing my love
'Cause all you want is television
No heart is infected
No damage is done
No cavity open
No body no fun
They throw shit in your face
And you smile
They throw shit in your face
And you still come up smiling
You've got nothing to believe in
The diverse, the young and the breathing
But it's all you want
All you want, all you want, all you want
They said it's all you want
All you want
(Television)
You've got blasphemy with a smile
Insomnia sleeps with you nights
You've got commercial sex appeal
In sterile black and white
You got glorious colourless motion
From reel to reel you run
Nocturnal television
Internal sanctum
But it's all you want
It's all you want
But you're changing my love
'Cause all you want is television
(Television)
All night and day
It's all you ever wanted
You got glorious colourless motion
From reel to reel you run
Nocturnal television
Nocturnal television
It's on all night and day
All night and day
All night and day
Your fucking television
It's all you ever wanted
Fear this hate. Fear this doomsday
Terror rise defines the times
All that is sacred is now declined
A loss of feeling, a sense of threat
Push to an end into the darkness ahead
Closing in, the hands of time
7 minutes before the end of our lives
The die is cast, the scene is set
7 minutes to breathe our last breath
Live on borrowed time, feel the fear in me
Future, past, all is fading, warped reality
Nation against nation, corporation versus corporation
How much more for power? Hands tick towards devastation
As minutes pass we keep on dancing on our graves
Doomsday
As nation die we slowly move towards our doom
So che Sansone muore coi Filistei
E contro i morti non puoi vincere mai
Beh che muoia il verboe l'immortale sia io
Giacchè non sono neanche carne da cannone a Dio
carne e cannoni-carne e cannoni
Carne e cannoni e Dio
carne e cannoni ed io
Si bagnan le ragazze d'eternità
Nella bruttezza della vera poesia
Ma che muoia il verso e l'immortale sia io
Io che non sono neanche carne da cannone a Dio
carne e cannoni-carne e cannoni-carne e cannoni
Carne e cannoni e Dio
Sciogliamo il dubbio-io ti spiego cos'è:
Mi fotte un cazzo cosa pensi di me
Le notti-le botte-le stelle com'erano belle
Ma ora ho un senso inverso
Amanti-amici-onanisti-ribelli
Musicisti mai fratelli
Adesso-solisti-coltelli
Del niente-del niente
Che al limite ti fai una sega,ti fai qualcosa
La promozione incombe e nonostante questo
Fra la mia gente
Siamo tutti ancora liberi
I called you brazen
Called you whore right to your face
And watched you silently
And publicly disgraced
I didn't notice
When you strengthened like a vice
That you were trembling
And burned beneath the ice
Ooh, ooh
Why don't you weep
When I hurt you?
Why don't you weep
When I cut you?
You don't bleed
And the anger builds up inside
Why don't you weep
When I hurt you?
Why don't you weep
When I cut you?
You don't bleed
And the anger builds up inside
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
You said a prayer
And I betrayed you with a kiss
You never realized
That all had come to this
So keep your dignity
Don't throw it all to waste
Stronger feelings
Than you've ever learned to face
Ooh, ooh
Why don't you weep
When I hurt you?
Why don't you weep
When I cut you?
You don't bleed
And the anger builds up inside
Why don't you weep
When I hurt you?
Why don't you weep
When I cut you?
You don't bleed
And the anger builds up inside
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Ooh
Why don't you weep
When I hurt you?
Why don't you weep
When I cut you?
You don't bleed
And the anger builds up inside
Oh why don't you weep
When I hurt you?
Why don't you weep
When I cut you?
You don't bleed
And the anger builds up inside
Ooh
(Nah nah nah nah nah)
Why don't you weep?
Why don't you weep?
Why don't you weep?
Why don't you weep?
Why don't you weep?
Why don't you weep?
Weep
Weep
Weep
An Archangel in bondage
Bediademed, souled
With a murder of ravens
But no less Astarte to behold
Abandoned by Heaven
To the dead, dark and past
Cast Her dispersions
On life's brittle glass
And though Her eyes still held fire
As stonewalls caged the beast
'Gainst the lassitudes of Death
She fought but fell to greet
And midst lies in collusion
She was martyred to teach
That "Divinity and Lust
Are forever forbidden to meet"
But I swore that they would
Before the veil could part our embrace
Twixt Her cold, silent hips I kissed
And promised Christendom in flames
Gravid with madness
Like a feculent dirge
That obsesses the heart
I am covened by words
To avenge Her
Ebon splendour
And surrender
My soul to the dead to achieve
Prophecies of libidinous scourge
Horripilation braying o'er carious herds
Vexing nightmares
And their weak prayers
To a no one there
To hinder Her decree
To weed the world of their disease
As shadows unblind mine eyes to see
The meat that is their congregation
How they plead to the skies
But this is mere foreplay to war
Scar-riddled saffron eves bleed like the conjugal
Vestal daughters giving throat to the priest
A psychophant, the despoiler of faith
Now His skinless crucifixion feeds a winged diocese
For Her interred
I tore a battle banner from His hide
Splashed in red goetia
Hues of Hell and deicide
So came the night
Its obsidian light
Is a master whom disasters
Suck upon like concubines
And under black skirts
That whisper of delight
Darkseeds near fruition
Darked deeds to marry mine
"In Death's bed I have lain
Paying lip-service to shame
But for dreaming of thee I regain
A reason to seek life again"
Then we smite the divine
For our true nature is sin
To strip tender flesh from these swine
Like the lick of carnivorous winds
The breath of the storm that begins
By forcing its Herod tongue in
The womb of the holy virgin
To taste of immaculate sin
From temptation's peak we will see
The world unfurled at last
Now the wolves of time who stalk Mankind
Shall be as one in grim repast
Commemorating sickle moons
The pack are poised to reap
A scythe of white roses in bloom
Whose twisted thorns will keep
A crown upon a dead man
Daylights crucified in sleep
And lives that hide in scriptured lies
To the memories of a scream
And we shall dance amid the ruin
As Adam and Evil
Dizzy at the falling stars
That burn fiercer in throes of upheaval
If all must we damn for this moment
Then it shall be so
For our souls have crossed oceans of time
To clasp one another more tightly
Than Death could alone...
As Zyklon beats reign to make carrion crawl
The talons of lust rake a clarion call
To the lick of carnivorous winds
The lick of carnivorous winds
Were living in a boring world
I'm living on booze and birds
They say that everythings free
It's not true and it will never be
No I don't give a fuck
Sometimes I think I will be dead
With all the glue that is in my head
No jobs and we want no pope
There is nothing left and I have got no hope
Step towards the line how close can you before you fall right in the show me something something new and original I can't help feeling that I'm holding on with one hand show me difference something new I can't help it if you're building something I can't help it if I'm feeling nothing I can't help it if you're building something I can't help it if I've seen it all before show me something something new and original I'm holding on with one hand give me something something to live for countdown starts from ten when you hit four it all starts again reset the ride show me something something new and original I'm holding on with one hand something to live for something to die for and it's not a game
What are you, becoming?
What have you, become?
Once, you sang your own song, now your dancing to the same drum
What have you become?
And what is that, you're wearing?
Money's ugly confidence
You sacrificed, the poem of your imagination (Whoa)
For these pounds and pence
Me I take the cynics role, throw scorn on your empty mind
I've seen this monotonous world make dull, what used to shine
You lost interest, you lost your spine (Whoa)
That's fine fine fine
Bye Bye Bye Bye (Whoa)
When there's nothing left, on this plate your handed
You'll find yourself, running the gauntlet, of all these double standards
Its very thin ice, over which you're skating (Whoa)
And after this black winter, the thaw
So what are you?
Tell me, tell me what are you?
Now what have you... Become?
(Intro - Obie Trice)
Bitch I see you, cause you know I know you
Yeah I know you.
(Verse - Obie Trice)
Last time I saw you
You was brewed up, booed up, ready for a new fuck
Last time you saw me
I was P-I to the motherfucking M-P WHAT!
And lately I heard you's a broke bitch livin' in the lower class suburb
And lately the word is I live in a suburb and I don't fuck with birds
She used to pump on the block
Sell a nigga rocks, bail a nigga out BUT!
She tried to plot on a nigga, vacan't lot one shot bitch died go figure
He used to pay this bitch, gave her lots of shit
Fuck's wrong with this nigga man?
He used to bring her through the hood
Treat the bitch to fuckin' good, my opinion
We used to blaze with the bitch, faded off the lick she x-rays the clip
This nigga bought braids for the bitch
Louis Vuitton kicks and tricked on some sucka shit
Meanwhile in the hood she drivin' around good
This bitch thinks she's in Hollywood
Meantime she settin the nigga up
Telling us what his stuff she's ready to get him stuck WHAT!
(Chorus - Nate Dogg (Obie Trice))
Thick eyes but she full of surprises
I swear this bitch is Shady (that's what I know)
Sex on her mind all the time
And you think that that's your baby (you don't know)
You a good guy that's living a lie
But she told us where your safe be (it's what I know)
If you cool and she satisfied
How come that bitch just paged me? (you don't know)
(Verse - Obie Trice)
We had to ride on a nigga
WATCH HIM! for the right time to get richer
We decided when the hit was, run up on him, .45 in the ribs WHAT!
This nigga screamed like a bitch
Showed us what his shit hit her, hell of a lick BUT!
The bitch, who told us 'bout the bricks exposed us to the nigga
He knew that we'd come BUT! {*gun shot*}
Meanwhile in his hood, his niggaz is suiting up and Timbed, looted up
Rims and new trucks your man 'Livin' It Up'
Then a van with no hubs suddenly pulled up and erupt
Shot a nigga the fuck up
Just my luck, the bitch got us both touched, it's like a rush
The bitch who blushed and smoked blunts wit us
Turned out to be nuts, switched up
Mixed up wit the wrong slut
Got my friend zipped up in the bag, it's all bad
My niggaz got my back, in fact
They caught on her Ave, flossin in another nigga cab
I could be wrong here
I could be right
I could be the Son of God
Selling you a little life
But you wouldn't see me
You wouldn't hear me
Why you and not me?
Tell me Holy Man
Is that supposed to mean something?
Am I supposed to feel something?
Am I to believe that you hold the key?
My way wrong and yours right?
I could be wrong here
You could be right
Please forgive me I have sinned -
Not on your life
But that's how you want me
But I'll never fear thee
Why you and not me?
Tell me Holy Man
Is that supposed to mean something?
Am I supposed to feel something?
Am I to believe that you hold the key?
My way wrong and yours right?
You want it?
You need it?
You love it?
You keep it
You want it?
You need it?
You love it?
You keep it
You want it?
You need it?
You love it?
You keep it
You want it?
You need it?
You love it?
You keep it!
(You want me to bow down, lie down, accept it and die)
Say what, say what, say what, say what, say why
(You want me to fear you, revere you, never question your lies)
Say what, say what, say what, say what, say why
You and me now
You and me now
You and me now
You and me now
Oh, Jesus Christ
(I will never fear you)
Oh, Jesus Christ
(I will never fear you)
Oh, Jesus Christ
(I will never fear you)
Oh, Jesus Christ
(I will never fear you)
Holy man!
(I will never fear you)
Holy man!
(I will never fear you)
Holy man!
(I will never fear you)
Holy man!
The price of your soul is less than the cab fare 
That gets you home before the living end 
The dead part of you leaves me with a blessing 
From a destruction of your beauty 
Your self-hatred your self-pity 
There's so little of you left 
The dead part of you takes me out 
And says the beast in me is fading fast 
And leaves me with a great big goodbye hug 
It's busy clinging to the dead part of the past 
You only love one thing 
And there's so little of it left 
He has taken everything 
And there's so little of you left 
You're just a baby in the back seat 
That a door slam sends crying into the world 
And a cab driver's in a hurry that matters more than 
More than anything we can hope for from the world 
You only love one thing 
And there's so little of it left 
He has taken everything 
And there's so little of you left

Sors immanis, et inanis, rota to volubilis.
Status malus, vana salus, semper dissolubilis.
Obumbrata,
Et elata, michi quoque niteris.
Nunc per ludum,
Dorsum nudum,
Fero tui sceleris.
Dread destiny and empty fate,
An everturning wheel.
Who make adversity and fickle health,
Alike turn to nothing.
In the dark and secretly,
You work against me.
How through your trickery my naked back is turned to you unarmed.
Why should I watch Matt Damon cry without her at my side?
I pined as days went by, but now it's fine
Cause in the end, we're such close friends, sugar-n-spice, and since then
There's more time for me, I've started a diary and washed my car again
And I can watch Good Will Hunting by myself (it's cool, it's fine)
I can shop for clothes without her help (it's cool, it's fine)
I can hang out with my friends, do the good times ever end?
Yeah I can watch Good Will Hunting by myself
It's okay that you haven't called me in a week or two
I'm sure it's hard for you, it's been hard for me too
But as long as wood still floats, I can sow my wild oats and paint the town red
The party's far from dead, I'm happy in my empty bed
And I can watch Good Will Hunting by myself (it's cool, it's fine)
I can shop for clothes without her help (it's cool, it's fine)
I can hang out with my friends, do the good times ever end?
Yeah I can watch Good Will Hunting by myself
Girl, I remember when we was sittin' on your couch
Watchin' Good Will Hunting, holdin' hands and drinkin' milkshakes
But milkshakes melt, people change, and you dumped me on my birthday
Right after I bought you that really expensive thing from the Body Shop
Called Jojoba Loofah Milktowel or something like that
That I sold 147 Cutco knives to afford, but whatever, hey, it's cool
I've moved on you know, I'm happy now, well, happy in a crying sorta way
You know, curled up naked in the shower biting your knees wishing you were dead kinda happy
But I realized you were right, we were never meant to be
And you know what? Thank God
'Cause you're the most vapid, whiny blah I've ever met
Always making fun of my clothes, telling me how hot other guys are, asking me to pay you gas money?!
Buy your own gas you bug-eyed mooch, it's your car and it costs more than my house
Oh and now you're going around trying to sleep with my friends
Hey good, that really makes you an empowered individual, no wait, did I say empowered individual? I meant two-cent gutter slut
Listen you tanning-bed-baked, broke-ass, goat-faced, oompa-loompa monkey problem
I am proud to shop at Target, I'll wear warm-up pants any day of the week
Yes, your ass did look fat in those jeans, your mom's a M.I.L.F.
And I plan to get on your little sister just as soon as I give her a call back, oh and you know what else?
You can watch Good Will Hunting by yourself (you bitch, please die)
You can waste your life without my help (you bitch, please die)
You can hang out with your friends, that is if you had any friends
You can watch Good Will Hunting by yourself till your eyes fall out
You can watch Good Will Hunting by yourself, I hope your eyes fall out
Why don't you go watch it by yourself? Go to hell!
Where do I put this fire
This bright red feeling
This tiger lily down my mouth
He wants to grow to twenty feet tall
I've left bethlehem
I feel free
I've left the girl I was supposed to be and
Someday I'll be born
I'm so tired of being shy
I'm not that girl anymore
I'm not that straight A anymore
I want to sit with my legs wide open and
Laugh so loud that the whole damn restaurant
Will turn and look at me and say
Look at the tiger jumping out of her mouth
No more sex-starved teachers
Trying to touch my ass
I can finally be a teenager at age twenty-six
Go to hell lions, tigers, and bears
I'm not afraid of you anymore
And my fear broke apart like fifty balloons
And I'm thrown around the room like party confetti now
Someday I'll be born
Someday someday someday I'll be born
Someday someday someday I'll be born
High and noon (13 times)
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here, oh oh
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I let you fool me
Believed you cared
Pretty words misled me
How could I be so blind?
Pretty words
Feelings of love became feelings of hate
You don't deserve a tear that I've shed
Wish I had the strength to turn my back
But you always know what to say
I swore that no one
Would hurt me like this
I feel for your lies no more
I'll fight for me, only me
Pretty words
Feelings of love became feelings of hate
You don't deserve a tear that I've shed
Wish I had the strength to turn my back
But you always know what to say
Now I'm getting stronger
I'm starting to see now
You're not the one I thought you'd be
Just get the hell away from me

Pretty words
Feelings of love became feelings of hate
You don't deserve a tear that I've shed
Wish I had the strength to turn my back
But you always know what to say
Pretty words
Feelings of love became feelings of hate
You don't deserve a tear that I've shed
Wish I had the strength to turn my back
But you always know what to say
Late night catechism speaks me to sleep
A lethal dose of narcissism conquers the beast
I can't remember how I got my last scar...
The bible tells us Jesus... Was a rockstar
A prayer under pressure
Of violent anguish
A prayer under pressure
Of violent anguish
Early morning exorcisms keep me awake
Seven stars surround me as I burn like a saint
I can't remember why my knees are so sore
The bible tells us Mary... Was a whore
A prayer under pressure
Of violent anguish
A prayer under pressure
Of violent anguish
There once was a girl, and she suffered from sickness
Her mouth was distorted from razor sharp kisses
Tried to pretend it was all in her mind
But I know her voice... When I hear mine
God, are you listening? I hear you in my room
As hot as the moon on the tenth day of June
There's no sleeping for me, I'm losing my faith
Love is not safe in a world filled with hate
Heartsick...
I'm sick...
Still sick...
My heart... IS SICK!
A man is known by his tools
I earn my keep with my tools
Fools, you fools, you fools, you fools
You will not touch my tools
I want to know what you do with my grinder
A man is known by his tools
I earn my keep with my tools
Fools, you fools, you fools, you fools
You will not touch my tools
I want to know what you do with my grinder
War censored, no blood on TV
Cheap entertainment sold like a new deodorant
World War Three, a Sega dreamland
I'd take a whore to the funeral
Sculpture of man
Sculpture of man

Sculpture of man
Jesus descends, Dachau his father
Flanders is a corpse under flowers
There's more art in Burger King
Than the British museum today
Sculpture of man
Sculpture of man

Sculpture of man
Wills and Harry, dressed in drag
Standing over the sodomised body of their mother
Would make a beautiful poster in Athena

Fall into this nightmare we've built
Ripping ourselves from within
With a desperate cry
With the taste of sweat on my tongue
(Blind!)
Blind from this state that we're in
Blinded like moths to the flame
With a desperate cry
With the taste of fears we create
Failure!
Oh! [Solo]
Learn!
Driven by what we achieve
Draining ourselves from within
And a desperate cry
From the promise of starting again
Die!
Broken from where we have failed
Never returning again
With a desperate cry
With the sense of a life thrown away
In this fire we burn
Back to the light we return
I hear the dying screams
I sense the end is near
With a final exhalation
My soul is reborn in fire
This fire will burn
In this fire we'll burn
A sense of life is thrown away
We learn to fall and run away
A sense of life is thrown away
In this fire we'll burn
In this fire we burn
Back to the light we return
I wanna be sure, I wanna be clear
I want you to know, I love you my dear
Me, I'm so dirty, covered in spite
Maybe you'll come back 'cause you want me, maybe you won't
But you were so young, don't you feel dumb
You're not the only unfortunate one
Held in your head, the things that they said
And all of the lies, and bad things they did
Me, I'm unworthy, callous and cold
Maybe you need me 'cause you're lonely, maybe you don't
And we all live
And make mistakes
And build up walls that make us safe
Spitting on all that make us sick
Sixty six promises
Fell from your lips
Sixty six kisses to
Rest on my charred fingertips
And Sixty six lovers
To come till I tell
Sixty six postions to take on this
Well-worn trail
Sixty six magicians
Deliver the goods
Documenting our marriage for some
Silent film in Hollywood
Is it not what you thought it would be?
Was it not what you wanted it to be
Was I not what you thought I would be?
Was it not what you wanted it to be?
Sixty miles talking
But making no sense
A life out of liberty
And the pursuit of
Happiness
Waiting for something
To smash a few wholes
In the wall of good fortune
And the windows to an
Outer world
And sixty six promises
They came in a kiss
Provided a meaning
Now I see how it reallly is
And it's not what I thought it would be
And it's not what I wanted ti to be
And it's not what I thought it would be
And it's not what I wanted it to be
(I see some very nice skin out there)
I like the smell of that shop
I like the way it serves me
I like the pigment in your skin
I like the way it moves me
I like kids when they're asleep
Their little arms around you
I like the way we play games
Don't lose that skin feeling
I'm looking old, I'm feeling young
It's the truth, my child
My second life has just begun
With this hungry girl 
I like black and I like red
And I like that orange circle
I like the things that you said
When you were misbehaving
I like the people on T.V.
But no one looks like me
I love you and you love me
Don't lose that skin feeling
I'm looking old, I'm feeling young
It's the truth, my child
My second life has just begun
With this hungry girl
I love the pigment in your skin
I love the way it moves me
I like the smell of that shop
I like the way it serves me
I like the things that you said
When you were misbehaving
I love you and you love me
Don't lose that skin feeling
I'm looking old I'm feeling young
It's the truth, my child
My second life has just begun
With this hungry girl
It's the truth, my child
Let me hold you high
(And I like to get up in the sky)
(I like to look down)
(I like to fly)
(I like to fly in the sky real high)
(I like to run in the sand like a horse)
(That's what I like)
(I like to swim in the ocean like a fish)
(I like to fly high)
My rage burns deep inside me
My will to hate is strong
I can't keep control my anger
It is tearing up my mind
I'm pissed off at the world
For reasons I don't know why
I put the blame on you
Your existence I despise
I can't relate with your world
And I don't want to try
To me you're all so fucked
I choose to stay away
I'm pissed off at the world
For reasons I don't know why
I put the blame on you
Your existence I despise
Hate grows stronger
Hate grows stronger
There's a star in the night sky
Brings you to my side 
Despite all the earth we feel
There's still glitter in your eyes 
There's a chill in the night 
It brings us closer together 
Looking up without knowing 
Where is our love going
Future is a sea of light
Future is a mass of shade 
Dreams that you soon forget
Dreams where the TV made 
There's a star in the night sky
Brings you closer to my side 
Looking up without knowing 
Where is our love going 
There's a chill in the night 
It brings us closer together 
Looking up without knowing 
Where is our love going
There's a chill in the night 
Bringing all us together 
Looking up without knowing 
Where is our love going
There's a star in the night sky
Brings you closer to my side 
Looking up without knowing 
Where is our love going 
There's a chill in the night 
It brings us closer together 
Looking up without knowing 
Where is our love going
There it stands way up high
A million bodies piled to the sky
Arms and legs, feet and hands
Impossible to understand
Countless heads, ears and eyes
Never hear, never cry
Tribal chants, tribal war
Tribal death, tribal gore
And the scavengers are feeding
'Cause the killing fields are bleeding
Not a single soul is breathing
'Cause the Serengeti's bleeding
And the scavengers are feeding
'Cause the killing fields are bleeding
Not a single soul is breathing
'Cause the Serengeti's bleeding
Listen, somewhere in the jungle
You can hear the devil laughing
Somewhere
African genocide
Brother kill brother, side by side
Wild animals show their teeth
And run away in disbelief
And the scavengers are feeding
'Cause the killing fields are bleeding
Not a single soul is breathing
'Cause the Serengeti's bleeding
And the scavengers are feeding 'cause the killing fields are bleeding
(Somewhere)
Not a single soul is breathing 'cause the Serengeti's bleeding
(Somewhere)
And the scavengers are feeding 'cause the killing fields are bleeding
(The rivers are flowing with blood)
Not a single soul is breathing 'cause the Serengeti's bleeding
(The mothers will cry)
Listen, somewhere in the jungle you can hear the devil laughing
Somewhere
(Not a single soul is breathing 'cause the Serengeti's bleeding)
The rivers are flowing with blood
(And the scavengers are feeding 'cause the killing fields are bleeding)
The mothers will cry their tears
(Not a single soul is breathing 'cause the Serengeti's bleeding)
They watch their sons die
Listen, somewhere in the jungle you can hear the devil laughing
Somewhere
(Not a single soul is breathing 'cause the Serengeti's bleeding)
The rivers are flowing with blood
(And the scavengers are feeding 'cause the killing fields are bleeding)
The mothers will cry their tears
(Not a single soul is breathing 'cause the Serengeti's bleeding)
They watch their sons die
Listen, somewhere in the jungle you can hear the devil laughing
Somewhere
If you grew up in the 60's
You grew up with war on TV every night
A war that your friends were involved in
And I want to do this song tonight for all the young people out there
If you're in your teens
Because I remember a lot of my friends when they we were 17 or 18
We didn't have much of a chance to think about how we felt about a lot of things
And the next time they're gonna be looking at you
And you're gonna need a lot of information to know what you're gonna wanna do
Because in 1985, blind faith in your leaders, or in anything, will get you killed
'Cause what I'm talking about here is
War (Ooh!), ooh, yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again
War (Ooh!), ooh, yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Come on!
War is something that I despise
For it means destruction of innocent lives
And thousands of mothers and their mothers cry
When their sons go out to fight to give their lives
War (Ooh!), ohoho, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again
War (Ooh!), ohoho, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Hey!
War (Ooh!), it's nothing but a heartbreaker
War (Ooh!), friend only to the undertaker
Yeah, the war is the enemy of all mankind
The thought of War (Ooh!), it blows my mind
Handed down from generation to generation
Induction, destruction, who wants to die?
War (Ooh!), ohoho now
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again
War (Ooh!), yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Come on, man
War (Ooh!), it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War (Ooh!), friend only to the undertaker
War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is too precious to be fighting wars each day
War can't give life, it can only take it away
War (Ooh!), ohoho, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again
War (Ooh!), good god
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Peace love and understanding, god
There must be some place for these things today
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But, Lord, there's gotta be another way that's better than
War (Ooh!), yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again!
War (Ooh!), good god
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Come on now!
War (Ooh!), yeaheaheaheah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!
Say it again!
War (Ooh!), oh yeah
What is it good for?
Nothing!
I'm talking 'bout war!

Almost near my knees

Yeah, Choke!
I feel your breath upon my neck
You're bleeding
Desperate to see you in my rage
Love, hate, lust
It's all the same
When you go down
I wanna...
I wanna...
I wanna...
Choke you!
Choke, choke, I choke you
Angry grip around your neck
You feel black and blue
Angry grip around your neck
As I choke you
Innocence fuels my foolish mind
Kiss and scrape ivory, revenge is mine
Love, hate, lust it's all the same
As you go down
I wanna...

Choke you!
Choke, choke, I choke you
Angry grip around your neck

Choke you!
Choke, choke, I choke you
Angry grip around your neck
You feel black and blue
Angry grip around your neck
As I choke you
Choke!
Strade deserte 
Note distorte 
Componi per lei 
Si è fatto buio già 
Ore seduto 
Su un marciapiede 
Sotto un lampione 
Sai che lei non tornerà 
E' un lamento continuo 
Di frasi che ormai 
Sono andate, sparite 
Mai più sentirai 
Ti aspettavi di udire 
"Sei il solo per me" 
Metti l'anima in pace 
Quei giorni son già 
Fumo e cenere 
La nebbia sul viso 
Nasconde il sorriso 
Di quei giorni in cui 
Lei era accanto a te 
Riassaggi i momenti 
Scorrendo i messaggi 
Ma solo quelli più dolci 
Non li cancellerai 
Il tuo mondo 
Sta andando a puttane 
Oramai 
Puoi reagire ma forse 
Non è ciò che vuoi 
Preferisci esser vittima 
Non guarirai 
Non mollare 
E' un consiglio 
O ti ridurrai 
Fumo e cenere
Johnny Falls
He throws his hands
Into the air, into these walls
He's freakin out
He's got a gun
He'll get his way
He'll have his fun
You make a mess
You bruise my name
Try to cut me down with every word you say
If you wreck my day
If you wreck my day
You son of a bitch you're gonna get some
And I'm tired
Of this stupid game
Running in circles from you again
Don't blame me
For what I gotta do
I won't hate myself to be loved by you
Johnny runs
He shuts his eyes
He only sees
From nine to five
Don't let him down
He's got a gun
He'll get his way
He'll have his fun
All you wannabes
Don't have what it takes
To take a shot at me
To put me in my place
If you wreck my day
If you wreck my day
You son of a bitch you're gonna get some
And I'm tired
Of this stupid game
Running in circles from you again
Don't blame me
For what I gotta do
I won't hate myself to be loved by you
Don't push me
Don't blame me
Or you'll be sorry
You're not getting through
I won't back down
As of right now
I won't hate myself to be loved by you
Wo--ah, wo--ah, wo--ah
See me cry
See me smile
See me fall

Of this stupid game
Running in circles from you again

Wo--ah, wo--ah, wo--ah
I won't hate myself to be loved by you
Woa---h
Yeah
(Say goodbye)
I know just how much I love you
But there is no time to explain
I realize just what I'd give to
Get you back in my arms
And I see you hand in hand with another man
And I don't know what you see in him and why you let us go
So if you're gonna lie
At least you could just let us die
And if you're gonna cry to me baby
At least you could just say goodbye
And I'm caught between myself and me
And I can't find the bridge
From my mind to reality
I'm trying to find a place in the sun
But I'm drowning in the rain
That's falling every place I run
And I see you hand in hand with another man
And I don't know what you see in him and why you let us go
So if you're gonna lie
At least you could just let us die
And if you're gonna cry to me baby
At least you could just say goodbye
Well I'm not gonna sit around just waiting for you to get over him
So oh, no, no, no
Say goodbye
Say goodbye now
Say goodbye
Say goodbye now
Say goodbye
Say goodbye now
Say goodbye now
Well if you're gonna lie
Well at least you could just let us die
And if you're gonna cry to me baby
At least you could just said goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye now
Say goodbye
Oh yeah
Won't you say goodbye
Won't you say goodbye now
Won't you say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye now
Say goodbye
Say goodbye now
Say goodbye
Say goodbye now
Say goodbye now
Won't you kiss me goodbye
You've gotta tell me goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye now
Say goodbye
Say goodbye now

Love, four words, explode above a mnemonic device
To remember how it feels when I am with you
The glass can't hide, my wounds will find the salt around the rim
And this sting won't help this bleeding heart forget you
Perfect lines like space and time extend across my room
But they don't help me get any closer to you
But open the door and the clouds come in
And find you sleeping on the floor
Get used to the numbness, you won't have to feel that anymore
But maybe I'd be better off if I just answer quickly
And make no distinction
If it's going up or coming down, it gets confused with progress
It is only motion
And all this time still hanging on into such codependence
I will fall completely
And all the lines you drew for me to walk
Well, I walked them well, didn't I?
It is one less tongue that bends to say your name
As I drive away the love songs play on my lonely radio
But I shut them off because all they do is make me miss you so much more
And so remains these twisted days
I spend time by myself
And attempt to make this failing heart continue to beat
So open your mouth and the smoke pours in, tastes so lonely
We are so bored, just breathe in the numbness
You won't have to feel that anymore
But maybe I'd be better off if I just end this quickly
It is not romantic
I am just giving up and shutting down
I am just so sick of thinking my head is broken
And in this aching bed we are lying on you
Get your forced confession, I am fucking lonely
And all the lines you drew for me to walk
Well, I walked them well, didn't I?
Now there is one less tongue that will bend to say your name
Did you ever believe in me
In you I never had a doubt
Although you were a part of me
I just had to spit you out
You never listen, you never hear a word I say
You burn me inside, so I put you in your place
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
I cannot believe it's taken so long
To obtain the sight I need
The taste of your lips I RECALL
Now burning black inside of me, inside me
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Spit you out, spit you out
You're nothing to me
You're nothing to me
You make me act so obscene
You're nothing to me, stop fucking with me
You never listen, you never hear a word I say
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Spit you out, spit you out
Spit you out, spit you out
