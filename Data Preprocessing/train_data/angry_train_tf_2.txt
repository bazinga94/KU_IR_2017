Screamin fucking bloody mess
Leaving absolutely nothing behind 
Stole a car, shot a cop
And in return, the have become my martyrs,
This shit should have gone "beta burns babylon, the end"
I severe the weakest niggas who not on my pedigree
Hey these girls say that this town sucks ooh
All about the tragedy and how you haven't slept right
Can't stop
Meanwhile we met your pal in its worse, you spit its thin
Two thousand other souls burn bright tonight
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
Make it feel like there's something
You're not doing what you're told
Vicious mindless violence that offers nothing new
Little punk is the product of an inflated market
Instead I'm feeling sorry for myself
You know I'm here for you,
A different wound that keeps them bleeding
You better watch your man 'cause he's spendin' all your cash,
Can you crease the wrinkles back into the cracked and open brain
You son of a bitch you're gonna get some
From one another, another one should come to one another
It comes as no surprise he's taken by surprise
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more
So when I bomb first, nigga, who you rollin' with
And says, "I got mine but I want more"
Now baby, baby, baby, why you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad
Karma killer
Bumpin' somethin' about clubs, bumps and hubs
I wonder how much pain it would take
Pulses through my veins
Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody that, I'm actually gonna do it, or that I believe in it
Was losing all my friends
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
Be my enemy
No tender scar no twist of fate
It's the same old cry
Makin' hoes, take these clothes, from these sto's
While so much still stands in our way
Then I'd throw it in your face
I hate it when you breach my space
Pass the eight, sack of shake
I'm glad I am crazy, it keeps me trying
We are advertisements for agony and pain
Runnin' wild through the streets like I'm loco
We had a chance to change our mind
When I'm God everyone dies
Is killing everyone
I was PI to the motherfucking MP WHAT
Right into my backyard
See I laid down beside her in the hospital bed
You wanna know why
We started out friends
Supressing the power inside
Everything had a shot
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
Tell all your lies while I bleed right through
Erase my soul for all your sins can never be undone
Sex, violence, money and dope 
Kerosene around, set me on fire
I have a reasonable doubt I think I'll just spell it out
But I'm not a slave
You can hate me now Die motherfucker die motherfucker die
Now every time you make your friend the reason
Do you miss the blend
And you're sure no one's there
Makes you believe I'm
Wrapped its arms around my waist
Let me be free if the strain on your conscience gets under your skin
I want mine right here, right now
But that's not what you need some day a sign arrives and that day will be left all in flames
Fear is your only god on the radio, nah fuck it
Process me, produce the proper symmetry to put me in charge of reinventing the mute Put me in party to the scheduled lie and give me your right hand but live by your left, make me murder every mountain and remove every paradise
All of my hate cannot be bound
Dos not cuatro word to Kool Keith, "I'ma break up your teeth"
Ain't no coppin' a plea, ain't no stoppin' a G
I turned into what destroyed it 
I'm a golden curse, call me treacherous, treasure chest
Now she's gonna make it out ok, but she's shaking like a revolution
You're just a semiautomatic hate machine 
Every scratch, every click, every heartbeat
Or another casualty
And I feel your warm sun on my face
A feeling is a piece of skin wrapped in a pocket
I'm gonna have to kill you now
But I can cry as long as money's seen
Left, right, left
In you I never had a doubt
Painted a new picture that makes me sick
Lick my legs I'm on fire
She run, run, run, run
"You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God"
You know anklebiters ate up your personality
I never put any faith in this life
Into the souls on the tree of pain
Pass me the sugar and things still won't be right
This shit remind me of a driveby
When it gets dark
There's no such thing as passions or wants or desires
We can drown in mediocrity, it feels sublime
Look ahead now
We've always been like worlds apart now you're seeing two nightmares collide"
Shut the fuck up, take the pain
Disrespect me  my potency is deadly
"I tried to tell the others, but they wouldn't believe me You're all doomed, you're all
Défigurée que j'ai gravé mon nom sur leur mur avec mon sang 
The crosshair in my eye, a vessel to god
To scrutinize what we call fate
They know I'm tight but I be conceited if I admit it
Eat what you are while you're falling apart
Come on, come on now don't you
I like how all that good shit sounds
That I would even show up to this fake shit
Dear Lord, lead us back into the Valley of the Shadow of Death,
I don't know what else to say
You liar, you liar, all your words are just dust in moonshine
Bend them over you get a taste of lollirot
The game I ain't even use a gun
"Folks I know you're all dying to know how long
Swallowed by the river
The billions of people to sick to believe
Niggaz love to scream peace after they start some shit  pay attention
See how much you've done now
We take back control
Who ever stand in your way
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind
And I beg your disease
Well, they wanted my brandnew phone with all the pictures of the kids and the wife
And We can force you to believe"
If you really want hell, hell
'Cause I'm fighting with a thorn on my side
All the king's men fell down on their knees
Now the sluts, they wanna bone when they see me, whoa
I will not say I'm all right for you
I wouldn't waste your motherfuckin' time with no bullshit baby
It's the end, exgirlfriend
Your gatt looks rusted, disgusted
Oh gonna pay for mine
If we fall into ourselves we will become free
That's the life I choose guns, drugs, and booze
Great white death
You're killing me in cold blood
When Hollywood passed I nearly lost my mind
We'll float away from this mother fucking human world
Jacobite blended dregs a gypsy's old bed setter
Free now from everything weighing you down
Choking away the life that I have left
Trying to get rough when it's obvious they ain't rough enough
Genocide
They cannot take my rights
I got the nectar of the gods flowing from my mental pod
I move in another dimension oh oh oh
Belief no more of what's been forced into
Why can't we sleep always
When they say all of this is approaching its end
You're not the only one who runs on instincts
From guns given to my people from my own kind P Dog
I don't care for EEC or CFCs or the latest disease
My happiness there just to die
Out to the lake of tears
But to understand
This city once was mine
Talkin' that shit, punk
The shame, the lovers
You've made me what I am today
The spirit of Almighty Voice, the ghost of Anna Mae
How does it feel to know that I'm a part of it
Baby no half stepping no baby
L'on puisse m'attendre 
But I never understood who even made the rules
You're not living, we are
This is not the st time
Evacuating pain, fear
But now it's winter, my bones
To fake
So bury the good and let that shit rot
You think I'll wan't you for evermore
When I looked into her eyes I cared enough to wonder why
This rap is the kick back from toes you tread on
I can't say what I want to
Such an irreparable disintegration
That have long gave up the ghost
If I thought for a second it would do any good
And I'm twisted brown from all of the bullshit that I've been through
He was paining, now a bunch of whispering immerse
You can just apologize back
Well I'll cut your tongue
I am a ghost, you are my host
And the readymen, defiant drinkers and charmers
Guess I didn't cut you deep enough, to bleed, to bleed, to bleed, oh I see
I'm through  I kicked it  I won't kill myself
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your grace inside
And that little punk did it all for the cookie
I don't wanna carry any of your pain
After losin' every battle
And beat this bitch with a hit
When niggas speculate, what the fuck Pac would say
I just had to expose the truth like Leonardo DaVinci when he paint Madonna
Yup I know how you work, you ain't nothing but a flirt baby girl that's one of the risks
Shadow soldiers
Hey good, that really makes you an empowered individual, no wait, did I say empowered individual I meant twocent gutter slut
I And put her in my claw
Just wanna take something, something
Can you remember how it felt to be alive
Hate mail is not read, in jail instead
Graue Leute suchen Wege für die Ewigkeit
And you know we're right
I hate the way you talk
Terror at gunpoint
The world will sing like a happy bug
Please forgive me I have sinned 
She's nobody's fool
Don't give me your hate
Too late yank crime
Throw the pistol in 
Can't get it back, wish I was dead instead
And life is bittersweet
And I can't feel it
Hey God I believed your promises, your promises and lies
So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes
We can't control our accessies spreading
Don't know
Hemmungslos mein Geld verprassen,
But you sit there silent, folded arms
I see a woman in the night
The lead giveth, I take it, if I didn't understand it
Like a malingering ghost
*Laughing* "I understand that time is running out"
Lay your flowers on our grave
You end up dead in the end
I'll pass almost every penny on to you
At least I'll always know which side of the gun I'm supposed to buy the farm from,
Could never understand or try
All my problems are for me
Sell out whitey liberals who hang with blackie sinners
Coward
As though you had no choice
I thought we wiped the slate clean, that's fucked up
Do not give them the best of you
I'd go through hell for you no matter
You could have stopped it
And I know I can be self righteous
Obnoxious until they shoot me on the day I retire
And honey honey the call is for war 
The game is lost, eternal hate
Au revoir la triste gamine 
So honey gotta help me please
Black black black black black black
I place myself in your hands to fall
So please make up your mind
One drop for breath and one for skin
But I'll never fear thee
Everything but then again I was thinking about nothing
So I run into the hall
Oh, no, no
Ohno ohno ohno
War Ooh, it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
What's real, anybody with nowhere to run
You know how this part is
You fucking pig, now you die
I gotta feel you right now
Come around no more
Thrown out the temple, noncalodic wit the father
I'm the flame I can't get burnt
But I want to see you
Loose bitches in tight jeans
All the little things that make me run away
Come to save you 'cause you're all mine
Where was hate when I felt like love
If ya know me then you know we pop away
Into the abyss will I run
Fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck yo' fine ass bitch
I wanna taste the breeze of every great city
 Stupid black owners are foreigners to affairs of the heart
Give me back to the endless wild 
I've got to get out of my skin
I'd like to break his neck, if I may
Alike turn to nothing
Here comes the war  put out the lights on the Age of Reason
Don't think 'cause you can't see me that I'm not watching
I'm repeating myself again
dizendo que tudo vai acabar
I have crawled a million miles to reach you
You don't know what I want
'Cause nothing is happening 
That high horse you get on from bullshit you where fed on
But then you're fucked
Losing ground and falling faster
A bullet in the head
You know I can't count how many times I've heard people say
To bring the dark upon the light
Head of the class and she just want a swallowship
Without a reason to believe in something,
Very sore, unsatisfied
What's perfect for you is like a hell for me
Strip your ass butt naked
Some of them are cryin' 'cause the soldiers look so brave
After I've stopped waiting for an ambulance to come and get me
High speed horse shoes harnneses and heavy string
'Cause Marshall Mathers the rappers persona's half a facade and
It's easy to control us if you keep us all afraid
It's kinda like our running joke
On my swollen tongue
Oh, honey I'm a mess
Does your life stand for anything
Whatever it takes
Lies burning eyes
And spent night after hammered night getting back my mind
I know it's your child I'm carryin' in me,
So another six months won't make a difference to me now
This is how a heart breaks Can't take it no more ooh
Wir wollten nicht so werden wie die Leute die wir hassen
He's a hipshooting exoil king
And the visions blew my mind
You want me to fear you, revere you, never question your lies
Infiltrated business cesspools
Here's to the justice never dealt, to innocent, proven guilty
Who cares if you die
I knew that someday I'd end up
Ignorance is bliss, you know it's true
Stand there with your ball and chain
In the line of fire  watching empires fall
You know I'll just work it out myself
But the whole fucking system is twisted
Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet
I've burned
Said "I don't wanna feel a thing, I don't want to feel a thing"
You Hippocratic, messianic
Something saved my skin
And I want to do this song tonight for all the young people out there
This is all mine
I'd be a damn good one
If it wadn't for me where the fuck you'd be
There's no use to keep a secret
I'm wishing I was back in utero
Into their graves
And I'll kick that hoe, punt
The games that politicians start
I want to destroy you
Answer me where I stand
Motherfuck a war, that's how I feel
I'm just lookin' for a big yellow
Right now
I'm comin' home and I'm gon' be kinda pissed
I hold out for the rare when the silence is golden
Believe Believe
You're kinda breaking up
It doesn't bother you you're someone else's wife
Well at least you could just let us die
Standing in the tall grass
Bright coloured wrappers to suit assorted greeds
So put another penny in and turn the crank
And take her fucking with you
If I let the niggaz around my way tell me how to feel about me
They break our legs to prove a point
This time you drowned us in misery, that's why you forced me to say
Leaves with a blood stain
We burn and coil like cigarettes
Her fingernails longer than her dress is
Gnash your teeth Like a flamingo swarm
In a scatlike gibberish for not saying 'butterfingers'
I get unemployment, you work and we making the same shit
The whole world hates you
But they can't talk Four walls
'Cause I'm so heavily influenced by the things that I watch
Then I think you'll understand
Sayin' such a shame
There's no truth left in your voice
I know you're so alone,
In the land of dirt and plaster
Pedisinister girl next door
'Cause your beef is mine and we're one and the same
And what do you call assassins who accuse assassins anyway, my friend
In squadrons passed me by
That shit don't mean nuttin to me No nuttin to me no nuttin to me
Hey hey yeah, like your hands on my back and
'Cause beyond my hopes there are no feelings
See, you're not, going crazy, it's me, I'm your best friend Tyler
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above
And we'll go at it punk and I'm gonna fuck you up
Know I meant, every motherfuckin word
Click your fucking heels, there's no place like home
How my niggaz feelin' good how my niggaz like it rough
I know what's coming to me
Still not true
I would have made us a killer movie
I rubbed it out and loved the spot where it were missing
Dirty deeds, dirty deeds
Didn't quite, fell apart, where the fuck were you
And the grinding of the teeth
The next five days, no help ensued
I'm no joker Play me as a
All us yellowbellied cankers and book throwing believers
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Don't bring your woman to the party 'cause I'll take her
che avevamo noi di sesso e tenerezza
It's fucking righteous baby, baby
In places that you sleep
And if you cross it
But she don't do it that wayay, no
But don't fall in love, 'cause we hate you still
When you're selfless you're so hard not to adore
Cause, if you mind your business, then you sure won't be mindin' mine
II can't believe I'm letting you do this to me
We've got nothing better to do,
Never is enough for you
th album, no  mics Then let 'em hate
On my father's gun
It's not happening, it can't be happening, it's not happening
All you do is talk about you
Grease back their manes, for our own sake
Girl I wana know why your bailin'
Rat poison for dinner, 
Solarising into pictures
I'm just so drunk and miserable
'Cause they drivin' me crazy me crazy
Try to take something from me, motherfucker
I know that you got it in you
Just break me shake me hate me take me over 
And I'd listen to you cry
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
You should fall in love with yourself, oh again
You and Me, I'm that same bitch
The little boys are breaking bottles
And never to their own fear
I'm not here for your entertainment
And everything you gave to me I want to give it back to you
And ah, the awkward way
My mind comes beaming like an early sunray
We take more drugs than a touring funk band
I've been falling out of time, but I want you to hear
I was determined in Chicago
Yeah you watch me when you work
Where you stop and I begin, and I'll
Back stabbing, dollar driven status quo shit
No no no no no no no no no no no no
Fuck, I'm putting myself at a distance
I tell 'em Lean back, just relax, we tell 'em
And with all I've seen, I've finally made up my mind
No, it doesn't really matter anymore
Seven hundred miles to play to fifteen angry men
Don't want a thing from you
Come on, come on baby let me shout shout let me shout
Damp with fog the bog that grows the former business sector
porque nunca quedas mal con nadie
Evil, evil, weak and now feeble, evil, evil Evil man
Is, therefore, not to desire her
It breaks my heart
Full of one night stands
One�day�I�will�fuck�your�parents
No holding back now
You can't run from me Kim, it's just us, nobody else
Just dig a hole and jump right in it,
No one knows the things that he knows
The red gash runs through this land
You are the same with your balls and your chains
Come on let me shout, shout
In my pocket like a thief and there ain't no honor
And let me leave your mind corrupt from this song
Daaaaamn homie, in high school I beat the shit out of you and your man homie
I'll bladefuck your heart baby
No no
And I would kill for you
Take my arm, break it in half
I can beat your crew with instrumentals
I want you to
Die die die until hell is full
For the wise men and the fools
And that forest burned You see smoke
'Cause I'm out on motherfuckin' bail
The tragedy of infant hearts
I heard something peculiar said
I guess I never believed
Oh can't you see she's pretty wild
Riassaggi i momenti 
That he has left his soul in someone's rented car
Oh, I will not forgive
I don't play, I work hard for my money
In the back room there's a lamp that hangs over the pool table
Why all I need is someone to save me I believe
But it would do no good
Kun opin puhumaan, sanoin "En haluu sisaruksiaaa"
And that ain't what you want to hear
Oh my eyes, it cannot be ; He said no, it cannot be
In a battle inside of my soul
And all my friends are gone
I'm surrounded by all these devil mouths they talkin' about kells some say I came from heaven but I rose up from hell and every since I rose up success has been my cell some caller hits my lawyer 'cause they got me out on bail never been a snicth boy never been a bitch boy why I got to hat on you look at me I'm rich boy you need a sten wheel the way you riden my dick boy say yous a go getta go get your own shit boy what it's gone take for you mutherfuckers to understand I'm a r@b boss kells think he a rapper naaw bitch I'm jus tryin' to get my point across niggas hatin' on niggas man y'all no y'all keep up that's why when it comes to these hits I'm gone keep up shit keep risin' to the top keep gettin' that money keep laughin' at you clowns cause you clowns is funny I've been gridin for  years tryin' to keep the piece but now you mutherfuckers done brought out the beast
The clergy they come in stand up now, stand up now
But now it's time you take a look
Thug life is now on radar
I don't believe in TV
My head is not a football for you
Now I'm flirtin' with death but never been more alive
Because they ain't got no heart for this, bust a gun and body shit
Let me bring in the Devil Dreams
Done run akin to the car on the lawn cinderblocks
They chalk it up to my anger
Wish you'd shut up about everything
You fight me tooth and nail to disavow what's happening
I've been taken to looking back
I'm not gonna step aside I'm not letting you make the call
And I'd be nothing without you, my darling, please don't ever leave
You're gonna burn
But now it's turned to shit and it's because of you
They're gonna kill, kill your sons
To understand
So, you ask me why no one stays together anymore
A knife for the men who've taken the heat off you this time,
The more I want to punch your face
Seven sweet disguises, seven ways of serving Thee
And as a land we clean our minds, reap our belongings
Never get too close to the end of the line
I feel good, I am a liar
But you won't have nothin' you'll see
You say I'm going to die when you tell me
You are a liar and you are a liar
Face my fears
In an American grave
I disconnect the dots
All because I lost control
Two perfect worlds, it just cannot possibly beoh oh oh oh
The death of millions is just a statistic
Give me one good reason why in time I should believe in you 
But I can still make a fist
Ewe know  bones will be exposed from the force that I unload
If your soul was deep just like mine is, then you would known not to give up
We decided when and which hoes we would fuck it
That I'm not fuckin'
Who'll deliver me from this body of death
I'll be waiting for you deep in hell
Oh no, I don't like this plan
'Cause you've left me with nothing
Straight to hell
Some just gave up in the end
But I won't stop now You gonna hate me I'ma hate you too
Still walk these hollow grounds, bein' lost but never found
Clear your thoughts with Speyside with your brain
Claw hard from your casket
Tell me what you want
It's kind of sad to watch you break down
Crawling in my skin
And does he sing to you, incessantly,
And the innocence you spoiled found a way to live
Fuck fuck fuck you
When it's nice it turns fire 
It's that I recognize your offwhite lies,
Sends the shivers to spines
Listen up, it's just not happening
I don't wanna take a pill
Out of control
To beat a hole in their defence
Introducing the reverend Hellacious Boom Boom So good of you to come, I call on the priests, the saints, the dancin' girls and the Goddamned reprobates Our decisions must be final, restoration is impossible To the ignorant members of the misguided populace, book ends to nothing Good times on bad times, free us of the modern idiot, cast away the bogey men, detonate your hate bombs Pick your victims But take good care of yourselves Hallelujah
But the solitary refinement of your room spits you back out onto the streets
I'm sick of songs about the summer
Motherfuckin' snakes,
I'm simpleminded
Ladies and gentlemen
Hang around us niggas all night and you'll get yo lil ass whoop
Doors 'n' the suits that make 'n' break da law
When every star fall
Burn burn burn reclaim this land
"He's been shot" "The president is dead"
I find it such a shame
It's funny how a morning turns a love to shame
Voting doesn't work, why
Tell me a truth that I find not deceiving
See�the�prince�on�the�rocking�horse,�his�polished�face�looks�cool
You ever got within a hundred million miles of my soul
With the head on thatwards
And win the war with no regrets
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
You say sorry like it's supposed to change everything
Never sorry, never wrong
And you know what the truth is
Crawling on bones
Why did ya lie to me
But my enemy, it's your name on my lips as I go to sleep
Absolute destruction is the battleground we're given
Follow the smoke going higher and higher
On the wheels of steel, my spirit flies away
We always seem to fall with only photos to hold
Leave it to the ones who disown you
My dress is on fire
For the rage that I feel
No one ever tells me so what am I to know
And I don't need it, I don't need nothing
Tha masked screaming land or death
This hotel room feels more like a tomb
Boat of the town, devilish grin look peculiar
This girl didn't know what happened
Now there's nothing left for me to do except die
How do you smile You are a mystery to me You taught me by moving slow, you do not so quickly proceed Still you're warm and gray, a quilted memory, you market yourself by the faded company you keep And you were already herea shadow on my tongueyeah, you were already here and all alone like me You are a blister from too much sweet, you're an ulcer from too much wine You are dead, I know that you're dead, were you ever really alive
Spend more, burry the rage
Let me die inside
I can't sleep
As I begin to cut you, screaming out in fear
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
If you're here cause you want to be entertained
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know
I wanna see your booty rubbing against my dick when I start buzzing
If you know what's good for you
Dirty enough, I got me a love
What ever poison's in this bottle will leave me broken, sore and stiff
After ten cups of coffee and you're still not here
It's like all of Franklin Avenue now sleeps upon my chestmy chest
Can't recall my crime
Everybody, self included, is fair game
I step into the sun's bright glare
The truth is sickening
What the fuck I look like, saying I'm sorry
Me you're sorry with a straight face
Hey I got twenties on my benz you still fuckin' with a gem
Not even tryin' to stand out
And the violence and the violence, and the violence, and the violence
Toss your bear a goldfish
Shredding him to bits
Bet all you mutherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
You haven't even tried to tell me how it feels
I'm writing the folks back home to tell them
We want it back again
Sadness and hazards six six six havoc that crafted Sadistik
With a bullet in your gut
Spiraling to hell
I don't want to mention the reason I know
Angels round here don't sing
They're so tired of shooting protest singers
With this war 
Don't you ever try to take me back
Wipe these tears from my eyes
To make believe, to ease your doubt
Piercing the darkness of these streets with my electricity
You've been a dick to me all along
In the backs of
There's no sense in running from nothing x
Well maybe my mind's deceiving me
Ein wilder, starker Tiger,
With our arms crossed and our fingers locked
Already heard that joke about how shit floats
I can't stand the looks on their face
What I found was a gutter where the love of entertainment meets the lust for blood and demerits,
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
He left me all alone to work the riddle out
Star no Star
She could call for the minicams, or take up a gun, or be politically correct
Waste another year flies by, waste a night or two
I don't fuckin' understand why
We beat you like bitch
I am sold by a lie
They'll take a fork and turn you over
I'll make you cry
It's not an empty threat you deserve what you get
Only lovers, only lovers left alive
Glaub mir, es tut sehr vielen leid all denen die dich so verehren
Taste thriller, break thriller
Waiting for the love that's not delivering
Who cannot pass a sixthgrade reading test
In which we drown ourselves
So the pierce screwed up your face
When I am queen I will not wait my body type will still be great
I have no favorite rapper because all you suck
Are memories of me
And into your dark is where I never want to be
Profit profit, nigga I got it
You're the ones that kill your babies
This woman literally
It's exhausting to keep smiling when your toes are bleeding on the floor
That there ain't no more breath in me
With spades and hoes and ploughs stand up now, stand up now
And gave it to a bird with nothing in her beak
Screamin' these words, screamin' these words
You could prop up the bar in hell
I'm only killing the only haven
With thoughts of failure sinking in
It breaks my mind
The pride that is instilled cannot be overcome
What about the times you yelled at me
The most intense of burning hells
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
See you can't stop me 'cause I'm a brainwash teens
They shut the fuck up, kid, get with it
Peace love and understanding, god
Pero nunca das un nombre,
I want to help you, but you've got to say the words
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
Been stuck in some wars, but Vinnie fought his way out
And who cries for the nameless whores
We're all prayin' through the smoke filled sky
The Devil's mark
It enhances Human metabolism, increases respiration rate and raises blood pressure
Just thought I'd mention the new extension
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky
Shame, shame on me
And oh, my mind is all, oh, my mind is all
I just stare with my one glass eye hoping you won't be back again
Ready to softly kill my pain
Because some scars don't heal with time
Know me  I see the fear in your eyes
Yeah you be the one to run and leave me out in the cold
I know my rights
There is no debt here to be collected
Prepare to be told "That shit's gay, dude"
My bones are tired, Daddy
Which only now they're clearing brush from under
I hope you die
Driving down the back streets
For a little bit of time even made it work okay
The ghosts fly their asses off tonight
Dressing up every day
You should have known that I'd bite back
Heartbeat
You can't wipe out my thoughts
I'm not the one who caused the problems started long ago
I can't pay no doctor bills
I lied, you've worn out all your dancing shoes this time
Tied around you're back, you're treated like thieves
Down upon my face, I catch 'em in my mouth
Why can no one ever touch a fire spirit
He'll never change he's not like me
She was scared to death in that waiting room
And see the disappointments walking in their line
Freak out and feed the gods
Infiltrate the battle zone
An animal
You promised me another life
See this game that we playing, y'all playing to lose
You're not the best thing that I knew
How come jerks don't know they're jerks
Like assinate me bitch
Look once at life on the ground
Flashing through your mind
All lies
Something happened to change your mind
But there's no one buyin' and there's all this doubt
Your reaction's kind of odd for a kid who loves to nod
Eternity putting innocence to the test
Selfishly walking through killing the angles
Pimp hoes
Nope, in fact I'm so enamored with this standard
Smiled so much they failed to take a breath
So  who ya tryin' to clown your money like Chris Rock
Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me
Tell you I love you, daddy, but now, fuck you
Turn around shooting at the monster till his knees are weak
And I'll find no solace
It's all you ever wanted
So don't front and lie like you were all that in bed
Es wird Zeit, sich von diesem Sprachgebrauch zu lösen
But I don't believe it not for a minute
If you ain't understandin me
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
I've gotta find a place to hide where I know you won't go
I couldn't find a trace of equality
They're gonna rock and destroy
I smell a massacre
Little punk wanna be a big star
I don't wanna be dead
You set it up so no man will ever do you
There's nothing more than this block
Watch niggas kiss my ass without flexin' a muscle
With wack beats and gap teeth like Tyler the Creator
I bleed me
Sai che lei non tornerà 
Never take your call when you're nobody at all
These words fall short of our last goodbye
Hey your blood is showin' through
Is this a feeling of something about to happen
Taking some notes and then I write the song
Now highways turn to tidal waves
Kill the fucking lights
If the wife and me is fussin', mister that's our right
Mike G, crusty ass
You'll hear so many BoweBoweBowe, you think I'm Riddick
So make a fuckin' difference in these apathetic names
And it's all we have left to live for
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Throw that motherfucker, "Well, whatchu gon' do now
Pray to your pagan gods while your twisting all those trees
You make lotta noise
If not you'll die too
We got preachers dealing in politics and diamond mines
I gotta couple numbers of my own, just return the courtesy
Politics are assassins doctors dig the graves
And now please let me in
You are a liar
I need you right now
'Cause now I'm stronger than yesterday
You want a piece of my fucking mind
Max Cavalera was arrested after the concert but denied
In the tired veins forming From the Tigris and Euphrates
And I hope you got the fuck out of our hometown
And everyday wear the same fuckin' uniform
Without the threat of death
We will show you your future and choke the air from your world Choke, choke, choke
And I'd have seen Ren fuckin' bitches from Howard
Because of the color of their skin
Come on, try to shut me up
When I am queen I will insist with perfect scars upon my wrists
He got caught in tha chains of his own game
Saying what I wrote, you feel what I feel
And I hope that you're doin' fuckin' swell
You want to be down with the down and in
For reasons I don't know why
To silence the dissident hiding in us all
All of my niggas bang with us and let's ride
The answer already known
I'm known to strike like a Hittite
Conquering new ground at last
Poetry is no place for a heart that's a whore
From now on, I'll write about flowers and butterflies
You thought I'd always be there
With the taste of fears we create
Speak through these walls
Chanting in the darkness for just one taste
You say my time here has been some sort of joke
Too many pills in the pharmacy now
I am a clenched fist
They throw a war like a party saying,
Their backs
Somebody shoots a guy he don't even know
I've got you trapped under my claws
Und ich fragte  was ist gefährlicher, rassistische Polizisten oder Saharasand
But I just can't help it
But where I'm from you're nobody till you kill somebody
As one quits another nitwit hits
And once you give the gift away, there's nothing you can do about it
'Cause by the time they find a lead release, your shit is ancient
I'm gonna make you my bitch, but now I understand this
On everything I call mine
You say I'm sick not so to speak
In a failed attempt on blue
Your deceptive games
Nobody gets a record deal, you gotta take that shit
I took your car with your baby in the backseat
My hands look Pretty Baby 'round your neck
Still fucking hurts
I don't know one thing about my brother's blood
You can't stop coasting cause vanity is high
Cannot take, cannot fake
Your faded face is so irate
And my heart with grief was sore
Hate me now, hate me now
So we can sing the sorrow
Tell me when the lies are going to stop
And to the jury carry your turns on my skin this color
You're a product of my ministry, you are crushed on open arms, you will drown in open air prepared to heal your anemic heart Old vulture, gnarled nemesis, old cavity retooled I want to drive a nail through your eyes so I can get a better view A part of me longs to wash the past, yeah that part of me is weak, a part of me works to find the faults that part of me won't seek Carry me home, you improbable ghost, I would rot by your flesh, I will gnaw on your bonesare you calling out my name Elutriate and evanesce I would gorge myself on praise if you praise this
I have died
Great Britain is fucking dead
Can you inject love's tender touch back into the gang bang
I wanna do something freaky enough to win your heart with"
Hahaha Well I ain't prejudiced, I don't give a fuck
Don't nail me up Why don't you buy my cross You'll never bear it
Wherever she asks me after she licks it
We put clothes on their backs
Pogo on a nazi, spit upon a jew,
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Everywhere I go I feel it
Uhhuh big time hustler, snake mothafucka
What does it matter
Dig your claws into my flesh
Who can make me feel like shit
What a difficult feeling
Scream if you want to
We keep fresh paint on the countenance
As shadows unblind mine eyes to see
I'll cauterize myself back together again
And like you think about who I am 'n' shit
What my niggaz want blood we stay callin niggaz bluff
I grab the mic and bag your wife
From this glass of hate we sip
Did I fuck up
I take one step forward
Put the wounded man back in the ambulance
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through
I got to box her for the money, said it might end
I got those minerals
Neon black branches hanging from the trees
It's just another scary story to me
Or bite your tongue until you've forgotten what to say
Stush like you don't wanna try to be yush
Your mother's job is to fuck all your neighbors,
Represent the ruling class
Till you eat out your heart still beating
Vinyl in mono
Swallow them down to my colon
Am I not everything you need
What Oh my god, don't kill me I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin' around
What say you and all your friends
The circle never breaks
And all that goddamn negotiatin'
There would be no light
Or involved wit niggas who lost their lives
It's the sure shot X
They say to chill, they say my homegirl's not available
Like it's all real, when it's a lie
Nunca quedas mal con nadie x
That I'll fall down
I know somewhere it's right
So don't be telling me to get the nonviolent spirit
Is so fucked and wrong with our generation
At least when you cry now
I live at the end of a  and  minute hallway
That they no vision saw to maintain such a law
But I got a plan I got a plan
Yeah, I don't want you to be alone down there
Reach out for redemption it bites the hand that needs
And the midnight sky reflects off my skin
Something to believe in
And in I come to lick it up
They want in
And as the knife undoes the slice it closes back up
Nonstop disco
My viens are sweetly singing while
Would not look the way your house looks today
Has risen beyond control
And I wouldn't work for you
Pain I felt so long ago, I don't remember
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world
But I don't mind 'cause I've got time
But that's why I know
Oh, this pressure center, rising
Make it big by showin some ass
C'mon now
But I ain't saying nothing
Now listen, I'm not introducing you to my mind
Knowing that I feel sick
A single thought to call your own
Find another place to start this over
Line the roadway north of town
White motha fuckaz got the ball and chain
Giving birth to maggots without the sense to become flies
And my husband, Charlie, traveled around with us
Oh no, I don't believe so, no
I foolishly began to trust, but 
American made
And God himself will reach his fucking arm through
You have no idea how right my head is screwed on
The edge of happiness
I don't know
And you fall to the earth like a leaf
It's not what I sold
I I'll write my first love song and I will feel warm
I want the world,
But it's a different story when them muthafuckas coughin' up blood
Every once in a while there's that same asshole
Kiss and scrape ivory, revenge is mine
I gotta run up your phone bill
Love that perfect frown, honest eyes
Wem gehört die Frauenstimme
Child abusingturnedsatanic
I got fed like a fish on the cardboard smiles
Don't focus all your anger and resentment that you have
'Cause I hate you now
Scream a little bit louder for me baby 
Annie Single my ass
I know you wish you could the way I bang them regardless
I don't want no part
It's all smoke, there's no more fire
If it made you stay, but you won't, but you won't 
I'm not a good friend, I'm not a friend at all
Gestern war die Sonne wieder größer als sonst und das Licht war auch viel heller,
Get back, get away 'cause this could get ugly,
And die by the gun
Eminem killed by M and M
I got the nose
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Swung on this faggot, knocked the windows outta Silvia's
You know I just about had my fill
Whoa, black Betty 
Like a shark's tooth or gator skin boots
That big fucking bomb made me deaf, deaf
My god comes in a wrapper of cellophane
Filthy stinking, standing on solid ground
How 'bout your fuckin' face
Fuck a wrist band, let's all do a keg stand
Devils in my head tonight
The swarm is flocking to the wound
I want it to be like it was before
We get paid to rattle our chains
tiver que morrer, na guerra ou no amor,
I'd have made you look fucking beautiful
You know it's me
I move inside my vein 
And it's a "newspaper tragedy"
You wish me hell on earth
You're full of shit, your words mean nothing
Until everyone lies dead 
Wit the thickness that get dis
No matter what you did or who you fucked,
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me
Snuck up around my back
Will we ever do it big, or keep just settling for little shit
Kill all the blacks, kill all the reds
With you around me I don't feel it's over
Since you're in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck
There's guns in the streets again
You run away 
Well I'm feeling great
Comatose wanna get out wanna get in
Sendin' a nigga to the desert to get killed
You're a star now, I am fixing people's nails
You smile as you stab me in the back
A blackout 
Not a damn thing
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
 a punch a kick and I can't think of a better way to end the day
You play us out and take us all for fools
Thousands buried in the ground
See the demon whore has eyes
Activating passion vocal vibrations to the blind plus the seeing
Married to the game, Divorce the Cathedral
Bam Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
You coward
It's fun to lose and to pretend
I'm right here nigga
You've left me here in the cold
Great future, safe life, money, abundance
Fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing
And put her in my claw
Shootin' on the run
So we send a lil' money, tell 'em it's all right
I'm havin' problems with excuses
What song reminds you of when
I've got a wantless need
Another sucker behind a desk
Now I belong, I'm one of the beautiful ones Starfuckers
I keep calling but nobody hears me
Won't need no purple haze
Oh you bloody
And midst lies in collusion
Whisper the name of the enemy mine
You need to contact your nearest recruiting office immediately please
Because you push me, push me over the edge
All I ever wanted was an afternoon
Nothing left to tell
Look man, you must be crazy
Of befriendin' each sentence, endin'
I'll tell them so right to their face
What's all this black crap check page twenty one of your contract
Puked up and down in morbid faith
Before you point your finger
You won't catch me crying 'cause I just can't win
You know it's your last chance
Do anybody make real shit anymore
Do you know what it means to feel like god
To a world that doesn't give a shit
You fucking whore
Got a strain uncontained that could turn parade zombie
Baby's got a problem
Spend one more day backed into a corner
Make me cry; get off now, baby
Every other day you probably prayin' when you walk to the newstand
Miten susta tulee noin ärsyttävä ääni
And attempt to make this failing heart continue to beat
And leave your fans saying, "How the fuck does he do that "
Does it feel backwards to be on the losing end
Where's the black and blue
I got a rock and roll house
Like Bronson, ain't got enough to flip his face to vigilance again
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
They want to build them
It's better not to holla back
Seein niggaz havin' a good time, so I'ma ruin it yeah
Of all the devils I have known that suck the angels dry
You pretend to be my friend
You weren't raised in a shack so you better not act so
You work against me
Turn on turn on, turn on turn on
Lined up then slaughtered, nothing to die for
Goin' out and doin' the same shit
And there is no warning, I'm not ignoring
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
I made up my mind
I watched my toenails blacken and walked a deadened trance
When they don't like what we say, then they stop it in the courts
Or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
Now I got you sittin' back with a smirk
You won't have to feel that anymore
I didn't want to be this creep
I want your arrogance and I want your pain
Hey, deceiver  I'm relieved I am
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
'I don't know how all this started'
Oh believe me when I beg you
Hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide
And I wonder if the reasons why you left me were untrue
Not a fighter
Not to knock it I've been off it never moving very much at once
Go tell him how my wrist is sore from pulling at your insides all night
In the state of mind
If I'm the fuckin' man
Clenched to smash power so cancerous
While Bush old ass on TV playin' golf
A working class hero is something to be
The music stops and the party's over
There a chance you could die
They puttin' niggas on the front line
It's the bitter root it's twisted inside
She's still mine she belongs to me
And blacken everything except the goal out
Except yourself so let them come and see ya standing naked
I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
And a little crowd gathered to watch you pick yourself up
Chickens and kittens and shit
Take me to the place you wanna go
 Do you remember Christmas morning
All because you lied and tried to pretend you a friend
Of anyone who'll take no more  of the lying bastards roar 
Fuck's wrong with this nigga man
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Slavery and mastery  be one of us"
You're hiding now
Believed in you
I want to call you names and start a fight
The chirps, I turn them into screams
For you to take your ass and move it to
You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a padalock
So far Left with nothing, hanging by a memory
Never fallin'
Opportunity I guess that ain't enough for ya
Life's not easy being dealt this hand
To keep it in your mind and not forget
He's double dealin' with your best friend
Lick my licks of desire,
Kiss it on the face and send it to God
This is not your culture
But you were so young, don't you feel dumb
Just run and get our ticket
And no one's seen your son in days
You're so perfect to please us You make all the right noise
Can you see them now
Never me they will fail to see
Lost like, you possessed her, tellin' me to mind my business
Frauen an die Titten fassen,
Unborn suffer the norm
The picture of what he wants to portrait wants me by Hid Spirit to associate
It just screams out loud
The perfect mismatch and disharmony
Would have left these red hills
That breathing less air beats breathing you at all
But stop talking 'bout it
Will you never shout
You see I got other plans
Yeah it's beef in the air and why she know
"That's a word I wouldn't know of
All is wrong if it's not right, take care
Y'all wanna kill off the black man
And when they get to work they hear drums
Not only was he married, oh no
I'll never do you no harm
Nine years more, if we're lucky now
I don't play the same games you play
Then when you put it down, ten feet down in the ground
Livin' all reckless like there ain't no karma
Another clever trick to keep us all in line
Feelin' a burst of pain
I'm not awake, but I'm not dead
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
I'll cry about this
And these teeth are decayed
I get so mad
You finally made it
I've missed you about three weeks now
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And all that's left is your bill and
The basis is racist, you know that we must face this
Under lock and key is the feeling I crave
Still hear you screaming
But you know what I don't I don't think so
You feel the earth revolving
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I swear I will never lie to you again, please, just give me one more chance
I'll run this world, I'll lie and steal
But since you've been gone
We all know what's inside
You're just another one in a long line of fools
When did this storm begin
Face pumped straight full of Restalyne every bitch in the room just Hester Prynne
She said, "I'm worryin' outta mind" bambalam
I believe in
Get the fuck up out my way when I pass through
This trouble in mind
Beoreutcheoreom jeonhwareul georeo sulgime
'Cause she had cobwebs up her fanny and I believe in giving to the poor
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
Behind an angel's disguise
Hell spawn, the air is ripe with fear
Your thoughts and deeds can't be undone
Stompin' around on the ground on the plains
And every finger that you point will turn in your direction
How they fall to their knees,
When I am queen I'll have my way I'll make it drowning dollie day
Walk 'n' cry, walk 'n' cry
So their tongues can attach
A rivers drying up the heart beat of god
Kick rocks
So you want a piece
It's not what I stole
I love to shoot smack
I can't hold on To what I want when I'm stretched so thin
And now look at me
Whether I hated their guts
And conquer our fears
They hate the songs, we hate them too
Like I said, it's a brand new payback
Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind
You know it's really funny how the tables turn
To just kiss someone and make them fall in love with you
And I feel caged in my mind it's like my flow is doin' time
Calling from the underground
You're not the one I thought you'd be
I'd like to try another way
For pissedoff kids waitin' for desperate shicks
Every single piano I've ever met in my life, never
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect Yep, yep
'Cause she came back She claimed love
We run dis Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch x
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
I spitup on my plate and I disrupt the family
Now that they're breeding all our animals insane
It's time I lett'em suffer tha payback
Wealth empowers its own views
Still running x
Those kids suck, nah nah not me
Give you children, if you want any
Angels fuck and devils screw
EazyE's wife's life is somewhat now jeopardized
Yeah I won't sit in your misery 'cause the phonecall's gone and no one's comin'
Curled up in a can they don't know where I am
My god sits in the back of the limousine
In every look upon your face
I live at the end of a  and  minute hallway
That woman
An enormous and cold, universe
And I am whatever you say I am
They can stuff their punk credentials
You crossed a thin line
To come and pay your respects and help the family pray
You are a liar You are a liar
And pretend that we're
To stretch the thought a mile
Y'all ain't feelin' who
Or was I just the messenger
When there's blood it's time to buy
All I want is a little respect What
What's real, everybody who doesn't feel safe
All that I am turns to fear
You wanna hate me then hate me
If I thought y'all niggaz really wanted drama
I'll tell you why, you ain't nothing
And I am feeling oh so powerless
I've just about had, just about had, just about had enough
Oh, There's a funny feelin goin on
Tribal death, tribal gore
Fuck 'em and their law
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we'll keep them panties dropping
So back off buster, you best not stress me,
Heart beat just a little bit faster
I can't stop talking and I
And kiss your crucifix your boy's a certified sinner
La différence en nous et eux c'est  ans 
I'm just another rager with a Dairy Face
Yes, I left the refrigerator door half open, Daddy
Vex seal with spit
We don't do shit for the clubs 
For the beats, beats that go with losing any war,
Don't want to live with myself
I really wanna
And while she's lookin' toward you, I bet she's beautiful etta
Strip it away, this flesh and gore
We're a mess of eyeliner and spray paint
Here comes the war  put out the lights on the Age of Reason
It started with me and ended with you
I run this shit they just chase my ass
And we don't want nobody
Sunny day, cold heart listen up listeners
If that's what you wanted to hear
It feels like insanity
It's to repeat something that I heard on TV
How come that bitch just paged me you don't know
And all the tears that we have cried we'll suck back in our eyes
Now I lay me down to rest
But in the meantime I'm a have to say goodbye baby 'cause right now you're not my type
There's no way to turn it back, you're never gonna be the same
Too many times you suck yourself out of the scene
Said it's strange 'cause I feel the same
Every now and then I drive just to get away
See, they don't give a fuck about you, like I do
With his dick in his hand
I just wanna be catchin' up to you
You left me like a broken doll
Make my water break
There nine years old and they all carry guns
Oh, now how do you feel
We live in a country where John Lennon takes six bullets in the chest, Yoko Ono is standing right next to him and not one fucking bullet Explain that to me Explain it to me, God Explain it to me, God I want it explained to me now Jesus Now we've got twentyfive more years of "ah" Yeah, I'm real fucking happy now, God I'm wearing a huge happy hat, Jesus Christ I mean Stevie Ray Vaughan is dead, and we can't get Jon Bon Jovi in a helicopter Come on, folks "Get on that helicopter, Jon Shut the fuck up and get on that helicopter There's a hair dresser in there Yeah, go ahead in there, yeah yeah"
Have a gun the size of a black
Clear your thoughts with Speyside and with your brain
She'll cook soul food, know what I mean
He must be happy in his work 
See it happen in your own backyard
Not even zero negative one, a crying dove
Watch your back
Don't turn around
So much to hate
And blood will run
The game is lost, eternal hate united with the eternal day
Muthafuckas wanna calm down, put his palm down
Drop dead right where you stand
Its just a waste of money
So don't be surprised if you mind when you find me
You misguided fools
Unwanted children
I feel as though you're never gonna let it
With some semen in my sack and some problems in the back
No, you don't know who you're dealin' with dirty boy
Their government has failed them
I tell ya right now
Sink through your skin to your blood cells
I'm the last head you should ever try to fuck with
Day by day, the violence is ingrained
You don't believe in him
Protect her when it's warm
So who you wanna blame for the Hate That Hate Made
My brother's blood boils in my arms
I don't believe
I hope you die in his trash,
But now I'm, now I'm, now I'm just cold inside
Just walk away I've had enough today
Nigga, you couldn't get signed if you talked to deaf people
One love is a crooked lie
Plenty goes in but nothing good comes out
I keep finding hate mail
In zona mia i sorci crescono, i porci arrestano
There's so much at stake, why can't I make you feel used
Questions I have answered, you are still asking yourself again
If there's anything you have left to say
Maybe there's no haven in this world for tender age
Everybody slips and falls
You feel the past
But who the fuck died and made you King Koopa
Don't wanna think about the fall elections
He cannot stop
This is how it feels Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I can't take ya shit no more
They get throat slit 'cause they're talkin' to me like I'm thick
Well, can you feel it
For the next killing thing
Well, you can have him I don't want him I don't
That feeling again
In a shallow grave of stubble field and halfremembered lies
Not even Satan can't stop me what
Your reality produces poverty, spiritually in a nation of greed
I don't give a fuck
But I feel old and tired
I'm not the  stepper
I'm not afraid put the gun in my hand
You've got to be there, don't you know
This is what we're here for, control the dance floor
We got little kids with guns fighting inner city wars
I know there's been worse
The world is a shitty place and I can't wait to die
You're sucked to the very last drop
You want to keep me held inside your cage
'Cause there's no one for me
To remember how it feels when I am with you
When there's nowhere left to run to
So low Overwhelming, clinging to a tragedy
I hesitate, only to fail
I don't give a fuck about you and all that bullshit you stressin'
No I don't want to talk about it I'm okay, I'll figure it out myself but they just keep 
I'm on my hands and knees, I want so much to believe
I bleed forever and not a thing you do can comfort me
I smilesmile, tired, I walked a thousand milesmiles
I want you out, I want you in
And I guessin' is cause of the fact,
I know I will get over it
And how much time do we have left before it's midnight and
It's not that most don't know how
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
God made it, men use it, governments put people in cages for it
You've been eaten up by pride
Neon black future charging like a bull with a funeral bouqet ready to explode
He ain't give a fuck I ain't give a fuck neither
I sleep like Tyler Durden
That's falling every place I run
Closing in, the hands of time
I want to get off one time and look you in the eyes 
I'd buy you lemonade right now
All my sins 
Explaining changes nothing
I'll stand right up
Should've never glorified, now you're wrong
Just not on the inside, Yeah
You know I don't care anymore
'Cause your girlie liked the taste
Which is yours now and which is mine
Pick up the bones
Fuck fuck fuck
Reeling and stumbling, I've got to bump around a while
Smilin' at my face and winkin' at my best friend,
Just wanna lie here
I want to shovel all the blame
I am truly sorry about all this
Päiväkodis piti aina olla prinsessa,
I found out one life just ain't enough
And their swallow tattoos are fucking lame
And I ain't the lord no I'm just a fool
Tears fall in the dark
You smell like shit, not the truth
And half don't suit me anyway
Oh, yeah Well, don't get so distressed
I'm paranoid
Don't drop the beat on me
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma
No river leads back to mine
Hear the ceaseless screaming
Let them get ripe Ripe and take a bite Bite
But he's sleeping now
All this sickness
Do you know how they play
We are the nobodies
Don't try to be someone that you're not
I'll keep my hands warm
Wage war all around you
I smoke a lot but can't get laid
What is cutting like the smoke through your teeth as you are telling me "forget it"
You will never see me cry 
This ideology of sorry
The Day turns to Night
Oh you take what is not yours to take
Candy paint impala
That there's no use for
And I can see things I know I really shouldn't see
I don't know what's real without you
Yeah, go on and lay your tired bodies down
These idle hands don't know their worth
It creates disruption midst circle of friends
Pullin' out a silly club so you stand
You'd notice anyway
Followed by millions of dumbfounded dipshits
Nado saraminde joechaekgam eopgesseo
I know I'll break some time
The revisionist's death by her own hand
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned
I feel your breath upon my neck
And the ride's dark
Sometimes it feels like I'm clinging to an edge that knows
I can not distance myself
I, I crossed the line, line
You got lucky, you ain't talking to me now
Of everyone you know
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
You keep on saying that you want to know me
Mais attends tu sais,
I played it quiet left you deep in conversation
Until they run away
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you better let go of 'em 
But I feel it's time to say goodbye to fear
I didn't want to kill her"
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
'Cause all you want is television
Proof lies in history, say "that's how it always was,
What if god is just an idea
I bless you madly
"How can you do such a thing" a woman asked
No one wants to listen to all your complaining
If you're not complacent,
Seventeen in the dark outside a party
Established to condemn
Because we've got no future
When there's blood on the streets
I give it all back to you
I've watched them leave their families in pursuit of your nirvana
People hide what they feel inside
Jus Allah prays on the minds of the young
My rap styles distorted
This ain't the circus, I don't see no big top
So when I found it on the bathroom sink
Of fingerprints and names
I know they're selling me a lie
I'm not tryin' to confuse you
Out of rehab Man, you look high as hell
Scorn your mind well just feel the blow
Love songs always make me cry
And we run out of ice, so I go out to get some
To feel this pain
'Cause I'll push the fuckin' button and get it over wit
The wedding crashes and the rings fall off,
I don't play with this rap shit
You break it
In his evil place
And you will never know I'm gone
Been ripped apart but now
You're not mine
I love the way it moves me
This is my fucking life and I'm living it
Do you care Hell no
I'll say that you remind me of a girl I knew so long ago,
My parents made me strong to lift up that glass
I watch you burn in humid hell
While asking You for some answers, but we don't have that type of bond
You fuckin' biggots, you fakes, you wannabe's
You're the loser, I won't dismiss you out of hand
I hate it when you preach your case
This echoed compassion, it covers your eyes, 
No screams can be heard
'Cause you got off easy in comparisation to the pain that you've put others through
I took the greatest fall, I can't accept her
Hey mind your own business
As I cherish every blessing and I greet you with hugs
I believe that reality's gone
He said, "Well I hate that it's come to this
You grab a hold of what gets thrown or else you drown
We're at the horse and cherry, your race is blowing these rooties,
To spit in their faces with your dick in the dirt dear
I'm not someone you ignore
Give them the respect they deserve
Burn bloodstains from decompressed diamonds
I'll do whatever I can to stop that
Shot tha landlords who knew it was mine
Lettin' shit slip
Und dann fiel mir der Schwarze ein, der in einer Zelle verbrannte,
Oh, you make me want to run away and hide
You shoot the fun, I feel your black hollow consciousness
Excessive with the heat see how I'm holding the fort, sick
If you love me fucking let me go
Close yourself, you'll fall away fast
The apple falls far from the tree
So close, too close, not close enough
God damn, this motherfucker gets on my fuckin' nerves
Get away, suck
Heroin is just too trendy
So uh instead of me sitting up here doin' a little dance for ya and singing "On a Monday I'm Waiting"
You know I've really tried
'Cause I was on your shit even when you had the jetta
Au point de hurler nos histoires
Can you turn Mark up louder
Soldiers of merits, inherited for way back
Were rock and roll bands
Yeah I said fuck you yeah yeah
You disagree homie then go on and jump
Drink lots of black coffee and I smoke like a chimney,
And know where we went wrong
Go home and beat your kids 
By forcing its Herod tongue in
I've got a needless want
In the breaking heart of town
And what you fear the most is what I need
He is stalking the minds of dark poor souls
'Scuse me but I don't remember
Pine box is fine for a killer to run
My presence is a present, kiss my ass
Broken, bruised, forgotten, sore
Someone to put your shit on
No, I'm the fuck now
If there is a hell
I'm sliding like a lizard on my belly and back
'Til you died But you're still alive
'Cause you've always got something else in mind
Niggas like you probably snitch, do a nigga then get rich
Lawyers before love, surrogate sex 
Hard rock queens in ripped up jeans
I feel her, and I ask you why
I'll give you one chance to answer answer
This movie would've killed us
And your son's a fuckin' doctor, phat paid
Who has a plan
My thoughts are race cars running 'round my head
You have left a trail of deceit, assault, and flattery
Whoa, black Betty bambalam
To the young youth, ya wanna
The projection of your sick disease
I wanna save your heart
Erased the thought of me
It isn't hard for me to see you didn't stop for anything 
You got a little kid yourself now
You thought me of me, yeah
Traces of unseen love rivals
And the pages kept on turning
You know by the stillness in my eyes
When you're lookin' at pain you're lookin' at truth
An Englishman can he read it back
Surrounded by chalk marks on the ground
There's so little of you left 
And yeah, I know that all I'll lose is you
I should've realized I couldn't change your mind
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh
What if no one's watching
Or any other motherfuckin' military branch
Read in depth but you get the surface
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
Whiteknuckle blackout, adrenaline rush
But there's no one for me
Can you knit the stiletto back into the bloodstain
Do it now
Resist to cease, understand
But I'm not gonna let you, I'm not gonna let you
Are losing control
You hate me now, I'm sure
I'll make you to lick my injuries,
That you drove me to drink
Acte méprisant, regardes un peu, ca devient dangereux 
In a time where violence blocks the summer shine
Every year the cycle repeats over again
But all the streets they know your name
Off of And there ain't no rain clouds
Shesaid bullshit
But though your words will kill
I got nothing but the taste
Fuck the morals, does it make any money
"Should there at anytime become a clear and present danger initiated by any radical element threatening the operation of the government of th United States of America, members of this radical element shall be tranported to dentention centers until such time as their threat has been eliminated  code KING ALFRED"
I'm breeding memories I will not cry again
You'll never know how to react
Crying in the dark, I'm sorry
Left all alone, left still forgotten
And it leaves me with this empty feeling
Of the mines of Mozambique
Not the grandchildren that you will never know
Cut some flesh away
Looking back at yourself 
Cigarette now smoke it up
Roll wrap late nights been the shit on the beach
E non servirà un abbraccio
Du schaust mi o, ganz so ois ob nix war
I walk a fragile path, of thought and habitats
You lie so much you think it's true
Yeah, while you're sleeping
With your fucking scams
You can turn off and on more times
Leurs méthodes d'interpellations sont souvent passées sous silence 
Help me stand
Dahmer, Nielson, Yoshinori Ueda Blanche and Pickles, Amin, Manic Street Preachers
I'm just damn bored
And don't you know that she's making me see red
Ain't you proud I'm grown now
Every little bit, every little bit
And I don't want to try
And now you're one of us
Some niggers don't even know were the ghetto is
'Cause the niggas showed me no love
With a desperate cry
Neon black corpses, stacked, eclipse the horizon
Taxes takin' my whole damn check
With you around me I don't feel it's over now
Don't need no TV ad
The smell of cold, car seat is freezing
So sing for the moment tonight
Kato mulla todistus on priimatavaraa,
So you want to be entertained
To eradicate the problem, my friend
They promise everything, but it's bullshit
You are the fashion of now and the sickening flavor of cool 
And they tell me they love me and the shit ull get better
I need your love right now
You wear disgust like a crown
Maybe I'm crazy
I don't give a fuck if you're drunk or not
I never asked her not to run
I never thought that you would leave me this way
Living in the big machine now
I'm going to the mountain with a fire spirit
Are you fucking happy
From reel to reel you run
I hadn't had enough, kept kicking in doors
The cracks we've made in the temple of want do seem useless
Poison, be my guide Prepare me for my proudest work prostitute for my bride Nothing'll heal me but the severed limb, nothing will cure me like the cancer borne Fail me, fail, fail me fail me not, I suffer every eager infection
I need to kiss before I get fucked
Wrong moves and the wrong decisions
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
The days fall with the promises I make
Oh honey now I'm afraid that this is way, this is the way
Some guys never gonna argue, never gonna bet you're never gonna change
Need the power of two
At least now I can say that I am trying
Nah, but for real I got so much shit on my mind
Just sing this song inside your head
He doesn't like your Madonna nose
We all knew there was no turning back
I'm talking to you
I just wanna know Marcus, he's a sweet little innocent boy, oh God
Who are you to say that I can't speak what's on my mind
Cause you know it's over before it began
How did you get so big Can't believe it, now you're two
And their speech is growing increasingly unkind
And when you blamed it all on me I should have known
I can't imagine I don't understand
Back in school they never taught us what we needed to know
I know your desire is to be desired
'Cause I can't fucking stand it when you're around
Why, that's the one right up top a mine
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Yeah, her tits were higher than mine
Fra', perfettamente nel mio habitat
Well death is a sick way for attention
What does it take to make you believe
The plague; I murder a show, you don't even know
Over and back and below and around again baby how I'm bending
Deep in the mine, behind everything shared
See I don't wear those trendyass dunks anymore, or them dumbass Bathing Ape hoodies
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
On n'a pas l'profil type alors ils réduisent nos chances 
Those wandering minds
Destined by a fate so cruel
His face I could not see it clear
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
And no one will accept all of me, so the fire will stop
Oh I will die without all the attention
The walls are falling down
No, sorry won't pay for this grief
Can I ever fully believe you
Don't know, not even if sober
Daylights crucified in sleep
Some revolution
Now, no one will listen to our song
Accept me as I'm not, and that's a shitfit
I'm not defined by what you think I am
Crusade in the days of rage
I ignore the private calls
And a heart pumping blood
Did you think that this could end in bust
It's just a game but no one's playin'
There's no sleeping for me, I'm losing my faith
Never liked what I saw in the law
Just stop and take a second
And what I want to know, man
In this sick society
Our children run through the streets
So I chose to live this life alone, without the teeth marks,
I don't never wanna see your face
She'd attracted my interest
Cannot leave
I'm still asleep but I can hear the piano,
Still standing on the hill
I don't care if you're angry
Who gives a shit and needs your help
When I die 
E nossas vidas são tão normais
But I just couldn't make it so I began to shout
Smooth talking, fully automatic weapon concealer
But no one alive truly knows me
Now I feel better but it's hard to forget
They won't ground me
The final push, the last battle
But it's far from the norm when we perform, check it
I'll throw your gang sign up, and then I'll spit on my hand
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die in plane crashes
I never been no good at staying out of jail
Man it's so hard to find a girl who's close to having a mind state like me
And then it ends quick and it starts to decay
Rippin' every Chronic poster on your wall off
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
And the dissidence of miscreants
You show no remorse for the lies you told
Are screaming your name 
Open up your spirit 
Oh If you were a woman and I was a man,
Three and a half years
Lick my legs, I'm on fire
I'm not going to be a slave for the rest of my life
Ilohem, fuck the pagans we mark them
The swarm is feeding defeat
I've never been so cold  I've never felt this way before
To the punk MC
Worried for my friend
We dark humor at boths you're funny Yes, man
I'll bet you smoke in the garage, too, man
You got a bullet in your head
What do we care if the world is a joke
Hey now, all you killers
And now you're a cockroach
Try to start again and watch it come down
But no two things you say are ever the same
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her
For our souls have crossed oceans of time
Didn't know he had one
Any fucking time, any fucking day
Paranoid and lab aware
Your war
che hai distrutto
Feels like I'm falling, but I tell you I'm not going
But now I deal with all the consequence that troubles our times
To make you so goddamn defiant
I'll turn and laugh a ha ha a ha ha
La promozione incombe e nonostante questo
Seven thousand one hundred islands I been missing
Chase a light that shines and disappears
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man
The players, disguised as the lovers
N N, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a What the fuck's up Dre
My world is evil
Rich daddy left you with a parachute
If you fuck with me I fuck with you
Jestem facetem, czasem wzrok ucieka w bok na inną kobietę
But I managed to escape the good gendarme
Nigga I just came into the game ready to die
To find I've been turned over
To me you're all so fucked
Yeah head over heels falling
When it starts to hurt it only helps it grow
No need for safe return, is no need for your concern
I'm the lost angel knocking on Satan's door
Today, I am dirty
When Shady and Nicki's worlds class
I can't help but feel it's us
Who made you the hero, who made you the judge
Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
You don't believe it but I'm betting that you will
For the pain
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do
There's a black smoke rising, Lord
With a note saying "I love you"
We've got nothing better to do than watch TV
In the halls of death, you get left, I'm in the top 
Here comes the panzer attack
Well now you know what it feels like not to belongso long
You can tell it by the way I run away,
I break it down slowly
Listen to me take some advice, you wanna look nice, trust me I'm right
And if I cut myself would you bleed too
Wage war on the street
And don't get offended
Justice stings like the back of my hand
Oh baby, let him break you
I want you to have fun
Oh, no no Now, I've got a dream
U cryin' like a bitch
Your mama and your daddy know you love this ass
You think real niggas feeling your shit C'mon son
I started fucking running as soon as my feet touched ground
Sex, death and money, honey
I want to do things to you that you'll never forget
The thought to keep thinking, man
Every drop of blood you could bleed
I am so full of hate
Bo bo bo bo bo quandbass
It's a nervewreck place to be, it kills real
 went up in smoke
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin horse's heads,
You'd been in an attack
So it thick it wants to bleed
Is there a soul on this Earth that isn't too frightened to move
To defend democracy
He removes his hand so you can see the cut
And I'll punk the pussy like I'm Ashton Kutcher
She would have left these red hills
You might as well let me know now
For your fatass dirty dollar
And you bitches
The CIA tryna kill me, we bad news
It ain't hard to see that it's not that way
One shot and the world gets smaller
I am not what you want
I'll wait my turn
I was just about to say I'm sorry for being late,
I throw some clothes on in the dark
Who are you to say who's to live and who's to die
Speak up now, darling, I have been waiting
It's no mystery
'Cause it helps with the elocution
Think we all know the answer to that
You say that you cannot leave
So I just try fail and try and try again
The game you're playing is so easy to see
Guess you never listened all the times I talked
Watch that ass cause punk I'll brand it
And when the dawn breaks through the drums start
I ain't start your life but nigga I'm a bring it to an end
With extreme hate
Yes, my loyalties turned
And it worked
Every night you drink the money left to pay all the bills
Get pulled both ways and it tears me apart
Therefore I would run through scum
No pretendin
I'm tryin' to do good, but the devil's fuckin' wit me
I'm just afraid of being ignored
Yeah, must be some young phenom
There is no one there
I'm not quite as well
Flex the cerebellum, fire
And I am what you want
But that is not the issue at hand,
I can now invent my engine for the hard shell truth served
Then when you're singing great
Take a look at what you believe in
It's your turn now
Don't these little punks
Hat der Wahnsinn mich endlich eingeholt
Yeah, someone left on a burned out world
To hurt some poor c*nt I don't even know, and have never met before in my life
Just a phone call to ease your mind
I watch your body turning pale
Oh, he's like milk to you, halfSwedish and halfAsian
Jesus loves me, this I know
All I could remember
And all I want is company
'Cause I'm not here to let you down
The toofargone kicks still in the box, fix still in the pill in his sock, chilling, gill in the slop,
That's right woman, let your guard down
Stand up I'll let you live a little bit with the pain that I bring
This is the beat that my heart skipped
And hog tie your runaway bride with cold feet
One thing I know
This didn't turn out the way I thought it would at all
That reminds me less of youth
All I wanted was to look real good
Is the feeling of being in motion again
Using me up to the bitter end
This sort of feeling isn't pleasing
There's no discretion in my voice and you need to stand clear
I'm like a chainsaw
I'm stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
Don't you bring back the reveries
If I thought that half the shit that bitches said was true
So get out of mine
Viewers of the divine rage learn to worship the hard way
To make me sing
Break me shake me hate me take me over
Niggas on a chain gang used to do that Huh way back
I can't control myself 
A man is known by his tools
What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
A mother fucker got it bad 'cause I'm loud
Unless yo titties and ya ass out
Mahalma Gandhi cut crystal and having lots of showers
Can't you, can't you feel it,
He didn't move to the city, the city moved to me
Another wounded memory dies
We're sinking and I'm thinking
It's not the truth I say
Doomtree, Rhymesayers Entertainment you know the name
Know it's bad for me but I'm calling you
Still spittin' real game fo all the pimps and players
Your fuckin' men are mice, you shouldn't answer that
I'm pretty much fucked
Y'all know the niggas who steady screaming fuck you
The animals scratch at my skin
Spiritual habitation for your responsibility
Don't ever get too close, 'cause I'm not good up close
When I said I was open minded
Girl in white dress, boy shoot white stuff
Fuck me, like you, want me
I have too much now to fill my day today
This is just another layer
You bend over when you realize you're broke 
Siehst du nicht, dass ihr Leiden uns besudelt und beschmutzt
I just want to make you bleed 
And I wanted only you
Par contre, ils sont fiers de nous quand on porte une médaille d'or 
Telling what they know
The hours seem so endless
What bones
A couple months later this shit gets banned
Or a black man after all
Ever since you got your buzz, you don't know how bad you tripping
There won't be no collisions when they move so slow
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
Either rob or join the mob 'cause I'm not salable
So we found ourselves a place we did not know
No way no way
No truth, no pain, no sorrow and no grace
And never had the ability to ever fucking understand
Two walls, Four walls
Faut pas s'voiler la face, y 'a toujours cette angoisse 
A chi invece non ti pensa
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap Yeah
You know I don't look forward to seeing you again
But they'll fight like hell against raising the minimum wage
I guess they got a way of reading my mind
And when I'm in a dirty river
*Gunshots, screaming*
But all I want
I could go off right now 
I'll choose me motherfucker you understand
Last night, I had the strangest dream that I have ever known 
Ain't no one can stop us
To shatter all your plans
I'm fuckin' dope and this is my reward
To protect me from the enemy, myself
Tomorrow is the day, I can't back out
Wine in the pantry, wrestling on my trampoline
The graphic devils gettin' funky like the Nevilles
Hey yo, this song is for anyone fuck it, just shut up and listen
I've got my tongue in my cheek so far it makes me mute
Hu, That woulda been something to watch
Nothing's real  I'm disconnected
I want to shoot out all the lights
I hear Mama they got him working on tha Payroll
Think votes count, well I think not
'Cause there's nothing like a midnight run
Disinformation tube fed
I can tell I just know that it's going down tonight
Though this dirty hell
And every idol ever raised falls
I heard boar's head killed more than nuclear's warhead
But the sex is great
To fuck your thinking, it's not a mirage
Getting too old for this shit, man, you gotta grow out of it
Tell me to hear about your plans
Getting sick of all this
I wanna feel him crawl all over me
Most of the people failed to see
The way you always attack all the things that you say
I turn light into sound, 
It just depends on how far down they can go
One, two, look back, this is where it all begins
Kiss, kiss, let's meet for breakfast 
Like prolifers, that support the death penalty
In the streets of shame
Tie this knot between our teeth
She's gonna fuck the whole city of Seattle
Those who know, lust Trust the flow is disgust, touch
You fuckin derserve a knife in your neck
She knows the party makes me nervous
I know it's my problem
I've had enough, made up my mind
I'm sick of trendy ass political rappers
I just wanna lie 
Now as it's passed onto the next one
There's no devil's haircut in my mind
That's all I wanna hear you say
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
"Baby you're right, but that's no excuse"
What about the times you shamed me
My Daddy said "Son your gonna drive me to drinkin"
Stepping out to watch the final scene
Real alive no god
Y tiende al otro su mano 
Mein Herz sprengt mir die Brust
Where you could get the help that you need
I believe
Total hate, total hate
Just a line between the pleasures and the pain
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Why didn't you stop me from turning out this way
So hot, so cold, so far so out of control
Rob me, tear that asshole out of place
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
Or a gaddamn star, you can have that shit
The trains and planes can corrupt and obstruct your planes of thought
I have a sex twice as big as her husband's
Ooh, you want me to take my pants off
As another day's memory dies
Did you want me to break down
Charred remains the way you feel
What a good shot, man
And how do I talk to you without crying
Through the stench of disinfectant
what about the years I spent pampering your ass
You know how long I've been on ya
I can almost reach my mouth, now, now
As the knife in silhouette slowly unhacks it from the ear
It's the focus that you cannot seem to find 
I'm sick of always writing songs 
All I feel, everything I'm not today
 models of fear on the wall timorous
Says she's thinking of jumping
Reminding me of a time when the old was new
It's easier to lie
Love me or die, tell me, did you ever open up
Dear heart, dear friend
With a steeltoe, how you feel though
Background Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart, eh
Speakin' to the punk that's tweakin'
Would you feel it in your heart
Es war völlig klar ich konnte immer auf dich bauen
They ask me all about you, but my answers pull up lame
Left, right, left, right
I watch your face on TV
Did you ever believe in me
I wanna put on my sweatpants
A little cut, no one will tell
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
So I could learn how to stand up for myself
And I would walk  miles
'Cause it's die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas, still
I don't even know you when I want you dead
I send you back with my raps banging in your stereos
Buono solo a cantare
Inspiracja postanowiłam podjąć temat własnej osoby, pisząc szczerze i uczciwie, równie bezlitośnie jak to zwykłam robić z bohaterami innych moich tekstów
That you cannot spend Cause your budget gets recouped
Back before the time when I was running from you
Another little flare up
On the floor, knocked down by booze
And anger spilling out like gasoline
There's a stack of shellac and vinyl
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And now they've got drive through
Ask me why you're feeling screwed
But now it's slippin away
I am the alcoholic pissed in the park 
A salty taste in your mouth from blood oozing from cracks and wooly heads
And the sky iz black
Of people, who would trade gold for food
Scattered across the sky  he trips on clouds
When all I want is release
God give life, God taketh it away Not you; I think you are the Devil itself
Come on join the bloodsport, show us some support Still working at the drugstore
By my friends
Something crawls to the surface
Jesus descends, Dachau his father
Whatever is coming
This dark hole, is so deep
Will you never shout hua
The bottle slipped between her fingers
Me and my mother, all we needed was some love
I should have known, my family they never did pretend
Everybody got the feelin' 
And as the sparrow sings
I can't see 'cause I don't want to see at all
So I made up my mind
What was half in me has become whole
I don't get enough sleep
All within me gone but pain and hope
I wanna watch it all go down
Somebody better make me bleed
All with my tears
Ended up on the floor in the middle of a nudie show
This time I'LL take the stand
My god it's the end of the world
No matter what I say or do
A good shot, man
The way you thought of me
Everything is poison that's coming out
XEcutioner style, cuts and blends like a syringe
There's a carnival in the graveyard tonight
They say jump, you say "How high", yeah
You and I both know the culprit
I gotta run up the phone bill
To take this shithole by the fucking throat
You wear all the finest clothes go or die say pussy and I say
I'm sick and original
Now what the hell are you waitin' for Chester
If you even know the meaning
Live life, mind power
But is your life the one that feels like a ticking clock
Found out you erased the memories
This house is full of mmmy mess
Welcome my downfall
Ready or not
Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Tied up in traffic, what do you know
Don't be ashamed to slaughter, the centre of humanity is cruelty
And the way that you feel
I like to feel this abuse I'd like to give some to you I'll steal the tears that you cry my fucking eyes so fucking dry
And you can't tell anyone 'cause no one's here
See the storm  moving in
Just to see who died for the spot
I can't feel it
How does it feel to know you will be destroyed
Cosa ho dentro e fino in fondo
Everyone got behind my back and broke it
Show'em what you're made of
They declared the war on drugs like a war on terror
Fuck a war
But it's not a matter of age
And in the fields till I sing a prisoner's song
So why the ghetto shit
Everybody loves to knockdown straw men 
What shit they write in the Stone or NME
Tried to warn me
Forfeit the game
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a blood bath
Play this game with you this game with you, this game with you
I'm such a fool I can't believe I let you in my life
Can't shake this blood from these eyes
We made a biscuit do the talk and it became richer
Bells are chiming and tears are falling
You fill your mind with facts 
Just give me stuff to break
I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner
Don't drop the beat
You're choking on big black bloody mouthfulls of it
I had to pull myself outta this nosedive
And I am sorry
I'm a God with spoon and syringe The world of darkness where death begins
Of such enormous size
No matter how strong no matter how tall
Was my number now
Turn out to be all of your best friend's best friends
And I ain't comin' around just to see them get pissed
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
They caught on her Ave, flossin in another nigga cab
Where have my standards gone
Poverty is toxic, everybody knows
Before you put my body in the cold ground
That drive me wild
Consumed by hate and guilt
And we've got some battle
Nigga fck your feelings, this is me
You know what
Know you heard that shit before
And take my memories of her with you
Well, the prince he died screaming he showered me with shit
The MPC's do not come on tour,
That empires run on the old black gold
When you're the boy that I want
The hooker layer  motherfucker say your prayers
Down a black, black river 
And who die when I tell them
Fuck what I want
Everybody, everybody, everybody fucks
And the branch never falls too far from the tree
Everyone wants to be America's little fantasy
Outside of the lines, we're still screaming
Stay true to yourself and your friends and never let go
No, not of you, of all that's been told
Now I smell the stench of my own piss
Everywhere I go, bitches always know
And the distant noise of some drunken jazz band,
No limit, hah, hella greedy, uh
It's not your fault that I write these things at night
'Cause, I watch TV and Comcast cable
You never know where you find yourself
Less talk more head right now, huh
I ran into the fortuneteller, who said beware of lightning that might strike
take it back, sorry it didn't help
And not enjoyin' the show made
And it's not my last life at all 
Go fuck yourself you ain't no one to us,
Come on come on baby let me shout shout let it all out, these are things I can do without
This chance for us to reconcile these doubts
Don't let that bitch take you for a ride like she took me
You got chains on your neck, and the Man's respect
I don't mind seeing your face around, but we can never speak again
Well, I've got a bad feeling about this
Listen you tanningbedbaked, brokeass, goatfaced, oompaloompa monkey problem
How long have we been sleeping
It's all you want
DOA as his man made his run for the door
You're stripped, vulgaryour pulse points none
And it tears me apart
Making money
Don't lose that skin feeling
We want to be just like you
Too late too late now to be
Said it twice lil bitch
Play it off as stigmata for crossover fans
It feels good to see the disgust in their eyes
Ground sure don't like the way it's treated, so now
You know, curled up naked in the shower biting your knees wishing you were dead kinda happy
From our bloodless lives
With a mind of a God and a hearth of an atheist
Sex, death
Limped up like a dog with three legs shut up to the stage
It was there he made his bed,
Another lesson learned
I can't stand you at all
The saga continues, with the worlds most dangerous group
RobertEcomelately hayseed wannabe undercover Yankee
Can't hear you buried in the lies that you've laid
Well it's a different man in your face
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you spit on my snatch
A great new wave Hesparian death horse
You're going home in a fucking ambulance
I'm the one closin escrow, with the best flow
Breeding fear and loathing with the lies they're speaking
In this fire we'll burn
Contrary to popular belief, this time you caught your foot
I'm not what I seem See, I've got
From all the evil I possess It's almost too much
Prophecies of libidinous scourge
Of the hurt you call your own, you know, you know
All those motherfuckers
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
Turning to the left
They say I'm a misfit but I say I'm not,
See all I know is that my girlfriend used to date you
And then watch her die
I'm just responsible for giving my investors some return"
With girl poison
Don't do this take no drink
Burnin it at both ends, friends let's commiserate
Fuck knowin' these broads names, extravengant champagne
Your people warned me we would never get along,
Entranced, we danced toward the ripest display of escape
Maybe I wanna die
A Pre canned star for mass production
You confess it all away but it's only shit to me
And she's skinny
Yeah, when I get back I will talk
Put the rope around your neck and jump my nigga
But I'll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside for an afterlife that isn't even guaranteed
Tell me, how do you sleep at night
I wanna be sure, I wanna be clear
And I'll give you an answer
Do you even know who you are
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door
Let's just kill everyone and let your god sort them out
Greed kill the need and bleeds the lines
I know life feels like a struggle some times
You're not the one with all the problems,
Now that I know just what you're all about
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stonefaced while the building burned
Taking back all the words I said you
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
Clench my teeth as I sleep
Why the fixtures turn to serpents and snakes
Ain't no doubt about it
You're the painting
I don't know who sold you that baby but it's a fake
In the desert of my mind
I want you to know
It's a wonder that she laughs I guess I'll call her crying,
Don't sing me lullabies
They told you not forever
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews
Da verließ die Mutter den Papa 
"I've been believing in nothing since I was born
How did I end up here
I wanna feel your heart race in mine
How many times will the culprit kill 
And "I don't mind if you break it all"
And how it fucks with my head
In the backseat of a car
You breathe life when you break the walls down
In the eyeless dark
Bad flood flushing your veins
I think it's time to make a move on the contradiction
When a vicious creature took the jump from Monkey to Man
Safe and ignorant
Against these fuckers
And pretend we're meeting cute
The life on display is trouble for sure
I let go of everything I had left at home
Blood in or blood out, son was bugged out
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me
The air is breaking around our heavenly speed
Oh, if only you'd grow taller than a brick wall
Give them the respect they deserve Give them the respect they deserve
My little girlscout, your mouth is getting sore
You're all the fuckin' same
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
In every circle of friends there's a whore
You at a stand, still, mannequin
Will dominate your thought
Wir kannten uns seit Jahren sind zusammen abgefahren
My only true friends
Cause Lench Mob niggaz are the craziest
And my heart goes beat, beat, beat to the music of this sad same song
Waiting for the number that clicks on the wall
You're dead to me punk ass fuck
Just educate myself and pretend all I've learned's untrue
Of a dark Scottish loch
Hey y'all can't see a nigga like me, never in your life
You couldn't please me if you had his dick
Cash for fear
The tyrant must fall
I've watched the youth,
Still running
Donc cassos d'immigré qui fout le riffe à son scrutin 
When another girl violates that Hey, oh
Try to swing and hit, cause the things he can't control
You'll still be fucking beautiful
My nigga Earl ugly as fuck, let's have a moment of silence for that nigga real quick
They told me to teach you everything I know
And every single meeting with his socalled superior
And I spark a fire for the cold and the dark
I've seen their upward glances in hopes of instant salvation
Now, I'm standing in the kitchen, carvin' up the chicken for dinner,
We've begun inoculating troops and first responders against ballistic airports
I'm not sure who's fooling who here
I won't die, like Chuckie won't die, but I'm not here to socialize
Kill in cold blood
nunca quedas mal con nadie
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
Breaking my back doing something
Like staring across an ocean and
I put the balls on the money divulge in where
Cock back and blast off written on the tombstone, ain't that a bitch
Dread destiny and empty fate,
They watch their sons die
He laid down on it in a drunken stupor
In your pain you blame me
Too much alcohol and weed shot my ass out
'Cause that would be telling a lie
I'll tie your legs, keep you, against my chest,
I did this for you, I did this for you, not for your religion, not for your patterns
I can remember
Exaggerations still not true
We're talking just a little less shit
I love you, I hate you, I love you, I hate you,
Yet you know there is no answer fit
So when you act up, he smokes ya and keeps firing
And then I hear it click shut behind me
Should've listened to the facts that the black's been telling ya
Onceoccupied minds are activating
Without a cop harassing me, searching me
How's it feel to be a man
Round your own world We are weeping tears
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
You missed another one
The only ugly thing about it is that you're not mine
Hey man, nice shot
Bleed motherfucker, bleed 
'Cos I got money to burn
You live in shit
You should learn some respect I think you need to learn some respect
You wanted in, and now you're here
And blow that little piece off shit off the map
I wanna do right by you
Monsters with no free will, just copies, with an urge to kill
Put my son on my back and I maneuver through the obstacles
I choke back a laugh
Desperate in his pain
No more, no more
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart
He's screaming at the same blank wall
We burn up kings
Flown to another country where
 And the material singers will fade into dust
Oh, what a heartbreaker
'Cause three years in a row, I felt like the world was mine
You close your eyes and said "I'm feeling torn"
Everyday it feels like I'm stuck in hell
I need help
When your innocence is gone
You taught me how to hate you
It's the bird, it must have been the bird, disgusting critter, it must
Oh, you know just playing a gig tonight
Gazing up to the blackened sky
We seem to end in nosedive
If it wasn't for lies, I probably wouldn't survive
Come on give me just a little bit now
Follow dirt that is gonna let the God occur
Something is very fucking wrong
And I'm not a slave
I should fuck that nigga up when I see him
These wounds, like a catalog of flaws
In the end unity will be thrust upon us
The lights are on but nobody's home
Some people thought I died that's just a rumor though
I like the way it moves me
I waste time by talking to the drama
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
That crossed the floor
'Cause when they signed you, they thought you'd make a hit
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
No, there was nothing I could
Save me from my hell
And I, can't pretend, can't stand these trends
Stomp box voice of fear
My sharpened knife begs to explore
"Oh, speak now, precious
There's no point to grow
What, you want something like a cake Want a Guinness or somethin'
Lies an army of a thousand nowhere kids
No one serves coffee, no one wakes up
But it's really not funny
I was scared but you told me I'd come home if I wanted
So hard to deal with the ones who can't feel
You're always trying to win these selfish games
I thought it through and my worst brings out the best in you
They shitty like suppositories, that's the end of the story
And it makes you wanna scream
This is the motion of the new revolution
I'ma creep up behind ya my nigga
One wrong move and it's death you're facing
I kill myself thinkin' bout things that you do to me
All that's left of my decisions be they only white or black
All you want, all you want, all you want
Frère, les faits sont les suivants  la tête endommagée 
Get your broken nose
When all the cards start to fall in the ditch
Everybody's a thought just waiting to fade
Now the flame that burns twice as bright
Suck, suck it, suck
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
Or on my knees
'Cause it's all over now All over now
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
What I want, what will I need
Life pouring out of my veins
The juvenile delinquent bit
Rushing through my veins 
But who the fuck are You, You never showed the proof
I sit at home and feel the sun's daze
I'm hungry and ugly,
And never let the mother fuckers tear you away from what you love
Nothin' like pain to make us all the same
Deshalb bekam ich mehr Energie und ich lief automatisch schneller
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I feel hate, I feel pain
Now it's, no it's no fair, no fair, no fair, no fair
Nobody knows anything at 
Go fuck yourself
Could it kill me later on
You can waste your life without my help you bitch, please die
Bring in the pain
So we'll see who stops the black guerrilla
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
Fake, fake flowers
But as I hold you and listen to you sleeping,
Stand for nothing but sit at service
Jimmy died today
I don't wanna be defeated
We are the aliens
I smash the glass into my face
And feelings will be hurt so your better of if you mind your business
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Here comes a shoutout to the professor
Fuck that's what they all just end up doing in the end
This love turns to hate
As I cross the Macon county line,
And when it's gone I'm left with nothing
You'll get it back today
Beat up, whip it Topped with a little scream
 I had my mind on something else
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
The way I hurt myself again just to get back at you
A mulatto, an albino
My face seen as often as god's
Gotta watch for my sister and my mum as well
My hated fiends
Kick rocks, mother fucker
Now he sobs like a baby in agony does cry
My relief is my release
To inject the pain
Ah it stinks, it sucks, it's anthropologically unjust,
Naughty thoughts and a surprise under their shorts
Cheating, lying since the day you were born
Dumaladipa amadui amadui
Watch the bathos drift forth like the petals from a wild crafted rose
In no general direction
I believe in peace, bitch
It's nothin' gonna happen nothin' ever will
Little punk is the bull'seye of the industry target
Run down and jagged and make it back
This shit will fuck you up
Ultimate killing machine
Then a van with no hubs suddenly pulled up and erupt
My womb is not a football for you
Money is power motherfucker
It's sexual debauchery, you fucking cunt
Well I don't want shit and I don't need nothing
Ranked in no class like Marxist
I overestimated you
I used to have a girlfriend
I'll blacken your Christmas and piss on your door
Wind on my skin
Why you wanna please the world and leave yourself to drop dead
Get me another body bag, the body bag's full
And I rest again peacefully peacefully
Society has made me temporarily insane
Eternity is not sunrise
If I should believe
Suck, suck, suck, you pig
So long fightin the bullshit for so many years
So fuck them too
Never break down,
Our gas a gas that we pass
Like an insect staring back, like a dying dove
And in the morning the shells will wash up on the shore
I'm gonna break his legs off
But if it works for you, it works
Sometimes it feels like the weight of the world is on my shoulders
And it might not come this way again
Doin' a buck and some change, not knowin' where the fuck I'm at
The bleeding hearts would got to be turned into some
It's time for us to take a stand
You try to tell me that you know best
I know I've been tolerant till now,
Tie this sin between your teeth
See I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
Oh, oh, honey I'm a mess
You little piece of shit
Ooh, a dirty little witch
Erase this scum from my fucking sight
But they know, like I know, the black rhino
In the grave
Let's fall deeper into sleep
I do not know anything
He knows their hopes will fade without the strength of his hand
Now you're dead, now you're dead, now you're dead Ah
My idea of fun is killing everyone
Because nobody gave a fuck
How's it feel to to know that god can't stand me
Dangerous music greedy greedy greedy
She takes the pills to fall asleep
And when the hope's gone the weight falls on me
Do you sleep do you count sheep anymore
No one in this fair new world can talk us through this situation
And you medicate intravenously
An advance towards the light
Do you feel the same way too
You won't believe what you're not told
das war kein Selbtmord
To weed the world of their disease
So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around
This is war
You mean shit to me, you mean shit
And your odds and ends
For them that think death's honesty
You never really gave a damn
Profit is worshiped smells like stale ghost
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
You get up and sleep
Can't fix my problem
I'm sick
The tears will begin
To be kicked around the garden
But I don't feel like dying
But she smokes a man's cigar
Go answer your phone now
Of the ones who know
And choking on her candy flesh
A discomforting extreme
The woworld is my punchin' bag and
You wanted it
The�night�is�cold�and�long
Another world, another time
Love me, like me, come ahead and fight me
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
You claim to win battles
I move in another dimension
He'd already wrote the note
Makin' eyes at all my so called friends
Don't lie
But I'd be a fool if I say you're the one
Commentators bring aside try watchin my paper
I know what I wanna do
I hope you hear it, we're in a car right now
Used to pride myself on living a life without any regrets,
Sugar star comes down to talk to 
Back to the light we return
And then Mom rushes out to the driveway
And now I'm a different person
I gotta say, I hate people I'm so sick of them
Motherfucker, I want your blood
Now the ladies show me the goodies under their Wonderbra
Let it not subside
Come on let me have a final kiss now
Nothing less and nothing more
Needs a piece of my respect
Oh it's all mine
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
And I had this funny feeling
Coming back on ya every woman you insult
Niggas want to act, damn, you don't even know me
The time has come and it's going nowhere
And you wanna take a shot, no doubt
No, it doesn't really matter anymore
Wanna talk about this concrete Nigga, I'm a scholar
I wanna blow it before you put it in like a Nintendo cartridge"
We're not the ones whose pollution blackened our skies
Please someone help me take away my loneliness
Porque tú nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
Desperate to see you in my rage
It really lets you know that you're on your own
Still haven't done anything I did not later regret
Push pause on the game and get to know each other by our real names
I saw you as you walked across my room
Weirder here's another burner born and big in ya
Were you always chasing girls
Ima go get some new expensive shit
Loaded on vice and disease
Give me give me what it takes give me this love to make me feel it's real yeah
Hot ice, cold cash
Niggas ain't real, please believe
And he's mean talking beanstalking icey man
But if the answer isn't violence, neither is your silence
My mind, my heart, my soul is calm
If there's war between the sexes then there'll be no people left
It surely works its ugly way inside
I admire all the games
Keep the wack beats out true motherfuckin baller
I got the game the ladies all want
Dance of darkness beats
Seven stars surround me as I burn like a saint
So sing for the moment, 
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting
I'm not afraid of standing still
My bones are tired, Daddy
I woke up to my cold sheets and the smell of New Jersey
That it's over 'fore it's even begun
He's gonna start a war
Rollin' off your lips, tensing up your shoulders
Tangerine turning green 
You don't argue with that bitch, all you do is fuck that bitch
Fake plants are killing me
All I feel is bitter
Left with no TV just a couple brews
One by one by the gun
I begin to snooze
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
We must not destroy the safeguards
I've got to burn
Slit wrists talk shit
Time to surrender, yeah sweet surrender
Cause niggas feel this right
I can fuck you betta, etta, etta, etta, etta, etta, aye
But I love disaster and I love what comes after
Niggas said hip hop was dead, but I invoking the spirit
And you my friend
To the lick of carnivorous winds
I move on, move on, I move on
I was sick, I was broken
And you want more
If you hear this song a hundred times it still won't be enough
How can such sweet kisses come from such a poison tongue
I want courage I want to stand alone
I hate you too
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
Last stand on an ocean of sweat
Holding it back
I fight all the rules I don't see the way
Impossible to understand
She maybe be crazy, she may not be right
I'm trippin', this drink got me sayin' a lot
Notre force la voilà, donc à nous d'le faire 
You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
You left me standing there empty handed
You're no use to me
And burnt me up
Kick sand up in my face like I'm a wheel guard on your dirt bike
No rights and no one ever tells
A little more time before I slam the door in your face
How can you sleep at night
I feel so lame, 'cause that's the best I can do to express myself
Exposing them as fakes
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
Of my face
I'mma tie your knot on a Downtown building, let it tow behind me
Scar Scar Can you feel my power
All she wants is you
And the world is a rotisserie of pain
There slamin in the pit when I'm kickin my shit
We would have had a lot to talk about
And breaks him off clean, call me the upsetter
It's too true we all have some flaws to admit to
I will not rhyme on tracks
Oh shame on me
Oh God, he wants to take you
Dirty secrets, dirty secrets
I hope you choke now sucker
No one knows the real reason  no one can stop him
Get me out of this hell
Ha, you thought you could feed on my soul
Ich bin der Abgrund, das Chaos
Your face, your lips, your hips, your eyes, they meet, you're not hungry though
You find me so hard to understand in your world
You've got hate running through your veins
Flew too high and burnt the wing
Like growing up pains or losing a tooth
Martyr for god
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
Now you put me through hell 
Pray to god I can think of a nice thing to say
I turn into a bird
'Cause we know what they are
Homie I've been good at rapping, now I'm tryna get gooder with it
'Cause right now I'm dangerous
You go where only fools fear to tread
'Cause we all need to scream out loud
Too many happy faces, I wonder what that means
Take some time and warm it with your hands
It's killing season
And I've cried with my little cry
Don't smile I'm not your clown I can see all the signs
Someone stop the colony
I've had enough mystery
Why do I feel
Or laugh through a glass eye as they rape our lives
Does it make you happy now
No more pain
You're not worried about what I'm doing too
Yeah, it feels like someone pushed the rewind
You said goodbye and I just don't want you regretting that
And roll across the ocean
You don't know what I need
Well I ain't no superman
I know you never needed anyone 
Now a glass goes whistlin, my rap flow's switchin up
You're not even tryin'
il disprezzo
Before Guliani got into office and deaded shit
Stolen land  and there's no going back
And maybe I would believe in a dream I cannot even see
I know I want out, but I can't
You wanna go, son
What you want  disease
Now you're dead, now you're dead, now you're dead
And the wild ones like to hide
Do you know what they do when you leave the room
When all about you doubt you
I know when you're alone
As you fight to get it done
Than you've ever learned to face
Lick off the shot my stories shock ya like Ellison
Tell 'em they can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Got me a raygun
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow
As the dreams of your darkness died
Don't want to hear about it
Do not sit idly by, do not remain neutral
Lost my innocence to a nogood girl
Hey now, all you lovers
Like a man, like a woman like a man, like a, like a man, like a man
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
Got my arms they flip flop flip flop flip
Nobody is against me, I'm my worst enemy
They smoked cigars and rolled their eye's at him behind their specs
Was asleep in his car
You're not quite right
Qu'avonsnous fait de nos histoires 
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
Kick yo ass like a bitch
But battle without war
Only to wake up in their own personal hell to go through,
Nocturnal television
Two million smiles and running
Have you turned yourself from thee
We got CEO's making two hundred times the workers' pay
'Cause it's an oldfashioned dream to plant a family tree
At pm Central Daylight Time, National Weather Service Doppler Radar detected a severe thunderstorm six miles north of Weatherford moving southeast at  miles an hour Locations in the warning include Bridgeport, Geary, Greenfield, Hinton, Hydro, Lookeba and Weatherford Hail up to three inches in diameter is likely Severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes with no advance warning
Carne e cannoni e Dio
I said I'd not come back, well I'm coming back
And stabbed the backs of fathers, sons of dirt
Shut down by a guy I never wanted to kiss
Don't lose me now, let me help you out
You show me you're evil inside
When that face isn't here and you rot underground
Big brother, beware, 'cause some of us do care
I'm a God with spoon and syringe Chalk one up and let's pretend
It's gon' be hard to put me back on the course
I am not a pretty girl
I don't want your reptile embrace
Going back to the school tomorrow
It must be raining 'cause a man ain't supposed to cry
Motherfucker in after life
Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear
'Cause the breath of the death
The ball I threw back days ago
And I made lemonade out of it
That turns the tide
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy
Put your faith and trust in the dusk
Don't feel like Satan
Won't be caught up in your game
Doch diese Wahrheit führt uns ans Licht
carne e cannoni ed io
Lo I turned my neck toward home
Can your mind take it
Eminem
Y'all feeling my pain I've been running wild time and again
And you will feel it, feel it, feel it
You were not honest
The juggernauts of this rap shit
anche ai loro sentimenti danno un prezzo
I don't give a shit I don't give a shit
You fucking in this shit
Who the fuck could ever
My body a temple falling to pieces
It's high class meets white trash
Dahmer, Nielson, Yoshinori Ueda Blanche and Pickles, Amin, Milosevic
Yeah, he remembers it
And if you don't like it then don't fucking listen
All the images turn into shadows of myself
No more happy face
Where there's a nest filled with baby birds that starve for their mother
Yeah, hey hey, few things that I wanna sayay
No rest, no rest, no rest, no fucking arrests
And get my future plan
We don't know if we should be
These wounds, they will not heal These wounds won't heal
I'm a fool I keep believing, I'm a fool I'll believe at all
Your loaded smiles
Single, my ass
Mercy, mercy I'm made of heart
And they know it now but no one makes a sound
I want to be a good father, but
It's like when I'm feeling happy then I'm jealous of me
Break, break, break, break break it down
I will see you screaming
Oh it's not hard too
It's painful to see I can't take it anymore
And he's gonna start a war
For going in unchained
Must I always be playing, playing your fool
Just about to fall down
Not now, but soon
Uns gehörte die Welt und dafür brauchten wir kein Geld
Check the heads bow in Vietnow
Then allow them to dine upon this flesh
I want you to
Present day heartfelt moments killed by a slap to the hand
The valley is crying
And running from the ones you know
Witch hunt burn this girl
The day with no emotion
You'll work all damn day, but you will never see a check
Tell me what it's like when you've had enough
If there's one thing you remember
Atom rocks with thoughts
I need a vacation cause all this shit got me stressing
On a cold white snow, plus with the right flow
Fill this vacancy underneath my skin
'Cause I'd walk through miles of makeshift mud
It's not far at all
Have your face in another bitch twat
Do not give them satisfaction
A trail of tears upon your face
Like a motherfucker from hel
Today's the day our younger son is goin' off to war
I live to blasphem, You'll never understand me
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Chrome in our fingertips
On the wild, blue road
It makes no difference to me
Oh, you know how to take a spine and snap it
Oh look, they're losing all of their trust
"You know, you look really pretty without handcuffs on
Runs a comb through his black ponytail
When I'm not around
Dass unsere Liaison jetzt vorbei is
The one I love to hate
Thank you kindly leave now Would you kindly go away 
Just wanna lie here next to you
See when they offer me book of gold,
Eat, sleep, fuck and flee; in four words, that's me 
I wanna rip her head off
How to work it, jerk it, make you go bizerk it,
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying
Split lipped with nothin' to lose
You don't need no medicine 'cause I'm gonna take your life
Well heaven's not so far away
You noble diggers all stand up now
Speak every single language on the planet, kna'mean
Turn it off, turn it off
Break me shake me hate me take me make me
'Cause we know
No one knows what I've been through 
Everything I thought I knew
Savor every flavor you got, 'cause it's not your own
I didn't know where to shake my butt
And I do believe that you hate yourself
A train wreck maze of dirty pictures
The empty bodies stand at rest
Lost to butchers, lost to child killers, lost to narcotic ritual
And without consternation our laws are lost
I've watched men
To push fake morals, insult and stare
"'Cause then we'll know the party has gone on too long"
But it's not enough these days to say sorry
You get hot rush feeling on your lips
Spinning, turning
The glass can't hide, my wounds will find the salt around the rim
And you'll see me return
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' Ooh 
Spewing, sweating blood demon breath out
You're jumpin', you're runnin', you learn to play
I'd hate to see you on the pile
Watch those little crooks come crawling back on bended knee
'Cause in the end I'm the head case you gotta face
Stolen clouds, dark beauty
We americans is cowboys
Ah, tell me, how do you sleep at night
I'm potentially the illest lyricist upon the planet
I am not your ruby to gress
The night full of blood
With a fuck you, fuck you,  a comium
Unleash a stranger from a kiss, my friend
Will you die for the perfect war
Saber tooth tiger, run the night with the sharp claws
'Cause in the end I'm a sensible girl
And they will never know were gone
No, no, no, no, I don't care at all for anything
So put another coin in and turn the crank
Don't you think that it's a little bit too late
At the crossroads with the deal he made
Call it off, sorry refused
To some thirdworld country 'cross the sea
Under darkening skies
Little punk did it all for the nookie
Into the night we pass
On life's brittle glass
No older woman can do it the way they do
Ale to wyzwanie jest jak podróż w nieznane,
This hits like fists bomb with the left and don't miss
Does nothing to protect you
I'll rip your mind out, I'll burn your soul
If it wasn't for damn hypocrisy, I wouldn't have to sing this song
Take my car and paint it black
I'm fallingdown
Don't get mad
She licked her lips and said, "I had a really fun night"
I fuckin' had enough
Saying "Take me to the Folies Bergere and please don't spare the hearses"
Okay, okay, okay I'm gonna kill it
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles heel is
Well I've got a bad feeling about this
Now I've smartened up I'm turning my back
I saw you kissing that girl last week
And the day is rising
I want you to know, I love you my dear
While a thousand miles away, in a warehouse complex down by the river,
Baby, I said I want to know
Music seems to help the pain
No bloody, bloody, bloody, MURDER
I like kids when they're asleep
The flesh we love the most
Where the old north wind blows through southeast hell, yeah
To stop lettin' my whisperin' heart control me
Fear is how I fall
Speak till dawn of violence
I know we are all so angry
I can chew like a cannibal, I can yell like a cat
Because she doesn't believe him
But I can fuck you betta
'Cause I wonder who would ever not believe you
No one around him to stem the rising tide
When I die, set me free from the lies 
What have I got nothing much at all
And so full of shit
Niggas that getting hot not this hot nigga very hot
I know you hate who I become
Decended from a line
You always sharpen your teeth 'cause you're like that
Your only crime is you're an easy target
You anger makes me mad though you can't tell
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Pocket money spent on hot pants
You've got a lot of nerve to come back
Can we fake it, can we makebelieve
Disturbia, disturbia
Those evilangelists
Oh no, you lowered your score
Please~ I stay professional in all my endeavors
Cause lord knows I could use a warm kiss
You can hate me now
Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
Now I need therapy to hate a little more
This could be my chance to break out
There's no chance I'm ever getting out
In the neighbor's backyard
Just rest
Well it all dies anyway
That meaning you heard means you were making me sick
They say it's not what ya know but who ya know
Don't you mess
She said "run run run as fast as you can but you can't run run from our law given hand"
Yeah, and I just made you up to hurt myself
Their judgment now
Your discrediting has lost my consent
Now I'm choking on the memories
They're gonna kill your sons
Who would lie, rob, and hurt us
E il cuore è grosso quanto un pugno, non ci state in molti
To look not quite as desperate"
What's wrong you're always crying lately
Question friendship
I pick myself up off the ground 'cause I don't give a shit
I dry my eyes now receive my heart
Don't ask questions, I'm not open to suggestions
Twenty minutes in broke another fucking string
Do you wear a vest no
She ain't made of westside plastic
All I want is a little respect Some respect
Gimme noise
And you sent your flames Your shooting stars
When the passenger seat in your car's been moved
Save me from the wreck I'm about to drown in
Window pain 
How could this be a part of any greater plan
Thugs that'll blaze with laser guns
I divorce your innocence and my guilt
The right to innocence,
And I'd have seen Snoop give away Eddie Bauer's
I learned how to sustain myself in storms
And now
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass
Cold day, warm heart object of affection
Vengeance is mine 
Come now for you to be a MAN
I want to scream out in my self defense
Nothin' but burn riches down, I should grab your jaw
A knife in my back
I'm not afraid of forgiveness
In black hair dye
What if god ain't looking down
And knocked his glasses
She wants to fuck that boy so badly 
Just turn around and come on down
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap Oh
Now scream
Oh, I'm a liar, I lie, I like it, I feel good, I'll lie again, and again
I can see the truth lies in your eyes
Bad blood eats you all up
Just mark me down as an angry man
Mobbin' in the park after dark wanna start shit
Steeped in a dream to rend the seams to redeem the rock of right
He drove to the desert, fired his rifle in the sky
Snap the axel in half, bust the tierod
Pledged our flesh to be one
I've kissed so many faces, lips smooth, just like a shark
You wanna be rich right hell yeah
Bad words  Could you get back
A baby is born and another one dies
My spirit can smell your fear
I know I'm big and proud all over, not just on the stage
Pushing outwards
They send a sucker to your folks, lookin' stupid
I don't think that it's so punk
Ha ha, got ya, go ahead, yell
Yeah, I wouldn't give a fuck who it ices
And I'm fucking you
So please don't whisper sweet nothings in my ear 
Once it has been, the fifth amends
Att självmord är den enda vägen ut
I'll never lie to you again
Just mind your own business
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
Only fools won't realize, you won't be told
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name,
She wants to know, wants to know where I've been
Ill thoughts disperse, we're the first and last
You need someone old enough to know better
My head is filled with disease, my skin is begging you please
Catch me counting all day like a clock on the wall
You can't come and tell me that you're free from sin
And I'm bout to take it to another level bitch
Well, I'd get you son of a bitch
Wishing I were better than the rest
When your number's up you gotta get up and die
I have a fucking brain, You should know it
You're driven to the one last flaw
I think I'm going crazy, beware
You wanna take it all, it's never quite enough
I point my finger, take the blame
If you wack and no one's confronted you on your bullshit, then I will
But not the evidence
Bad blood  Up to your head
I'm not the only one
I'll see you all in class, but not if I ditch first
I won't let you come back
Fresh blood through tired skin
It all breaks down
I just wanted to get laid
It's ' now and all that shit done passed
Pumping melodies and memories too, my head's killing me Ooh
I got nothing, Ma
Don't matter how hard you try you never weaken my strength
Offbeat heartbeats
That don't tell her a fucking thing
She wants to stand
And your sweet surrender 
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
Hand of God, I feel the finger,
And trembling in fear
Stop it, stop it
And skee ball tickets still on count, it's real money
God owns god cheats god lies
Blues are falling like showers of rain
And you think that that's your baby you don't know
It's about people who use power to trip on
Death, murder, kill
The path chosen, surely assured
And cut me up like a knifeknife
It's always the fallen ones  
It just screams out loud, yeah
In the streets there is no EQ, no didodidodido
Darling, your face is radiant 
I still believe it, John, we lived those nights
It's either there when you're born or not 
Danny Boy's arrivin' I stand six five and a half,
But first you have to help yourself
You say you're free I say you're mine, boy
The snakes get fat while the good rats die
Hey Erased it but we saw you fake it
Bleeding now One, two, three, four
Obnoxious nigga, murderous lyrics, I know that you hear it
Fuck your religion, fuck your decisions
So while you drunks look for a hook and say you masturbate
The devils own
Too bad if you don't believe it
Merge on the networks, slagin' nerve gas
But lord knows that this world is cruel
Jesus Christ is suffering upon his cross tonight
It sucks so much I get blowjobs from it
Set them up for a fall when you can 
Be on you like a house on fire
I'm not afraid of happy endings
From the firefly
Just call me doctor, just call me pain
And we're really sorry for all the mistakes we made
Just pull the trigger, I got nothin' to lose
I'll show no allegiance
Best flow I bet the whole US know
I don't believe in books
Don't wanna be up or down
Dre, just let it run
The more that you deny my pain, the more it intensifies
The world is flat so they fall off to act on a crucifix nail
Like you love this game
And oftentimes he could be seen returning
Till you loosened me and let me go toward the everlasting light
Never say enough
And we wander through this soul
I'll fire back a fuck you
She don't need no mustang
Can you feel this inside
You love this ass
A simplified love sick taking no prisoners
My god pouts on the cover of the magazine
So you want to tear me down
If these walls could speak
And I'm not even human, I'm a body shaped demon
No no more 
You wouldn't believe in my new belle she flits and weaves a curious spell,
Silence's like disease, but I dare not say it hurts
Round here, we talk just like lions
Have we lost everything now
My soul won't rest until the colony is free
Off her back, jab her if she act
But quickly turns to three or four with stops at every underpass
Believe everything you say
Turn the lights back on
If you don't believe the theory, then argue with this logic
Let them hear it in the night Yes, we'll fight They're listening Let the night roar Let the night roar, because they can hear us, they know we mean it We'll kill them if they come
Who've been stamping their feet to a different beat
You can burn my house
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely
Yeah, the collapse you'd cause could pull us down with claws that don't let go
Claiming he can handle my mic mastery
Were both to doubt 
Probably come to die in this town
Take a lung of dirty air
Left to take back all the mistakes you've made
BLOOD blood BY by SUN sun LIGHT light
Funny how money makes a fuckin' little picture
She had nothing but time on her hands
Yeah, that's your skin;
And working against one another
If I knew the answer 
You will not touch my tools
Are we out of love now, is this just a bad patch
That you're a peace loving country and race
Yesterday, I was dirty
Nothing but the smell of the piss stains
I will not pretend
E contro i morti non puoi vincere mai
I guess that's just your style to you it ain't no big deal
And your blood runs like the venom of a poisonous snake
No rest for cross tops in my mind
The way that you turned your back on me
I know you will complete this work started in me
If someone you know is weighing on your mind
I'd get right back on the aeroplane
But don't you know I'm trying to quit
In strange days, the wickedest ways become the norm
I beat her at that one good 
And the fax fucking rings and rings
Die Spache verroht wie die Menschen und ich sah es
Where's the drugs We know you got some drugs 
It is you they set their standards to
And all the while I know you know it
But you're about to need a good friend tonight
Feels so wrong and feels so right 
And now in your eyes, I can't find you
Ain't no any kind of way
Spinning till they hit the ground
And work out the reasons before you die
So let it be known
Make it be a whore, a tabloid cliché
We choked on street tap water
Comunque meglio non chiamare 
Travel on estranged 'cause you don't know your own way
And you expect me to just get over him Pretend he never existed
I'm like a mad dog
You're ready or not
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments indeed
To ever single seat I smack flames
'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground
Slaughter the daughter and kill everything
Can't see nobody
Some life must die
And they fall on my skin making tiny holes
There are things you don't want to remember
You know it makes me wanna shout,
No one came to see us so we got the hell out of there, so there
Who is that punk with the three point shot
Our teeth full of holes
There's a space kept in hell with your name on the seat
He'd rather not get his hands dirty
What I want
The loveliest and the naughtiest
And I'm sorry, Dad, no, I'm not making this up
Not that bright, not that bright, not that bright, clown
Laughing as their blood runs out
Travel fulfills you but the distance it kills you
The note of nobility can go on forever
Why are you doing this Shut the fuck up
Or be the backbone of a rebel platoon
When will this ever end
Lie  I just wanna 
Oily hands wag a finger
Make sure your fuckin' feelings end up up in a Glad bag
With a killer's pride, security
A plan that's right
You know what time it is, so why ask
Makes part of me slowly die
Your loss mine now
But I call it a good oldfashioned tragedy
We were born to fight
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew
Woman like a man, like a man, like a man, woman like a man
You swollen with a crime
You brought me to my knees
We break our enemies with fear
To take a cold shower 'cause you get no ass
The least you could do is take it back, all the vicious remarks and verbal attacks
I'll give you fucking sores
I'll carve these bitches one slice at a time
Well I thought I got you on my side
I guess that's all that I got left
God knows it's gonna make me smile
What's out tonight calling to nothing
Martyrs bleed
I fucking hate you
I won't stop smiling for my treasure 
Do you feel like suicide
I know it's gonna happen but I don't know when
I wanna tell ya 'bout a girl
Doesn't he know he's going down
Right now, get down on the cement 
Either, etherlicious or rebel yelling anathema
Do my dirty work
She made it where the spot ain't hot
On some silent shit just get it stuck it's some violent shit
Don't you ask me how I know
Reverend Sir, I don't want to seem irreverent, my teenage angst is far behind me But Father, certainly it's troubling to see all these people kneeling instead of dealing with the fact that we're all we have So rise up, rise up, there's no one to worship  but plenty of life to lose I'm not saying, "Let's burn down the churches" but do you want to hear my confession It's my greatest sin here it is
You can't escape from death when it's close at hand
Faithless, grungy, pathetic, wretched
In pieces as I took the fall
I hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record
Of the mess you left when you went away
I'm feeling cheerful already
And now you having hot flashes
When they get what they want, they never want it again
The way my four pound turn your stomach to spaghetti
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you
Ooh, I remember we could talk about anything
So take your fucking faker face and stay away from me 
This room is a, a fluorescent tomb it's brazen bulbs mimic death's heina croon
And all the swine at the cabaret lick their lips as they clap along
When your playing these games
And your ass will be home in one damn piece
It just cannot be defied
You don't know how to save my soul
Faces deformed by hate
Well back up and back off
A loss of feeling, a sense of threat
Come on battle
And now she puts the kid away
Such a shame how you could easily get trapped in a zone
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Eminem
Filled the shoes 'til I was ten
não me peça para entender
Squeezing your own ass, so pretty, except the way that it's used for shitting
She's a creature so sublime, and already be in line for the gun
Soothe every ache with the touch of your skin
They're tampering with our minds
There's a girl running around my head
MY best interest is What are you trying to say, I'M crazy When I went to 
I wanna see it go right in and down
And we've seen how the tears come around
Don't touch, back up, I'm not the one
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
The�dark�dark�Sunday,�the�blood�stains
You just got burnt by the controller
My love  no  my love
She's not my sister
I made my own wounds
Blade runner, in a beige hummer all summer
Don't try to make them mine
I probably just need a rest,
We chin check niggas, them thin check niggas
Same as the last punk, when I stuck the gatt up his anus
Well I got a bad feeling about this what is this for
They drill them to the ground,
Damn I make her feel all right
You faggots got me cussing
I understand your problems
There's a darkness
And I don't want your religions
Dirty little secret, dirty little lies
As soon as look at you  go to the back of the queue
Your fate is all that you'll see
So never again will I look back in vain
Commemorating sickle moons
Ici y'a pas fake y'a pas de faux y'a qui ont est
Woman  Shenedoah, Shenendoah
"Compton", a nigga gotta scream that shit
U pussy like a bitch
Pray them a prayer and turn out the light
Profit made
Everyone that I meet, I wanna stab in the ear
But not to have it
Wrapped you up in masters
Oh my eyes, it cannot be,; He said no, it cannot be
You would look so magnificent crawling on those bloodied knees
Don't need no more lies
Do I have to put the law on you baby
The rotted love that twists the fates seem
Our nights are colder right
I have lost my edge
But if God put me in your plans or not
I guess not, oh, I guess not
I spit the wine from mouth to cup
They reminded me of yours
Despite the traitorous label, makes you nervous as a kid
Here's a message from
But the devil's apprentice, he gave me some credit
Drawn to the taste of broken glass
At the door we don't wait 'cause we know them
Your ass smells like a rose
Den enda sanna tron
The curious folk who chanced to stray across this downland way
Kill Yeltsin, who's saying Zhirinovsky, Le Pen Hindley and Brady, Ireland, Allit, Sutcliffe
With love I believe
But you drive on through
Safe from pain and truth and choice and other poison devils
But you can't keep me captive on your wall, I'm still in my twenties
These people hate each other
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
Well then you might as well gouge out your own fucking eyes
No way, I don't need it, I don't need your love to disconnect
Got burnt once, but that was
Is fuck you
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Just comprehend
I perfectly understand
I'm not stopping the car until I make you cry, I'll drive it all night
You're showing what you feel like inside
I feel I'm dying
If you're sick
J'attends toujours le bus qui me mènera vers d'autres images et
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it,
And how can I be someone you respect
He shoots his arrows wildely with bottles
I'll get my sleep without tearstained sheets
And something flickered for a minute
I'd rather be working
I'm afraid of losing you
You punch 'em like a mother fucker even rape a few
Pathless makeshift, glass knife
We brag on having bread, but none of us are bakers
You're all going to die down here
It's not an animal
You are a liar you are a liar
That death ain't a sin when you're living in hell
th and like Madison
You better back off if you know what's good
'Cause I couldn't fly, not to mention
And do away with everything, fuck it
Once, once is real early but twice came back
And kiss my ass
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
It's turning into a year now
Everybody wants to scratch your back then
Ask a few questions, quit a few bad habits and after that
"I just wanna be with you"
As his brothers not his enemies
The nigga makin' you sick, ask the  monkeys
And I'm the one to dispense it, She seem almost defenseless
Now that I'm old enough to love
If you want to live like the folks on the hill
"She's dead Lent, just how we wanted it Great"
And we want to be just like you
I hope it ends before you know me
To hell with you and all your friends
You're not worried 'bout what I'm doing too
I close my eyes to feel the cold
I could write you a song, send you a note
If you don't stop after they call ya
You wanna get a room like noone else
 That's right, senior And that's good 'Cause you, by rights, would have every reason to forget some things "Change must come through the barrel of gun," said Mao Tse Tung This place would be a paradise tomorrow if every department had a supervisor with a submachine gun
ne tahtoo Ingalsin Lauran
When you are suffering know who sold you out
Your will to ignore, but when it cuts back round
Die, die so viele beraubten, teilten mit dir ihre Gier
Well it's happy ever after that's what we want
Walking on fire, hate to deceive
Rule baby, I've been really outta control lately
Hangin' out with the OG's shootin' up the clubs
One great big festering neon distraction
You're no better or worse than me
She's heard it said, by the drone in her head, that the wages of spend is debt
She makes me feel like
A rat done bit my sister nell
Oh, these rhythms of mine
I'd really love to break shout your heart shout
I play a game it's called insincerity
I try but I can't remember
It's the fear that you can't do right
"Well I've got no time for victims and I don't think it was all that bad
The hearse brings corpse back to the morgue
Nobody ever said that life was fair now
You think I give a fuck Come on we're going for a ride bitch No
My face is numb
Numberless troops lie wounded or dead
'N speaking of the devil
The double jab, right cross what they caught in they mouth
Because this is not my trip
Another working day has ended
I met a black man who became a police officer
Steal a kiss, yeah, and call us friends
Yucca mountain goddesses
Would you bury all of my doubt
Je peux trouver des armes pour que je puisse me défendre
This is a blood path
I'll run wild through the fields
Now peep the way we coming in we picking shit back up
And I don't know what you see in him and why you let us go
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
In your back yard just to fuck with your guard dogs
Never had a real good friend 
It was like the backdrop of a play
I want to drag you down, down with me
Where these beads of sweat feel like a flood
I keep on pleasing them
And then I'll fall past
I wanna kill and rape you the way you raped me
I hate you
Tell the wordless message
I know there's a better way
Wild like hell
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
We always seem to fall with only memories to hold
Young enough to take it on
Damaging challengers  resurrection, disorder
We on the look for the advantage, we work hard
Terrible lie
If you live in the eternal now you're a ball in hand
I only stayed to break your heart
Shells of ourselves outside
I'm hungry to begin
She wants to fuck delilah
Call me anything you want, call me everything you will
Disrespect our sisters
You're the respectable members of
You can watch on TV,
When we ride on our enemies
You gun 'em all down, even the father
That was not what I wanted to do
But I feel I'm only being civilcivil
Well it's the loneliest place to go;
Hey yeah, I'm a dirty mouth
We only want what's best for him 
Oh, If he'd just shut off his conscience for one day
I doubt if you can show me somethin' I ain't seen before
And he told me he was single
And she's getting a degree in fucking you
The end of time
Just never bends
They wrote you off and left you behind
'Gainst lawyers and 'gainst priests stand up now stand up now
Until you feel your lies
Well, you can tell everyone I'm a down disgrace
Fuck that shit 'cause I ain't the one
Promised only sky but given ground
So High and you can't feel it
I see your finger fly
Turn it on, turn it on
Er war noch jung, g'rad dreizehn Jahr 
Taint my mind but not my soul
You're the one I want
Snort it
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
% believing all the videos
There's no escape now
Massacre 
It runs away 
And I'm tryna to use the phone but they makin' noise
And if you violate you'll probably get your shit chopped off
In the night they stole it, left you skin and bones  knife in your back
You've got a lot to lie about
But when asked to make a point I tend to whisper
It's the drugs 
I don't know if I am real without you
Yeah, go and run, tell your little boyfriend
Its gettin' bigger now the information runnin' the globe
But a head start with a little help from a friend
Just to let you turn the other cheek
And it just left you full of humiliated confusion
If parted by a river that was running deep and wide,
Of the blinkered eyes long enough to
Wait patient now they're alert to your call
Like kill me in law
You can scream right in my face,
No, sorry won't wash it all away
You're gonna make me flip this switch, I'm gonna make you my bitch
carne e cannonicarne e cannonicarne e cannoni
Now I have taken control control
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
We're passing slow, passing slow Slow, Slow
So you can just suck my cock
Now the wolves of time who stalk Mankind
I see them seething between her fingers
That covers me with scars that never fade
But me know I'm not a fear to you
Power to the people and the beats
L'Etat veut notre peau, espérons qu'on sera aux choses divers 
No, sorry won't turn back the tide
The body goes back to hospital where it comes alive again
That needs no consent
Teach me a lesson that I understand
Have sex in the back of a black Lex or an Acura
It's now my turn to drive
You love this ass, why not shake it
Four point restraint and my hyper cube on medicines
God knows I know I've thrown away those graces
Don't wanna leave you
A petal, another petal, another petal
No no no no I don't care
Don't give me your nothin', just let me be
BUCK BUCK BUCK, 'cause I don't give a motherfuck
Johnny runs
It's all the things you thought you had
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
The sense of hate
Wait for death
When it was nothing but a piece of putty
If I were a man I'd have a gun, But I'm so bone tired
You can watch Good Will Hunting by yourself you bitch, please die
I hate you more than my job
Space age rage to rattle your cage
You may not like what they said
A painting of morality
You've been out there, and tried to mix with those animals
Like calendars dying at new year's eve parties
Yeah I'm an asshole yeah yeah
Feel this hate
The bloodshed on the dusty roads
The man then falls upwards, back on his feet
Nós assistimos televisão também
Kill or be killed
They cannot stop me
Know one knows what I've done
Why are you such a stupid asshole Would you really like to know Well, remove your clothes and a vet will show you how You went to school where you were taught to fear and to obey Be cheerful Fit in, or someone might think you're weird Life can be perfect People can be trusted Someday I will fall in love in a nice, quiet home of my very own Free from all pain Happy and having fun all the time It never happened, did it
Italicised lies, headlines, bold type
And I'm sorry
Squeeze on MC's, with bullet train speed
As the dagger screams
That I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
From the whole fucking staff At you, they laugh
I'll be your enemy too
Now we agree and understand
I feel like I'm God
You don't know me, no you don't know a thing about love or life in between
You say that we are friends
Somewhere between my shoulders and neck
And now I see stars
I watched that episode too
As if I don't exist, as if I'm not here
Oh god please listen fast
In the way and you're driving like a bitch
Came from voices talking in your head
The price to you for this is nothing will ever be the same
Well I just made my perfect worldoops you're gone
Take a stand
She's crying 'cause of what he might do
The sins, the sins the heavenly limbs that greet below the red, red lights,
Life was home on the dangerous
Solid gold
come un ramo di ciliegio
I step in hog heaven, stoney with no weapons, pissing on teleprompters, selling megaphones to hecklers,
And you won't see me surrender
You keep talking
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still, fool
Is just a front and I still want you like I did back then
I'll bust off on her face, and right after this segment
Inherited the trait to make both ends meet
Got one in the head plus a nigga's fed 'nuff said
Face the day embrace the pain
Practice of a humanist made in his image
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me"
Face flat along the edge of the grass
That I got suck at
All it's hate, all it's pain so
People just pretending, that's a let down
Everything I do would be interesting
I never underestimate the enemy that's what you do
I'm not no whipping boy for you
If you hate me
Who the fuck who the fuck
You say that the magic's gone, well, I'm not a magician
I may not suit your taste tonight
I work hard to take care of every one of my niggaz
Love me or stay the fuck away from me
Money buys you 'friends' but it won't buy you fame
Crying, missing me
And I live to fight
Does it matter what anybody cares
Profit off a death
Diagnose the symptom
I've lost and can't have back across the aftermath
We've gone too far  From pride to shame
Nah, bitch, not even close
Overfired
Anything to break the silence
I know you can't help it
I understand
Mr International, passport pimpin'
No nothing no one no more
Fuck your droid noise, Voyboy's Noid ploy
I attach no importance to it
Type that in your little away message and set it
I'd probably be just as crazy about you
And ain't a damn thing funny I get money in piles
You shouldn't have to shout for joy shout
Now they know their robes damn hoes that fold my clothes
This is what it feels like "This is what it feels like"
It's all fucked you've blown it
"I don't want to feel a thing"
Demande à Mégret, s'il nous voit intégré, c'fils de putain 
The names are always changing, in the end it's just a game
Meantime she settin the nigga up
Don't need your dick to fuck
And I would never ever try and hurt you again no no
And if you're scared by what you're left with
Recycled Angel tears
Baby penetrate my mind
Useless to run
But I need sleep and it's kind of late
You feel to moan but unlike before
Hornblende flakes have wedge shape
I'm not a carbon copy so police think they have the authority
Give us brilliant boys we wanna fuck, man
I don't believe you when you fuck me
My niggaz love fuckin' bitches that they just met
Don't want to love it, don't want to feel it,
You're still implanted in me
I don't care what you think of me now
 mm inoculation
But I'm not really convinced when you say that you're impressedhell no
I'm breaking at the seams of life, but I'm holding on
All my friends are embryonic
Je passe à table les jours de rable
What I want
I know id leave myself inside
Where the kid got shot
I just can't help but sort
Who was born into the wealth of this sytematic fuckin' scam
Some people get away wit' losin' my rhyme
Ow, be like wild with my style
You sweep the pavement, shine the buildings, display the maid,
Walked backwards, fucked like a fox
And half the time I open my mouth to speak
They stand there in the pulpit, doling out their lies,
I hope that you're back up 'cause I know you've been down
You taught me how to hate and how to hurt
To fall down at your door
Yeah, when I'm gone the weight falls on me
And if my thoughtdreams could be seen
Can't help but wish that life was like a Drake song
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself
You know, we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately 
And I died
Asleep in her hotel
My world is evil but American made
The reverend plays on the ugly organ, ohoh
I can't breathe if I cannot see
'Cause if you mind your business, you'll stay busy all the time
And you just can't help but question
Everyday is Saturday so baby hit the snooze button, let's sleep in
But when you say, "Let's buck for revolution"
Suddenly fists turn into brave ears
Some men rob the passersby
I could within all my power
I'll rub till it bleeds
BomBom, rock the nation
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
Stop, stop, stop, stop 
An adult film star paints thumbnail portraits of elderly couples, fully clothed and smiling
Cram that cop donation in your ass
Boring fucking politics that'll get us all shot,
We are the world's most dangerous niggas alive
Pass me the scalpel, pass me the knife
Just how much you fucked with me
Can't get that engine turned over
And they know they killed our heroes too
As the library was burning
A gift from god doing the devil's crimes
To know this will
Don't leave me no space in your little boat
Even without a nonday first
No no
Kansas City, motherfuckface word
This the shit niggaz kill for
You're all reality and sound bites, and the freedom is never in plain sight
Neon black tanks grope the skyline
'Cause I would walk  miles
And singing birds are starting up
She's the first to kiss me without crying
You couldn't pay me enough, you couldn't pay me enough
It's not fair to deny me
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
If you ain't got heart you ain't got shit at all
Everyone got behind my back
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
I'm gonna behead niggas that don't believe this
Every now and then I cower and I need to find empowerment
Collar pop jolly roger, die motherfucker die,
Sure as the rain will fall
Gotta hit the ground 'cause here the slug comes
The bosses want decisions
Can't break the chains that have kept you under
I get down on my knees and pray
Cause this shit's gonna publicly crash your systems and isms and formulaic flows
But now he's tha devils friend
The government says that killin's a sin
I don't want to
I divorce the taunting acts of violence
When the beats drop, you'll get hold of 'em
Aber dass die deutsche Sprache sich auch daran berauscht
Okay, okay, okay I fuckin' get it
Didn't take you long boy to stop from being a friend
Where we made mistakes
I'm gonna kill it, yeah
Oheeoh goes the cop on the beat
Come a little bit closer
I know to be
I need you to hurry up now oh 'cause I can't wait much longer oh
What's that you said, you were my friend
Going "straight" will get you nowhere
I'll skin your ass raw
And sterilize the sickness
Shot out to the curb with no place to go
Where the hell you creed 
We go through the pain together by any means
And now the Feds growin' shark fins
You, you brought the art of silent war
And revive her dying mind
Yeah, that knife in my back
To any motherfucker disgruntled exit wound, look like a funnel
Hendrix e Morrison senza LSD, prova
Places are being prepared and readied night and day, night and day
Don't want to fight you
So oh, no, no, no
I hate you fuckin'bitch, We'll kill you bitch
You're not the same
Things sound good right now
Themselves, shot down, or
When I'm in one of those moods I can give a fuck
It may not be much
Sometimes I want to bash in your teeth, Daddy
Come around come around no more
At war with the demons that live in infernal regions
She crawls on webs of lies
Denn jetzt fliehen sie im Scharen
I'm feelin' Pretty Baby, don't you shout
One that's born of memories
On every door I already knocked
Peace in the valley of death when I rise
So shoot the president
Blood flowing faster, no clotting
I think I'm being watched
Without me, you're nothing
She wanted to go blind
Look, we can just take Hailie and leave
I am sleeping
I won't hate myself to be loved by you
When you break the circle, you have no right to live
Or I'll burn you to that cross
Only to be killed again when I fast forward this shit later
To bring their shit into light
One hoped they'd break the patent when they die cast me in stride
Because you've got no soul
Af en toe moet ik nog aan je wennen
For you to burn
Fuck that motherfucking bullshit
And leave my song standing longer than the Parthenon
I saw Todd Trainer singing in German
Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of
A woman tried to start a fight with me
'Cause I think some shit about to go down nigga what's goin' down
 Only way you can only way you can bring it on, that by is by killing
From six stops away
But silence is a crime when someone needs your help,
Change the way I feel about you
The single sista lynch, the cell doors crash
'Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
Do you know what they steal
Stop the want
And it runs deeper than you dared to dream it could be
There's one way in no way out
Why was I never good enough
All our aircraft on the ground, we might face another and infinitely more costly Pearl Harbor
Sit there silent, folded arms
Anata ga koe no,
We kick them doors down when nobody would let us in
And you don't give a fuck about me"
Shake your skin Like a scrambled TV
Now here I sit in a staterun asylum
Friends will come and go as it seems
As I move through seven levels
Star no star
Just shut up and make it right
Leave it well enough alone
Because we have been told that if you've been assured
A part of their design An accomplice to this crime
How can you say I'm crazy
When asked about the man that had died by their hand
Fuck the fame, I'm still stayin' the same, lil' bitch Hello
Well when I called her evil
By now, I should have been somewhere
Been working hard been writin' songs about the things he feels
Feel that I know you do, guess what I wrote it too
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
I'm gonna try should I oh fuck
The subject right now is what's wrong
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
I want you to throw me away
The world is spinning around and around, out of control again
It seems to me that you couldn't care less so I'm not going to do it anymore
I wanna see you when you bleed
Condemned in his mind
For handmedown albums and guitar with no strings
He asked me "How would you feel if everybody acted like you didn't exist"
Was I sleeping What How can you be so sure
Weakened knees call
Ill drink less
lachend auf die Strasse scheißen,
Most black folks be made to die
You get no respect
All the planets and the stars
But everybody knows it's all about the things
Don't know how long I've been awake
I feel all right
And why do I defend your ignorance
And emcees have left materialism behind them
Had to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your bitches
We know how to pray
Taught me how to speak my mind without making it up in time
My body yearns for the warmth of snow
So I took the shotgun off the wall
I don't know you like this
Now all I had will die with you
I watched the world pull you away
Oh anger
But if you talk in the movies
Now you want to try a life of sin
I understand you
The cross, the capital, the pale families
A human flesh feast
This will pass by 
Young and sweet like mother made you
Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Just let die here
Of nothing
And I'm down upon my knees
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
Just a vanished ghost And your legacy
But white paranoia is here to stay
Maybe I'm paranoid
Your mind is sacred
Solemn words that were both spoke but not emerged
With her own innocence surrounding her
A sight to sore your eyes
Chipper little girlie at the front desk doesn't mind at all
You fucked up  Ah
So kindly as I welcome niggas back to the jungle
Then I'll let you die
So don't you dare mess with my Mean Machine
Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
I'm gonna watch her die
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard
I really used to believe
I'm smashing every country, bitch I'll send you a postcard
'Cause all I do, is mess you up and lie to you
To any fool with a grievance, it's open season
Ain't nothing changed niggas know I'm holding the torch, bitch
Dismantle whatever's comin', y'all niggaz sit there and put up hoods
But you wanna justify
Who them niggaz that you fuckin' wit' us
Cold and alone, dead and disintegrating,
Lying bleeding on a grimy street
Have you no decency
Take another look at me now
See the sin in your grin and the shape of your mouth
Für mich ist die Sonne gefährlicher, das ist der Beweis
All my friends are broken toys
And you should be killed
She's running out
A breeding ground for your untruth
Pop trash, disgust
Come reap your reward your time has come
He only wanted someone to play with
Here comes the war
Town hasn't moved but it's getting closer, losing ground
I got a feeling we ain't meant to live this way
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I will not rhyme over tracks
I know you niggas wish you could prevent it
So catch me as I fall 
Love I shall not love, yet I'll still sing about it 
"Chocolates only so much shit, floating out of the snake, to the see"
'Cause I'm fucking up
And tell me do you laugh yourself to sleep
I want your body, not your mind,
Can we ever forgive love for it's pain
I'm sick of shruggin' off your petty little ways
This is for right now
How will you sink your ghost in a man
It's not true and it will never be
But tonight I clearly recall every little bit
I am not so upset about my horrible self
Everything is fucked
Of 'nearlymadeit' s
E non cambia ora con la major
Just so you know
And the way I make you feel
You don't have to put up with this nonono baby
Would I, like the voices, rise and fall
Someday I'll feel no pain 
Take your time coming back
I want to rape and kill you
Dancing through a time warp in your dinosaur trends
Sit up front We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up
You talk about love
Neon black whip, war gang hiss;
Everything about me is a lie,
Cheap tales of modern love, in bed with strangers
Reading through your messages my favorite way to die
Here I go, an angry brother finna make his move P Dog
And now you're chillin' on a half priced clearance rack
Don't wanna sing about food in Somalia
Just angry at the things that have failed you
I hate the fact that I have to believe
Venomed body of thought
There is no romantic ideal involved
Or a single KO
And regain control
I can't believe, this whole world twisted me
Quelli che sanno chi eri
Hey God There's nothing left for me to hide
We fightin here for you
Why do I feel desperate now
There is no love left in your eyes
Sunrise, wrong side of another day
An understanding
You're falling, you're falling, falling from your godlike distance
What the hell's your name
You little fuck
I'm a fucking unicorn, and fuck anybody who say I'm not Wolf Gang
This is mine
Some jealous punk
Oh I just move in another dimension
You think you're set 'cause you get lotsa hoes,
I need you to hurry up now 'cause I can't wait much longer
Empowerment is paramount to how I can begin to mount
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her
No I wouldn't have kissed your face
Say boom, say, want keep him, keep him on his back, say
Many man you say hello to the bad guy
And the tree The tree of knowledge
I don't think there's no excuse for you
And the smell of this hell
The clock is laughing in my face
I was a wellknown thug and I gotta lotta love
I can yellscream and small all I want
I just want things to be the same
Before I go to sleep
Same shit you was fuckin' wit way back then
I moved forward and thank God for the lessons learned
Some say the X makes the sex pects
I stopped lookin' then they found me
The cold linoleum is talking up my shoes
I wanna leave it up to you
Roses in the hospital
But I'm afraid that it might kill you then
No rhyme or no reason I fight to feel the feeling
I think that I'm happier now
No more, nno more
You better get off my back
And dead your eyes they cannot cry
I wanna be a shiny new baby with a spongy brain
Another one you string along
We would have made a hit
To love another
I get choked up
Play my position I kinda dip it when I always kick it
If I's a clock I'd be the end of the day
Don't want nobody to follow me 'cept maybe you
She said, "You get too drunk, you get too high
I pity the fool that falls in love with you, uhhuh
Nigel is happy in his work 
Fucking buck in the wild kid
They try to look innocent, but they are always up to sin
Now I lay me down for death
She turns to see her brother again but he's already walkin' past
So he crowned himself king now no one remembers his name
When you say "best friends" means friends forever
Sie sind ihres klaren Verstandes beraubt
Sometimes I gotta say shut up
And I'll never come cryin' for sympathy
Consider this a distant early warning
Oh, what's the matter Kim, am I too loud for you
You wave the red flag, baby you make it run run run
God, I clenched my fucking fists and banged my head
I'm driving drunk like it's the weekend
They all hate me 'cause he loves it
This thing does not end here
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
It ain't gonna ever stop niggas
Give me stuff to break
I, I wanna love you
Because my scars won't heal with time
It ain't on us that your life sucks,
Windows dark
Manchmal schreib ich und die Wahrheit schlägt mir ins Gesicht
I'll be there, and see ya and now you gotta open up your eyes
The crystal
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
I'll give you three to die
OF will be done for, niggas will be dumb poor
While Deception was a clickin' his high heels
"Jess, I still taste you, and thus reserve my right to hate you
I lie just to be real and I'd die just to feel
The fire is dying out
No time to ask, could the motherfucker really survive
Like a wall 'cause I'm hard, I represent GOD
Still I try to reach you through the darkness
I shout like I'm trying to get heard on the island
While my friends have died
No one's asking to go dancing it's not like that anymore
We need ten years on rewind so we can return
Wild, wild
For awhile I was cleaner than now
And you're standing in the shade
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
You made it easy to decide there's no way that I could never be your wife
Hey here's the mirror see your stupid face
I don't want to let you go
We are the most impassioned ugly people
'Cause without no promotion, of course sales drop
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
Now Mary's got a problem and Mary's not a stupid girl
That motherfuckers don't give a damn for you or me
Everybody sees you cryin'
I'm losing my mind, everything's fine
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Why are you falling, falling
They say all good things come to an end, I wish this didn't apply
Oh, my mind is all made up so I'll have to sleep in it
Fight the power for peace
But the signs I know
I felt in your pocket and found your sweet woman's comb
Rest on my charred fingertips
Give my regards to all you shady fucks,
Giving a thumbs up or thumbs down to incoming and outgoing trends and styles of music and art
Tell me what you want, sister
That it's still worth it's weight in gold
Water, food and drive
Oh my god, I'm not supposed to say this,
You have to spit to see the shine
They say to chill, they say my homey's not available
When you took a fist and knocked me down on my knee
I'm not reading that motherfucking book because a human wrote it
Stands guard over stifled screams
Don't wanna be described as fake
And there's no more use
We'll steal the fire out of your eyes and turn it on you 
Hurt by a star, fucked by a star
British adults expect a nuclear war in our lifetime
To make amends for all of me, and the fire will stop
My bleeding is for you, so that I'm dead
And needs a friend on the end of that other line
A poisonous saint with a brittle, crippled frame and she fooled me with her motherly gestures, my only guess is she's misguided
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask
You hear that, nigga That's cult shit right there, nigga
Let us unite on our own and not because of bobbedwired death
Don't know much but I do know
I had a knife in my back
There's a page back in history
Take my blessings where ever you go
There is no warning, I'm not ignoring
Doch konnt' er nicht von ihnen lassen 
Come up out of these heels Oh no
I pushed down the pain
How you dig that shit
The way I rhyme in Islamic promises, ignorance is common sense
And let the rest remain 
Wash away the dirty things
Woh, woh, bullet the blue sky
I don't care for ignorance, indifference or tolerance
Who ever made up open skies and two of the bluest eyes
Semiautomatic hate machine 
'Cause there is no design for life
Wage my war internal
Of the working class
I want more
Peeking through my fingers
I know you like it both ways
To sign my name with blood
Leaves me for dead and nothing drags me from
The collision is always licking it's lips
The singer of the heavy metal band from Minas Gerais,
Catch the liberty fires catalog,
I'm not looking to stand up real high
Dear Preacher, thanks for making time for me today, I hope you don't mind if I hide behind the curtain It's been fifteen years since my last confession; by your good book's standards I sinned like a champion, but that book seems a tad bit outdated
Find another life far away
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
rivuoi indietro
Now this angry little girl
Gettin' madd opposition hip to the game
Until the frames cease to move
I take my glock and I point godpoint guard like Brevin Knight
Keep it all inside till we feel we can't unleash
Won't need no sunshine
It's long and slick and olive green
The fucking bastards that you created
On est venu squatter les sommets you mothers fuckers don't know me
Maledetto me che sto morendo
I was turning into somebody else
I remember when you used to be shy
Niggas said hip hop was dead but I awoken the spirit
We've got nothing left to do
To drink for forty days and forty nights
And even though I'm angry I can still say
I will surely find another way
'Cause it drives me wild
Le noir est plutôt gris
Once I get down there'll be no breathin', it seems when
Punk motherfuckers beef and rhyme my race
We seem to end in nosedive 
Denn ein Sinn für die Wahrheit schlägt in ihrer Brust
I want to kill this waitress
Don't give me your nothin', don't give me your nothin'
We know who's ahead of the game
And rock and roll is what I'm born to be 
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
No way, no way, no way, yeah yeah, to disconnect, yeah
Bare hands will decapitate and bash your face
Because the beating won't stop
The evil ones
Overseeing the game, over being part of the same ol' thing
You lost control
New sweat to drown me in
Is heaven real, is it fake, is it really how I fantasize it
This is not the world that I remember
You better believe  you sucker
*SNIFFS* I smell smoke and somethin' sizzlin
Then I said I had enough
I smell human flesh decaying and rotting
'Cause all I want of you is just to let me be
Always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
And no this war was not scripted,
I'm making another delivery
I am the blackness, I am the dark 
Just victims of the inhouse driveby
Can't stop now give me all your money
No more shit
Suck, suck, suck it,
I'll speak my mind when I am ready
Got me deep under the beat just it is like I can't see
I spitup on my plate, as I sever the entity
I annihilate a fake persona for spare change
I don't want him
Ca sent, ils aiment les étrangers quand ils peuvent en tirer profit 
I will not let you in
Let me make sure I'm crystal clear on this issue, okay Heavy metal fans are buying heavy metal records, taking the records home, listening to the records, and then blowing their heads off with shotguns Where's the problem That's an unemployment solution right there, folks It's called natural selection It's the bottom of the fuckin' food chain, okay I say we put more messages on the records "Kill the band, kill your parents, then yourself, okay Make sure you get your whole head in front of the shotgun Thank you for calling Thank you for calling"
Until your mind gets locked in
You know, that ugly ass nigga Tyler with his bitch ass
Shows the changes, and I hate them all
We are the underground
Yo Bush I ain't your damn hoe
I'll waylay your daughter and kidnap your wife
How 'bout me being half awake and crying 
Every limb is empty, robbed of pleasant memories
The pain in your veins
You blame me but some of this is still your fault
And I don't know what to do
There's no innocence
We rhyme sick and side  for dime chicks
Stripped me of my power
Only one thing comes to mind
The farm, that's where she belong, better leave me alone, calling me and asking where I'm at
I hate her
I know what it is I can see it in my dreams
I'm sorry for the mess
Now that the smoke's gone
All things must pass
There is no strength in trying to break me, no
You stole all the covers and fucked up my head
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
Ronald Reagan was an actor, not at all a factor
You're going out with friends now somewhere
We were born to live here we were born to die here
Talking sweet about nothing
How is it that the only ones responsible for making this mess
New York's coming an' New York talks
Want it all Are we singing
I don't know if you do or don't exist, it's driving me crazy
Alone on his haunches the hair raises on the back of his neck
To a bunch of fucking fags that can't potentially harm me
When hearts, hearts, still beat the same
You're fired
To Injest The pain
It's upside down my frown
The blood is not on your hands
Well "good god damn" and other such phrases
Now all the evil thoughts I had
And if you diss the code of honor we takin' your head;
'Cause when it comes to rocking something fierce
You're still a lawyer
Slow dance alone with no one to the sound of four hands clapping
Will not keep me interested
But now even if you could eat your own words you'd start a hunger strike
My heart is cracked from being left out in the cold
How many crimes can I try spotting dry before it leaves a stain
When it falls through
Oh oh ain't that nothin'
There once was a girl, and she suffered from sickness
She says, shhh, I know, it's only in my head
What's in my mind
But don't ask why, bitch Ask why not
New found power
And I'm feeling torn apart
Oh, don't you know that anyone can join
They just ignored the words I said
I do not catch the spark
You say one thing, do another
Talk to me, come on, talk to me
I've got something that you all should know
I feel like I could lose my mind
And the black markets,
My friends said "Man she'll give you the blues, so man, don't get caught"
Then write a book about how I wanted to die
And get the feeling of the peeling from the other side P Dog
I'm A Swing It watch me bring it to the next level
You fucked up, you bitch  you really fucked up
A motherfuckin' chainsaw
You were never the martyr you pretended to be
And I know what they mean
With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me
I wanna break shit, run up and take shit
Open your minds
Oh no, I know a dirty word
Qu'avonsnous, qu'avonsnous fait
But most of you rap niggas is hoes to me
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Your very means, they have no ends
Heavy weight on my mind
I'm out of the fire
All your tears 
Rip this motherfuckin' bullshit life
You just tied me to the mast of the ship of fools
Funky piano
Niggas saying "Free Earl" without even knowin' him
Pretty melodies don't fall out of the air for me
For me to cry out in my own defense
Drop dead right where I stand
You can't change anything in the end
But there's nobody there 'cause nobody cares
Pass the prozac, designer amnesiac
Black and I rap with a little bit of swag and happen to have a little money in the back
I lied to myself right from the start
'Cause no matter where you are, a struggle's nearby
So the city just wants the same
A group of teenage boys watches a video of a father playing catch with his son
Draw a letter on my skin
We all on deck fool so put your heat up
You best remember, you're twice my age
Padłam na bruk, tobie wprost pod nogi
To change the whole fucking world
I gave you the Documentary, shit was a classic
Oh, the leaves began to fallin'
Look at us now,
So please just leave me the hell alone
Cross back with your kind
I found you alive, but the ghost is helpless inside, 
Now I can't believe
 Will you forgive mine 
Yours, unconditional love and hate 
I'm surrounded by fucking idiots
It's easy first I kill it then I throw it on the grill
Sick Girl want to cry
Taste I have no taste 
So stop wasting my time stop wasting my time
You say, "Who the devil"
Don't call me nigga, this MC goes for his
My brother's blood
With your blood
Find another fault of mine you can scream to
We may not compromise
Through arguing over who feels it more
When I'm dreaming, yes, I know I'm gonna dream 
You say you miss me like crazy now
Send a death fetus to my ex on Valentine's Day
It's 'cause he loves this ass"
They bustin' out a blunt for this shit
So you tryna get some attention by cussing and eating a fucking cockroach
Taking their time right behind my back
Drag my ass out of bed and stagger off to work
Gonna rip your heart out the way you did mine, Daddy
Damn, would you like to take the fall
It doesn't matter I'll probably get hit by a car anyway
It's alright I feel no pain
It's the same shit  different day
It makes me want to stick my dick in your face
And I see that it makes me want to shed my skin, shed my skin
Fight to death
To you it's all one big silly game
Left you in the forest with your carcass in the harness
But he's standing up for what he believes in
But I know her voice When I hear mine
He's big disgrace to our beastly ways
From your darker days
Tell me again your fuckless excuses
But you can't pass the police or the pentagon
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me
Induction, destruction, who wants to die
The sky is fallingpeople running scared
I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
And watched you silently
Now dey got me losin' my point
'Cause you're bad right through and don't know right from wrong,
I still want to see you
As I'm watching our decay
He knows what to do and moves to commit the deed
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk
How they follow little trends to get they fame
So, keep poppin' at the mouth and get fucked up like a Bitch
We will fight for the rights of our children
Should I pray for all the hate to go away
Why don't you want me no more 
All's well that ends well
The devil made me do it"
If I did my tricks with smoke and mirrors
Everything you swore would never change is different now
And under my skin there's a place where she resides
I can see, you want this war, there you will find your god
So I'm left here seedless, mindless, careless
Should I answer a friend's distress call
Track masters
A bridge is only there for you to jump
All the gold and silver couldn't measure up my love for you, it's so immaterial
Well the name is Crass, not Clash
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins
We kill for oil, then we throw a party when we win
I come back, open the door
You gotta get it, there's nothing hotter then it
Sometimes I drive slow
And with nothing to do on a night
Let's pick over the traces
To me you ain't no angel's child
Hoes want to be seen with me, and I like their big thick titties
Tell me now what have we done We don't know
I don't believe you when you tell me
Che sei il sole e non un raggio
I only want what I deserve so who are you tryin' to kid
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
L'amore non dura, baby
Like a hunchback juice
You left me lying in your dog descent
Are closing in
Oh no, tears galore
It never ends, never ends, never ends 
Man, you gotta be crazy
In this triumph of the wills I won't be overrun
Sunshine an enemy
Someone's gun is laughing, laughing
Thinks she got the mix all right, says she wants to drive tonight
Just before he died he had a toke
To feel the pain
Your fucking culture alienates me
Tha power pedulum swings by the umbillical cord
The only place that's perfect is in your mind
So don't make it seem as if the only one bleeding is you
Suckin on the tits Had the hooker beggin for the dick
She's right where she always wanted to be
Decided you'd rewrite the law
But now we're alright, we're all calm
And it's a damn sight better than I got from you
Now I deserve to be as mad as hell because
New found power 
Batter but the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming
When I wear my Mary Jane's shoes
After deep cups of patience have been drunk to the dregs
Ah yes I'm all grown now
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
They love my darkness,
Look what's happening now it's all your fault
From the edge of the world
I erase the lines that you mend, "I've done it before", I said, "I'll do it again"
I can shop for clothes without her help it's cool, it's fine
Nothing makes sense, so I won't think about it I'll go with the ignorance 
Are you talking to me hey hey
Choke, choke, I choke you
CHRISTjah flesh; CHRISTlight within; CHRISTBeginning and the end
Don't fuck with me
There's no sense in running from nothingx
Take the pleasure with the pain
And have a fat nigga sit on him
I've learned some nasty lessons so I'm shutting
So many dark arts to choose
Stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss
Whatever, whatever, I can't speak
Peace now fools to trace your muse beyond the failing hand
I'm your meanest thought
Just stop your bitchin, your bitchin
Communication is not just words
For the pain you caused me 
Drown drown drown myself
I am me, and I know exactly who I am, what I am
Innocence stolen
Nuuh not stopping now,
Creative control they withhold
Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker
Go to sleep Go to sleep my child
To know the words you speak to me aren't honest
And all I got was a fuckin' shitty article in Thrasher
My country's enemies
Must be a clash there's no alternative
Coming back from the edge of town
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned
Call it response to a negative home
Now I work me the night shift, where I
Buy a saint to clean up your mess
Where money stood, we planted seeds of rebirth
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
'Cause I'm doin' the same shit martin luther king did
Everybody looking for the ladder not the answer to the question
I'm almost sorry that I must do this to get my name in lights
When it's hard I break the ice 
Not a fucking thing
Have another drink and drive yourself home
Stickin' feathers in your ass does not make you a chicken
He shuts his eyes
These lebels think backwards They push the acts that need it the least
Devastator, in a negligee, does a strip tease while he sings this song
And I'll wait my turn
He'll remember you
Go on drive me wild
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read
Then he'd rape your mother Stick her face in the mud
Got a pack of Kools and a buzz to kill
As cold as ice not witch, you're ice, ice baby
The power amp, we call the "pamp"
I feel you baby
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
See now they acting like they ain't knowing
Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Where you come from must be beat
I got a bad feeling about this,
The maniac psycho, Cool J screamed the shit, but I still can't believe it
See, No body is interested in learning
When you start talking I hear the Prozac
I am not for you one
You've got to get your self respect
You want the questions you got your answers down
Break up with my girlfriend, so I can bang sluts
Kill that motherfucker
When there's nowhere left, when there's nowhere left to go
Waking in the sleep of reason
No I cannot be that one
It's not me you're dying for
Prostituted like the whores of the apocolypse
One foot in the ground
I'm just afraid my life won't work that way
Nobody sees it nobody sees it
Burns only half as long
Everybody knows she's the number one suspect
I'm not writing my goodbyes
With no color at all
But I know it's 'cause you think you're adam
Like the man said its just a shot away
And always will until the end
Every day it rains, so every day the pain
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
When your blood begins to thicken
On its knees 
Squeal if you want to
Then I'll turn you out for fun
Yeah they'll do anything just to spread disease
I need another and another one
I'm pissed off at the world
And every crotch is a siamese gun
Sitting in my transport as we slip through traffic veins
Dried my tears up
She's got a body and you've got the answers to all of her problems
She's widely known, the only maquereau that pays her taxes
I have no friends, I hope that's understood
Like lies, like lipstick on last look goodbyes
Don't call me, don't you call me, I've just had enough now
Never fall again, never fall again
Just know I'm doing something you ain't
I sag my pants until my ass shows
We're starving and dying from our disease
Fight, fight, fight, fight
E mi hanno sempre fatto credere che
Where your homies at They'll get fucked up too
Here we go negero, I'll sing figueroa, figueroa
You feel the same
Little bitch try's to sing and dance
I go wild 'cause your promises are broken
'Cause you don't fucking listen when I'm around
Such a motherfucking bore
Wideeyed and redfaces, my skin hot and flushed
Sex, death and money
All the misery you feel
I don't owe you shit
Begging all fucking men and women to listen
Wild wild wild wild X 
She sucked the poison out of my wounds
Don't you know it starts with you and that it starts with me
But now I'm stronger than yesterday
You want to make up the rules and the provisions
I'm talkin' about that shit you never tell your grandkids about, you know
Denn ich ahnte die Gefahr sie war da sie war nah
Get gun Shoot
Silence so sweet feel the dreams unfold
Man, it's funny that you scare me so, just enough to fuck me up again and again
Crossing the street you look so fine
não me peça pra entender
 heures de TIG, j'ai fermé ma gueule et j'ai assumé 
I'm not that straight A anymore
Demisomething clyde, clod, faux po'folks, wellreadneck
If you let it instead get affected by your habitat
Next in line to get fucked up
Play another charming
Sometimes I feel you're not listening
You're just another exile X
Then fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Damn you for not trying
You thought you could keep me from loving
I don't wanna play
He don't know how to be tender can't appreciate beauty or gender 
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
I'm not even legal
Messin wit them silly hoes Silly hoes
Und die Sonne hat so stark gestrahlt, da brannte mein Verstand
Idon'twantanythingfromyou
'Cause ev'ry day I'm feeling fine with myself
For my shotgun
I disconnect the me in me
Should be made unemployed
The embalmment fluids goes back out, the blood goes back in
I don't know who sold you that but it's a fake
You drove me crazy with your OCD
You say one thing do another
Hold back your breath
I like this, I like the way this feels
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Cause everybody want to get the black
It don't mean a thing 'cause I don't wanna mess around with a joker
I said I have no way of feeding you so leave
Will you forgive mine
If you do why the fuck are you looking at me
Those kids suck, yeah check emcee
Murder murder in black convertibles, I
There's no sense in running from nothing
I left them in Cabo,
You see all the blood, yeah your boy was just here
Hell's no
I'm not spoken for, I'm ready to talk
Was all she ever wanted
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe
As detectives trace my hands with chalk
But we just left a lot of people upset
My mind states, I rate
Four walls, Three walls,
Another day in life
Look at these niggas with attitudes Hello
Everything I am now, but you never worked for it
As of right now
But no one cared
Y'all know the niggas that be steady screaming fuck you
Then your engine in the driveway
Where was God when I lost my mind
Thoughtless trust into the lies,
Cut yourself up and down your arms
My frown's upside down
It's really not so bad, you know, once you get past the taste, ass kisser
I hate you all more than you will ever know
I know you love the way I come and I scorch this
And you know, you know, you know it was all wrong
Ah, how do you sleep at night
I know just how much I love you
It's all gonna change in a hurricane of darkness and pain
It's none of my business if it makes him heal better
It wasn't ever my plan
Do my dirty work, do my dirty work
Yeah, I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
I lie steady
Mary had a little lamb, her face was white as snow
We like to suck before we spit
And I put it back in
As weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine
It's a bitter mouth it's buttered and knifed
You're off track tonight, and if you snooze you lose
You'll never really ever get enough and you broke my heart But I'm weakest when I am up and you have always owned the weakest part of me And you've too many reasons you want to know my disease, huh Well that's just the nature of fools that is the prize for the rules get me to report, but never recognize
And my eyes more red than the devil is
When you fall down
Uh, you hear that shit
He just drinks his Poland Spring
Just turn around and walk away
The boy I love's got another girl
Then there is no way that I can win
Psychiatrists play god  I know
With his new found friend
Woman like a man, woman like a man, like a woman like a man, woman like a man
You fucking
Happiness inside my pain
They got no path that I can't see
Oh, tell me how you feel
And this sting won't help this bleeding heart forget you
There's nobody left who cares you're alive
I spit negative just like a halogen
A little love crime
I know when I leave
They said "Son you're a oneinamillion minority"
Finger on the trigger but your punk ass is scared to pull it
Yeah, when I get back I will call
We're smashing now, a flaming wreck
Pretentious judgmental assholes everywhere
I was hoping that you'd know better
Sellin' tapes out of a trunk, to movin' this far up
Whatever my niggaz want from me, is what my niggaz gonna get from me
Don't care if the whole world falls apart
Cave into kisses cold and wet
Can't take another dusting cause the egg is going to crack
Denounce the spears
The decision of a lifetime I'm having second thoughts about you for the last time
You're not that smart, you're not so strong
I see your not hip to what's happenin'
You'll look all classy with your brand new colombian necktie
California king wrestle gators in the Everglades
Cleansing every sore
But it'll kill you first
And I've been told that my sinful life is an addiction
You never know where you'll end up
Where you think you can run, or you can hide
Gotcha feeling like you're some kind of slug 
Sitting on a fence is a man who sees no sense in fighting
Curse, for in their words tell them that you fucking heard
And she's a fool
And a desperate cry
 in the ', now watch the Chevy scrape
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Flushing our faces into the world
I can hear him now
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
Don't tell me what you're gonna do or what you wanna do
But now you are coming
"Here is where you rest"
You think I've lost my mind
I raise my fist up to the sky
Because you push me you push me over the edge
And all the pain that you hide
As we ask for rest
Fuck the righteous wave and ride the evil undertow
I always wanted the most
I'm sick of always writing songs for you to slit your wrists to
You had your chance now let me show you the way around
Helicopters doing flybys to take a couple of shots
I've heard them rotely repeat your teachings with elitism
Just feel the pain
Helpless die for you in vain,
Make you lick my injuries,
Make me drop down on my knees
I set you free, on an island of flesh
Top Fuel buck  with a finger on the trigger
No, oh no No thanks, just point us to the highway
You try to help
The less you know the better off you are
Maybe you just can't tell, I'm not under your spell no more
Listen, somewhere in the jungle you can hear the devil laughing
But we mean nothing to you You would believe
You're a neck and I'm Dracula
And I don't know where the bathroom is
SplendidAnd lets end it
And I'll tell you something else I don't get, okay This whole thing these bands going backwards, you know what I'm talking about This whole nostalgia for the late 's, the early 's that's happening right now The Black Crowes wearing bell bottoms again I DON'T FUCKING THINK SO, okay I wore 'em once, they sucked, they didn't get laid, I'm not wearing them again
She wore out the feeling
Sometimes I drive quick
Erst wenn i woass dass
Shed no tears
You'd better start removing the lines of deceit from your face
There was fire everywhere and nothin' was spared
Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
I'm sad, I feel sad
Calls down fire upon
Good and bad that's passed
Verzehrende Leidenschaft  autistisches Vergnügen
Walk in half view
I killed myself so many times
Your heart says "No" but your feelings show the poor baby never knew
But some things are better left alone
My inner storm blows
As above so below, now be careful
Hey, we want a Universal healthcare deal
Teeth in the necks of everyone you know
Look at me, I'll never own land that I work on
And I met your old girlfriend,
Hello, hello, hello
I think we're getting back tonight
And the mother of gloom
Is it beautiful enough to keep you begging for more
You can hate me now C'mon
I know you're full of shit x
I think I had enough
If she's so willing, little one, there was no chance there
They used to, though, back when we were hardcore
You know you are high fivin', talkin' shit, but you're going home alone aren't cha
I'm not crazy being institutionalized
My pride's at stake
Turn their bleeding hearts
There's something strange about the way you move your body
I think he's in a jealous rage
Not a single soul is breathing
We can't go on like this no
Now you're closed, now you're closed, now you're closed
When you're great it's not murder it's assinate
Kill them during sex, kill them during talk
There's so much more I want to say 
But you still wanna hate, be my guest
Sometimes I can't describe the wicked shit I feel in my heart
Wildin off a zone and a whole half a gallon
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the hatred we feel
Take revenge on the world and declare your fucking war
And build walls from fragments of my past,
We americans can't write
I could use someone to talk to
Blaze up on y'all one time real fast Do the mix and all that shit
And all the bitches who forget about me want to ride my dick
When my boot stuck in that ass like a dildo
We should be indicted for bullshit we inciting
I can tell it by the way you run away,
Oh Mississippi come and wash my pain away
We hate love
And now my dick has a permanent imprint of my hand around it
Stab stab stab
Bottoms up you fuckers
And we plotted out my death
You'll be in the corner crying
That's what liers always try to do, it wasn't me, 
Leave your fuckin' necks clipped
Talk revolution
Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
And I don't know who to trust
One goddamned word I ever said
Our faith was made for those who lost their own way
I'm not afraid of the price I pay
It's only that my frown
There'd be no need for law
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
The pain that won't go away
But I don't feel like crying
I'm not a fool to hurt myself
Throw in the brittle skeleton fake tomb
The truth of it all it's only face
While you sleep, I destroy your world
If there were no darkness
But I know that God put you in front of me
junto a los artesas y conscientes snob
Fine, you don't believe Black real official
HOPE Maketh not ashamed Everybody listen got to tell you something
And you came crawling back
I'm judged by my wild image a lot
She's wearing an orange jumpsuit and holding a picket sign
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Another asshole lights the flame
I would jack off so much back at my parents' house
To a world devoid of lie
I'll see you cry
C'mon, keep sleepin' on me
Mollasseo nan dokhae
But you'll never see that, not without promotion
I keep my distance
And read the bloodstains on the sheets
Your man is mine
I think our moments come and if you'd feel this love
Make sure everybody dies, when we ride, on our enemies
You choke like a son of a gun
You think they're working your album You're mistaken
Keep your bullshit lies 'cause I'm
I'll never have faith in you
Watch me while I drown
To clasp one another more tightly
I saw them fall
Don't you fucking know what you are
Bodies thrusting to the beat of our shame
Killers reinvent and believe
Some make a living doing killing Colombian penicillin
I want justice I want you overthrown
I'm sick of muthafckers talking about "the West died"
Fill till this feels like hot gossip
But now we get scared like our parents
She didn't know what to do about dad
I never be the student ahead of the class who gets an A in his report card
I don't wanna feel a thing
I can see the truth in you even I know that you're lying
Keep it, don't want it Think I'll just go away
Turn it on turn on the news
But the people in control don't care for you
And I don't give a damn, my heart made me drunk but my mind is sober
And get to work
When there's nothing left,
Kid ain't shit changed
The gentry are all round stand up now
Forced into evil, It's all in your head
You niggas a bunch of squares, Madison
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
"Just how we wanted it laughing"
I watch the snow make slow time
Wish I had the strength to turn my back
I just wanna lie
Power That's not the way to do it
I left with shaking hands, looking for danger
A bullet came to visit a doctor
Thought you could get all you wanted
Girl I love you and I no you love me
I know you want to jump around, but try to contain yourself
This what you want this is what you want
If I make love to you now
I wanna watch it go right in
You did nothing for me
The drugs that I took have made me impure
Blare some of this blacklight
What would you, oh, go wild for
In another life
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
CHRISTJah flesh; CHRISTLight Within; CHRISTBeginning and the end
I should've said to go to hell and take it all with you
I hate the way I love you and I love the way you hate me
Take another look around and find someone else to play
I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do
 I said, "no"
Like an angry dream I was stranded
I feel like I'm on the edge
And you're crawling back baby that's a given
She's ashamed of her birthplace
Releasing the fear
He'll end up killin' these cowards, and I'm not feelin' these cowards
On a rack of skin and sin 
One thousand mothers are praying for it
Makes you cry, while the milk still spills 
Don't you understand
Sitting on a fence is a man who sees no sense at all
Fuck it I'm living my life on the edge
Getting down and dirty baby
Lately I've been fuckin' pissed off why
Don't know what my aim is
She gets the skills from the pills
Bind, torture and kill
"Come on baby, what's on your mind
"Hey, can you open up the back door"
Sir Jinx grew a little bit taller
When I needed my mother and I called her
Behind my back, I can see them stare
I grip my mind around an existence of liquid
But if you'll give me just one more chance I swear I'll never lie to you again
Died, go to hell
In my head, I'm on my knees
She hates her life
We are You, and You're us, stop playing games
Desintegration of humanity
Working for shit another eight hours gone
I know there's nothing left to say
While Devastator sips from the crystal chalice
Peel the candy crust of my body fake flowers
Starfucker, just like my Daddy, yes
"Are you ready for the joke" 'laughter'
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Yeah, if you'd like that, we can ride on a black horse
That someone understands
We go in the back
Baby what do you want from me
So I'll walk the plank and I'll jump with a smile
That's getting married has a curse and it's made up inside of him
You feel black and blue
If you ever want to know what time it is
Cannot be allowed to pollute
I will not bow
Even the dirty ones, you say they annoy you, they want to destroy you
I bleed forever and not a thing you do can comfort me spoken
Beängstigend wie Ratten, die sich auf dich stürzen
Someday that bitch is gonna make me crack
You're out of your mind
Keep on rockin' in the free world
And I am bone and you are glass
I know you do
Craning your neck at the car wreck
Now I don't know and I don't care
Get you back in my arms
And remember your place
Stand up now, stand up now
I can fuck you betta, baby
You'll end up with no one to talk to
Shedding skin succumb defeat
You gotta let these shits go, man
Yeah, that's them, the migrant seasonal workers
Your self respect
Bless the martyrs and kiss the kids for knowing better
I've got hate running through my veins
I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
I'm so fuckin' mad that I got a slug for you
"I'm not Jesus, you can't run away"
Kicking back a whiskey 'til the sun come up
What do we have here, oh yeah, no way
Fucking worthless parasite do your own fucking work
The club is all their law, stand up now
So tiring when you cry
Def jam greedy, we all know priority greedy as a motherfucker, hahaha
I'm Hopsin, I spit shit so unfair and real
Me not unfair to you
And that you're standing in the doorway
The indescribable is up for discussion
Steal my tongue
Well I've got a bad feeling about this when it comes to this
I feel like they've been brainwashing us with a lot
Fuck your traditions, fuck your positions
Sorry That I'm taken aback
Who gouged the notches from the family tree 
And you'll be my family, my brother, my friend
And jumped
The oil burns in thick black columns, the buzz saws echo through the forest floor
I like take my time and it just doesn't work out the way I wanted to
Peel away the shell and we're frightened on the inside
A girl may lie to a suit and tie
Now this here's for those who choose fights
My leader came to see me in a hospital bed
I hope you feel better, I don't, I will not not recover
I wanna see em
I'm not your s*** box
When I know they don't believe in me
No matter what I do no matter what I say
Her mouth was distorted from razor sharp kisses
Clear without fears and it knows only your name
Then break up
To our family and friends and the music stores for giving us gear when we couldn't pay
Lick my licks, I'm on fire,
Dead but dreaming, memories remain
Nobody knows it and nobody can see
I see this whole world headin' for damnation and I'm ready to leave
Will you speak out Will you defend me
I hope it all comes back to you
You're crawling back to tell me
Feel like I've been sleeping in a
There is nothing left to say,
I lost my ignorance, security and pride
You wanna hear my long snake  moan
And that's what you can't understand
I've got my own eyes now and I want you to see
My revolution STARTS HERE
A ball and chain I call my own
There is nothing left and I have got no hope
So break me shake me hate me take me over 
Where's your mother
No more, no more, no more
I've know the damage
Only someone else can show you nothing
Though I like your pretty eyes better blackened
But you only wanted undressed and defenseless
Now in ', let's see who beats the jack
When there's no one left to pardon your sins
The revolution has gone the way of so many before
All the guests that's in the church, all decided to disperse
I can't always be playing, playing your fool
They just want to see you
Thunder bloody bloody thunder
How they love you now
Who are you pretending to be
This is not novelty
Little bitch wants to live in her own delusions
About the American boy back in the states
When I feel more than a little strange
The way I got police barricading the block off
You always disappoint me
I'm not living without you
Look at you, you know it's true
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a motherfucking thing
But don't speak, don't say nothing
You won't believe me now
This is how a heart breaks ooh ah yeah ooh
Just a pain, pain junkie
So it's my fault
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
Let them bleed, let them wash away
You know another way
I'm not afraid of you anymore
No matter how much you yell at me
Isn't there enough to talk about
We could of  hey, where you going Get back here
Like a fist fight
And don't waste my fucking time
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel the pain
Until Jesus is the only master we'll never break the bars of this jail
Back slap you like a bitch
If you'll be my enemy
But not hearing anymore
Take your mother's warning, Roman
Got a halfArmenian girlfriend
Murder rates increases, bullet holes the size of fifty cent pieces
Every girl I meet, always talking bout "I don't even wanna know Hopsin, ewe
You've been touched by the doubt of man 
One hell beast shot over me
You're just screeching out to fate
And now I realize that you never heard
Game, Biggie, Hov, prolly Pac, Nas, no particular order
Into a Grammy winning schizophrenic fucking orphan
Yesterday don't mean jack shit 
Ils nettoient la bavure et l'affaire est classée 
Some people accuse some people of crimes
Coast into the quotient provoking the local pistol pete, choking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens, smokey little pile of bloody pulp and codependencies
Ah, you want to know what makes me tick
War Ooh, good god
And you should've left the light on
All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me
Is used, it feels like you used it up
I'd probably do the same in your shoes
Every fucking thing that deals with You is fucking suspect
Absolutely no respect
The only shit they wanna see is that doggy tag
American grave
Let the starving ghosts feast,
Go lie in a hole and be small
She's not really my type, but I think you two are forever
As nation die we slowly move towards our doom
Your sweet surrender 
Macin', nothin' of gunnin'
Amphetamines for boys
Gone another memory
Let these old punk ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit
Scar tissue, blood blister
Niggas fear what they don't understand
And every key works differently
But sometimes I wish the world would stop
And I'm starving, I'll bite your arm off
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
Fuck the police, break the law
"Go fuck yourself
When the sun and nothingness beat down
See how this wears me out How close am I now to another dull mystery are we the graveyard or the ghost I have a motive My motivations are a matter of faultall your fault
Nunca quedas mal, quedas mal con nadie
How can I help you Yeah I need to make a withdrawal
Just give it back to me
This melody kills me
Time to sing
"I found love on a prison ship" repeating
Another day, another knife in the back
But I know you see exactly where the bottles is going
Well, she crept back in the house at half past three
You're so pretty when you lie
If your heart was simple just like mine is, then you would know just how it feels
My head is filled with disease
 a yes a no and I can't think of a better way to end the day
And when the night breaks through they wonder
Into the dark is where you want to watch me bleed
I beat that bitch with a hit
Und die ganze Welt geschockt
I soldi entrano ed escono
Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin' Damn homies is dissin you
I take music pretty seriously You see that scar on my wrist You see that Hmm You know where that's from Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm I heard the Bee Gees were getting back together again I couldn't take it, okay That was the only good thing about the 's We got rid of one of the Bee Gees One down, three to go, that's what I say, folks Yeahhere's ten bucks, bring me the head of Barry Manilow, all right I wanna drink beer out of his empty head I wanna have a Barry Manilow skullkeg party at my apartment, okay You write the songs, we'll drink the beer out of your head
I'm reminded of your death
You got this power over me, ah
Riding in the dirt
Can't keep my mouth shut
I can feel your body
Comin' back again 
But you hurt me in a way that I've never known
It's the emptiness that's all you have left
Shake your wings Like they're painted with tar
Scrutinizin' ev'ry li'l bit of dirt
I've lost the fear and the horror
IAK niggas, westpoe killing you slow
We want it all
And I'm aware
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
And she stares at the fire all day, mumbling to herself
Far behind if not for her condition
How could you mean that she said, oh you turn my eyes so full of red
With all that money I made last year
Ich lieg' in meiner Kotze
No one knows, no one knows
I'm on fire
Now I have taken control
And it feels like that the only way
I spend my nights in the factory
She screams for more and that is not a dream
Before I fall in too
Had to make moves our home was so fucking little
When it all burns down
You always mad about something
They got no ideas in their heads
On your flesh
You can't respect me 'cause I've done so much for you"
It won't be enough these days to say sorry
And my fear broke apart like fifty balloons
Tell me it's killing time
I'll turn you into one and
Give me some answers 'cause now I'm lost
It's not like me to have my back turned to open places
I'll make you lick my injuries,
But believe me I'm innocent
You want it back
I can pretend to be so sad or funny
It doesn't mean shit
No visitors for you when you're in hell
He is down on bended knee 
Double park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy clarks,
Of this beauty and her innocence
One another And I'll live without you love,
Ready to hold heat, driveby with Rule
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
And I wonder if you still think Bono writes his songs for you
Je ramasse mes parts de marché as a millions dollar boy baby
I leave you bring up discussions on who I'm fucking
Wrapped up warm in daddy's coat
She hides in the back and is unseen
Collapsed lung only help to breath diseased atmosphere
And it comes to me as no surprise
From day one I could not comprehend
I'm breaking down
Jet black  the ink that spells your name
But no matter what I try
When fame is your game
But when they shoot you up with thorizene on crystal smoke
I know what's real 
I feel stupid and contagious
Pure flesh and bone to rip through
Keep your glass eye glued on the end of the highway up ahead of us
I've been through hell, And I think I know it very well
What you want, what you want from me
Tempestuous love passing me by
Damn woman she makes me oh so blue
Shame on a nigga who try to
I'll sing in the forest, tear down the trees
You can watch Good Will Hunting by yourself till your eyes fall out
Love, disfigure, amputate
Your enemies and all your demons
On your back drop your ass like a heart attack
The end is spoken, long since overdue
You ain't got no money you just ain't no good
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Funny how no one knows we came
A nation army couldn't hold me back
'Cause I got more back than them, so it makes alot of sack
Bladefucked
There would be tears in my eyes
The sheets are stained and bloodied
To wrestle with obstruction
But I can't remember what it was that made me
That's why I'm glad Jesus died when he did Oh yeah Because if he lived to be forty, he would've ended up like Elvis, come on Oh yeah, he had that big entourage Twelve guys willing to do whatever he wanted to do He was famous already at that point If he lived to be forty, he'd be walking around Jerusalem with a big fat beer gut and black side burns going, in Elvis voice "Damn, I'm the son of God Gimme me a cheeseburger and French fries right now Where's Mary Magdelene, I want a blow job now Come on now Fuck you, I'll turn you into a leper Give me a cheeseburger now, goddammn it Bluhah Love me tender, love me true, empty my colostomy bag Ah Bluhah Huhah Oh, I think I shit my pants on that last 'huhah' Change my diaper now Huhah"
From this flesh, from these bones
And don't tell me not to reference my songs within my songs
How the fuck could you do this to me
Oh, The beat goes on
Before you're gettin' warm by my heater
I want to be a star
I'll bring back even what's unspoken
 Okay then, wha wha what'd he say There only one way you can bring about a revolution for people
When you stab me in the back
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
It always runs slow
Graffiti Jack sprays in black
Sex, pain, fear, freedom love, young guns be shootin
These fools want to rock but their rhymes are pathetic
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Betcha didn't know
Ah, the sands and hands of time have run out
The shell seems so empty
In this life nothing can last forever
Big guns are pointed at you
Don't wanna sing about no carriage horses
Your mother's arms
I will rebel in the face of all tyrants
Make a stand, make a stand, make a stand
You got problems in your life of love
Or the warmth of the land it's strange to us
Well, I don't mind dying but
"We've got every rerun of Muhammad Ali"
Chasing this pigeon down the street towards the banks
The wind was raging, and the stars were black
Limitless, friendless but much more together
Now bleed bitch, bleed
Alt "This song is a joke, & my life's a joke"
'Cause no one truly lives or dies
The little young nastees, no doubt
There is no death there's only eternity
Blew a head gasket flipped shit and shot up a school
Nunca quedas mal con nadie
Where the roof at We'll stomp that bitch through
Natured now and blown apart
When you watch the smile fade from their face
Are back together, sleeping all alone
The lawyers they conjoin stand up now
As a century ends
There is no one here that understands me anymore
Down by the trucks on Christopher Street
Of a lifeless happy ending
Oh man, I said I'm under the gun, round here
Don't ever let them change your face
You know what, man This is not an independent rap beat, can you tell
I'm gonna make her cry
Are now lost with in ourselves
Black and on the ground
Whose fruits might never not ripen until after their life
The end of an era
There is no god that I have seen
Tryin' to keep me underground, underground
Embrace and fly through the madness 
Tear the scar, be a fighter
My mind is focused, my thoughts are disciplined
Why don't you go watch it by yourself Go to hell
'Cause I'm dishin'
Look, I'm not responsible for the lessons children learn
Designer impostors find us twitching in the claws of the snake
Now from the slime on your tongue
Speak the truth don't you dare lie to me
You know it's only the beginning 
But I find more joy in coaxing with a gun
They cannot repress me
If you wanna make your number one your number two now
Give me back to the earth we've defiled 
'Cause I'll be damned if you flex on me
It's in her kiss, black as sea
I'm starting to see now
It's over it's nothing it's now
It's still so dark because it's
Backstabber 
Bloodworm, bloodworm
I divorce the thoughts of you in love with me
Here's your answer
And I'll go have breakfast with my good friends yeah, yeah, yeah
Come move in another dimension oh oh oh
Drunk again and all the lights are down
You know it's all you want
Strike a match get back and watch that sucker burn
My best friend
I just can't believe this happened
 I said, I said, "stop"
Backstage, everybody wants a piece of JD
We got politicians running races on corporate cash
I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin
I came straight up out the gutta I was saved from hell
The river runs red and I think I'm dyin'
My nigga Jasper, dirty fatass, that nigga boxers stink
I ain't buyin' no future when the past is so far away, yeah
I wszystko znowu trafia szlag
And I wake up in the darkness and i
Y'all check this shit out
Name but I didn't even hear it, and she started screaming BUDDY BUDDY
Make a body work
So send my love a letterbomb and visit me in Hell
Fortyfive calibre killer, but out of the philla�della�rella
To the mindswapping parasites that feed off my existence
Fuck you You did this to us, you did it, it's your fault
Cause today's not the past
It's written all over your face
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
I'm ridin' high now
I'm always watching the way his wife looks me over
And argue that's not what you did
I get money
Don't you make me burn
Said, "Don't you move a muscle, kid,
Till the end of time
She wants to free the kingdumb
You spin around and disappear
Why is it so surprising, no on'es compromising
I don't need to make another album, bitch, I don't gotta do shit
It was more than we could face, hey hey
I love to hate you,
A bit of this stuff but not it, it moves anybody
Karma killer
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Got some wires crossed in my twisted head
And she'll say anything to make you move again
But I know that it's not real
Paying lipservice to shame
My heart is not a football for you
It was just the two hits and I remember nothing more
You keep on asking me this question
Outta her nightmare and back into mine
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
Snoop Dogg Why the fuck not
Fuck all your jewelry and fuck all your cars
He's a quick boy walkin' round the bend
Can just make you look like a liar
As I choke you
And Deception made me as I am
You know it's only the beginning 
But nine, nine, nine for the lost gods
Please don't drop the beat
I've never been afraid to die
Back once more at the point of no return
It's over, it's nothing, it's now
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
And everything else I'm burning
Who can make me feel like this
Some feel that life's a favour
One drink of water and I'm
Too bad bitch, you're gonna finally hear me out this time
You hear no, see no, speak no no no no 
I wanna leave you all by yourself
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot
On the palm trees in the dirt
I know
For exposing that the earth was not at the center of the universe
I don't know what it means
Into the cold wave of a note
All I know is the cops and my  gauge
I need another soul to feed on
I was taking control
Niggas on a chain gang used to do that Huh way back
You said you'd call, that's a lie
It's funny how your worst enemies always seem to
We swam like rats on fire
They keep on kicking me down, kicking me down
Still carries scars
That's could break your day or make your day
Tu postura no molesta
Red is the colour of revolution
Is this how you get what you want
I'm doing dirt like earthworms
Turn on the radio, nah fuck it
Fire fills my veins as I proclaim my resistance
You were a sentimental mercenary in a free fire zone 
insieme ai muri crollano
But I'll wear dark glasses all the time 
Than have the world and all of it's gold
I'm alone in the fight
As you catch your death
Reclaim your power
Multiple senareos, playin' wit' your mind
Roots within our mother's skin
Before it turns to stone
As you claw at my eyes
But when the shit comes down, you're out of places to hide
Your mind stops from nine of my divine shots
I got some militant thoughts and you ain't killin' em'
None can match my scalpel skill
You see me drinkin' there every night
So stupid but not stupid enough
You are not unique
Mother Goose ain't got shit on me
But retreat is not an option
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Oh Mississippi come and take my pain away
We want to know how things could get so fucked up
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
It's all fucked you 've blown it
I'm tired of asking
Turn on the TV, seein' the pain
Fall in your orders 'cause you don't know how to act
Turned into a ball and chain, oh
Sometimes I feel like just giving it all up
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
She said "Sweet of you to notice"
Do what you want as long as you don't come back
'Cause we can not give back those lives
Five young punks for you
Circular Nature of Social Evolution They will never win the war
Like a necromaniac raping a corpse, up the anal passage, while contracting genital warts
Just a scratch upon the skin, 
Now I'm just cold inside
I left it out all lying in a box 
Did I mention I appreciate the way you treat your guestsguess not
They act so discreet, they are hypocrites so fuck them too
'Cause they make they own money, plus decide how to spend it
Yes, your ass did look fat in those jeans, your mom's a MILF
When all of this time, you're turning
I've seen it turn from white to red
I'm not the girl that stopped and stared
Feel the pain yeah
At both ends
But nothing's endless
This disease infested ball of lust and carnage
Tangerine tangerine
So when the beat starts
Mammon, opiate of the masses
Gimme me some fucking feedback
Until I get with all my loyal niggaz goin' the length
'It's healthy for you to express your anger'
They want us to go to they schools and be fucking miserable at they fucking college, studying that bullshit, fuck that
Won't hear the answers
The gates of Hell stared in our face
Lean back and relax, we tell 'em
Where words blister and die
Do you think it'll run that way
No matter where, no matter when
Big Brother's got no heart
Shut the fuck up, the beatdown on the verge what
They went and taught themselves to die
I'll see ya motherfuckers at the next show, pac, the media is my bitch
And for the straights that got fire cars
A deep sore dragged through ages
It didn't take long for her to know me
With a little understanding
Who you tryna fool
It's the blood in your tears
You niggas are making it so simple
To clean the mess that he has dropped
At the mouth, toilet talking, pea soup
You have no answers to our questions
In this division of the law
It's making me sick 
That all we had would be all for not
'Cause now I have something to say
Yeah, that shit hot, nigga
No fighting all the time
'Cause everything is poison
I never wanna see your pretty face again
On her milk white neck
And if you knew what you were saying, I might even have respect
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
I am never enough, I am the forgotten child
Predicts that passion turn to strife
Clawing it's way back grinning You know
Throw a brick through your shit, come cut the alarm off
tu mi dici sorridendo
Well I need a place to run to
We put the walls up, we put the walls up again
The darkness still falls
Two sides working together
You wanna get stoned
The bombs were attatched to the wings of the plane 
Do not rely on this broadcast alone
Can't make up his god given mind, no
Listen to talk back radio, watch Neighbours
Hey now, all you sinners
You say you're sorry now
Could rock your show single handed
Maligning my name will holy ark up your squad's face
Like Julius Caesar seizing control of the Praetorium
Performing in front of millions, nigga every race
The drugs have given you all kinds of different sores
Ain't it wild
Some folks work so hard
Before I didn't give a damn 'bout what they say
I got shot so I dropped
Let the light in, Let the kids play, Let the people know
See across the field
Shove a million dollars in my pocket, but there ain't no pacifying me
Stay out late, make out, bring a friend
I don't want to care
Did we distract you
Dog faced boy
So I will flee the factory, and pray you to dismantle me
We know you did it 
And choking on your candy flesh
He unsays the words, He said, "What you What the fuck"
When my mind would say 'hey are you afraid'
To give me some reason to move
As if the heart were not enough
I've been asking you this whole time
I ask 'cause I'm not sure
I can see your face
I just wanna be free, is there a possibility
Full of passion
People are being forced to live like animals
Kick it back in its face, my God
You wanna be a woman like a man 
I still love the way you feel
For Teresa is a waitress though she's now known as Juanita
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
The music she make, rubbing our faces in the feces of the daybreak
In the valley of the fucking locust
Bought what I wanted, and they said "buy more"
The idea of a happy ending
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Is not a good vibe, or something I've missed
Just to piss you off
Do you know that I exist for you alone You alone
You can hate me nooow You don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
She's so rock steady bambalam
Fat mama cass it was hip automatically
 If you want to stir up real mud
There are so many things I want to tell you
Tell me what's the game now
I'm living with a perfect stranger, but I find myself alone
This solemn piece of a guilty net it grows, so cold
I want my baby
But my thoughts have changed now, I've opened my eyes and now I'm through
Disloyalty will have me kill my brother, sheddin a tear
And try to find a familiar mind
You are such a hypocrite, so I'm leavin' for a bit
Yeah living in yellow skin so I shed and borrow shed and borrow
Sound, I'm a dead neck
Ever we want to
Look around you, is this what you want
Making up everything that's in my mind
It made a mess outta me
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do to me
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
I was taking control
Ya baby daddy passed we share the same losses
A friend of mine Roberta she got a job at the post office
Bring your IQ and try to understand
I'm the ringing in your ears, I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
I feel a bloodrush come right over me
And I'm still ripped off and passed out
The stinkin' troopers them, they think that we are fooling around
Waiting on a revolution that I can follow I can follow Yeah
What kind of love from a nigga every night make you cry
Let me do what Nas did and tell this shit in reverse
Whatever dude
I'm fucking done
With its hands stretched towards the calendar hanging itself
I represent the wicked and I'm creeping out from the dark
Oh Baby Why won't you talk to me
As I plan my great escape
Among the excrement of my sins
This is not the man I wanna be
High and noon  times
Made a promise not to clean the slate
Violence and civil unrest
Motherfucker
The cardboard change game, it ain't far from someone else's truth
And I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
I can get lucky playing some shows, I'm a bitch
Clean up what is left of you
Producto back rap rush, you'll notice the lad crush
And this is war 
Popping shots through the sun roof screaming "fuck you"
The damn thing gone wild bambalam
But it doesn't fucking matter I'm playing a losing game
Bet you sleep like a child with your thumb in your mouth
Sixty miles talking
Battle cry just trying to seek the satisfaction of the captain
No idea how it feels to be on your own
How they love you now
It burns like the open flesh on my arm and reminds me of the days
Kuulkaas enot
But it's easy to hate what you just can't be
I am the doctor and I'll kill your pain
And through the walls you hear the city groan
Baby you're always using mine, why you get
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
The line you found within your mind
Hand the children death and pretend that its exciting
You're a fool, you're a fool
And you speak in tongues to me
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
A synergistically greater plan
I'll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun
It tears you apart, it tears me apart
So when your new shit finally drop, that's one album I will not be buying
They want to take away the little they call something
Out of shape, out of mind and out of time
When you get your hands on it, wanna fawn it
If I tell you what you want to hear
Let's burn down the parliament and watch the flag cook
I'm not Mr Friendly, I can be a prick
I want the life you think I have
See I get betta with time like a watch
Low twos to you my, my fickle friend, yeah
When I get what I want then I never want it again
That takes the beat from my heart
I hate to say it but fuck it, shit I done lost faith
You don't plan for intruders beforehand
You raise a flower of fire
To know that the flame still burns
To know the eyes you stare at me with aren't honest
Do what the fuck makes you happy, cause at the end, who's there
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
There's no need to wait
Stepping on some toes that he does not know 
Lil bitch
Hes gonna evolve us, some rockes to prove that shit is garbage
Sudden swoop skyward iron horse overpass
I wanna new face right now
Set, Style blaze hard with the criss one race over to race
A big pill but you know that you need a poison
I'm feeling bored
There is no way I could not remember
Now Don't fuck the style
Oh my god my god won't forsake again
The black sand stuck beneath her feet in a warm Sorrento sunrise
Its payback, and it's all
I am life I am death
They knock you out at the drop of the dime
It's our world, please believe
My mom, she died and never wrote
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards Duh
With the taste of sweat on my tongue
And I've done nothing but lead you on," she said
Touch down new ground stop living on the moon 
Spill over the wall
Shut up, its how hard ya work and how good you flow
So lets watch everybody bleed
So sink in your tusks, mighty walrus
Until we give up the ghost
Kick it to me now cos I just can't figure
A social alliance, are you in distress
There's no price tag on my conscience
I beat a woman with varicose veins
Do I lie alone and keeps my cold hands off it
Roll some notes an' hail a cab
And if I can't afford her, my veins begin to ache
Right through her chest
Buy me a drink I've got some craziness to kill
'Cause nothing is promised
Her face and arms began to swell
All that time, it cannot be ; Oh my eyes, it cannot be
And I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
I take y'all niggas straight, +Beneath the Surface+
She's got it all, that's what they want you to think,
In Schlangenlinien durch die Fleiß und Preisgesellschaft
Because I believe that it will determine the amount of sex I will have in the future
To submit to the  race
I said it I meant it, that's the way I deal with enemies
Gonna move on ahead
There's lots of good rubber left on these tires
Mama I don't know if I'm a ever be home
Think I'm going for a walk now I feel a little unsteady
Oh no, I've started a war
No you're not thinking, you're on drugs Normal people don't act that way
I believe I'm fixing to die
We sat by the fire and ate a goat
And I have nothing to say
You're not rid of me, you're not rid of me,
Let them split their tongues to lie with both ends
With backing  with blessing,
With a note in his hand that read,
I pack a chainsaw
The plotted lines the faulty map
And it makes me so angry
All lost and summoning the face of their fathers
Everybody says he's mad
But you've got no right to sit there saying I abuse it when you only sleep with girls who say they like your music
But ah the bums say oh
But you must've been aware;
Member when your pussy Second husband tried to beat ya
I'm older now
When there's innocents  there is guilt
That's what you ought to know
All the children run away from me
The lick of carnivorous winds
If you made plans or not
Please forgive me Jesus for now I know
Fear this hate Fear this doomsday
Don't cry,
Do you understand
You're a scumsucking shitty guy, so die Taylor, die
These eyes have had too much to drink again tonight
If you thought that I was afraid, well have no doubts The trouble is, you cannot figure me out And you've too many reasonsyou want to know my disease, huh Well, that's just the nature of fools that is the prize for the rules get me to report, but never recognize
So I can cold spark the party when I'm rockin' the place
It's not over till it starts again
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
Save this, my rage is bliss, I'm taking names and getting pissed
Sleepin' wit the enemy bitch
If I ever will be there Do you sleep anymore
And I've done nothing but lead you on and on," she said
What a habit when I needed you
You want the badge of honor when you save my hide
I'll lick my wounds, could you pass the salt
Now she's feeling more alone
I'm angry with myself
You're bleeding me x
Send it off to me
Make a mess
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
You're not rid of me No, You're not rid of me
You're all or not
Speed toward hell
Make good in the end
Load your gun the damage done
Oh, suck
Bitch, we have got a problem, it's not enough to be hitting it
Das war ein mieser, feiger Mord
And maybe it's a woman
All I want is a little respect Respect
Tell me go back home
Your money talks but my genius walks
Are you clear in your mind and sight
Where was the fear, when I said I was scared
I've been beaten
It's gone on way TOO long now
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
The game is lost  the game is lost  is lost
The one I want to hate
Now if sex is old fashioned and you're not selling out
We burn  we burn at both ends
Scenes of violence protect this
What's real, everybody who knows they're out of place
Baby, I've had all my shots and I'm fine
You wanna be fooled
Scorrendo i messaggi 
Oh, you thought it was over
No, naw man, that's actually not on my mind, naw, it's different this time
Take it pull my hair back Oh no
So when will it end, when will it end
Lies you're bleeding 
I don't believe you when you hold me
Well you can't walk in my shoes
Watch me now
It takes to put a girl like this back together again
The rivers are flowing with blood
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart
I would never want to
Can't shake this blood from my eyes
The blood is on your hand
Pushed straight over the edge
And you want to believe
I'm not the one
For you know this isn't the first time
You almost turned away 
Got a head cold, got a chest cold
Shine my shoes, ain't got the time
You stabbed me in the back, you're lower than a snake
So we about to blow like Parliament in "V for Vendetta"
Where no one notices the contrast of white on white
It's time you know your enemy
Always, always darkest before the dawn
There's no kind like me
'Cause the earth and space gave birth to this paleface
Y'all really on one, beat it, you're gone, done
I never thought I'd change my opinion again 
Don't you wanna go for a ride
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool,
My hell
Call it off, sorry refused 
At home with a roach hazed, alone or with hoes great
I am not the son of shaklak klak
It makes you go to hell
Save what you can do 'cause that's some bullshit
Well, you'd never believe how much effort goes into
Even this laugh'll pass
A bitter taste
Niggas for life, fuckin' your wife, these niggaz wild Hello
Flesh for food and blood for wine
I am a liar, yeah, I am a liar, yeah, I like it
Came face to face
Brought you to tears again
What's the matter with you
The jewels around her neck retain a curious sheen, god is in my heart and tearing at the seams,
I wouldn't be in the crib, I'd be loadin up, to run in your house
That's when dickhead put his hands on me
Safe in these halls discreetly
There's something left in me
I'm red and thick like fire
Life on the edge is the bread which I feed
I'm not Jesus, Jesus wasn't there
Shaking as her sex takes hold
It's the feel 
'Cause I just want to know, I need just a little
Your nose is bleeding
As I smoke my tree, medlar, South African
She said, "I'm not your minor girl"
I went to a church and stabbed the pastours heart without a warning
Living in a city where the skinny niggas die
I hate to leave my children crying
When it might have made some kind of a difference
All guns are loaded and have gone off now
My second life has just begun
You could say everything's no good
Domination won't win friends
But I'll be back to haunt them
'Cause I'm on fire too hot to touch
If this is spring than it's time to sing
And you'll grab that piece of gold
And you could bury me where I lie
All is left is pain
Now go on and stake your claim to this ground
I know it's not allowed
Aww, mothafucka wanna see you shine and I got my gold on
I'm fucking crazy, need slavery to be alien gravy
Now I'm realisin' we're fightin' to heighten
Doctors arrested for euthanasia 
I still believe
Shut up and swallow my pride for me, go
In the days of rage
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act
So finally asked scratch when I can get my dick sucked
This is not what I want, this is not what I need
I said, I'm sorry mama
He says he's sorry and so she wants
I don't want to fade away 
A world full of hate is my alignment
Depression drinks me deeper
Just what you're gonna do now
I lost it all to that flicker of pearly white
What about the times you hit my face
But it's the genie at the bottom who I'm sucking at
I love our sunburnt country, I love it a lot
non mi resterebbe altro
I seen the same nigga with the  die with his eyes open
You married disaster, it ended your life, 
I feel your arms surrounding me
Making me a burning specimen 
She wants to be a messiah
With the fucking phone
Every foolish game, every midlife rage
Understand
It's time to pick up a knife
Step up to my friends in the alley tonight
You're so predictable no shadow of doubt
You know what I mean
And I can't get to sleep
When I am queen sweet girlscout's face and not a one will fall from grace
If I want to honky tonk around till two or three
Eh shit
Walk 'n' cry, I walk 'n' cry
I see your mouth running
Let me bleed for what I've done
We see all but do nothing, in the hole of "How it is"
And the silence embraces all my weeps
Doesn't surprise me now
There was the bones of a song
Ill mind
Die Taylor, die, you ain't no friend of mine
And when I come through you know I'm blowing the top off
When did living start being a sin
Check the new style that Ollie found
Do you want to see your life pass by
You get too drunk, you get too high
I'm above you, smiling at you drown, drown, drown
My shaking hands are in the skin
The bag turn it  degrees
Oh no, I've seen it before
That dog in you spit me out into the Mississippi
And all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge
I've heard you talk about how
Giacchè non sono neanche carne da cannone a Dio
Through the whole fucking town
My distance from your toes babe
I'm not your property as from today, baby
If you get burned
I'm a wall, I'm a fence, I'm a dotted line
Because in , blind faith in your leaders, or in anything, will get you killed
Yeah, let's fuck with their hearts
The problem is my frown
If all they lost was selfrespect
I feel you baby when you're so alive
Another statistic, a body in a drawer
I'm a storm, I'm a sign, I'm a bleeding heart
And now, we're all to blame
Touch down new ground stop living on the moon
All the things you've done coming back to you
This is not what I want this is not what I need,
All you niggas is faker than Lupe Fiasco claimin he
We're in tight playing seven one night stands
When will you come to get me out of my fear
Heart you break
The force of law becomes a farce
You better know the house rules to finish in this life
No hurt, no pain, no shame
The passin' of everyday human events
Whether or not you shot, the aggression looms
Let them ferment and came back to our senses
My fist
Embarassed faces
Don't apologize  I hope you choke and die
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
And we hide behind loss, anger, hate
Voodoo pinning, devil jealous
One kid took another kid
Sometimes I feel like I've broken through
Dem niggas bout to jump u
I can't keep control my anger
Sheila is a messo
And I'm just calling to let to know
You coffee shop revolutionary sonofabitch
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
It's time to fuse ourselves when love set free loves burning spirit
Let's jump upon the sharp swords
With his feet inside your shoes
Is a master whom disasters
Sitting on a fence is a man who drinks real ale
Sounds like you have a problem
I got a fresh opinion now
The death of one is a tragedy
So nigga fuck you x
It's getting all your friends
When I know I'm wrong
And take turns to burn religious doctrines
Like wat the fuck you expect I'm a muthafuckin cajun
You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back
You can run and you can hide
You're not allowed to change your mind
I torti restano, fra', questo so
And know that I don't hate you
You blink, you die
But I'm drowning in the rain
Embrace me
Destruction lies uncovered
When lies are easy to find
You're living your life in total hate
But to unplug is to spill a restless world at unset knees
Why not kill your maker instead
Knowing this is a big mistake that I'll regret much later
The whore you'll miss the most when you're away
Smell the burning wreckage of even you
I'm sorry if I disagree
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
Fugees Fugees and Mobb Deep tryin' to diss now too huh
Another smiling photograph shall stay  winters long forever
I know your full of shit x
Till my dad returns to tell me what the other side is like
Watching you squirm in your shoes
My young hips, they know how to entrance
And when the shit goes down, you're out of places to hide
Don't get mad
En unión con sus hermanos
Shapeshifter, guest lister, big faker
Yeah, use your rights but don't imagine that it's heard, Oh no no,
I ignored the sheep and shepherds on my way
Kneel 'n' cry
Until you taught them all how to bite
I got a bad feeling about this in you, in
I see no reason why I've placed such a value on you,
This is what you want from me
I got a message in a bottle, written in gas and oil
You know time don't ever end
Says, man, you should try to take a shot
You can be my black Kate Moss tonight
She says, "I can help you, but what do you say
Won't you let her leave today inject the holy spirit in her
Heaven knows I can't take more of this
The drugs 
When your chances fall in your lap like that
The things I used to hate, I have learned to accept
So hold your head 'cause I'm a torture yours, leave them open sores
Miami bitches you know how we go
Greasy, dirty, smelly, wretched
Making lies up for all the right questions
Hear the warning, the end's Beginning
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
Perfect lines like space and time extend across my room
Five stories falling
I'm living with a perfect stranger, is there anybody home
As a killer
Well, you can have him, I don't want him,
Belligerent authority, bloodied by the right to be
It's got nothing to do with me
I still know your name
Like passing through a sculpture gallery
E proprio questo sono stanco 
They were few and far between, no it wasn't meant to be from then
To the game
This is not the first time I came to the planet
Do you care Hell no 
They have always run this town
Search me So you want a piece of this
You fucked up By Ween
I'm not exactly sure of your motivation
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Someone yells you suck
Elvis had  but this one is mine
You don't know what your power has done to me
So put me down, punk
And there were jumping jacks and whistlers over christmas,
But there's nothing better than watching him go down
Pass me the key
Bell hoppers to the death while Irish hoes deep throat
She's got a secret surname that nobody knows
They got us using drum machines now
Until the end of time
He's losin' his touch
Could never end
When I'm crossing the road
I'm left with, I'm left with
But the world moves on and leaves you far behind
I've got a long way left to go and you've shown me no grace
I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned
I'm so unhappy that I could die
Goodies in the basket
Every bit, bit, bit
You can watch Good Will Hunting by yourself, I hope your eyes fall out
Will you still be standing in your disease
You keep on steppin' out of reach but you won't win the race
MC Ren Why the fuck not
The fear I see when I look in your eyes, hey, hey, hey
It's running in the family, hey baby
Me I take the cynics role, throw scorn on your empty mind
Contestants in a suicidal race
This is not what I want this is not what I need
Okay, here we fuckin' go
There's nothing I can do
All the lies, Oh
Or at the falling of a tree
All she wants is your lovin'
Glaub mir ich kontrolliere das nicht
Tell nothing except who to idolize
The cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing
'Cause I don't want to marry my convictions
That they do not respect in any degree
The time we spend
But the real problem with this man
He laughs as Kiev burns on the six o'clock news
I've got enough of my own
Undercover lover, that's my heart now
Fix it with your tiny fist there
And that's no one to talk to when feeling depressed
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
Ignorance, intolerance abounding
Everybody wants somewhere
I see the blood on the floor
Cold gun, wild rose
The neon forest is my home
Oh, why do I defend the state you're in
You'll understand when I'm dead
Money buys you beds but it can't buy sleep
He wants to grow to twenty feet tall
And for this gift I feel blessed
You're not what you seem 
Oh now you can see the reason why not everyone's the same
All I want
And we are broken, we lie misconstrued
I'll make my stand against supremacy
All my blisters now revealed
I swear this bitch is Shady that's what I know
Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down
I smell the bullshit
Full of ecstasy, hard drugs and bad luck
But feel like autumn 
They broke in my house, planted bugs in ma lamps and my couch
I'll leave out the teasin'
A war is taking place
Took this game to its threshold
I can't forget the fight that's growing stronger
Eternal kiss, touched my face
Doch eigentlich ganz normal
And you laughed in my face 'cause you held all the cards
Disrespected, niggaz don't "show no love"
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light,
Don't stop to
Who makes laws for lawmakers
Everything I hide ends up in lyrics
You want it
Do you not go to the palace of answers with me Marie
You're drunk, you're never gonna get away with this
Been loved to lied to been a bride to a death wish
Attacking the vocabulary kingdom, see not everybody's cool
I'm gonna fuck the whole state of Ohio
Can't get to sleep
Somethin' gotta come down gotta change now
Too many things I got to know
The bitch who blushed and smoked blunts wit us
In the darkness
Per ora non ho fatto il cash e va bene Marra
Perhaps it's just the way the light falls 
I'm out this motherfucker
Keeps me always believing
non lo sai che i miliardari
Force the pace, ignore the speed limits
Wanna be clowns, the fail ones
We're going to turn the world UPSIDE DOWN ON IT'S HEAD
I cannot rest, or my consciousness contest
No kind of life, this is no kind of life  I've got to get out
Das Haar voll Glanz, die Haut wie Samt
And I hope you feel the same
I'm wolf, I spit flowy partly
Just remember we will always be here
I know blue eyes get boring 
Jump back, get your self respect
Who you fucking now
Sixes, money foldin
Never compromise and you will never live a lie"
Please stop crying
As stonewalls caged the beast
Voting doesn't work why
Break the fist that abuses
I'm just saying I ain't heard shit from the horse's mouth
And smother me
I went down like a burned out rag of a child
Your fingers are whispers
I wui dass du woasst
To be born again in the thrill of sin
It's looking more like a kick to the face
Screams of pain dismembering the wind
For life is a chain, cause and effected
Dirty, I keep shit stinks in my
Chorus I only wanted to be somebody
But I mean no harm nor put fault
Take my head and kick it in
Destroy the answer that you've found
I'm not alone because the TV's on, yeah
Line my nest with your soul  cleansed in bloodshed
And run away in disbelief
Casting doubt
I, I, I don't need this poison
Do I need therapy, or do I need a good kick in the ass
And take away my pain
I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
Independence is a game
Cellular phone soundin' a death tone
Hard enough to believe in myself
Even if I can't fight beside you
I'd get down on my knees if I could beg you to see
It was a slap in the face, how quickly I was replaced
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
Cause bein with you was like a hangman's noose
Do my dirty work Yeah
Tellin' me how sick I am
Moving the masses
And kiss the devil on the lip
You can try to suck me dry
Lord I got into a fist fight
 It's not my fault
Black no 
You're in for it now Are these helicopters for me
You've got to jump back
Like a second skin
Your mother should've swallowed you,x
What better time than now to bandage your bleeding
I'm motherfuckin' radical
Dr Dre Was it a bitch in the mix
You dont know what it is to be a friend, now
Selfdestructive line in pain
And I'd have doubt it if she's heard a single word that I've said
Why talking a lie
Go now please and 
You want to wash away what ills your heart
This bright red feeling
You know those other girls just can't grind like me,
You piece of shit
Watched him tearing through the garden, killing everything in sight
No stranger's feet
Baby it's you I want,
He wants too turn his back on your sorry face, and run away with someone else's reflection
Spend it on the enemy
Don't wanna think about the schools in Bosnia
So this business is what I left you for
But in the end she's left me a bitter twisted motherfucker
Ich möchte endlich frei sein, aber wohin soll ich gehen
'Cause to talk to you is harder work 
Battle battle battle
To burn your candle
We'll never let up until we hear every voice scream
What do I know What do I know
Get a grip right now
And nobody makes us wait
And know that I don't want to fight you
Every inch of planet Earth,
While you're in the benzo messin with broads
bin nicht spontan und mitreißend,
I think I'm falling off
I thought I could change you
I don't wanna take a walk
Does anyone care if nobody cares
The fire burns on high
We were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts and march through the gauntlet of car alarms,
Stayed up those nights to feel
But it doesn't matter what you do or how hard you try
Pick yourself up now and walk the road
Deli Joe he ought to know
I've tried hard to make amends
So I died in the back of the cab
It's a crazy world to live alone
Well they say that rock is dead
She's just a puppet in their indoctrination plan,
Do what's right, do what's right, do what's right now
Whose soul are you tormenting now 
You made me throw it all away, my morals left to decay
Motherfucker, I'm Dre, I don't need your respect
As I gazed down at his grave
Forced hellos
How would you feel if she held you down and raped you
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
We've lost that kind of spirit
It always cures the pain that would never leave and causes even more
Without the fire
I've got a little bit of thunder
All but the primitive side  the animal side
Two falls or one submission
A shallow little xxx kiss art disaster
And now you're desperate, and in need of human contact
See, I could never be a fat guy I'll tell you why One simple reason the first day I wake up and can't see my dick, I STOP EATING OK "Honey, I can't see my dick Give the dog some of the food, 'cause I'm going to Ethiopia I CAN'T SEE IT Can you see it I can't feel it" Freak I have to see my dick first thing in the morning That's the kind of relationship we have Wake up, first thing, "Hey, how ya doing" "Good, how ya doing" "Terrific, you wanna jerk off now" "Ya, why not" Oh yeah, jerkin' off is like an aerobic thing for me now I'm forty, now I do it every day I do it eeevery day I've even gone beyond porno, I'm back to regular network TV Oh yeah People wonder why "Caroline in the City" is getting such big ratings I'll tell you why I know why
You know, you should be flattered
Trust built on a mound of shit
The club is all their law, to keep all men in awe
I could write or I could read, go next door and smoke some weed
But it don't have a face
"You'll die trying to live this down you might as well forget it"
Self doubt is an industry
I even slap hoes bitch
But I've seen the way she covers her chest up as if it was a national treasure
I'm not Jesus, Jesus wasn't fair
In my old man's shoes, and how you'd understand that
And stop taking all these pills
A little bit deeper
I wanted your words
I'd have made us a killer movie
How many miles can you put on one soul
I want this ship cleaner than a hospital ward A radical has polluted our ranks
I don't wanna baby that looks like that
Keep your drink just give me the money
I bite my tongue every time you come around
With their violence and pomposity
With the world running faster faster then
There was a voice behind my back
Crazy fraud lovers kill off inside
On a ball and chain I call my own, huh, huh
I want to stand alone
I'm eating rat poison for dinner 
You made me suffer for so long
Was it not what you wanted it to be
I cry and beat the bathroom floor
You piece of shit
I don't want to fade away  away 
I wanna tell you something
Enough to drive you nuts
Maledetto me che stò cedendo
Oh my god there's scenesters everywhere
And some strength that you won't believe
We outrun a river colour brick red mud
My skin cold as ice
At four years old thought the world was joy
Don't you fucking know what you are go on get back to where you belong
These hooks sink in
I won't pledge allegiance to hypocrisy
To take a shot at me
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Only thing I know
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Dipshit
As a snap of rifle rounds echoes out across the fields
Video killed what we once stood for
I'm a dark storm cloud that's floatin' over top of suburbia
And songs that recognize our sick obsessions
And believe in a god we can't feel
Whatever happens well I'm part of all this
Set her soul on fire
Sie verdient einen besonderen Schutz
He likes to remember when
We'll move forward
When I am queen on royal thrown made out of parts of broken bones
But I ain't one to jump through hoops to make the first impression
War Ooh, friend only to the undertaker
But I'ma make your bitch ass holla
Fantasies of the master race
Bring it all together, I want everything
I won't play girl to your boy no more
I swear I'll never never feel like myself again
I am down on the ground,
The damn city bus, it moves so slow
No more indie rock
And a gat that's filled with love, now let opposites attract
Don't try and front fool
Hear the dogs, hear the beat, in the dog pound
And motherfuckers lost their minds
So I'm not waiting anymore
The mothers will cry their tears
Be silent now and take your beating
And when I smoke, I will smoke gaping holes in my chest
Damn you for trying to fuck this up
Kick Artist jump the knocker nothing but a shife
Or is it my suspicious mind
Angry grip around your neck
No nodon't give me your nothin'
You stupid asshole
And now I finally see that the further we go
They just wear me down with more chains
I throw it right back at 'em so happily can't believe that they have the audacity
I won't lie down as you walk away
In darkness, and seclusion
And it's wild wild wild wild 
If there's one thing you remember
But right now I just don't
The tide is swelling and we've fallen asleep on the shore
She's not me
Type o negative cover, written by Peter Steele
The battles left us are far from over
And burned it down the same night
Dress up this rotten carcass
But I choose to speak, sing, scream
Everybody knows you're no beginner
The people I looked up to are not for real
You know who we're talking about, no doubt
But don't lose me now, don't lose me now
Steals the soul; machine forever turning
We know our god is the same god
Don't you dare mess with my Mean Machine
Satan ain't hard to see without craning your neck
There's no point in charades any more
Anata sono made hashitai no, I just wanted you to talk about it
But who knows
But my mind stays the same
Blood is on the ground, they're shooting all around,
They're the backbone of this town
There's no need to scream or to shout
I'ma give 'em hurricanes until another Levee break
Ieeieei and I die fadin' straight away
Look what you've done to your arms
I want to make you bleed
What do I do to ignore them behind me
Said they pack the , they fire it at prime time
To pass the time, pass the information
Eye of the tiger, I know these cats are sick of this
My blood was an untrusty ink tonight
To another time, to another place
I decide it ends right here
I'm 'a fucking snap like Berman when he acts right
There's nothing wrong
We've got nothing better to do than watch TV and
I wonder how you'll justify the lies, the lies, the lies
And if you can't run to save yourself well then you deserve to be had
Yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
The bitch threw her tits asked my click who we pay for
An everturning wheel
The cinema speaks as you take off your clothes and burst into dissimulation
If you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine
Tú te crees un juglar moderno o algo así
You've played your little games
You're no better than your enemy
The gardenhead knows my name
We learn to fall and run away
"How come you ain't made it yet"
Drain out your blood we all deserve to die
I try to be polite, but I feel like I'm stuck for life
Elle dessine des spirales et des drôles de coeurs 
If you ain't wit me I'ma throw you WAY over the edge
And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Bully boys out fighting, it's just the same old game
Take a long look inside cause right now
But there's no time
Murderous rap revealed goin' for kill
I don't want to hear it
I will begin to turn it around
Always darkest, darkest
Struggle war whole drug fiends, the white house burn
Then asking my identity
March march march to the beat of the drum
All that you want
And standin' like this with my ear to the ceiling
You just piss in your pants
The slow death of light
But you better shut her down before it's to late now Come on
What do I know
Well I'm not here to preach, I'm just sick of looks
Well, I'm here to remind you
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
See ideals and my visions all burn up
Chorus I won't stop
Got a pain, I've got a hunger
And there's so little of it left 
Well you know if you want to talk about it I'll be here you know and you'll 
Your brains are in your sac, you two faced fucking fake
I know you know, I know you know"
"I want to be cured"
Your fucking television
And I want out desperately
The daybreak and sunset
He denies he's descended from the dinosaurs
Then have a mental breakdown and proceed to use a crack pipe
Right off of his face
We can do it however you wanna do
I want to go, I want to get out
I have focused on the cameos made by the tiger
Why can no one ever feel a fire spirit
Every single one's got a story to tell
Here's your answer it's still
Past tense, my best friend
When I close my eyes I'm in a crosstown cab
When you kill the mother, there's no other
Your houses they pull down, stand up now
There's no devil's haircut in your mind
One on one, beat you down and then hug you
Funneling through smokestacks
To money and fame, I changed my name
They drink and they fight
All those things I loved I now despise
He died as me
I know you'd fool me again
Make me hungry for you again
You're holding me back, confined by doubt
Give a kid a gun, take away her Mum,
I gotta feel you right now; comin' around
You know I wish them all dead
Mä oon parempi kuin sinä, koska mulla on aatteet vitun ylevät
Right now I want to thank God for being me,
Weary of this hallway lined with ghosts
Every touch you craved for turned to violence
That's some nasty shit, I you wonder why I'm sick when I see this shit
For passin such judgement, I can only wish you death
With a flat fluid embrace
What you gonna do when your trip turns blue
And I feel sick, sick, sick
Rears its familiar head on the TV screen
I know it's crazy but I know it
I think I know
Lookin' straight ahead like they know just where they're goin'
A real party not just people who're faking fun
Leaving blood and shattered bones
I think I'm paranoid
It' s sad when someone you know very well decides to fuckin' die and go away
And Juliette had her Romeo
To explain, let me kick it to you a little something like this
'Cause you know it hurts to see the light of day
Do you know what they say, what they say about you
Are turning 'round
I'm so full of love it deeply sickens me
Then piece me back together like a star
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta, etta, etta, etta, etta, etta, aye
I guess I don't know my own strength
Adrenaline is fire to fuel
Tell me they lucky I don't suddenly go off and cause another Dem
I have no idea what's been holding me up
You monkey, you left me 
Life filled with deception, unwanted inception
Once in a while I could hear him shoot his pistol
Never let them make your face a mask to hide behind
Even through the darkness, I can see you shining
Knowing when all else doth fail,
But, I'm afraid your brittle bones would break
What do the old people teach us but how to die die die die die
I want the world to know
Flat tire, homemade cross
They never thought that I'd be 
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Exgirlfriend, exmember
But now that's gone, gone, gone
But ignored them, and showed 'em the risk was to blame
If all I've got is everything and everything is all you want
So put on your thinking caps and get ready to fuck shit up
No surrender
I feel like I could explode
Bullet in your face
So we give back a little bit of what the worlds given us
Master passion greed
I've talked to a bum out on Sunset Strip
Silence when I try to talk to you
On top of being talented, bitch I'm fucking passionate
So I could sleep some more
Wanna be somebodies Na, na, na, na, na
 I'm on your fat claw
I've just stopped trying
When I chased you with a burning cross, my mother she wanted you dead
With your gun, nightstick, and mace come on be a man
Wipe the tears from your eyes
At the bar, six shots, just beginning
Friend you'd better think again,
They just gave up in the end
But luckily had a couple of guns with me
Do my dirty work Yeah, yeah
She stole my skin,
The Devil's on rollerskates
You get more fun within your shell 
And y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit
So this shit about taking in the souls
I'm feeling more alone
Mom and Dad said I was nothin, So it's time for me to show
I gotta get out or figure this shit out
Meet me where the city turns to trees and nothing comes for free
You're skinny and pretty and 
I hope you break every bone
I can't help it all I hear when you're crying is laughs
But I'm nicest when I'm clappin' at my enemies neck's
Will you save us from the cold tide
And I don't think you care to doubt it
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
I am not worth this
There's nothing worse than bitterness
There are evil voices in my head
Shoulda known what ya missed at home
And I don't know what the fuck to do
By a man in a bulletproof vest
Titianium, criminal minded, swift
She wants to break free from eve
I feel all right, uptight
I don't do this for my health, I do it so I feel like hell
Crazy Town rocks so hard, you'll go berserk
Cause, if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine
They tend to regret ever sendin' me threats
Sometimes fun others run their mouth or away
Real good, feel good, don't got no more brains
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
I'm not feeling too nice today
How many, many times the worm had turned
I would be faking, I didn't know
Boardwalks and breaking waves
Yank crime
I am left in the night, trembling with fear,
And when the runway rovers
I don't know how
She's probably not the easiest one to live with either
So I've made music that made my mum cry
They say most of your brain shuts down in cryosleep
And I feel crazy
Odd Future Wolf Gang, came together cause, we ain't have nobody else
Walkin' slow, there go the po', now here we go
It's every players favourite crime, to make you feel
And he sat down and watched me take off down the road
To be my friend
You wanna get turned
The air is full of harmonies but is anyone even sleeping right
We teach the kids, you rather have a bullet or a word to your wig
While these streets, got me to prayin' to stay out of hell c'mon
I wrapped it up and send it
It peels the flesh
And a oneway ticket to nowhere, Baby
I'll show you no love
I wept my compassion away,
God puppet beats a drum
Hollywood ass rappers
No, we don't sleep
What you think is love is truly not
Red orange furnace sphere notches down
I have cleansed my life now of the people who pry
Nice fuckin' accents
Tha same devil that run around Managua with a sword
I want to get off one time and not apologize 
The empty space between me and the sunken walls
Woke me up and shook me out of mine iniquity
It just ain't enough to leave my happy home
Won't make you die
They don't care if you cry
So why do I feel desperate now
Stand for what the fuck you believe in, and don't let nobody tell you can't do what the fuck you want
'Cause it's die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Holding on at the end of the noose
And everything I've hoped to be or ever thought I was
In these days with no love to give
In this chess game of language,
Would you sit on the fence, take no chance
We're only making plans for Nigel
'Cause your punk ass made it up your fuckin' mind was gone
Down on their knees at the half court line
All those hours of wasted time have never crossed my mind
He knew that we'd come BUT *gun shot*
Hopeless fight
Where every single thing hurts
Did I do you wrong Was just teasin'
Only if you wanted to
This time you're gonna feel it
Well, he doesn't want to look back
My mouth has sprung wide open
No razor blades but you can get knife
The feeling is so that I'm sick and I'm breaking up
Have you ever been kicked to the curb
Ain't got time to make no apology
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous
In synopsis this is my minority report
And I know what little I've known of peace
What are we gonna talk about I don't know
I am stabbed by grace and slinging blood
Then we moved
Open it up, the stink of your sin
Come on it's not a sin 
Want to feel something of value
It left me caught between
Make you even sicker 'til you're slipping away
They'll hang the bullies and the louts that dampen down the day
The crowd drew the blood
If everything you said to me was a lie then
I burned all of my porno 'cause you were PMSing
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Take yo money like a Bitch
Hah hah hah hello hello hello hello
And for the wars they wage
I'm calling you back
I believe in a changing of the guard
If you die, tell 'em that you played my game
You've become the enemy
Oh God I'm a sinner and I think I wanna sing along
Puts the knife away after reattaching the ear
'Cause there is nothing wrong
The warrior with the deadliest weapon is the one without an instruction manual for his gun
This feeling haunts me
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
Why must I repeat myself
So I update this almost every single day for you
Did you sing "Oh happy day"
Give me strength allknowing one
I got so fucked up
Not until you've listen to Rakim on a rocky mountain top
That it's no sacrifice, because the price is paid
Is death the only way to get attention
All my subjects would dance and sing
I wonder how it got to be You lied
Eighteen deep when the plane soar
They say a day of rest
Your voice sounds like money and your face is cute
You fuckin' bureaucrats
I'd like to go back to the way that things were before
I'm breaking the limit inside you
I'm a God with spoon and syringe This is where the pain ascends
She's running out the door
You can try to stop it, but it"
I just wanna change
Don't call me boy, don't call me, I've just had enough now
Tell me what it's like when you know it all
Know as an outsider, recognized as a lone wolf
You're stumbling in the darkness
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
They break like waves of hunger and desire upon these eroded shores
Und die Liebe führt uns ans Licht
Em ain't no reason for us to be fighting like ooh
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
And then you said to me that I was cold and stern
As if you could not suffocate
Telling evils of the reefer, but all through time we've smoked the sky
We talk the same
Thy compassion shall be free
'Cause I'm gonna cry
I jumped on a bus
Until the next breaks up
But I can't buy it, it's just too hard to stand beside it
And all that glitters isn't gold when inside it's dead
Now fuck wit me
It's not what it seems 
Because she thought I was Jewish
Step up 'cause you're the next one in line for the kill
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I bust another cap in his ass and he died, time is 
But today's a confrontation with a thought that's not assured
But that's just it baby, I'm not affected by you baby
So I wander and I wander
Shitfaced, and pissy pants,
Swallow all my pain
He don't believe my speech
And, uh, the person that gave a fuck was me
Same routine, nothing new
Because you're not the one but you're the only one
But I ain't fightin' behind no goddamn oil
I just put my monies in the hands of the same people that left my people stranded
You'd never understand
Every lie you've ever told
He loved bluegrass oh, brother when I said Shania he sneered
Homemade 'tached memories
Terrified, blind, and wait to die, 
And I can't imagine why you wouldn't welcome any change, my friend
Your thirdclass communication,
Wasn't it me you didn't want
I'm upset 'cause I betrayed everything that you gave
Hate is running through my veins
But I am a queen, understand
The vapors caught fire up in your mind
To believe him that is why
I'm using bogon and I'll take on all comers
Is she a ride or die bitch
We wait, but nothin's comin'
You'll never find a place that you can call your own now
Nothing really matters
Laugh so loud that the whole damn restaurant
Für die, die mit ihr die Welt regieren
Can we talk to make it right
Hush my baby I'll make you bleed
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind
I'm bleeding to death, everything's fine
They think they got the answers, but there's something that they missed,
Totally fucked, five minutes later
I can't remember worse times
It is not something you could purposely do
They're oh so flattering and so sincere
You're in a fucking coma
I see Orion and say nothing the only thing I can think of saying
In every city, memories would whisper,
The flame still burns
He's a fucking drag, But if you don't then you watch him go
While crossword people look for clues
Fuck all your opinions, I'm tyin' 'em with a shoestring
And I'll jump off with a rope that's wrapped around your head
And you know this when you work
A lake of fire lookin' looking like a long trip
Takes a nation of sellouts to keep us back
If I soak my hands in others blood, Am I sick
The kind of murder where nobody dies
I'ma choke who I wanna choke fuck that
I'm gonna flashback
I am the girl who sold her body to the dark 
Everywhere I go I see your face
I was cursed by a talking snake
With nosacrifice
Why you always waste my time, I don't know
You tried to make it all stop
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Understand it be flavor
Secluded from the whore
Nobody knows but it always shows
Believin' the lies
Gotta get drunk before my mom wakes up
I have every right to feel the way I've been feeling shut up  I don't want to hear anymore of your dirty excuses
Now I just wanna make good on all the promises I have made
Ich möchte am liebsten tot sein und von allem nichts mehr sehen
Crazy with power, blinded by vision
We will not spiral down
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
This is a hell on earth, we are meant to serve
Le nottile bottele stelle com'erano belle
But she will never inspire a plan to save herself
Is your wife, when ya look, oh, you ain't there
I never thought that you would go
Where words go to die
So I made you lie 
We have to shout above the din of our Rice Krispies
I'mma eat a gun
But I don't suppose you'd understand
And it's killing you, killing you
Screaming bloody mary until my mirror breaks
Part IV Rock 'n' Roll Girlfriend
I give a damn about the damage to the body from botox
Quello che ti insegna e non ti farà capire niente
They've gotta stop to laugh,
But I can't remember when
And a broken heart will turn to sin
'Cause there's women running past you now and you just drag your feet
Meanwhile in his hood, his niggaz is suiting up and Timbed, looted up
Ici y'a pas de fake y'a pas de faux y'a qui ont est
I will not suffer this loss
Fightin' in the age old battle we've sometimes won before
Oh no no no no no
Lock up your doubt
Inside the passing lane
I'm in the motherfucking tractor from out the garage
The Special Ed kid at lunchtime the bitches wouldn't stand around with
I've got a boyfriend, I've got a feeling that he's seeing someone else
Oh burning fire
Noriega had back
Revolution come and die
Can you feel it inside yourself
I haven't met another you since you were with me
Oh don't you know I'm sorry for my views
Like nothing that you've ever seen
They sell the tickets wit'cha name up in lights an' shit
This doll has turned to crap
We hope and we pray everyday it works out
Hit you in the stomach now you're feelin' what love does
Matt big ass, big ass nigga with some small ass earrings, bald
I can't believe
I've seen so many faces, and always left my mark
Scratching my nuts right at god
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
You can hear the devil laughing
I know you lied
'Cause it's all you ever wanted
Go find a man to fit my shoes
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
Because I'm not yours
The power of their source
He didn't see me watching from the aeroplane
Throw away the darkness, I wanna see you shining
Meet all of my friends in the alley tonight
You got your game, made your shot
Been rooted in a slopin', quickly given golden sand
I'll punch the tree bark
Even if you sell a million, you'll get burned
Innocence so suffocating
I am numb, I'm everything you want
And all I wanted was a little patch of green
I'm perfectly content with being crazy Hell yeah
And deepest black
So wake up, nothing can stop us
You know You know
I spray terms like throwups, I'm 'bout to spit a feelin'
Know
And I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face, oh 
So Bill just chops 'em down, watch 'em fall
Did we stop you
You know, the man just upped my rent last night
So you stagger back home, and wait for nothing
tritt diese Verfassung außer Kraft
Oh yeah, a message left on the forehead of God
It bleeds horizontal straight from your wrists
RJD drop that shit so I can drop my thoughts
You make me sick
Lookin' through the crack between the blanket and the wall
It was sweet like lead paint is sweet but the aftereffects left me paralyzed
I am just giving up and shutting down
The sun has come to wash your pain away
I murder everything I touch, buddy, move back
Ghostface Killa
rahassa ja lahjoissa on tosi kiva kylpee
But why am I still losin' I can't take the pain
Bitch, bitch, bitch
You pretend it's the end
We drink until we stupid and the party is ending
In the end, makes you better, Yeah
You're miles and miles and miles away
Now that I made it through
Ma quante notti al caldo stretti, stretti
They're gonna burn like hell tonight
Sometimes things don't work out
Textbook fucking mental
And I am frozen with joy right where I stand
Up against your flesh
Paperface
There's too much fear in the way she sees life
And got hit wit bullshit
'Cause of who you were affiliated with, and all that bullshit
I turn my head and look away
Feeling like a knife's being twisted in the hole of how it is
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
Drink your beer, take your drugs
Did I fall off Got you in your room
Big fucking ditches in the middle of the road
And a life that's full of crap, and a finger filled with hate
When the evil seeds were sown
Those most deserving will end up with the most
A ritual to mend my angry heart,
I didn't notice
Back on the street now, now, now, now
You talk to me like I am something more
Baby fire baby fire baby FIRE
I know you'll pay for what you've taken, tenfold
I'm thinking your the one to know
Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed
So tell em' I said fuck you
When the prompter dies I'm
As if the heart beat wasn't enough
The lights they tell me I should stop but you say,
Each day when I wake up and I set my best foot forward
And roll over in your sleep
That's some Camu shit
No more having sex
A fist to the voice
The last laugh's not on on me
I don't have all the answers
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
It's such a shame to ruin this bright
I know my heart will break the day
Into their teeth
Erase yank crime
In my Stacy Adam gators, where's that mothafuckin' stapler
Go to sleep
Rival gangsters sit down to plan an afterschool program
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
To make these memories quit
I make em' jump and mosh oh my gosh
You hit me, kick me, tell me you're what I should be 
Slackerbitch, fag hag, whore
Look at you now
I need you more than ever now that I've come so far
Why should I watch Matt Damon cry without her at my side
Only the rush hour hell to face
Drunk off blood from dead cops and
Searing pain, expose your flesh
This is a call to arms, to conquer, now to war
I thought maybe we'd made a pact,
It's your world, do with it what you want
You don't know shit, you're a fucking therapist
Don't hold your breath for the turnaround 
My life had barely started since you jumped all my heart
She likes the dark
Ooh, a dark creep lover
Well the beat that my heart skipped sounded like this
You'll never find your pleasure if you worry about your pain,
Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard 
My white girlfriend won't suck my dick jus 'cause it's pink
I'm not Jesus, I will not forgive
Hail Mary full of grace smack the bitch in the face;
I'm unchained
They know it all, that's what they want you to think,
'Cause power's just another one of those things, baby
And into a stranger's bed
Now label this my fuckin' trick shot
I wanna new body that's strong
Yeah see you coming in your entrance is not clear you should try moving corret and touch the whole atmosphere
It's an obituary
vendicare
I know everything, I know everything about you
The receiving end, I've never been
Like the rivets in my skin
But you should've left the light on
I'm locked in the throne, whether you like it or not
The fucking brat
Nothing that you do or say can change the way I feel about it
You know what drives me
When DA in back of us, I'm stretched out nervous
I don't believe her 'cause I just got the news on the wire
I'm talkin' about the ones who don't get chained to the rock
It's the heart you used to have when it died
Take a shot from every angle
Are you talking to me
Uncle, you spared not your children
Cause it gives 'em a hint not to step in my path
So let's go before I change my mind
That forest burned A halo
In my darkest hour of need
That beacon falls from your eyes
Therefore we black out together
And I don't wanna deal with your mistakes
I didn't want this
Give me some more whiskey not that Colenmorangie
'Cause free labor is the cornerstone of US economics
I want to be pretty
You know you're alright, alright
Who would of known
I will never tell a lie, no, no
This one's a cash fiend taking your money
There's a look on your face I would like to knock out
Now the damned have no time to make amends
About ancestral innocense
But not another reason enough to continue
You decide if you still want to play this game
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
What will people know
Rather swim in some fuckin' hot tar
To eat shit out a can like a worm
The blood of Christ was shed to save your soul
A drop of blood to let them in
Passed the point of delirium
Not running down an empty hole
And if I fall, you are not the one that has to cope and deal
Food and drink and handshake drugs
On my hotel t v, fucking on my t v, fucking on my t v, on my hotel t v, private hotel t v
And if you tell me fiction, you will never get me back
I don't want anything from you
That you just can't trace
With one hand over the mouth, still managing to shout
If I'm gonna drive, girl it's gonna be one hell of a ride
But you might be the one who's lost my mind
So I'm going back to New Jersey, I do believe they've had enough of me
And then I'll laugh like a motherfucker
And you're too busy with the lies they sold you
Time to spend
Your mother sucks cocks in hell
In arm's reach of the black remote
U want the dog I'll let him out
Afterwards I hate them and their lies
Promises I made to you went down the sink
I'm sorry for you I'm sorry for you
You choose to live on your knees, I'd rather die on my feet
Way too detached to fight the waves
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see stars
In the end almost nothing changed
Stand up I'll let you live a little bit with the pain that I bring
This game
My life is their disease
True green lie in botany,
You promised me another lie
Start a riot in this Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I need some pleasin' so help me I'm wheezin'
A new discussion of an ageold question
'Cause it was etched in tears
You've got a lot of nerve to come back here
Wake up feeling like a Messiah
ObviouslyWell I know it was you
'Cause I can't believe the state I'm in
You know you love this ass
My teeth bit my mouth oh like sexy housin
If it's not the rule then it's always the case
Instead of sinking in the bay 
Afraid that I'll never squeeze enough
Problems, you've been going off for no reason and we're afraid you're gonna 
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em
And I promise you it'll end someday, I hope
Don't know what you're expecting of me
These heads do turn
I don't ever want to
Coughing till there's pains in my fucking abdomen
Now don't you sell me no future, yeah
 I'm innocent,
There's a white horse running wild through the switchcane
Secret power fueled by hate hate
Do you feel good
All I want is you
Shout loud in the crowd "Watch them beat us all down"
I'll live until I'm fucking killed
We spray pain on the walls
I'm not no crocodile
All these rock stars should've been killed, man Every single goddamn one of them Right after Jon Lennon died, we should've gotten the Partridge Family bus and driven around and killed them all one by one, you know Elvis Presley should have been shot in the head back in  Somebody should've walked up behind Elvis in ' with a  magnum, put the barrel of the gun right up to his brainstem and just pulled the trigger so you can remember Elvis in a nice way, eh Wouldn't it be nice to remember Elvis thin, with a big head of hair Maybe that gold lamé suit Wouldn't that be nice, eh Because how do you remember Elvis You know how you remember Elvis He was found in the toilet with his pants around his ankles and his big fat hairy sweaty King of Rock and Roll ass exposed to the world, and his final piece of kingly evidence floating in the toilet behind him Ugh Creepy One of his aides had to walk in and go, "Dang, Elvis is dead I'd better flush the toilet flush Oh, man I should've saved that I coulda made some money off that Dang, man A ding dang doo"
I want you to say that you understand 
Where tribes of wanton peacocks strut
Still I'm sittin' skits and laughin' while they all missin' this
I wanna punch you in the face
Whatevers possible becomes impossible
How white you fucking are and how you can fight for your race
So don't bother, I won't die 
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck *Clucking*
Only feelin' in this world is the life within you
Gossip gossip, nigga just stop it
I thought we were decent
Walked up to a whore
Your girl wanna blow me and don't even know me
Yeah I know that no one is
I don't think I'll be your lifelong friend
Und er fragte  was ist gefährlicher, rassistische Polizisten oder Saharasand
I'm not letting you check out
It sucks to lose
Fakers must fade, the stakes are now raised
There must be black unity, there must be black unity
Where I stand
Your bigtalkin' man friend came round to my home,
Can you face me
Does she treat me like a snowman
Rudi Rudi Rudi Rudi gonna fail
 And you're gonna know how fine you are
But not today
Breathing's a tug of war
The innocent will pay
No life, No mind, Nothing left inside
I'm so sadistic
You call me a whore, but you always come back for more
So eager to walk plans
Yeah I see you acting all conscious gettin' passionate in rap songs
Oh, why you don't care no more
See your knowitall face on TV
It's poisonous it muscles it aches
To taste of immaculate sin
Where do I put this fire
Master horned head turns to see what's on the bottom of his hoof
You can surrender or savor the scent of your old victories 
We're on a bullet
That deals with AIDS and race and gays and
And try to believe
You feel the jolt
Welcome to a state where the politics of hate
Do you feel the way I do
I am not an angry girl
Not your type, not your type, not your type 
Drive a million miles down the PCH
Er war zwar etwas komisch
And watch the devil start kickin
And he trying not to eat you
The dirt and ugly from the stain that they try to hide
Self mutilation is the only thing I know
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now
Wake from the grip of the tongue
I can feel it
There is none
You're nothing to me
Time to sing 
And hoes can't roll on
And When you are free from the work of the towns
So I wanted to impress
And this is not all that I am
But what the fuck was I supposed to do
I can't help it if I'm lucky
Abulic disciple
I don't give a damn about my reputation
Lets go kill 'em
Uh, as we pick up where the last Mathers left off
I'll write my masterpiece some other day
An heavy sleeping beast
My wives and I were all choked up
Who decorates the scarf with the fugi knot 
Am I evil enough
And You are a liar You are a liar
In my dirty lungs
T'es à l'usine ici, les rimes ça sort au cost guy
Take me back to the beginning
Before I die
Which has my name on the cover, along with my face
Y'all niggas wanna bang who
But there's no crashing until I see this through
Well, I am hell a miracle overloading
Nice entourage lock mints wonder bras
Just watch out what you say
Beach front punks, they insist I'm the raddest
The live it, you fuckin' gimmick
But then it hits you, then it kicks you
The lie, want to know, has it met
Fear I see in the back of your mind,
Then she turned off the headlights
Still in love wit niggas who was serving some hard times
Sie war kaum zu überseh'n doch ich wollte nicht versteh'n
And every time I tell that lie, I live without guilt
Bitch play the skills
You'd think you'd get the fucking point
Never come back in a mighty fright
I'll have a devil in my infrared scope, WOY
You abused me in a way that I've never known 
And guns
But I think I've got the answer
I nod my broken head
Let them eat shit from our trembling hands
I'd build a boat to get to you or else I'd drink it dry
Daddy left when I was three
Into a life that no one should have to live
ThugLife see will never fail Out on bail  biatch
Plan your attack and I am still waiting
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying
Out my  slug and it ain't missin'
Couldn't pay me enough
This heart is a joke, & my life has been choked,
You wanna get boned
She polished all upon the wall
Wealth and power crashing through
You're the one with all the pride
Lemme put you on game gunshot
With no place left to stand
Child, don't you know
And gold digger,
Check you attitudes those narrow views are bound to be the death of you
On the devil's wing
I let the fire rain down
That's why you, you wanna break my heart
With such an appetite for taste and grace
I rub my thumb across her palm
Cut down, left to rotten
We're not the ones who made the nuclear bombs
We may appear sidetracked by violence
Come and make me a part of your story She has a name an old word she has a name fantastic and utterly unknown, for it is old the first word strangled from the void was never spoke again Whether right is right or wrong, she'll turn you to the empty parts, she'll fill your belly with regrets, old manacles are faithful yet She wounds, she wounds, she has a name She is the beating drum that marks her by the bodies she collects She is always, she is ever, she is the scourge of kings and devourer of light, she is the lust to dine on flesh, oh she'll watch as you perform, for her you'll die to speak to her once more Give me a love that makes me real, hold down my breath for meanother lonely world to fall ingive me a love that makes me real, I would write it on my arms your misery's a gift, your plaguea comedy
I don't think it's likely you're just made from all the wrong stuff
Fools, you fools, you fools, you fools
By that confession I've made
Frustrated self hatred my hands turn to fists
It's like a fight to the top
When she knocked upon my door
Don't even recognise my own face sometimes
The whole world seems a little bit brighter, brighter
Don't take the fall 
Disturb So you want inside of me
So bad to hate somebody else
Maybe you'll come back 'cause you want me, maybe you won't
God knows  who controls the radios
And I don't think I can stop
Dyslexic critters talk backwards to rap words
When another girl violates that That's right
I don't wanna wait for you
It's fucking righteous baby
Ignorance is bliss, didn't have a shoe
I saw the sourceless anger eating at him from inside
My niggas real in this Bitch
Tonight, rat poison for dinner 
I didn't come here to be damned with faint praise
Let's move from this underground,
Back breakers Don't Come back here
Every single word you say
Everyone's screaming
African genocide
Wild like hell
A paranoia got the best of what I hold dear
But no matter what it's been, niggaz never got a win
I be illin, parental discretion is advised still
Make 'em hot and jumpy, trying to get that God money
I ask you how many fucking times
So you're the kind who deals with the games in the mind
You wanna fire my fuel
Whoa Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
If you're giving it up, you better spit that gum out
But there's a hell of a lot more to me
I told you from the start just how this would end
The Nina milli sixa, show ya how I don't give a fuck about you
You can't feel the flow because you died, facedown on a suicide
Now His skinless crucifixion feeds a winged diocese
I hate you so much
I hate the things you do;
You see the Wu W raised in black fists
I see a black man, see a coloured man in a cage,
They all thought the queen was charming
Never hear, never cry
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside
Fill your hole inside with dirt
I don't want to be broken
I'm so close to the fucking edge, I should be close to You
Conscience easing curiosity pleasing
The right to my silence in quiet discerning
I don't care no more
It was you and me hoe getting cnotes
We bring war to pacifists
And you got away with a lot, but I'm not
Everyone knows about it
They think they crazy but they ain't crazy
In the back of the neck right between the eyes" 
So why do I feel so desperate now
Whoa I wanna get connected
So close your eyes and remember all those lies 
Betcha didn't know, woohoo
If you never take the time you never know what you won't find
I speak in monotone
Now I have better things in mind
Bis die Meinung der Masse auf mich einbricht
Don't tell your friend
She was on fire last night
I tongue a socket
We all get mad
But know I'm laughing in your face
I stand against till the shit drops
With You I'm at home now
I just get so hot, you know
Fixing to die, fixing to die
Over little shit you do, pretty hittin in me
Don't stop talkin' to me please
I surrender, giving up all that is me
Like fifteen strangers dancing
I did not name the stakes
And lately the word is I live in a suburb and I don't fuck with birds
A never ending chase
So they're kicking out everyone
We end up dead in the end
And his best friends say man where you been
And it's fine, all those lies
You've been choked oppressed
I cannot breath
Flipped it back so I'm back in gang green
'Cause I've been talking to the people that you call your friends
That day will always be remembered
It's everything you had when it breaks
Fünf Uhr, Feierabend, zum Bus rennen, n'Abend Alter, n'Abend Alte,
It balls my fingers into fists
It takes you back to a better time and place,
Shout, shout
And in the end
I envy you your ignorance
It's not that we don't get along
I'm a bad ass BBoy, two triple O
io non vi posso credere
Here's to the "Rattatntat" of gun shots, and your life is shattered
Oh, we never talk about the past anymore
Made a million plus and still don't give a motherfuck
Caught up in the chaos of their minds
Coppers try to kill me
Ooh, you make me want to run away and hide
How blessing will set me free, yeah
And puts your name to shame
A rising sun loomin' over Los Angeles
He says we knocked his socks off
I've buried half my life in the same place you've soared
I cockblock wack shit, now get ready for Knock Madness
I just cannot explain why these girlies always hit me like an atrain
Immortal Technique, I made this the bump in your ride
Thousands of white men standing in a park,
We spun like birds on fire
Fuck school, I'm a fuck up Fuck Harvard
Are all mine
So stop wasting my time
We're not the ones who let the children starve in faraway lands
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
I hope you get all that you want
Get the business clothes off Take off Take off
To humans is it like staring at the sun, a blinding brightness that conceals a source of great power
I can't feel you there
You want it
Hey hey, now motherfather
I used to think cupid was an asshole
The wife, the bitch, the Rapunzel
I wake up and go to work, back aches and my shoulders hurt
The revolution wont have any distribution
They're pointing fingers and they're whispering discreetly
People like you just burn
Otherwise I might fall
You're not anything like them
Everything that swore it wouldn't change is different now 
You could have spared her, oh but no
That gets you home before the living end 
Please forgive me my cruel joke
I spit and scream "what's done is done
Heaven knows if they'll ever awake
If blood is what you want embrace the demon glow
Willing me to fail
Of what is causing all the trouble
When it's completed he moves on
Don't believe in you anymore
I'll shoot your useless brain out
And I don't need you to tell me how you feel
And now I've moved on by myself
I think I'm dying for another one
He might be fucking her right now
The Devil punched down to the monkeys
So go ahead and put your tears on ice baby
And holding back our tears
Go to sleep And I'll sing you a lullaby
Fading away, well you might say I'm losing focus
My body's not a football for you
And I don't know why
Then you fall down, down, down
False hope, an inch of pride that died when I left to hide from non stop
As you're driving down the street of gold Hey Pussy
You're bleeding repeat x
And now we're alright, we're all calm
There's no mission accomplished here
Tourniquets of velvet ropes, my fourfinger crucifix
Who fuck round with the trigger
No I am not a rich man
My whole world's falling down around me
They look like fucking machines
Work me like a slave while they laid back
I blow you a cold kiss
You put me in the clutches of sin 
But you come to me and you ask me out and I say okay now
Make up to break up *singing in background* niggaz need to wake up
I'm fuckin' radical, nigga
And I've learned a lot from all these break ups and make ups
My own space shuttle,
The transmission wippin' our backs
So get it understood boy I am from the hood boy came up from the dirt selfmade hustler I'm a beast I'm a beast
I have to take advantage, before the moment passes by
She was college edjamacated but got fired up at the law office
No sleeping pills no old tattoos
You picked him up but he's a total stranger
A slip of the hip or another
You're goddamn immature
I'm a Thrasher you ain't know Thrasher
The All Stars amped out bender got corrupt
When whack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage
In this little booth where the truth has no place to stand
You can't help me till the sunrise lifts up
Till it's cold and dry and no longer bleeds
Steal my game, go on, take everything
Disturbia, disturbia, disturbia
And I'm only fucking human yo, what am I supposed to do
But I could kill you instead
Gonna get her wig knocked way back
Well put the pistol to your head and empty the clip, pop nigga
Broken heartbeats become breakbeats for niggas to rhyme on top, but
And the feeling coming from my bones
And I won't cry
Give me back
This is fucking loveless
They say you're nobody till somebody kills you
You dare not ignore the things I say
You keep on tryin' to hide it but we both knowow
Hey Got some static for some niggaz on the other side of town
I like to run in the sand like a horse
I think your head's fucked
You've done enough for me to hate you
Don't know what to feel
Muthafuckas will war but not many survive
It's run in the family
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
I know you don't know if you
They wanna make you hot, no doubt
Only the dead have seen the end of this war
You always remember your first
They won't break me
Does the man who makes the shoes own you, clown
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
It's not funny 'cause when you think you're on the atip you slip
I hurt where I can't feel, I feel where I can't hurt
See my blood  and see my gun
I think my mind just goes outta control
No no no
You've been helping yourself this whole time
Scraped knees don't prove what you believe
I know I don't have the right to bug you with how this feels, its just the hardest thing I've been through, nothings ever felt so real
And there's so little of you left 
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I'm perfectly content with being crazy
You'd fight and you were right
And unscreams the scream from the first initial cut
Go see the rain forests
Only made me
It's not enough, it's not enough, and more can never be enough
I'll end the world tonight
And greed, all it's hate, all it's pain, so
Murder Inc is my blood
Then walk a mile in the skin
Pain not penance, forget martyrs, remember victims
I run in circles but I won't crack
Tears will come and I will end
'Cause the ocean, she never sleeps
And this is how Mary's garden grows, this is how Mary has her ghosts
I hate you
You said, "There's no one watching over me, over you; it's always out of reach"
The police force was elsewhere,
While the edges slowly Fray
The day's reality around the bend 
Don't want to leave
Of a dark Scottish lake
You want to breathe
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Tapped two of them on the neck so I could meet their eyes direct
Sapphires You make bracelets
As I'm watching your decay
Silence, no communication
No spare time no sanity
You want a zoom zoom
Break this take control
The world's got no end and got no beginning
Everybody loves to knock down straw men
I wish nothing but
Are the kind that must be stopped  before their kind take all we've got 
I get so choked up anyway
My life will kill me
See it's simplesimple, it's not that I want to make it rippleripple
Rende inutili Io non ci sono, adesso
I remember you
Wishing I had not been born
As if it happening wasn't enough
You better keep your distance
Pantsed at the wind for a joke
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
No CNN or media now
J'ai entendu dire en bas
I love you, I hate you, I love you, I hate you
The messenger of love
Drive my car, with my jewels, now you're holdin' my wife
Yeah now you're right here
Blown stack what's coming back Jack, we'll turn back
Look me in the face
But nothing seems right to you
Less the talking bout mines is mine and become one mind
I never saw my friend alive again"
This is madness
I can't get enough of you
Well he might have been the richest now fear is in his eyes
The perfect crime, crime of the heart
Enough to stay wide awake
There's nothing here but the shadow, and now you know
Cuntured up by the bubbling stinch of unwash bodies and unsanitary quarters
I got a trunk full of funk like the Groovy Doolies
I fall down just to give you a thrill
As you're driving down the street of gold
Kept screaming out my name
A hiccup in paradise
Every single night I play your music right at bedtime
Millions of cowards
No difference between my hate and your love
If I won't face your grave
Where's the drugs 
Shake your hands Like they're full of disaster
I've come to bring you hell
If it wasn't for death, I know I'd never feel this alive
You did nothing I see
And the flames burned away
I don't believe your dream even exists
Or a box for a smoke
They clench the fist of ordained might
Across the tin huts as children sleep
If seein' is believin', then there's more to live fo'
The truth scares the shit out of me
And yet you know that really I'm sorry for you
And all this tension we ignore
She figures that's better than nothing to show for the years of tears and sweat
I see no sense in doing this
We americans don't read
To live and die
I hate everything I fucking hate it all
To make you all believe
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem you stayin wit me
I'm just afraid of losing and I am afraid of DYING
Come and join the mass debate
I once believed
The swarm of locusts
Enough by now
So can you get the jist, imma make a move 'cause the game is over
I need noise
And doesn't she know that she is doing it all wrong
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Life's not meant to be expendable
In the tall grass where
If you lie you don't deserve to have them
I raise my game as the stakes stack higher, higher
Oh, it'll be perfectrunning scared
I wish I could turn back the hands of time
The sores are my own, I know
I think it would take away the pain 
Treat the bitch to fuckin' good, my opinion
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
Fear, To find myself again, my walls are closing in
You have the same passion I have
Oh how I want you to know me
I know I can't help it
Have you ever loved something that never seemed to have a face at all
Spend some time in bliss
WHAT You are not your own Everybody listen got to tell you something
Here's your trophy on my face, it's just an eye anyway
The battles started are far from over
No, no no
Does she make you shiver under your skin
You'll get a bullet in the back of the neck, Millions of men with blank faces 
Don't you mess with me
Won't even bother now to tell me why
Fight now
I wanna see it come down
Little to big o' brother, you leave me like blood from my veins
People spreading rumors, they ain't saying shit for real
We are the people that you hate
O, baby, I want ya
My life had barely started since you jumped all on my heart
And I sing my sad songs
And for the last four years of my life I've thought about you pretty much
So cry if you feel
I saw priest kill a cop on the TV
Your bed's been made
With too much patience and too much pain
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
In spite of all my good intents
Big black steel cap dealt rejection
I'm leaning over backwards
'Cause you're all whores and I'm a fag
Heaven help me, my head's spinnin' round
Now a nigga's selling millions, now it's time to celebrate
And I said I wanna fill you up, I wanna break you, I wanna give you up
Though he couldn't move
My mind can't shake one sound
Like a man, like a man, like a woman like a man, like a man
Do you think that you believe in yours more than they do theirs somehow
I crept on bounded knees
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
Duckets out the window ends on the street
Fills up the air with his pride and praise
I did not believe
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me
Yeah, when you fall for the garbage man
I wanna give the violet more violence
I left my arm in my coat
The part that you've been playing has me dazed and missing you
While it can seem so hard now
Cause "The Nigga Ya Love to hate" still can "Kill at Will"
And have to go to war with FAKE niggaz standin alone
In the madness that calls 'Now'
All that time, it cannot be,; Easy said, it cannot be
And I do know what's good for me
I won't back down
You've got to know you'll burn in hell for all the lies you've told
Decimate your paradise
The dirty old man from the trailer park
In the field Cotton you yield Your skin peels off your back
The stop lights were interminable, but I get along all right
Can't you see I'm not listening
Just not built for
That only half of a girl
See myself disintegrate
"I never saw my friend alive again
I've been watching in bars
Turn, turn the radio low
Taking the makeup off my face
Yeah, he got some skills but every time he put them eyes in it look like he popped some pills
Who them niggaz that you love to get us
Down where the crickets learn to sing and play
And I don't think you care to know
We all just race around, whoa
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson
That he was painting but it was obvious in all the photos
Just gives rise to hostile trends
To defend the flag hanging limp and bloody above the village church
Okay what's the matter
And you stayed, what made you fall for him
BURNNN it to the ground
I never thought how was I to know
I love to smoke crack
To grant us they are loathe free meat and drink and cloth
They fucked the operation
Both sides are losing now
Then he jumps up and shouts gun control
So I can raise a black family with a true devils
Kill, kill, killx
For all the ones who've left
He drinks my beer and plays guitar
He'd be just another bush surrounded by a couple orchids
So your dirty guilty braids
The fear I see when I look in your eyes,
M's and them 's came out of nowhere like your kid's wet dream
Cry your tears, pussy
Cats hatin', 'cause they know I finga girls twats
That she wasn't, cause all that mess was making me hot
What would you die for
Shelters body from cold reigns of reality
I don't think that I can stop
Without concrete belief, you step up to the edge and follow
It's alright if it makes you feel better
Every little bit
Closing comments made you wonder
From what I've seen, I hate humanity
'Cause your God is just losing his touch
You don't know shit, about a dead man's perspective
And what if there are no damsels in distress
I'mma need to see your fucking hand
'Cause I'ma nigga  life, so I'ma motherfuckin nigga till I dizie
You're the ones we hate
Certain things I love, Spend my time
Peddlin' contemporaries killin' me loudly
My pretty life depended on it
You are mine, you are mine, you are mine
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
I don't know who you're talking to with such fucking disrespect
And I hope you die alone
They take great pride in working,
Like a kick in the bag
Don't treat me like a god
You want to share what you've been through
You watch them
Matthew and Stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you have till it's gone
That I'm not going down, I'm not going down I'm not going down
Would you walk me home then, everyday from work
You don't expect me to put up a fight
And left us naked out here in the sun
Homie you know me
I thought of someone I could save 
I've got a thoughtless mind
Not to say what you don't want to hear
All my doubt 
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
A whack rapper is what Hopsin isn't I kick it
There's no fuckin' way That I'm gonna fix you
Wo ist denn die Anleitung zum Kindesgebrauch
And our dreams become fake reality
I'm thinkin' of no one in my mind
Hoeveel vriendjes je wel had
Naega bwado nae jasini meongcheonghyeo
Do you know what we're fighting for
You gotta look at reality, understand that shit so you don't get caught
Everyone makes one mistake
Fix her hair and hide heir veins
I could not convince or trust you
And if you should confess to the crime
Not knowing when
Truth, tell me the truth, the truth motherfucker
The world you perceive to be so normal
Listen, Ih know it must sound absurd
Well in a back room in Harehills, I got my souvenir
Did he stop No, he had a couple seats
Spit out and sucked back in, the reason's getting thin
You love this ass, in the jacuzzi
The face of the Mother Culture is sickening
Cut up bleeding beaten cheated
And when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors to murder the medium that shot 'em  years before they said
Life's miseries pain is deep
Find your faith in your security
But maybe I'd be better off if I just answer quickly
Tranquilized like an animal
That I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna let you
Ich möchte so besoffen sein, dass ich alles nicht mehr seh
And nobody cares about your paranoid trip
In these days see the people run
I hope he's with your mother,
Treat the record label like a slut, then rape that bitch
We stay stuck in the maternal gaze suckling the demons breast
I used to want some explanation
There was no trusting you with my foolish heart
I'd really love to shout
I think I'll take this hate and
When we hit you with the lick you'll see the wickedist
mut vielä mä nousen ja maailmalle nauran
Was früher die Gestapo war
Oh, baby you're killin me
The philanthropic minds to speak up now
The Black Panther is the black answer for real
But take your money and your soul
So take your sorry ass
'Cause I'm tired of you stressin me Tired of you stressin me
What's another word for desperate
Go fuck yourself you ain't one we can trust,
Six feet in the ground is where the living begins
But it's just the empire of a new master race
I want to dance free till I fly 
I ain't talkin' shit nigga
The world lies in the hands of evil
Oh I wanna get connected
God cannot change
To end this obsession
I don't give a fuck about your dignity
I'm not an animal
We wanna be somebodies
You know that I know that we're infected
Sie war geil diese Zeit wir waren zu allem bereit
'Cause a nigga like me is goin' insane
You niggas is featherweight, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
You're breaking off like something's in the way
Your blind faith passed to your seeds,
Remember how you gave me shit
I got a rock and roll girlfriend
Caught 'em in the 'gaitor shoes his girl probably bought 'em
 "Through by a barrel of gun"
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
His bitter seed
I've seen the scars
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Er war vom Whisky bald verroht 
Roamin through the forest as the hardest lyrical artist
That's how these niggas so onetrack minded
So what the hell is different
You catch me 'cause I'm falling down on you
Just to let you know that I hate your guts
I promise you it'll be more than hard to ignore the gore
I've watched you smile as the students bow to kiss your feet
To curious strangers who throw dollars at my feet
Yeah I thought this was it,
They break your skin when you're a kid
On the back of photographs
Lights touched my eyes and petrified my tears
You spend every moment of your waking life bitching about
Kalashnikov machine gun flow that I fire
When I'm dead I'll rest, I'll rest
I gotta go and write a song just to remind myself how bad it sucked
Can't wait till I fuckin' buy me a jet, there gon' be some hoes on it
I am cold and distant
They always want to take a bite
It's not yours  fuck you
Think it's time you shut up
I've moved on you know, I'm happy now, well, happy in a crying sorta way
I'm using too many covers
Last whispers come bleeding from lips
It's nothing to you
You're putting poison here
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
Suffer not But extend your hand
Talking 'bout TV, please shut up
When I'm the nigga sold  mil out the gate and numbers do not lie
Ain't nobody fucking with me, man
The paramedics walk backwards, like an Irish dance
Just wanna lie
I got a bad feeling about this in you
I'll sacrifice what I believe
Does anybody remember back when you were very young
I'm grinning at the breaking
She's comatose dead on 'er feet victim of sin
I've seen their righteousness mixed without loving compassion
But you ban computer games
I'm only treading ground I don't wanna know
Unless this kills us all
Neonazism never can be the sollution of the matter
Is this true have ya really seen tha holy ghost
Don't startmeup, 'cause I'm not the Rolling Stones
Couple of portraits then ignored 'em
Let them break their hold over me
I hope we live to shout the tale shout
From the  to the fear of breaking down
And the blood pours up him, rather than down him
Right down towards the residence
I know you're in love
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
Is why the world has to have so much pain
Thousands of bodies in the ground
Do you give a god damn
'Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
Not enough to feed the hungry 
Why'd ya do it, she said, when you know it makes me sore
Break 'em all, pull over and jump out
War is money, war is power,
By the way, I got sixty fucking Wolves that'll guard me
You know you try to categorise me
You may not feel me bawling out
Can't seem to break away
We work like perfect puzzle pieces
Remember when we used to sing
Every once in a while there is some asshole
He smells the future on the lawn
Your screams were made silent
Ramadan, orange alert
When no one knows your name
Shh Who the fuck is that staring in my window
With the giblick, then I passed around back to B BReal again
I know who I am
And dedicated to the people advancing the game
And what do your hissy fits teach you except how to cry, pussy, cry 
The long walk home, an hour and a half
No, thank you, no
My god it's slipping away
Say lick my thirst
Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin'
But now
And if we seem to rough it up a bit
Like the songs your roommate sings
'Cause the killing fields are bleeding
I can't believe this violence in mind
Don't you Know
Savage her sexless and burn out her eyes
With this hungry girl
Total hate Total hate Total hate Total hate Total hate
It feels like I'm dying
Losing sleep wasting time killing myself till the day I die
I have become a superbitch
Takes the snail he stepped on, back from its creator
Your lips taste of poison
Round to back
Pour the poison in my ear
But I am not a maiden fair
Life sucks  I'm over it
All in search of our personal gods
Say to the Lord, "I'll die for music", but there's never sound
Constantly noble, constant noble, portrait of persona,
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
I'm sick and tired of the smile that you give
 j'suis la perdu dans c'putain d'merdier J'ai été condamné pour outrage, putain de procureur m'a allumé 
This is how a heart breaks
I thought that you would keep your word
The road is turning for you
You better run like I'm booger flicking
Don't tell me that, you're on drugs
You wanna what You must be bugging
You wanna come and rob the cradle
His heart is sick
PC she speaks impotent, sterile, naïve, blind, atheist, sadist, stiffupper lip, first principle of her silence, of her silence 
This same old graveyard
We're sinking
If I may paraphrase the government notice reads
And you were the mother earth
And they come and they call and they fall on the floor
And come back to haunt you in your time of need to say
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Ice cube ain't a lick nope make me bleed
Tellin' them you died in the line of duty
Alright, motherfuckers It's time to go old school
I'll make you feel my heart's affect
You suck the light out of a room with merely a glance 
You never seemed to care the first time You never were my friend
Bass and treble heal every hurt
Come on man, you wanna be an activist be a real activist
With all these feelings inside
She was a thirst monster now she's gothic insane
Shot a nigga the fuck up
Arabe ou noir, ils aimeraient tous nous foutent dehors 
You've taken all my money
Not enough beer
Caused by how I used to feel
Fuck the club, instead of bitches I'd hang with a group of nuns
Against the fear, it feeds the fire
Who are you, so full of lies
And all her bones were haunted
Tell me a story, offer me a glass of milk
Thuglife niggaz Yes bitch that's a President
Pain you know you can't ignore
We invented the zero But we mean nothing to you
The first time always hurts you know
Until then old friend
And when you cry for help they don't hear
It's no fair
File out face first
Your fate and that of everyone you know depends on it
How do you like me now
I'm just stupid and I'm angry is it immature for me to say
At the end of it all lies of course the final phenomenon of deterioration
I don't know what it is,
Every fucking morning is the same bullshit
Nothing left to die for
To distract you from the damage that they do
See it in your eyes niggas ready to die
Blood Roses, blood roses
Bitch ass females
Their little arms around you
Come back rewind one time
Ripping through your life like a fucking hurricane
Even if he wanted to
Take a small mistake and make a small one bigger
The fluid acid end up being no good
Where is my shrink and my mind eraser
This is it now
And she says, "it's a copout and I know you know I know
Thats the last time I cry
My very soul has to bleed this time
And I don't want no more
And it's fucked up, but at the same time it just made me want you even worse
What you want to be
I gotta get this shit off my chest
This keeps repeating in my head
All my life I relied on one thing and that one thing fucked me up even more
Living on borrowed time, I'll die tomorrow
Those kids suck, yeah those kids suck
I know who can love my many selves
You must think I'm a fool
It won't work
Heavy, you want it heavy
All of your shit when I'm sober
Or should I go to sleep
All my pictures on display here
 torched orchids and citronella for algernon,
From the scales on your skin
Do you know what they say
I don't want to think
So I'll start a war
Do my dirty work, do my dirty work Oh
We sing the death song kids
She bit into my neck, snapped my necklace
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
But you will never get the feel 
If I died right now, you'd turn the fire on
All drunk
Believe me when I say
When I feel the there's something crawling out of me
One month of sucking it in
No more tears to dry
Well fuck you
They watch you fall
Phenphened to no end
Punks roll when I put in work
You moved me in a way that I've never known 
Entranced in noise 
So I don't have to use this gun
Never believed in luck a benefactor of the damned
But I think that you made it up, I think that your mind is gone
I would rather be miserable fo the rest of my life
I'm on my hands and knees
Take fame intravenously
Tell me straightfaced 
What have I got Four walls
Fire burn all our uncertainties
Out on Bail Hey, hand me some motherfuckin' Colt 's from the fridge nigga
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
You'll find devices to kill your master
Until I became an alien,
Followed by fault lines that cannot sit still
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it
Provide the lines that make your mind spend the time
Mass destruction is my function  time to put it to the test
They say I killed the brother
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
Y'all niggaz better pucker up, time for some real asskissin'
Like gay step mom, none of you motherfuckers can fuck with me
Your sex and your dope is all that we're fed
But I know that to possess her
A lot of people think that, what I say on record, or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life, or that I believe in it
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
I am not a whore
And we ain't got no love to give
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
What about the times you lied to me
The truth you sucker
Let the world turn, Let the curbs up, Cats Van Bags Yo
You can't tell me you can't, no, no, whoa
Now I want out
A fucking hypocrite draftdodger like George Bush
You were once someone I called my friend but that's all now changed and I don't know why
"I believe in the Power of Good
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
Baby I remember
And you ignore it, you implore it
Its life or death for me now
Just long enough to really make it hurt
Born to this  I thin not
Wracked by guilt on slick machines
When you're feeling broken
Don't nod, don't laugh all nicely
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
Lenny helped out, and that was real
And I'll go on and I'll break every last thing in this house
The stars are singing in the sky
 We gettin' shit done, you know what I'm sayin' Geto Boys,  The year  and forever And the shit don't stop until I say it's over with, muthafucka Know what I'm sayin' This is Geto Boys for life
Where the fear of illusion is real
Make devils drop and they just can't spite this
I'm sure raising my hands with questions and demands
Yeah I'll have my coffee black
For every evil deed
Thanks, thanks for nothing
The light is red like a fire,
Is farmers and their families
The way we push through equivalent to rocket thrust
You're so fuckin' special
Now, I look at your small life and it doesn't mean a bit
When you're this close, it gets hot before its cold
You burn a flag,
And I want to fly away
Gonna give you the righteous answer
I really hate you
Maybe I'll get a shotgun and
In the distorted German channels of my own mind
I begin to hate you for your face and not just the things you do
And bore use to death with your auditory sedatives
I pick myself up off the ground 'cause I don't give a shit
Through the smoke beyond my parking space
You made me throw it all away
I don't care anymore I don't care no more
I find it hard to concentrate with all my past mistakes
To the dead, dark and past
Rather then be on tape and make my own song this messed up
Like a river running wild
Rock this shit straight back to Anaheim
But then I take two steps back
Ich stand nur daneben konnte nicht mehr mit dir reden
I can't remember my own name
With things that I love now the things that I hate
'Cause I don't think you care to know
No more war traitorism, it's only me and her
Anarchy and freedom is what I want
If you got a lady and you want her gone
Of the sound of the peeling ground
A psychophant, the despoiler of faith
Your pretty little face
Return it
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
Sepultura, Max Cavalera will respond for breaking the
My personal attacks snap back to murder cats
I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
A little bit closer
Before this whole thing falls apart
Voting doesn't work it's easy to see that
Don't need no side effects like diarrhea or sexual death
I got no problem with you
Bitch, what's your problem You expect me to be optim
Don't talk about anything else we don't want to know
Trust me, It's that real shit
Problem is today they've got an answer for everything
When the hook sets in and this all ends
Once, you sang your own song, now your dancing to the same drum
Let's see, what's wrong with me might be my fucking tourett sy
Cast your eyes into the distance
Want me, fuck you, hate me
Realize who they're talkin' to
The sponsors of 'The Johnny Carcinogenic Show'
I can feel her so far away
So turn around and come on down
In a galaxy of stars with nothing in the middle
Why don't you throw your poison idea away
Golden earring, golden tan, blowwave in the hair
What I really am is really not so clear
And is it in you now
Getten drunk thrown' up
I thought you were a good man
We know you've got some drugs Shut up, man 
The fires imminent
I set shit right one whore at a time
A burnt and withered land
Simply reality, my dearest friend
My skin is begging you please
I want to rape and fuck you
It's runnning in the family, oh
Je n'attends que le bus qui me mène vers là où je peux espérer, babe
Turn it up loud and feel the ambiance
The dead part of you leaves me with a blessing 
You just left me lonely somewhere
To build the piece of the puzzle called the human race
So tired of the heartache and the nights I lie awake
I am the idiot who will not be himself
I'm asking my friend I need you again
Pay no mind what other voices say
To kill you if they could and rights from you to hold
Whatever pleasures those who get  from stripping skin with rhino whip,
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Just turn your head to hear my plea
Unohtanut olen, en voi kahta palvella
I'm not a motherfucker ignorant
And no zen guide to men will help you fend off the brethren
When it comes to sex you get mo better
She's not you this is not the end
Interest How do you know what MY best interest is How can you say what 
And all I ever needed was to fall right through
Why can no one ever hold a fire spirit
Too bad he never knew that you were just a grimy whore
I bleed forever and not a thing you do can comfort me x
But you know, there's no turning back now
Oh no, no, no
To a different beat
I'm not a pimp runnin' a stable
Your black soul, you know you're
My friend you are starting to become a bore
Tell that girl to step Step back
Pick up a gun and learn how to fight
We all fall down to build up
And I'll tell you something else right now I have the solution to the drug problem in this country Nobody wants to hear it, but I have it Not less drugs more drugs Get more drugs, and give 'em to the right fucking people Mmm mm, 'cause every time you hear about some famous guy overdosing on drugs, it's always some really talented guy It's always like Len Bias, or Janis Joplin, or Jimi Hendrix, or John Belushi You know what I mean The people you wanna have overdose on drugs never would Like Motley Crue would never fucking overdose man, never You could put them in a room with two tons of crack They come out a half an hour later, "Rock on, man" "Shit, they're still alive Fuck They're probably gonna make a double live album now, goddamn it"
Keep me company as I hunt down and kill my enemies cause there must be someone to blame
Look at the sad faces you've left behind now
Just something you should understand
And I love the way you hate me
They playin' Nintendo and he's got tha high score
You can try to blame it on the devil
Don't speak, don't say nothing
Das war ein so seltsamer Unfall, dass ihn noch niemand kannte
If I could just get past my pride
It will always hurt you fucking asshole
When you start to speak and my warm blood starts to boil
And I'm running but you're getting away
Through their socket pride
And all the children sing
Addressing most littlest
My bad, should I step out my shoes
I I you we're not thinking my stromata
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
The mess was in my head 
Animals having sex with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits
Shit and I be trying, I even text you, but you not replying
At authority's heart beats a dollar sign
And all our sins come back to haunt us in the end
Now I know, my A, B, C's
Fucking you is a total stranger
Those words weren't meant to escape, but they do anyway, I hate the others
Won't need no haircut
Are you feeling happy now
That marks the beginning of their end
Come closer now
He said you kinda did but I don't mind at all
Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere
She left with the morning
You'll be left alone, and broken bleeding
Everybody talks too much and argues
Sleep with one knife open You can't outthink us, we've been out of thoughts for a while
Islamic Bombers, no contender is parallel
Everyone and every thing you see makes you fucking sick
Don't need no dizziness
Take the heat, take a free kick, man
If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
Bet you wish you stayed near the cross
We are all so full of fucking shit
All those bad things are on your mind
Grunt fuck
I hear the lift descending
All being controlled by evil tyrants
Verse   Sadistik
You know, you need to maybe get away and like maybe you should talk about it,
I look to the left and the right
To hell with you 
What I want you to do is, uh
I spit the acetate
Don't move, I'll shut the door and kill the lights
Break, break, break, break, break
I know I got to be right now 'cause I can't get much wronger
Then stand up and shout impeachment
Nothing ever made quite clear, beware
Across the bluebird sky
Has made you drunk
I don't drive nowhere without the radio on
Because it wasn't due to you don't mean I'm paying dues, you stupid fuck
I ain't never comin' back no more
Just look at the face
Someone knows I'm dead as hell
You can't do nothin' absolutely nothing' ok
"Oh, husband, I could not control it
Fuck, shit
I'm talking 'bout war
And there's no hope
All you wannabes
Please turn off your cell phones
Oh, sleeping children better run like the wind
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
It's begun everyone better fuckin' pray
I'm not introducing you to my mind
Limited in sex, they dare
Confused You'll know when you're ripe
And so bitter
Just let me die here next to you
You've taken everything that you wanted
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"
So they tied the knot, now it's too late to reverse
All that is sacred is now declined
I move on, move on
Es kann nur noch wenig, sehr wenig Leben in dir sein
The white man won't notice the air he breathes
I am the dirty, you're the clean 
Matter of fact, shorten your list nigga, top 
They won't change nothing with their fashionable talk,
'Cause I don't wanna be no, no, no, no
The end
They pass the homes of greed and plunder
I won't ever have rough sex with Molly Connelly again
But now it seems that the tables have turned 
I sing I need a man
I got lots of this, I vibe to this like I rock a feegee
Featuring Jessicka of Jack Off Jill
I see the point, but I can't find a way to get through this fucking mental hell
But the bitch say I'm hot and I say no bitch I'm blazin'
Don't know where I'm going
So go and tell your friends, you know, the ones you got gassed
While we go away for the neighborhood crime
I said, I can't say what I want to
I said to take me to the god eyes
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies
Well my inner luck knows better, it's what I wanna hear
It's just another repeat of our history
I waste time in my mind, thinking of you
And step back, as I take up the helm
Where big shotters lick out white mountains like everest
Stand over by the wall
I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
There ain't no reason why you let me wait
Until they run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
Throw them meat and the dogs want more
I ruined all your plans so
They drew a line in the sand and made their last stand
Well see the flesh falling everywhere
Tat nach ihnen flehen, greifen, fassen 
This is the fence that hate built
I'll fight for me, only me
Scream battle, but you never fought
You heard my gun cock
I can't imagine, I don't understand
You got to sit in back
Stop talking Stop botherin' me
I hope you choke on your Bacardi and Coke
Mindin' other people's business seems to be hightoned
Don't you feel the same way like I do
Where your bitch at She'll get fucked up too
Just a little something you should keep in mind
carne e cannonicarne e cannoni
And praying to a sideways cross
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
If I was deserving, who am I to disagree
I dunno what happened its just what the ghetto did
You open your mouth and all I hear is lies
You stand by the waterfront never sure of your choice
I fuck ya ass up fuck him up
Before it's coming to an end, yeah
Oh and all I want is company
So fucking triumphant
We pull up to the cabin way above this damn metropolis
I need such amazing grace
We were strangers when we met
But it's under the skin of everyone
Better burn that dress, sister
As far as you wanna go, down in Dragontown
Unchained tearin' your flesh we unfed
What's your pleasure, what is your pain
Got me feelin' miserable I'm miserable
On roule en caisse les roues chromées, ici tout le monde nous reconnaît
And everybody thinks he's some kind of warrior for the Lord 
It's all about the LENCH y'all know the rest
We know what we need
You'll beholden to no one
You're all going to die down here
Bringing the legendary
They'll not try to hurt you
Turn your fucking cheek
He had been redrum in his past life devil
Man makes a gun, man goes to war
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when
Ooh, a dirty little sister
They mad shawty
We've chosen the path of disgrace
No no no no I can't take this
Burning in a sea that sings out in D
They shot an arrow at your head
All I'm really sure is that you're not too impressive
Now it's nothing but my way
I used to want to make you talk
And fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing
Won't you let her breathe today inject the holy spirit in her
You better see right through that mother's eyes
Oh, you're not rid of me
Genocide and the minds of men make
I'm haunted, by regrets and mistakes
Their meagre ambitions, their impotent fury
She thought burnt skin would please her lover
I'm lookin' for love, but it's got too many damn faces
Walking on fire, found a place away from humans
Strip her down to her bare ass
The system like a disease and bring it right to its knees
For like three and a half years
Insomnia sleeps with you nights
I'm sick instead, write it into
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh
Blood stained with no way to be saved
Everyone's passed out in the van
And the bottles that you've been pissing in 
Hey hey, now bloody mind
I beat that bitch with a hit
And flying is fearful of me
And watch him burn
Into the salted wax and the false attacks
And everybody seems to think I have a sinister plot, I do
Muthafucka you heard player murderers
Just then I thought
Through sickness and health
I wish I had a bullet big enough to fucking kill the sun
And It'll take over your mind
das war kein Selbtmord, das war Mord
You're very drunk and we were very young
I am the dirty and you are the clean 
Follow for now, swallow this spit
I don't know when I noticed life was life at my expense
Now I'm restless here, can't seem to part with fear
And I could just sit in church and just say �fuckin the services
You mind to
Let me tell you a little story about the slave master
I wanna see what you're insides look like
I should have seen it coming, I should have fucking known
I oh wanna love you
And die
Spoke on everything from war to how the ocean is vast
Or watching you fall apart
Is there a boy in this town that's not exploding with hate
Ah, the spirit's gonna close in on you tonight
If everything is all I've got and everything is all you want
They lied a fear and loathing
Making me understand 
And I spark the fire for the cold in the dark
I've watched you whore yourself for one more thing
I don't want to play this game
Not broken not broken
What's left of me
All these scars keep ripping open
We're leaning on death against compensation
We never stand too close
Every ounce of pain, what else is there to blame
It's something I'm not missing
Speak your mind and speak it clearly
To a safe place, that was made for me
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
It comes knocking back again to
Rationalize the lies and the hurt, that it's all worth it, sure hope it is
You know how people have these little habits that get you down
But you don't understand
Thuglife niggaz I'm going straight to , BIATCH
Before I forget who I am now
How's it feel to be a woman
Motherfucker
Gonna let nobody love you
You think you know me
If I thought it'd ease the pain
If I cannot bear to face your grave
Flying past God and wars and conflict 
You'll bleed out of control
If I wanna fancy fool, look I would've hired a dancer, oh
The little chips that know where home is
Until eventually, no one surrounds him
With it ever end Well I don't I
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
I stand all alone here at the altar
Showed us what his shit hit her, hell of a lick BUT
With the weight of love and the grace of the Baleen Whale
Development wants this neighborhood gone
Charlie sang for a pocket full of pills
Tell me what you believe Ahah
Punk was once an answer to years of crap,
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
That's the rule please niggas don't get it confused
He who got the finger on the war button
Oh, you don't even care no more
We'll be right back, well I will, you'll be in the trunk
That you would leave me now
Unlock your mind
You�can't�break�my�soul
If you failed to speak your mind
I stab, I stab, I stab but I can't puncture
Life is too precious to be fighting wars each day
My friend from overseas said this countries got the dumbest
And I would stand for you
Upturning usurping
He is ready for his sneak attack, he's gonna go do this shit and not look back
The lawyers they conjoin stand up now stand up now
Seems that what you want and what you need
I've been making money off of my indifference
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
And look down in disgust at our misery
You plant a demon seed
Pour s'endormir avec lui 
I wanted to be that, to be that special girl
Every time I see your dick I see her cunt in my bed
To watch it function and bubble out your lunch
You're mistaken
Look at you standing all alone
Cause everything you say just disappears
Black is death at midnight
In my hood, bitch ain't nothing funny
Momma turned her back on me
Streets that burn, a bullet flies
No no no no I don't care at all
I thought you were some perfect readout
And run in little circles till circles are
Love the girl that weed and shit what
I put my faith, my faith in you
I don't wanna have a talk
Fuck my ass
All the way crazy, shady
I want a perfect soul
In the Halls everybody gets a turn
So I don't know
Our government has a firm policy not to capitulate to terrorist demands That noconcessions policy remains in force, despite the wildly speculative and false stories about arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments, we did not, repeat, did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages, nor will we
I know it's all getting away
I'm the predator of the lies
You know you will never be right in the eyes
Tell me how you feelin' now what I know you illin now what
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
And if you'd left me ground to stand on
Seeing you laughing another time
You know that justice is never sought
You threw it back
Je reserve mes dernier mots a ses petites bitches qui pourraient douter encore
Concoctions of pain hits from eight angles
It's been going on for months, said she'd only done it once with friends
Massive plutonium radiation
G'ed up C'ed up motherfucker blaze the weed up
We took a room back full of kids and threw a heart at it
Tell 'em, Tone The rage of Angels
Where I am no longer your misanthropic majesty
This is our biggest fear 
You try to cry but it's just for show you know I know you know
And dismissal
This is beginning to feel good
Tea parties are the shit, forty mags by the scones
I know you made one mistake
You can't tell a joke, yeah
I bet you're not fuckin' pretty on the inside
It's hell when you're around
Whitewashed all my boyfriend's features
And I know
U ain't fuckin' wit me Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Or love is blood,
A war that your friends were involved in
Hey it's me Versace, whoops somebody shot me
This is not the life I wanna live
'Cause if I honestly react, nothing's ever gonna work
That nigga had the power to make you crawl for him
It's enough to kill me but it's never enough
Seems so very clearly now 
Greed, your master passion
Gather your pathetic masses and bring them to me
Don't get too raunchy They want you to behave
Plowing through minds and paranoia 
Into the abyss will I run
Got me deep inside the drum you see it's blackness
I've whored myself for less than this
Future, past, all is fading, warped reality
I am down on the ground
Turn on turn on the news
All those familiar faces
And this is the end of this session, let's anything else you've gotta say
You need a designated driver for your hostility
You'd better go and call for backup backup
Shut up I'm about to tell you some secrets you'll never know
I'm makin' collect calls to my old bitches
Yeah I was feeling strong mouthed and weak willed
A mother fucker on the war path
Yo you can run but you cannot hide
Well all I know is that I been down here tryin'
Man mother fuck a war
Could we stomp around your back yard
Someone help, someone speak, before I start to scream out
Et bénisse tout nos efforts de ses dernières années
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
A painful time, a time where cynicism rots the vine
Say you like to play this game
Just want it all to go away
When all I wanted was to be good
Let them bleed now, let them wash away
When I go out, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
Made a mistake, made a mistake
Get a load of this fuck, he's the dead guy
See, promoter's making small talk,
World ending, it's just beginning 
I'm a fool who'll keep on trying, and like a fool, I will crawl
When I wear Mary Jane's shoes
Ruler ZigZagZig, we don't fuck with no pig
You love this ass, why not make it
Sublime rockin' No Doubt stylie
Don't go to London, no no no
How many times have you taken the beating
You can complain But they are not concerned a bit
I know your kind
Why did the chicken cross the road
Yeah it is you that I remember in that glowing
And I have earned my disillusionment
Thinking nothing
Sparing you is not my aim
Nowadays every godd damn little disaster
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
Know one knows what I've done
This is all we've ever known of God
All of my thoughts
Sitting here like a loaded gun
You can't appreciate it and I need to feel whole
Buck fifty face stupid and say but run Nike swoop
I implied black skies took a needle to my eye
You can't stop me
I'm innocent
Already know what you're gonna say
We camouflaged stone cold
Walk with an army on me, stalked by the harm and armor posse
But keep in mind my darling
The choir on the black box rejoiced splendidly,
You think that you're God's gift to life that we should fall
Now I'm afraid that I am not so sure
Who left Murph the Surf On my ceiling
Follow it, they said, to paradise
Hey, want it back
Is completely cold and crazy,
No you ain't gonna need no little boat
I find it so upsetting that
But maybe I'd be better off if I just end this quickly
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life You can't blame me
But by strong folk, not a puppets feeble imitation
Nail it to the House of Lords, you will be buried in the same box as a killer
Try to make me move, but only half an inch
You get disconnected over methods you choose
I'm just calling to say hello
On the game again
Poison eggs reverse swallowed
Pay no mind to the rabble, pay no mind to the rabble
Tyler calm the fuck down
Ain't got a ride or no loot, yeah, uhhuh
And nothing looks the same
And that reminds me man hey ya gotta call
The new born babies drowned at birth
There's no good way to end this
Takin' out a police will make my day
Gettin' down in the town that makes no sound
There's shit on the telly there's shit on TV
Out of the old and thin and control
Held up its arms To the sky
Yeah, we never talk about the future
Do you mind if I were yours
The world was mine but gave it to my baby's mama
And this the motherfuckin thanks I get Hello
We are antimovements, we are antianti
But no one can remember
I know I didn't say somethin' wrong
I don't know where I went wrong
 Where you onliest way I think you can keep it is by being at peace and being honorable
Give me a faith, something I can believe in
You might not think its phat to apply the cross
It was a murder but not a crime Pop, six, squish
You don't bleed
It might rain, it might snow
Go to sleep Sleep my child
So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Hey God, I really don't know who I am
Crucifixes for ladies
Hey, I'm the one with no soul
I know soon still that platinum is coming
Turning me on with my lightsabre cocksucking blues
In fact to the gritty ain't none of us wack
Oh, do you remember my name
Nobody cares, nobody cares
My life's out of reach of my arms, but I'm holding on
Be me  put my eyes in your face
And it seems to me there's a means to and end
Bring our soldiers home
To not come and speak to me speak to me
Who cares get the fuck off your soapbox
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it
And I've been sweatin' and cursin' and frettin'
When you come around and you flex that fake grin
I'll fuck ya ass up
Nnnow that don't kill me can only make me stronger
Take your mind back, I don't know when
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Ah but I know you wanted me to be there oh oh
Can decide your fucking life
But to shiver and shake and make shit in their shorts
What's she thinking Does she really believe
I'm all ears, and I'm all scars 
I don't care for making ends meet, getting on or reading books
And weep at my grave
Nothing will bring rest
My heart is beating from me, I am standing all alone
Lose yourself, you'll fall away fast
Big talking, small fry
Hip gangster wannabes
I had a scream last night
Does Joe bring flowers to Marilyn's grave
From the start I see the end
Now don't ask what, don't move, don't cry Don't even ask where this is going
There will be struggle and fear
No cash to buy their lies, just the rage behind my eyes
You're a respectable member of society
I'm not afraid of lying but I am afraid of DYING
And finally I'll sleep, I'll sleep through the night
I want to live
He didn't know that every dog had his day
I scream within WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
And if not, I'll take my spoons
And when I feel I'm in hell, my ideas are what get me through pain
To drive me slow
When those walls close in around you
And you get poisoned fruit from a poisoned tree
Shut up and stop your playing around
Baby, I think you'll understand
Got a fourdoor and a faithless wife
It's no fun
Better off not asking
If I was you I wouldn't fail myself
Politicians, can you fucking believe them
Stupidity's separated by a wall of glass
Hope Fox Trot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot
I'm the singer, I'm the singer in the band
But nothing compares to the path that I tread on now
You goddamned kids had best be gracious with the merch money you spend
You read of the tree Beget by god
I'll never be the shine in your spit
You're nowhere into giving
Than stay and watch you make a fool of me
No, that's not the way to do it
You all know that I never miss
And it's not something that I'll let you forget
Through a mess of sweatsoaked covers 
You're gonna be left alone
Swallow your pride for
You a good guy that's living a lie
I'm gonna kick it in the arse
She finished the move, presenting blue waves of doubt
And wild because I would do anything
Enferme nos reufs au cachot 
I ain't got no time for the bull shhh Come on
Don't care no more
What you, what you want from me
Bad milk burns on your tongue
Into attack position  ELIMINATE ALL
Some tried to run even though it seemed useless
This industry business is all screwed up
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
For all of you rappers that be bringing me drama, homie please be ghost
Sing me a song and I will surrender
No I am not a bitch
What do you want to do
You're not the one with all the problems
You thought that it was over
I'm standing in a room,
Those smarmy bastards would steal from their mother
And you smile as you ease the gun from my hand,
I'm talking as a walking document of our struggle
I want it, want it, need it done
You want the answers, you got the face fleshed out
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
I'd have seen Dre rockin' parties for hours
In body rocking, rapping, and macking
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I am the ism, my hate's a prism
But you are nothing
And the grass was green
We've got plenty to talk about because some of them you just
Can't even do one thing, assassinate 'em
I'll just talk the talk, I walk it
And I get choked up
Highways fill with refugees now
I've been dragging a bitch called hope a bitch called hope
Where I know the roads like the back of my hand
But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew
I'm sick and tired of all of your lies
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
Destroy the mind, destroy the body but you cannot destroy the heart
I'm coming over but it never was enough,
The way you always speak your mind
You know death and the devil sure got it easy today
No no no no more son of a bitch
You wanted nothing less then
Runaway, runaway girl
There must be another route, way out
Crosses and kerosine
I've got my own crimes now and I won't let you in
Justice and the law
Eye trained, on scope, blessin'  proof
At school the choices I made
Friends looked at me and said,
I will run for you
The liquid light is descending
The animals scratch at my skin
But we'll see who stop the black guerrilla
It's burning down
He was crazy and he kept screamin',
Of our own black hearts
Where I gather all these thoughts for all your broken info
Sing, sing, sing again
And send his ass home belly up
The universe is mine, a few disturbing times
I walk without you, but I need to believe
Sit back pop bottle y'all sit on y'all feet
And nobody questions
I wanna have control
You want so badly to get through
So fuck it all 'cause I don't care
To bleed for the 
Said it was blue when the blood was red
And the dirtiest thing I've ever seen
You and I have nothin' more to say
Do me this one favor and pretend we never knowed
Hell's doing great but I am serving no more
But he doesn't spend
The pain junkie
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
Rolling up tab ends that the baby's collected
What a pain, well, it's all a crying shame 
The fear and the mouthpieces
It's not the first time eye've tasted pain
Do my dirty work Yeah, come on, yeah
Truly, fuck the world,
To try to kill the major
Across it all, it was never that bad
Shut your fucking mouth
A thousand motherfuckers died for nothing
Is used to help ward off the fear
Slipped, and I fell, got back up  slipped again
Hand over my heart, gun to my head
Taking it long enough we crush the formal journalistic
From now on, gonna start holding my breath
You left me free fallin' like space junk
What do you want from my life
Take your broken pride, exhaust your basic quote
I like to feel this abuse I'm tucked away fucked and used it's trapped away in my mind unseen alone undefined this desiccation implied my fucking mouth so fucking dry
Or the patience or the courage or the strength to withstand god damn
Aw, fuck; Chuck's on a killin' spree again
Hook Kendrick Lamar
With thoughts of failure sinking
And all this time still hanging on into such codependence
And if you're planning a future of indefinite grace
You bleed and it doesn't mean shit
Show you right back
Give you poison to kill your pain
Put the cassette in the tape deck
Don't you think that I don't want them
I am chest deep in her swarm
This is why my mouth is always coming out with raw shit
Oh my god posthardcore kids everywhere
Steamed glass
Pain  and tears
Yeah, I lie, I lie, I lie, oh, I lie, oh, I lie, I lie, yeah
A phone call I'd rather not receive
Rapists, racists, all fucking scum
One time can't hold me back
You'll get up and sleep
Trying to meet halfway
But don't look so offended
Objecting to racism's like a candle in the dark
But baby trust me there ain't nothing that could
They try to get you with the funny money
And life is a sleazy stranger
What is left of me without you
So I gotta watch what I decide to say
I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's
I know line and walk tall, soft, and punch a clockAin't done
Oh, oh, oh then ya know, that li'l' girl would just have to go
My heart bleeds from the pleasure of the pain
To waist this love on no one
And I wanna sing
And in the meantime take an indigenous culture and rob it
They say no man's an island
When you left the door was
Yeah, they may not go down in history
Got a big chip, you want a fat lip
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
Come if you really want some of the chingazo
Follow me I run, I run, follow me, follow me
Over the border and to every corner and edge of the world
Tell me goodbye since you cannot rely
It's on, and being foolish won't cover up 
This my motherfuckin' nigga Em on dem motherfuckin' boards in case your wonderin'
You best believe I got your draft card
My life, my pride, is broken
Ah, shut the fuck up
And everybody wants to explore the new girl
Everyone that I meet, I wanna punch in the ear
Beat smooth enough to slide through like bobsleds
I've always got a knife in my back
A nigga'll die for a brawl
I don't wanna wait for you yeah
No sir, no ma'am
We going to knuckle up cause the Jakes bring war
But I don't wanna be just another girl
I don't know and I don't care
Your grave, it's your grave
How come I ain't got no money here
Wake the fuck up
If bullets don't get good PR there's other ways to kill
These times I'm living in just make no sense
I should give some money to that bitch
Send'em a wire, give'em my best
Turn your bleeding hearts into some bleeding hands
Starfuckers
They'll fuck you if your rich
Shut up you don't know me, shut up, you don't know me
Won't need no shadow man
I'd rather catch something controversial and die
I can't fully become my mother's guiding light
That this puffed up face is safe in well worn places
Just don't know how I'm supposed read into your convoluted mind
You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf
So fuck you anyway
I'll fuck you in the skull
There's no use fakin' it
I'd be spitting lead at you, to dead your crew
With protective shell
They say "It's not our policy to kill civilians,
But I went right ahead and told myself a pack of lies
How many tips can I take home tonight without them getting mad
And now I've got nothing to show
Am I supposed to feel something
I don't understand, it can't be that easy,
And calling down fire on what he don't understand 
It'll help if I practice and act immature
You're eating off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick
It's always the same, say the "F" word maybe that'll help
You'll see a hell of a body on the way to blast your eyes out
Your god machine is cold
Let's move from this undergound
Kato mulla todistus on priimatavaraa
But how things have changed now
Do you know you are a filthy thing
If I couldn't feel
It was on the back seat of that Fiat Uno you stole
Wither away inside your golden cage
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
With arms and gold in store
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face 
I am warning you I am weightless
The war is on, too weak to move 
You can call me crazy say I'm insecure
Shed some of this blacklight to surrounding towns
You feel the love
Backstabber, hope grabber, greedy little fit haver God, I feel for you, fool
The whole world was made of wood and smelled like gasoline
Even he'd like to end it too
Well, some passersby took me to the station
Oh, foolish worker bee 
Did ya think about me being half awake and crying, 
Drag another cliche
Would you be my wife
The world is feeling twice as cold today
I'm so sick of trying to fit in, I don't even know where to begin
Another set up for the fall
It's an awkward form of payback,
Tied down just to control you
Don't tell me how you feel
You, you take so long to know
There is not a wonderwall to climb
You tell me, you talk to Ren
It blows their minds most bitterly
U hoes can't make it in the game
I believe in something else
You suck me like a whore
Say the word and make it right, so dark
Covet love it learn to break
You're a madman, need help to
You fucked up  you sloppy little shit  bitch  ah
I beat, I beat, I beat, I beat
I beg of you my only saving grace
The weak die young and right now we crouch to make them strong
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
You wanna know what's really bothering me
It's not your pretty face that matters
So we can't find out guns
One's born everyday and everyday she was your sucka
Scared of the lyrics, and when they bitches hear us
Like fighting, like sex
And a rocket to depart in
She said, "I am not a feminist"
Makes you feel much better
'Cause face to face you're sweet
This is the sip that's drinking back from you,
Now I understand all of the lies you hide and you're gonna make me flip this switch
Here is a song to sing to do the measuring
And we keep wondering when we're gonna feel something real
What a resignedly of motherfuckin you thinking what they Uh
I'm coming over but it never was enough
Fuck you, and fuck your man, both y'all niggaz is puss
Nuclear showers there's nothin' spookier
We're kept in the dark
On the wall so high I'll make this fair if it's what you want
Step to face, I'll break your ass in two, bastard you
It seems like every time we all try to go underground
Probáltam a rendõrségen megmagyarázni de nem értették meg
I fired several rounds,
I don't hate my loss of luck, I just hate feeling so washed up for what
You'll never know how your face has haunted me
Of course this mean giving up from all my sleep
New plan Stan
Well, I don't care now what you say I don't care what you say
ThugLife will never fail I'm out on bail
Okay Put the fuckin' money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you
That don't change my feelin's in the slightest degree,
'Cause I'm feeling kind of jealous
Do it now Fuck y'all
I thought that that might disappear but you penetrate
You've got to feel
Don't need no terror squad
And I'm sorry but it's not a mistake
Hey now everybody
I hate so much
Purify the dirty things
I teetered on the edge of doom
Life was lame, I had to pay money to fuck a whore
Learn from my mistakes
I wanna see the ground give way
Belaruse no longer feels the sun
Oh, I'm sorry
But you gotta act right and not let it lack now
Step towards the line how close can you before you fall right in the show me something something new and original I can't help feeling that I'm holding on with one hand show me difference something new I can't help it if you're building something I can't help it if I'm feeling nothing I can't help it if you're building something I can't help it if I've seen it all before show me something something new and original I'm holding on with one hand give me something something to live for countdown starts from ten when you hit four it all starts again reset the ride show me something something new and original I'm holding on with one hand something to live for something to die for and it's not a game
Is there a human alive that can look themselves in the face
You'll never know the real story
Oh you know
Heart's saying "I will once I bury this bitch alive
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
You stupid dumbshit goddamn motherfucker
Never returning again
Best estimate, straight blacked out for the rest of it
Some day, Ill form opinion, either stand up to God or fall for religion
Mirror minor static 
Open wide for all the shit they feed you
I cannot distance myself
And with a heartbeat
I don't want to fade away
His shit attitude
'Cause it's her car but she lets the bumps steer
Johnny always lock a nigga down
I thought we were so damn cool
It's time you made a stand
'Cause I'ma nigga  life, so I'ma nigga till I dizie
I talk to myself when we are alone
And I don't give a fuck about the things they say
But when it's time to pay they came up with all type of shit
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go
Vitalize your benevolent thoughts today
Behind the hospital little baby,
All we wanted was a home
They didn't think that Vinnie P was catchin' bodies no more
Turning shit into solid gold
Rip away my fears
It feels good to say what I want
Don't give me your nothin', I can do it myself
And it's now arrived and my mouth is fulla saliva
ANd I just made my perfect world, now you're gone
Motherfucker, you not dope
I shed tears fo this shit
I'm just afraid it will hurt like, hurt like hell
Shrugged off the shit in my youth
You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye
When you take her to Chateau Marmont
I won't sell it for no payroll
Don't need no nausea
There's no need to be nervous
Well, I look over yonder to that burying ground
Nothing can compare to the way she would say to me "Darlin' You know I'm gonna beg,"
I wear skin like Jesus
Though we won't ever meet I remember your name
Both arms and it makes you feel better
When goldcapped irony
Break me down just to build me back again
E você passa dia e noite e sempre vê
My pulse reverberates through this malleable shell,
All I ever wanted was a nine to five
You think I got time to give a fuck about disorder
I am the blood of this city,
I have a problem with reality
Oh don't you understand
I'm digging my nails into gravity's ladder, ripping your mind and matter
Stand in line it's not your turn
If you cross my path
To even do that shit, like I'm that guy Bitch come down 'cause you're not that fly
I'm sorry for my blues
I want them to do this to you 
Shut down the devil sound
I'll be back in twenty years,"
From the cold light of day
After all, it's you, my pride and me
I'm gonna let nobody, gonna let nobody love you
I can hang out with my friends, do the good times ever end
PO, you know the dirty one disturbing categories
Cause you will never see me cry 
Boy you ain't the one that I wanna take
And there's so little of you left
Voices controlling my feelings
MTV stopped by to film our fortresses
Nur für den Kick  für den Augenblick
And I know that this is new
I'm your god machine
The power of conviction
Spurs matte from the life force sprung loose from wells
My walls are closing in
In studios, conference rooms think they're smooth, but no finesse
As they run down my face
I know she's right, know she's right, God I'm drifting
Funky, but ya don't understand
All the houses on the street would not compare
To be sure you known what I'm saying
They shout give us our fair share, give us justice
For a punk mother fucker with a badge and a gun
But you always know what to say
Turn on turn on, turn it on turn on
I face towards the wind
You love this ass, so don't fight it
There is anger resolute
We invented the zero And we mean nothing to you
And we're all going straight to hell
For in the end unity will be thrust upon us and we upon it and each other
I broke down crying on your return
'Cause you lied, you lied
Long beat, long beach and it feels so fine
With coppercore wound veins, a pumping cold hydraulic heart,
I can not scream in pain from down here on my knees
British hooker hired by bert's bandmates sings "Happy Birthday" and "He's a Jolly Good Fellow"
Teen dream, scream queen
No, no
You can do no wrong,
But there is no time to explain
I've been trying to think about life, trying to come up with some sort of flawless system that explains it all, you know, just something that makes it all make sense, preferably one that comes in a nice easily digestible sound bite, quick and easy and without too much effort, because life can be quick and easy and without effort, and I realize the only one thing that brings me any sort of joy is anger and hate Rage is the only thing that brings me what one might call contentment, rage is the only thing that even begins to satisfy my need for fulfillment and then I realize that I have been wasting my rage on bullshit, on things that didn't deserve it This one gift of mine was being squandered on things that weren't worthy of it, and this angered me, I'm not going to slut off my rage to everything and anything any longer, but rather now wish to save it for something really special, save it for something noble that really deserves it I wanted to hate what I respected and I don't respect anything I long to hate something worthy of the emotion I can't hate incompetence, I can't hate the pathetic The pathetic demeans my hate I want my hate to represent my purpose, to become my purpose I want it to be worthwhile and looking at you, thinking about you, knowing what you are I realized that to hate you would be a crime, it would be like hating a stain, like hating a pimple, a zit I can dislike things all I want, they are a nuisance, a bother, but hating them would drag me down, drag me down How could I build up energy for this How could I really care I'm tired of having my hate watered down by irrelevant bullshit There is nothing worse than wasting the beautiful energy of unrestrained anger, of uninhibited fury, on something like this, some impotent meaningless blur And then a calm overcomes me Nothing can bother me now because nothing is worth the trouble Underneath this emotionless surface boils the true essence of unrestrained anger, I now walk through life like a ghost, like a zombie, for I have reached a transcendental state of bliss, and by bliss I mean rage, because I know that what I now hate is the core of everything, I don't hate your trivialities, you bullshit, your irritants, I hate the essence, I hate truth, I hate the very fundamentals of it all
Cause in the end, we're such close friends, sugarnspice, and since then
You look sick, homie eat a gun I tell you haha
All I want is a little respect
Prop me up with another pill
Don't be so damn benign
You take a hit now you feel it break down
My parents can pay for the abortion, you know
Don't stand too near
If you haven't had enough of me, well get in line
The pedestal is high enough to fall
They twisted the knife further in
I'm tired of falling backwards
We meet after everyone has fallen asleep
Ignorance bliss
If I could talk
It's not right how they martyr our leaders
But in a back room in Harehills,
You live like a wannabe
I'm not that kind of kind of girl
To feel the things that we must live through
You ain't shit, just a puddle on the bedspread
But it doesn't matter anymore
I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna let you
My pen is prepared, and so the guns and the swords
Oh, shit she's a gold digger Well
I come across a substance yet I couldn't lacerate
Better watch your back, sister
We're only treading ground that we already know
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows
And I don't care Do you sleep do you count sheep anymore
And I'm aching from fucking too much
I never heard of paperface
Can we pretend
A simple choice to fall away
And still be sinking, submerging in the parks
These veins are bled
Lives lost due to needless violence
I'll 've just begun
Do you know what they feel, what they feel for you
Just splashed across the page
Nono the Zeplin song
Don't wanna leave you now or never
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go, all over again
You speak with false intentions but I know what you really want from me
I thought the world should know Ho
I enter the building through the side door, not like an eyesore
But turn my mind off
From the chip under your wrist skin
Same questions we keep asking
Everyone talks about justice but truth is forgotten
My whole world is disconnected
Crying for a love when you know you never learned how
I don't know why, all I need is someone to save me, I believe
I just want to get inside you
And you can't pass if you're missin', G
I think you shouldn't have glorified, now you're wrong
An explanation is what we want
And keep warm
And when he beckons his finger to me,
Slipped out of every noose
I'm a fist, I'm afraid, I'm a link in the chain
I don't know where you're going
Ha ha ha ha It died out long ago
I'd really love to break your heart
If you made a dunce cap I'd don it
Cannot breathe
When I begin to rise, you start to fall
Turn my fucking thoughts against me 
And fucking just remember this
I also wanna make an announcment, that I am protit all the way President Leary is protit all the way I love tits I would like to be the mayor of Tit Town if I could I'd like to drive a big truck full of tits down the Tit Turnpike right through the middle of Tit Town I'd like to have my own talk show about tits, "Tit Talk" That's how passionate I am about the tits, I love 'em all I actually love the small tits better than the big tits because the big tits get all the attention The peach and plum little handshaped tits, they're great I love to look at 'em "How ya doin'" talk to 'em, "What's goin' on Look at me I've got my face next to a tit" Men are mollified by tits We don't know why, we just are We don't have to see naked tits to get mollified, we just freeze up even at the sight of cleavage Waitress leans over the table the wrong way That's how we can end war Get the Good Year blimp, paint it up like a tit, put a nipple on it Fly it over the Middle East during a confrontation, "Look at the tit Look at the tiiiiit The tiiiiiiit The tiiiiiiit"
I don't know why all I need is someone to save me, I believe and I don't know why
Everyone on the dance floor is doomed Hit the ground Shut your mouth
Imaginary walls surround me
I promise you won't ever see me cry 
Better leave the lion alone do not pet him
Those kids suck, yeah they're fucking beat
With Halloween teeth that I can break
Feeling pretty sore
Those demigods
Half human, half machine
These bitches all on the dick
I remember we could talk about anything
Please don't shout
Crush it all, kill it Calling out my enemy
Night is falling to the ground
Lock in cages penned, hemmed in shoulder to shoulder  arms outstretched
And it made me fight again
I'm back in this bitch, we was gone for a while
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
It's a bird it's a plane it's a one night stand
Is it near enough
Walking on fire, you rather than me
You're no martyr
You sing with me
And I don't know what town I'm in
I just want a Pretty Baby to be her man
And when I suck you off, not a drop will go to waste
For those who died that Eastertide in the
Like a ghost that I can't shake
To the west, to the left
So sorry that, I'm taken aback
And you make it so real, I don't need your love to disconnect
Bucking stone 'cause I'm known to play for keeps
You burn so hard
Go see the volcanoes
Expect me to adhere to your bullshit code of silence
In our shiny white snow
I don't need your ignorance get he fuk out of my face
The fearful losses confidence
Snap yo neck like a Bitch
To face no good fakes,
My nearest and dearest
Slouch into position men, this is a war Set the traps
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
You know, I feel it crawl across the floor 
Come on now
Never would I thought you'd try to lie and deceive me
Better yet, I'll build on to the beat like tetris
The one I love I hate
Yo, I've seen souls get sold so coldly
So I'll meet you up high in your anger
To scream all day
Don't get mad when you get played by me I'm a keep it real till the day I DIE
And you feel as if you died Whilst you're standing on the line
Lets run away to accept that we all are different
No matter what you did or who you fucked
No, don't get upset, cause you never played fair
I'm singing it loud and I don't care
Come on you disheartenin' dobbins
There's nothing to do on bloody Sunday
Staring at the cracks in the walls
Why do I get shit all the time from you men
And the movie turns into a photo
I can never shut it up
But I've worked with less
Body, I'm not an animal
Fuck pigs, fuck guards, all some fucking retards
You're in the grip of the controller
Well you spin around and bite your nails, now let me tell you son,
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
I saw a cop beat a priest on the TV
To leave me oh no no no no, oh rha
I know you feel betrayed
Come back here
I'm so sorry if I'm alienating some of you
They think that your early ending was all wrong
There's too much anger inside me
Feel like I'm knocking on the
Must I rerun this pace
Under the silver knife
I don't need no family
I spit inside her face
I will try to scream in pain a little nicer next time
Now she cannot move, no question
Mom I'm not on drugs I'm okay, I was just thinking you know, why don't 
They got it all, that's what they want you to think,
Cut my skin, it makes me human
I'm sick of the sickening fakes
The safety's off nigga, so get the fuck out my way
I'm a fist of rage
My friends graduated and I'm way older then them
I am on the mend
Start to fall but I'm still standing here behind the wall of dying faith
Don't go to bed mad baby
Don't care if you hated me from the start
Another dumb bitch that you can show your friends
You suck my blood like a leech
Time to make life shine again like glass
It's just too late now
It's not making sense to you right now but
I'm left to counting the days
I have come to know this world of changing faces
Over the rain and storm
What you so mad about
I know you can hear me
These wounds, they will not heal
They pushin' rocks here, in the dead of night
They mind believe in us
He says it's real, 'cause I got bills, but I got skills
My other brother, I won't mention his fuckin' name
I Feed the mouth that bites me
Keep singing
When I tried to save us it was not enough
Every tree a finger of my glove
Don't want no damned Jihad
Flirting with a bimbo named disaster
I wantingly longed for your touch, but 
Nobody helps them
All ice water is tears and tears and tears and tears
That's what they made my hero say
You thought you'd leave me falling forever
Don't make me laugh wit'cha funny money
She wants to fight, wants to fight and I've been drinking
You act like you don't want it 'cause I'm with too many guys, but in the middle of the night, you called me twenty five times
If you want to take a shot at me, well get in line
You left our family in shambles
And been treated like shit
The peace offering another day
Reconstructive sergury if you know what I'm talking about
Shit basically they juss playin' sick
But I'm not coming
Rapalot greedy as fuck
And now we proudly present
Until the day I crossed that line
A friend in need is a friend that bleeds
Don't fucking weep
It's your mother birthday, you don't give her a call
Cold summer, cold summer
Better call the ambulance, I'm coming to choke y'all
I've seen this monotonous world make dull, what used to shine
And all I ever needed was to fall with you
Leave them now, let them go,
And fret for your lawsuit
You catch me if I'm falling
And get the hell out of the house
Not through talkin' and not through waitin'
So please don't keep on asking
They give them civil rights to appear on the left
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Brother give me another tote
Suffer not Your neighbor's paralysis
Don't tell me how it feels
I don't fear the confrontation
No, no, no, no, I don't care
Through the barrel of a gun
I'm on fire I'm comin' around
You'll never end this in me
You could say what she wants to hear
If I could only see you now 
 times the pain, I could never be like you
The motherfuckers made a motherfucking tape, Odd Future Tape Volume 
Won't you ever let this die
Do you sleep do you keep me anymore
She was an animal
But no less Astarte to behold
I think I love you now
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme
These people they take and they take until there's nothing left
For all the scars that never heal
 dispatch ma'am calm down, deputies are on the way
That burn fiercer in throes of upheaval
The lonliest soul in the universe
And I know you're his girl but you should ride wit me
Looking back into my diary
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
No I cannot be beaten
Continuous drift to depend and dismiss
Don't be assuming that I'm going to love you 'cause if you do I'll cut you out of my life I promise you
They wanna drop me like an awkward subject
Of this United goddman States of this bitch America
You broke them now, you'll haven't tamed me
I want to break through but I'm though if I do
I rolled ya up and smoked you like cones
You and me now
When I'm in paris niggaz Frenchkiss the pinky ring
Move Forth Towards The Break
I spit off  fuck it give 'em the 
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Encircled within our minds
To rescue they advise, such fury they devise, the devil in them lies
I want out
Barely our friends, who think about what's up with Jen & Ben
I buried my friend the other day
Of your spirit
I'm not the type
While Brittania's huns with their long range guns
Get the picture nigga, I'm the best of both worlds
And I warn you now
I want to give a shit again
I promise you towards the heavens
I will kill ya if you move in next to me,
Oheeoh fuck the lawns that need mowin'
The end of law
Your self control has gone away
'Cause  shots tearing through the side of ya ride
Spider bite panic attack
So won't you break me shake me hate me take me over
I know you want to be free
You feel deeply misplaced
Pull back  there are some things to realize
Now I'm ignored
No one ever tells me so what I am to know
When I let loose wit this uzi and just shoot through your isuzu
as encomendas na Bolívia
Well, there's a lady that knows
You and me Far beyond control
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
See you in hell
My will to hate is strong
Work, money, bills, reality,
The knife, the gun, broken bottle, petrol bomb
Okay baby follow me now
They tell me the improbable arithmetic of closing my eyes and counting the cards keep 'em busy by counting the cards
Yeah, I'd have shot you down
The week is weak enough
In these days I don't know what to sing
Rikki Sun, Alex and all hoes and walks in arrogant gems,
Quit hollerin' "Why, God", He ain't got shit to do with it
Achimmada saenggakhae
Devil got me a fat new bribe
Another cure to fix your day
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
Take heed and run
This time the bullet cold rocked ya
All my problems are for me
As those batons fall, turn a blind eye
All I want to do
All I want is inner peace
They act so discreet, they are hypocrites forget them
"Oh no they're all dead, they're all dead" Sample
You're nothing to me, stop fucking with me
But I wouldn't mind if you did
It's a shame what your father did to your brothers head
What I want from us, is empty our minds
Big brother's got no heart
Then trace them with razorblades
I watch you sit I watch you dwell
You'll see ten thousand lies
Stand me up and push me forward
Trapped in a world that you never made
I hate this song, does this look like a big joke No
Stuck my knife deep inside as I saw my fate through his eyes
That's when you made a pledge to yourself,
I've left the girl I was supposed to be and
If you care to take a closer look at the way things really stand,
For niggas that ain't right they get it upon sight
I'm falling apart
Terrible lie
I spitup on my plate and then I turn and walk away
But fuck these rappers, they're bitches
I could really suck you in
You just don't know it
Don't go knockin' on my door
Heed my faults  and heed my curse  heed my frustration  you just don't
But now you're gone, gone, gone
I know I need to chill
Your skin makes me cry
You promised me another time
Hardly waiting till the bed was warm
Then you get your planes and with napalm you bomb it
The love she sought through faltering thought
Bravo, nessuno
We are in deep shit
It makes you homeward bound
"You can try to stop it, but it keeps on coming
I come to purge the prince of death from off the earth
And pulled me from the grass
I'm not really bitter
Girl in white dress, boy shoot white stuff
There'll be peace in the valley of death when I rise
And act on what we believe
You're the ones that fuck your kids
That is just because I can't stop thinking
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine
'Cause Nietzche said "god is dead" and I believe him
To come to an end
Turn 'em on to niggas who deep into that thug shit
I'm an asshole and I'm ashamed
We know the score
You're the fan that won't work
Get drunk, get drunk, stinking drunk
Black man's got his problems and his way to deal with it,
You know I'm not surprised the Illuminati had to keep it a secret
Run game on a nigga
When there's nowhere left this crutch is broken
Get down  back into hell
Sit down bitch, you move again I'll beat the shit out of you Okay
We salute or burn, there is blood on both shores
You lie alone, I try to join
Now I kiss up to God my fists
Are cold
Consider this a spell and watch where you tread
Yeah, we never talk about the past anymore
You're like a rare disease
Now you can see the reason why not everyone's the same
You're workin' too hard
When you look at me I just can't lie
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
So tip the bottle back
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And never have the left to cover the bleeding
Well, it's all somebody's fault 
But who's version of god should I trust
I will spit right in the face of all you whores 
Show no shame like the pain of kane
Karma killer, karma killer
Unbreakable, unbreakable, unbreakable
Here's to bad cops turning cheeks when real cops are on the street
I hope you fuckin' die
Gotta make it shine like glass
How dare you niggas criticize, the way that I spit
On a sentimental noose
And no, we can't get in touch with who we're hating
But I shut them off because all they do is make me miss you so much more
When push comes to shove, whatever love we had take it witchu
And when it all goes to hell
I got the blood of Christ on a cup of ice
At night when you're asleep
Secondhanded, sick, and lonely
Your wife can't smile 'cause ya knocked her teeth out
Let the black blooded vein come to your brain
All of you, both of you, none of you
Words discoloured, bow to the bland 
Damn it feels like heaven every time he comes around
God don't you know that I live with a ton of regret
'Cause baby the memory is all you get now
You're not the only unfortunate one
'Cause you won't believe the state I'm in
Yes it's fucking political
The smiles only make it worse for you, you'll see 
Because it is you that I remember in their bedroom
I've nothing left to give
Who broadcast  million versions of the sermon for that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains,
I can't believe that I'm drowning
Feel like screaming So go the fuck away
Let us unite because of love and not hate
The kinda shit that's on your TV
I can see the lines open shutters
You had a problem with your newfound wealth
We'll be who we wanna be
And the rings fall out like a silver snowfall, Into the blinding light
It's only anger that your waking
With a little bit of dough and a pager
All my friends are microscopic
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right
When their sons go out to fight to give their lives
I was born on the dark cusp of twilight
I got so sick of being told
I'll watch you squirm
Love your masks and adore your failure
Class is in a session of regression
You gotta kill you gotta maim
Am I gonna have to put the law on you baby
Can you believe that
You know what else
'Cause the collapse you'd cause would pull us down with claws that don't let go
Now who got 'em face on money
Cause you know when my nine goes buck
'Cause you've got a beautiful faith
Awareness of our conditioning is slowly seeping, leaking
Who spoke of many powers he had
And I won't pretend
You told a lie
Been a bumrush dreamer while taking her stroll
She tried to plot on a nigga, vacan't lot one shot bitch died go figure
'Cause if we die there's still direction and
Gotta break break through somehow
I can hear their song from miles away 
And even asleep
And she says it feels good
I'd tell any lie to keep you listening
I don't even feel the pain
It'll kill us all
And you'd better think twice before you step to me and pick a fight
Ass and you ain't giving no help
How does it feel to know that your going to burn
The paychecks grow but respect dies faster
You're the reason I can't control myself 
Can I just be another risk you're running Can I
Of the war in the courts
The master said, "If you don't whip 'em, you're dead"
You can hear what's on my lips but you don't know
That the cream cannot help but always rise up to the top,
I will not drowned by your thoughtless scheming
And I will sing no more
And I'm in your mind
And six cars that are paid fo', suck my dick Hello
I should be feeling so alive
I'm sorry mama
Well can't you, can't you feel it
I know how I ended up here
And every day is another test
I am the white man, I paint you black 
Far beyond control
The powers that be let take hold a movement which they abhor
"If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to"
The shell you've built around your world lets nothing out 
So don't waste my fucking time
He ain't no trill he just quacking 'bout a knife
You are a vacuous soldier of the thrift store Gestapo
All because of fear
She'd walk on broken glass for love
You suck the life out of the new with all that you do 
It's hard to control
You know the thing you never see
I'm gonna change my immediate circle of friends
Pacin' back and forth looking savage, stop it
They throw shit in your face
We'll pass out on the couch all right tonight
Although you may not ever believe that it's so
The keys to the castle are right where I left them
È Dogo Gang e sai che mi basta un cenno
It's time to rip the chain from your neck
You think your shit is potent, but ain't nobody buying it
Go fuck yourself, well I'm real sorry that you sacrificed your time
Shrunken head, I love to adore
I break a smart ass grin
To stand up for myself
Probably feel a lot better if you talk about it, so why don't you talk about it
Shifty and EPIC, now when you be
Too fucked up to care anymore
The beat that my heart skipped
Believe
You can't bring me back 'cause I give it all back to you
If it wasn't for hate, we'd be dead by now
Hold it inside, all that is dark
Just turn it on, and leave it runnin'
This is our battle
I'm afraid to die
Burn at both ends
That odd hates blacks shades and other players
You don't even know me so don't hate me
You've made mistakes
You really fucked me Kim, you really did a number on me
Till we get 'em carsick
The glitter sores will heal themselves I'll play the part of someone else
I just don't want to know
My head's feeling heavy my head's feeling heavy
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed
I am older now, but I still remember
Maybe now you know how much it hurts
Passionnés passionnément 
Get money fuck a little let a nigga touch a little
My albums in store next to Kanye Wests
Y'all know what time it is
Send mo' pictures and make me some more riches
All I know is a  to  ain't cutting it
I failed you
Wir haben uns einfach treiben lassen wir wollten nichts verpassen
Damn, that money that we gave was just a bandaid
Shake your skin Like it's sewn with insects
In the province of gun,
Corporations turn revolutions
Your history haunts you like a knife in the back
I gotta story to tell, So kiddies listen up well
You want a way to be the same
You're made of card
I know you like me 
From Cape Town to Pretoria, to Johannesburg, there is a crying of people dying that can be heard,
I'm tired of this place and I want to go
It always stares back through the same new cracks
If they be hustlin' back, we'll fuck 'em
Put my makeup on and crack in half
So now try as you may
Tell his brandnew wife and second kid
It's clearer now
So blow out the candle and tell us another of those great stories,
You have the kind of eyes that turn mere mortals into wrecks
That you know, and I know better
The blood is on your hands
In her Kiki Montparnasse
Promised that I'll never ever lie to you
I don't need nobody, not anybody
I'm tortured, the pain's tormenting my soul
Or burn it off the Internet, and bump it outside
Me, and my own inhibitions
Have left me with an empty heart 
Fuck the rest and stab it dead
There is no progress
I know you cared even though you weren't here half the time
Find a spirit of resistance
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
I'm a bad ass bboy, two triple O
Want you want from me, huh
You'll see my teeth in the stars above
The policemen broke my door down
If it's not the defense then you're on the attack
I got all that I can do just to mind my own
My wingtip shoes, boys
Flip your shit past another lass's
Give me my money back
I never think of looking back
I've been shot
To stand up for us
We try and compensate through our troubled faith
To make me feel keep it moving
You hatin' on me, in every single way
I'm so damned
Does this job ever bother you, darkly creep up in your conscious too
Round here, she's always on my mind
Got my friend zipped up in the bag, it's all bad
Holy smokes, city blown to the bone the death server
If I don't get what I want x
I don't wanna be dead 
The label'll just throw your shit out, and got it floatin'
Peel away the shell and we're rotten on the inside
She wants you in her descent
An alternate plan
I'm building tension but not any bridges
Don't wanna live my life in misery
We both know you could deflate
Progressing like a constant war
Sky high and six thousand miles away
Tony's Touch create more gold than Midas
From now on, I'll try to look myself in the face
All your pain 
I cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin movie
And everyday I'm just testing my fate
Please don't tell me you're not perfect
And all the water in the stream couldn't ever wash her clean, in my mind
But I can't say nothing
So run, make amends, feeling torn
I'm tired of feeling hateful
He jumped into the void
Suffer not The paralysis of your neighbor
Better run, better run, better run
Push her in the snow fuck
Way you snapping' a flick
I go wild
Because I remember a lot of my friends when they we were  or 
Was not an act of war
Passengers with destination
They call me osioso obnoxious, I'd rather get fired than quit
Now I have taken control I have control
Nunca quedas mal con nadie
A lot of folks believe it though, but I'm not surprised
His power  his power growing every day
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
So quit spilling your drinks on me yeah
Can I run up in the settlement
Well now you're gonna see
Make you understand
For real you make me know and
A wall limits our life
Holla if you hit the bottom runnin'
One thing's clear beyond a doubt
 dispatch , forty reporting
She ain't made of West Coast plastic
I remember you and me used to spend
I'm like a goldfish swimming in a plugged in blender
Step up 'Cause you're the next one in line for the kill
Cover your eyes as they fire their guns
Belligerent authority, bloodied by the right to be me
Never say, you weren't warned
Oh oh oh oh, In hell I'll burn in flames
It's disappointing that you fell off well not fell off
I remember how it worked, back when we were both in love again, madeup memories
But you don't even wanna talk
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like
Yeah, I want to know
There's a law man and
I'm running out of air
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
I'm restless to escape
Haven't you had enough have you come back for more return to that plane of glass to remember what you look like and remember that you don't like what you see
What I'm trying to tell you is, do what the fuck you want
Always making fun of my clothes, telling me how hot other guys are, asking me to pay you gas money
Ladies, make it hot, girls, make it hot
And shadows form from chandeliers
Raised their arms to a leader outside
Now we've wrapped the past up in broken glass
And some say the end is near
I been wounded by ambition
Infinite voices why they drown me here
Make you sick, make you ill
And you're feeling awkward
They hear the villain niggaz spittin' with them nigga flows
Church bells are ringin', the families stand and wave
I keep breaking all the promises
And now you've gotta live with it
Girl, I remember when we was sittin' on your couch
What's forgot  ain't no eazy, no scott larock
Every president we ever had lied
Burn it off the fucking internet, and bump it outside
These voices in my mind,
You've got a lot to learn about respect
Yes it's fucking satirical
And I know it'cause the fear you hide your eyes show it
There is no future when the past soon come
I'll take a piss on a development deal from Sony, or Def Jam
Lately, I've been killing all my time
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your mercy inside
But it just won't run on lovely red diesel my friend
Prayin' to me now, I ain't God but I pretend
And turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me
She'll fuck you up and then some
You are the reason I can't control myself 
Only if I had one more time to kick
To make the life we know
We take yo fuckin' shit and live you stuck like a bitch
You can never understand
You need friends, you need help
 minutes before the end of our lives
I have arrived and this time you should believe the hype
Once bitten but twice shy
I think I would have said to go to hell and
I'm slinging blood
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
God in the flesh came
That's been stomped away from every single dream
Can't face facts needs a way back
I was livin' my life in dead man's shoes
Alright, not bad, not bad at all
Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
Read my rights and shit, it's all junk
Oi oi, I'll rugbykick the shit out your groin, boy
And you're singing
Heaven is a joke and hell is a lie, pay attention son 'cause these are words to live by
Battle back your liberty
There's no light in your eyes and your brain is too slow
Ain't got no time
To be absolved through eternal sleep 
I got a bad feeling about this you, in
I hear no, see no, speak no no no no 
You think you're slick in everyway
Pondering on if you really feel her
I'm not a nurseing protein
To a diary entry's end
I know that you won't
While driving, niggas shot out my doors
I wasn't raised to seize the day, but to work and worship 'cause he that liveth and believeth supposedly never dies Rise up, rise up, live a full life  'cause when it's over it's done So, rise up, rise up, dance and scream and love
And I won't bend, you will understand
A principality morals, maybe your standards might even make you
People sleeping in their shoes
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirtyeights
Kill kill kill for   
So sure is peachy to torture and shoot
Let them break, let them wash away
A mood that turns, a schoolkid dies
Driving me crazy
Flickers on me
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is
The warehouse getting smaller skitzing played yourself
Hey, four corners of the globe, all invent fire
The voice was so familiar, though
So far so good no one saw you
Don't be sorry just ignore me because honestly
Don't wanna hear your voice
Lass es sein lass es sein  das schränkt mich ein
You're the great exaggerators since 
So don't call me a faggot, not unless you are a friend
My dress caught fire
For this game we play
You won't have no time to run
You got a lot to learn my friend
I will never fear you
I hope it's not the last time
Don't mean we're still friends
Or drowning at the bottom of the sea
When I come in, kickin' with a vengeance
And I remember you and me used to spend
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
I've got a bad feeling about
Would you feel the way I do
So don't fool yourself you're helping with your white liberal shit
But then I made enough money for me to fund a tour
We've seen how the walls come down
Just to say what you don't want to hear
Erst wenn du woasst,
Rappers just battle me for the glory
And your untouchable face
But you know what the fuck I think is just pathetic and gay
Had enough of feelin' sick
I'm not takin' no chance tonight
Reflexes shot
I need a drink, I need a pill,
God doesn't exist, I'd rather have faith in pain
I'm looking old I'm feeling young
I put years in this shit
I'm looking old, I'm feeling young
You're rising on you're rising on
But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad
perché non scappiamo insieme
You want to see me disappear
Not every saint is a fool
This is a sinking anchor that we hold so dear
And that near death shite do I believe in a bright light
So I've kicked the bitch to the curb
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
Into the oblivion, into cold, into nothingness
So you end up throwing in the towel
I feel cold, I feel ashamed
Ripped shirt, black eye
Why do I find myself here again you disappeared
Just bodies, these golden souls
Be very afraid you've made your last deal
I'm not really mad
This is my last real bitter song
Look me in the face 
Bein' fudged by a face I can't erase and can't see
People where the fuck is freedom at
What's over is over and nothing between 
Take a piece of America back
Terminators back cause a dat is whack
Like swimming, like sex
Who you fuckin' with
You're feeling old with me you're up a creek and you don't know it
Sex, death and money, sonny
I will not leave it up to fate because I hate you too
I hope you don't feel anything when you see me
Don't wash your mind if it's dirty
Face full of war paint, strapped ready for action
Driving back to her apartment
I love my dick My dick loves me I love my balls too, it's kind of a love triangle thing we have going on I love my dick more than my balls, but don't tell my balls that because that would bum my balls out Wait, let President Leary clarify that last statement I love my dick, but I'm no John Wayne Bobbitt, you know what I mean Like, if my wife cuts my dick off, I'm not telling anybody Nobody's finding out I don't care if the cops show up at my house, with the dick, "Nope, no, not mine No, I never had a dick I'm a eunuch, that's right 'No Dick Leary,' that's my nickname I'm actually saving up to buy a vagina, that's what I'm doing right now But thanks for dropping by, fellas CLANG"
In the battle inside of my soul
So this will be the last bitter song
An object of destruction made for Madame Ray
Because you, always right, gotta fight, always wanna know whoa, whoawhoa
Flippin disco raps used to be whack
Well in a back room in Harehills, what did you mean
All alone, bawling till my mothafuckin' eyes bleed
You ass dicks had gastric bypass
I don't hate you
We think it's getting better but nobody's really sure
I've got to talk to you
Despite conclusions I drew
As I hate hell
All I want is a little respect Whoa, you better
Lemme put you on game
Yeah, I don't want to hate
So thoughtful, so gracious 
At any given time she wants to do you, screw you
Can't hide me in dark nicht places 'cause in the spaces
Keep your self respect intact
So I left it beside the road
Run through Little Havana yelling "Viva Fidel"
Ruthless wild
We americans is stupid
Ow, rage in the cage
And I fear him
No thought for me remains there
Butterfly wing crosswinds send Black Hawks toward hurricane survivors
The only chance you get is past your control
Worm teeth grinding feverishly below,
Talking to ears that have been deaf for as long as I can remember
Now y'all sayin' that's a clever nigga
I've been hanging at the end of her rope a bitch called hope
You look so seamless now
With spades and hoes and ploughs, stand up now
Prepare myself fro drowning
I'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand
Because glass to glass, street to street
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Open, you need it but I returned the point of acceptance
This must be the place, I can tell by your glare
There's too much shit in the air we breathe now
What you trying to hate for
Well, I walked so far my feet began to bleed
Down a note
But you want to be my friend
My passion's emphatic its mixed with tragic romantic instances
And didn't nobody use the phrase, "It's all good"
'Cause when I'm violent is the only time the devils hear it P Dog
Ha ha ha You died out long ago
Swallow you can't miss
Do you fuckin' know that Do you know that
The dirty bum bum, bum, bum, bum
She said goodbye to the ground
They fist and they fuck through the night
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Making unknown nuggets for the miners
To feel like busting up a Starbucks
For dancing and for singing
Wake me from my sleep
I'd like to know
I'm gonna sing the mile
Or pass the wine
You did nothing new, 
And you're a fuckin' disgrace
We'll attend to the terrified first class
I'm not an animal, an animal, an animal, an animal no no I ain't no animal
All the wounds that will not seal
You better hope you get shows, which will not happen
Nail the bodies to the crucifix
Sew our angers and our strengths
Oh, wait, would you mind getting some, um
Live on borrowed time, feel the fear in me
Because it's cold down, gold down there, crow
Every rumor's gone, I no longer doubt this shit, You�re the one
I don't want to see the plan succeed
I know that no one is
A couple box loads see all the money we spending
When I was washing the blood off my hands
Stare at each other, wait till we die
My heart and my soul they feel like I'm seven
Disrespect my love, I'ma be LAYIN YOU DOWN
Anklebiters
There's no today and there's no tomorrow
Bum bum bedum, bum bum bedum bum
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me
Beyond that man, he brings a world of pain 
Through the pain I see things as they are
While they do the weather I pretend I'm writing something
But heavy rocks are falling
Can you put the bite back into the beast you've broke, and tied and tamed
So you can help
Pretty Baby, don't you start a fight
You screamed give us Liberty or give us Death
You know who'll get the blame
Now you are so alone losing all your style everything you adore has a perfect life inside you cry and bleed
Eine Schande ist und war es
No I don't give a fuck
Believed you cared
We'll cry about this
Make major league niggaz show signs of fatigue
Some kinda simple sucker
Yes I believe that we can turn it around
Great Milenko, wave your wand
Hey cousin, en veilleuse et constate par toimême 
And his rage and her shame flow through him
Abyssinian, he had a Spanish wife
You're slack and sorry, such an arrogant brood
We hold out our hands in hope for a free ride to successful endeavors
One way or another, I'm gonna win ya
I know she makes me frown
You're sleepin' with danger
You know that I don't care
o analista passeando na Europa
If I can't square my fears
Like working for white people after watching Rosewood
Before we die
I feel like I could go insane
I'm not the man but I'll asked who was he
Don't know where I'm from
I know you can't take it
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I ain't buyin' no future when the past is so far away
It will never close, this fucking sore will never heal
You fuck around with me and I'm'a have to blast you
Hung they out a flag of war
You keep on saying that you want to show me that you're really different
You see my sad wife and my high margin of profit
All the world are fools
You must always remember
I see the boys that I once called my friends
Harder than the white kids that copy shit
Will hear a note that we playing
When there's nothing left
And join the line to march in time right back with your flock
They say, "You the devil"
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk
I know you really care X
Maybe you're not looking for acceptance
Each one a fart in the face of your idea of success
In any case there's no use in dopin' chokin' mopin' and sobbin'
I can't sleep they takin' polaroids
I piss and take a shit on your beat for fun
And now these two lay together in a drunken stupor
You'll be nothing
Don't break my stride
, ,  days a week, shit ain't funny
His foreman would pat him on the back
Stupid shit
Oh, baby, its gonna die
Let's not let us forget
God damn, it's a brand new payback
I'll be the biggest scar in your back
And I ain't even like that silly nigga
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
You motherfucker, I want your blood
There was a killer in the woods who would whistle
All my life frustrated, pushed, alienated
And if I catch it coming back my way
Won't need no stinkin' war
I can't fight the world, I can't change it
Shadowless and cold
I think I'll spit
I just had to spit you out
With love, hate, truth, you
Trapped in a world that I never made
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Don't feel sorry
Putting bullets in some guy's head for no particular reason
I wanna cook,
Are you gonna sit and watch me
Now you got a reason to be here and see it before you even die
You know I gotta go out
If it's any consolation, I guess I wouldn't want to be you
If none of us on acres, and none of us grow wheat
Count bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums
It's really not my problem anyhow
But enough is enough
In a state of shame
You can't run the race
This is where I wanna be,
Denn du hast nicht den deinen Taten entsprechenden Weg für dich gebahnt
I see the carcass in your eyes
And even through the loneliest time
Tell me what you believe Tell me what you believe
Do my dirty work, do my dirty work Yeah
Cube Drop a old school beat
And lately I heard you's a broke bitch livin' in the lower class suburb
When we gonna torch the restaurant
I dug my hands through his blood and wiped it on my face
Send more money
Jealous, it gets so sickenin'
Doctors finding out about disease
Make me feel good
Turn it from sweet to sour in this bitch
I'm probably the sickest muthafucka who don't get recognized
And that is why I hate mankind
Don't wanna hear your words
Joint in ace bands, you move to Graceland and Satan
I'll bleed you dry, I'll even fuck your soul
 Oh, shit, I ain't no "being at peace" Mao Tse Tung said that
Don't stop cause your songs on
I'm hanging on a ledge
I've got none left of my own
I just sit outside waiting for frost to bite
Whether or not you ever show up
I know I don't belong here and I think I ought to go
They came back to the world that they fought for
I will never break
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel the pain whoa oh
I remember, I remember, I remember
Don't know yo facts but I saw the blood pour from her head
Learn from mistakes and move on 
I'm not a Buddha boy
I love the pigment in your skin
And I don't know where the gun is 
What if no one's watching
Sex on her mind all the time
But you had to fuck up tha whole deal
I can't be stoppped
If you lie
Sped away  miles
So in reality I didn't give a dime, or a damn
Oh no, I don't think so, no
A played out love song playing in the background
Send it to hell
You keep spreading your message that I despise
Who've given us something more than faultlessness to sing about
Caught redhanded with a grin on your face
It feels like something
Why are the burners always toast
Soaring highs and drowning lows,
Rip through your motherfucking temple like Phantasm
I'm looking for a new solution that I can swallow I can swallow
Deal with these niggaz, let's put them where they properly go
I'll choke your friends in front of you, to prove that you be falling off
Gnaw on the bones Fata Morgana
Between the pleasure and the pain
Does she talk nice
This is a toast to celebrate the end of our innocence
Called you whore right to your face
We aim to win, made to end
I'm not one to go and start fights
Know I'll always love you
Take it up to the hilt to cover up your own fuckin' guilt
It makes no sense
Perds pas de temps, laisse nous faire si tu sais pas
It gets you nowhere; your life becomes a hit to a hit
And so now when I drink, I'm going to drink to excess
I realize I'm dead, I'm fucked in the head
Yo His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
How could they know this
How many niggaz wanna be involved
Say boom, say, me want to take off her dress, huh
Reel your heart in, run away with it
And no bombs went off that day
You love this ass, I'll copyright it
And we drive
But what the fuck you preachin' in my face about it for
That we know our kind
You chose your side, you'll get yours in the end
Now press rewind nigga
Who run into the arms
As I drive away the love songs play on my lonely radio
I wonder who you think you are You damn well think you're God or something
I don't really care, how much you cry
Need your goddamn pressure
And the head on backwards
And now I can't tell the difference
Devastator sleeps under satin sheets
But don't give a fuck who feeds us
Talk, talk, talk, talk again
And I cannot sleep without the radio on
Is just a lie, oh
"You should have known this from the start"
Make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
But we fake, we fuss, and fracture the times
You may not treat me like you do
I love to fuckin' drink
The club is all their law, stand up now stand up now
Alles was du sagtest war Das ist mein Leben
Rebellion and defiance makes my muthafuckin' cock hard
I can feel the breath on my neck 
It's like I'm in this dirt digging up old hurt
Who you fucking now
Yeah I need a place where I don't need a smile as my disguise
If you thought things had changed,
Cheat death again
Er war ein Einzelgänger
"Ladies and Gentlemen tell me what you believe" played backwards
Instead of mental hospitals
Ist traurig und schade oder abgrundtief böse
You'll be cryin', slowly dyin'
Put our feet on the ground
Needed to feel you so much 
Look through these blackened eyes
Can't you hear me talking to you
It's somethin' so ridiculous, funny, so fuckin' sick of this
Humans are fucking dumb, still thinking that Pac's alive
I wanna sing along
I never jumped in and rescued you
And now I give this gift to you
Fear I leave in the back of your mind, hey, hey, hey
'Cause you messed up good and I cannot ignore
And honor of me
Break ground
Out of the old and thin and control we spin
I know you have no idea
You know I'm trying to quit
I try hard to teach myself I've got to pass the test
Bathing in the blood
Someone else's fight
Spoken I feed my anger with the fucking bullshit that you preach
Many faces down the line
Of a generation said to burn
Are you sleeping
Next you know, you'll be bawlin' and shit
Where your grandma at She'll get fucked up too
Thorns So you want inside of me
It's none of my business if it makes you feel better
When inside we'll smoke the sky
When you've had enough
That's against the law, now he's behind the bars
My hands will bleed my hands will bleed
There's a tear in my heart where the blood ran out
Pants or dress, "Hate fags", the answer's yes
But now neither one of us will give an inch until I break
Because of you I need to rest
Horse made out of Black Tar
Again watch the rain
You never know what's gonna happen
It's not fair
But I believe in peace
No bodies ever knew
I want you to break me
Oc life is not the life for free
For all we know and all we care they might as well be Martians
And try to break me
Who can stand against me
How through your trickery my naked back is turned to you unarmed
La famille brille, mon business et sans merci
I'm callin' 'em out, anyone who fuck wit my fam'
The sugar never helps
É independente
Or resting in the Zions
You can keep them other hoes
Your self inflicted mass suicide die with the mob
Every restless night
Stop holding back 
It bubbles, blisters, burns my palms
But hey, you didn't want to make it
Dripping sex from every pore
I shake, I scream, I cry
Smile on the day of your disappearance, smoke in mirrors
Who cares if you hate my dog
You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Imitation demigods
With the S on my chest
Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
And it's talking and talking
Death is the sickest way for attention
It won't be long now
And never come back no more
From her to eternity cry, cry, cry
He even talks like Buddy Ebsen
Watch all the blood
And you will hear yourself when the rain begins to fall
And God knows what will unfurl
These motherfuckers just got wicked
Go on, take everything, take everything, I want you to
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest
Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lotta shit but I'm backing it all up
I keep clawing from the inside
For the minute a pretty face
Now bitch niggaz don't mean shit, from where I sit
When the fuck are you gonna realize
Son disposto a dimostrare
Yeah right, that nigga can't even ollie
No fibre now chaff
Come back to haunt me again
The way you made me compound to compound
Back up and a lot of weight, but now
And since pain is all I know, I make the weak bleed slow
Ah, I feel better now
I been doublecrossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free
I say sir, get your nose out of the paper
No I'm not listening
Gutters drain west, mud made a mess of us
Sent you packin', look who's laughin' now
I'm gonna kill it
Look at you standing all alone
Just let me bleed one more just one more
I might as well let the sperm, of that other nigga father me
With this wall between us
It'd break my heart but who's to say
What we don't know yet we'll never find in our books So let's spread our legs and all take a look at truth for once where wants are wound by how we're pound for pound bound to like to fuck I believe in what the conscience has ruled credulous a must, allow my heart be fooled Just as well, I'll be stuck to sell my delight in licking sweat to swallow hell, oh well I'm born, again, I'll build a life fucking friends and friends won't give a fuck for fucking is the latest trend I'll give my statue a shell, trust my unconscious is well and controlled by my hand, here it is, here we am
A rising dream, or a falling star
Not to notice
This is how a heart breaks Ooh
So niggas wanna go and get they man 'cause they can't do this shit
I like black and I like red
Everyone knows you need a piece of lollirot
Carve "DEATH" across your face
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins till amnesia
Surprised to see me Cat got your tongue
Wouldn't be caught dead working for the man
I have my life, and it's only mine
We want to be loved for who we appear to be instead of who we are
Step out the front door like a ghost into the fog
Addicted to all that shit
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass
Depression  I kicked it
I'm standing still, moved so peaceful
I am not your friend, I'm not your lover
Gracefully curved
God cannot lie
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Lick thy mother's bleeding lips
Fuck you, you fool
I've got this fever burnin' fist
Now that we've had this talk, I definitely may
A practice made perfect, matter over mind 
With police watchin, full of various toxins
Antagonizing and instigating my hate
But you don't know who you're dealin' with
Así te vuelves distante 
When a nigga wack found me, shit, I was selling weight
Mr McDermott, won't you help me to my feet 
Baby I'm wicked, crazy and sick and with the face of a nimwit
You're sour, now you are alone
It's hardly intimate, falling to pieces, out comes demons,
'Hey, fuck you, man'
Yes I always fight for what is right and put my foot down
You made me look a fool
I am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind
Pig, 'cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
In the end, makes you better
So fucking straightedge getting high off of selfrighteousness
This is the best way to die
Where the faces full of grief
Tampering with our spirits
She's my only reason now, and my only hope to live
To the ground
There came a cry "It's The Night of The Hawk
Whistling the old melodies
I am your end
Asking myself, "Bitch was this really worth it"
It's all the same game
Tell 'em we're brats and the press twist our fist  get me out of this mist
There ain't no ain't knowin' me
Louis Vuitton kicks and tricked on some sucka shit
Standing over the sodomised body of their mother
Told you once lil nigga
I go wild because it doesn't make sense
God, where the hell did we go wrong
You know I really try
I hope you're really felling happy now
I'm just driving till it dies
E chiedi alla polvere, fra', piace pure a tua madre
I'm gonna die
Erupting from the mouth of god Rising from the ashes like
I'm fucking burning
So the rest of you can stick it up your nose
At my journey's end
It moves outside you, it stays inside you
I'm gonna kill it yeah
I've even had you believing that I really, really like it like that, like that, like that
On a freight train to nowhere
Why don't you just go and kill yourself"
Madman, madman, oh
I won't try to explain what I cannot understand
For me to burn
Disguised and disfigured and you thought I tasted like rain
Well, do you want it 
'Cause oc life is not the life for me
Nothing heard, nothing said, can't even speak about it
I'm not gonna play that role
Don't wanna be that guy
College guys try to spike your drink, they wanna fuck a chick like Tyra Banks
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you
Forget school man I never could pass threw it
Them cowards fucked wit the wrong building
And I'm feeling bored
When it's my turn again
Fixate my sickness as long as there's air
And spending our lives for moments that won't arrive
We used to blaze with the bitch, faded off the lick she xrays the clip
A coded message heard
My tendons tend to rust with time while wires misplace their currents
Or get fucked up in this Bitch
We're holding back our tears
All of this talking and all of this chatter
I'm singing it proud everywhere
Ain't got nothing on you
That cleaves apart hills soil rich as blood
Those walls I faced alone
What is this world without pain
Give me give me what it takes come on baby I wanna feel right
You rose your god damn hands and fucking parted me
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts
But all I could do was close my eyes and cross my arms and hope to die
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
And I'm looking for a bit of sympathy
We may die with time
You've got to grit your teeth and try to keep them too
Rip and tear this unbleeding dead
Just because uh I don't know
ThugLife will never fail You know, Out on bail
And it feels like the only way is the wrong way
But now I'm laughing
Than no show at all
Im Grunde ganz diaf unten
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
And if this be thy will, then fucking pass me the cup
I'll let these people know
I asked for Providence to smile upon me with His sweet face
Of man's effect upon the planet
All my friends are dead and gone
Tonight's for fighting
A couple o' notes and get you hogtied in rope
Oh, well I woke up in hell today
Punk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hiphop
It's snowing in his mind
They got families and kids and it's all good
We made a promise
And I pray to God she chokes
Get him against the wall for the witness
I stand alone
To make a stand
To feel nothing at all
Broken from where we have failed
I couldn't resurrect it, I feel my arms break
My mother did drugs, hard liquor cigarettes and speed
Donc ma parole face à la leur n'a aucun poids 
Girl to girl sincerity remains
Now won't you just curl up and die
But they just don't work
Do it now, get the shit over with
Scrubing to get the dirt off
Couldn't kick it like I kick it bitch I kicks it
Joe the lion made of iron repeat ad inf
Stampede and break your chains
I work for minimum wage
Oh my God, where are we now
I was blind but now I see
You know I wish them all 
It's too much work to help a crazy
Confused and a mess I'm losing my mind I'm losing my mind
Do you think that it's cold
We now embrace all the corruption
The princess and the whore, the lady
All is fair in love and war, and love thy neighbour as thyself
Nur ein Blick von dir und ich wusste genau
Now I know that slime ballers laying out and all
And you won't call me back
The opener of your minds
To stop me from tears
I am the worse piece of this human race
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
My life's alone, x, I'm not living without you
U wearin' panties like a bitch
I don't know why, all I need is someone to save me, I believe,
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
And I don't care now what you say
Drinking brew after school, kissing exfriends girlfriends
It doesn't cry like me
Don't want you to apologise 
It's wild wild wild wild 
To convict the heart of sin
Big shot screaming, "Put your hands in the sky," 
As of the kids shunning convention with clinical disregard
They say gold paint on the palace gates comes from the teeth of pensioners
Dressed in black shit
Promise you won't ever see me cry 
'Fore it fades into black and it's all over
You fucking whore
It was your mistake but I will start again
Without worldwide belief, you step up to the mic and blow
Made a mistake, I made a mistake
I want you to trip like I do
We are the nobodies Na, na, na, na, na
Fucking fat pig drive around in your car
First eye contact yo that's the moment when you wanna die
I gotta get out no more
Where you just won't know what to do
I swore that no one
Put them back together again
I dreamed your ego died
I'll leave the luggage of all your lies behind
From disparate strands
I empty my head of all that I know
Why don't you bow down, get on the ground, walk this fucking plank
To get everyone the fuck out of your way
My father's arms
He screamed child why would you go and take my life
I cock back the sling to stone a settler
Gucci this, Fendi that
It was fucking with his head, but he beat us instead
'Cause I'm tired of payin' these high ass gas prices
And now you're gone
And the tears roll down my face
Heavy, I want it heavy
Hell fuck yeah
Take yo' notebook, yo' bitch and yo' glock
I have cried so long that I can't feel
She left behind, forgot to pack
On la surnomme l'anorexique 
And its every face seems worn and stale and overplayed
Drift madly to you
When I'm the god of failure you'll love me later, and heaven dissolves for me
I wore them  to make you bite,
Oh backstabber, backstabber, backstabber, backstabber
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
I stand around for family
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
The perfume burned his eyes
Or do you want more from me
She was a no one who killed her baby
Lets run away out of these vows of these men of structure
This is a sin fix
From every heart you break
Everybody wants to be
You design erect lines, who am I to just lie
Ayo I'm starting to face that a part of me's fake
My thoughts just keep picking shit apart all day
But we know all her suicides are fake
I laid a beating on the sleet and snow with my frostbitten toes
People like you just fuel my fire
You follow, find yourself at war
Now I can't feel a thing
Where is your courage
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
 You had better pay with real blood
So they went and stuffed god
Every mile just feels like two
Defiendes a la humanidad
I never though how was I to know
That the tears you shed will make you feel better
As the leaders that they decry
Hit y'all niggaz for frontin you caught up in that hell what
Call the police
I'm platinum bitch and I didn't have to sell out
Runrun
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Hell bent burnt you like acid rain
I've said enough
You'll lose your fucking mind
bleed bitch, bleed
It all seems so strange now
I am drunk, I am sober
He answered with his thumb,
Note distorte 
Snoop Dogg Well it had to be
But that kind of justice still preys on the ones with the stones hung around their necks
And now you reach for my hand and you cut me again
J'ai déjà gagné assez d'terrain mais je pourrais pousser encore
I like the pigment in your skin
And learn the moral lesson and marching forward to victory
Know I tried to warn you
Shinin back to brighten up the sky, many die
I am your mangy little whore
I'm gonna end up dead
We make you wanna kill cops
In back of that crime
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
When I see the way my friends gotta slave
Cause in my hood and you jump into hell and back
I'm not Jesus, I will not
Call me on the line but there's no time quick
A devil pretending to be a god
Your paranoia is starting to bore ya
Another time and another place
Resign myself to hating it, I hate it all 
It cuts like a knife
Underneath the ground
Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you
I was not honest
Now I know hallmark was right
Fade to black
I'm wandering around confused, wondering why I try
Fireworks for you The river's burning
All my rides and fake tattoos
Got hand me downs but honey no Vuitton
But now she's gone, gone, gone
No matter how close we are, I'm far, far away
I got wood legs and bow legs, and no legs at all
And can you remember how I kiss you
I'll take them out and give your new boyfriend a nice surprise
And we were strangers when you left
You suck the life out of the crowd without a sound 
I really wish you'd tell him he should go to hell
And the medics and all the passersby go back to where they came from
No charcoal breath who be hitting a stogy and not one that'll say shit to blow me
It's all we ask but instead we get our asses
So resented, so disliked
I demand I know my rights
When I was youg all my dreams seem so far comin' up was hard now I'm a rock star cause all I do is rock bars I stays on fire just look at the cars you need a hit from kells all right my nigga no prob I'm clean but dirt I'm good but I'm the worst I'm last and I first I'm blessed and I'm curst but my carrer is sorin while my life is a hot mess but the depth of y stuggle determins the height of my success I believe that wat ever billion dollars tryin' to see that wat ever billion I'm be still askin were the weed at hit lots of clubs take lots of shots of patron hold my middle finger up and tell haters to get the fuck on stay shinnen boy stay grinden boy keep these fine ass bitches stright eyen me bot now where you gone hear a better name  years in the game still continuan to make it rain puttin' these folls to shame I'm a beast
To the memories of a scream
I thought you should be warned
So boredom captured another fool 
Through the hallways of a sleepless night
Somethin' so ridiculous, funny, so fuckin' sick of this
I'm sick and tired and I'm saying goodbye
I've got hands that like to break
Cannot ruin things
I tried an idea for no reason 
I'm still not I'm exhalin'
Against motherfuckas I don't know
Red blood flowing like a flood
As I'm made to smile
Stalking the land, gnashing dull teeth, tapping our feet, 
Shake it, shake it, shake it now
I see my giant face
All we wanted was to be respected
And my fingers run through grains of sand
I want to get off one time, get off one time 
Why he and she gotta die
No wall at the back
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse
Laaf durch die Nacht scho seit Stunden
Were you always crying wolf
My brother's blood on a cherry tree
Never been Where does it lie
Wollowing in the echoes of Mlcolm's words
I found my place in nowhere
All the money in the fucking world couldn't buy me
There is nothing there
Show 'em what you're made of
I thought you was a doctor be on call for him
But now it's time to find a reason to be here
Until I believe
We work, move, and hustle with the rest of the gypsies
Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology
Faster, faster, until the Centre cannot Hold
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
Wakin' up the devil
But never to your face
It was a staple of brass tacks and wax backs
When I sit back and giggle like the rest it's the ritalinafest
I'll bet you never thought I'd try
Thirst and hunger, workday rhymes
All my friends wake up alone
Well, I move in another direction,
Or I'll call, some black midnight, fuck up his new life where they don't know what he did
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
You're the one with all the pride
Elle s'accroche aux paradis artificiels 
Do you even know what you have
Ist die Regierung erst in Panik,
And I hope she turns bitter, really really bitter
Darkness at the break of noon
And I knew I was in trouble but I thought I was in hell
Turn to watch the sun set red
A bullet ensuring the right to life
I know you really care X
Lick my licks I'm on fire,
I cannot see through the cracks
Galaxies full of nobodies giving us the farewell runarounds
The world falls down around you
'Cause I can look your god right in the eye
And realize that you got nothing that I need
We sat on my back porch and watched
Or lovers, like spirits mingling in the mist
You're never gonna see me closing in
And now Whitey's on the moon
The distances
How long I can take this shit
A new town nothing  send for the hearse
We all know what's in your brain
So let 'em all kill each other,
I'd like to wrap my arms around you like a flesh canopy
But you're not gonna stop me from having fun
We just don't feel like before
Heaven knows what you've got to prove
My nigga Frank Fuck, fuck Frank, nigga, fuck him
The party will be kickin'
Just a little more flesh just a little more blood
But what if the doctor was evil and very, very mean
 I'm not involved,
Then that would mean the government's god
Thinking fight, fight, fight
Like some crazy TV show
Politicians and gunmen
You're diving face forward into a antiquated past
As long as I want you, baby, it's all right
She made me cry
Even Rocky trainer and his wife said you can't win
But I really want to know what she thinks of me
Reminding you of our true romance and
Kicking like a little bitch in one of Dibbs's mosh pits
Can't you feel me
This message will be briefthere's nothing much to tell
'Stead of lagging now
The clouds carressed my sky and smoke
The restless consumer lies
Bitch, I'm a monster, no good blood sucker
We're not the ones who made the streets unsafe to walk at night
Should I black your eyes again
And even if we try and not become so overwhelmed
A a a so get understood bot I am from the hood boy came up from the dirt selfmade hustler I'm a beast I'm a beast
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces
End this fucking bullshit life
Hablas que con el planeta van a acabar
Your attitude just stinks, you cowardly little shit
I'm divorcing every motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
How do you want me
All I see is these niggas I've made millionnaires
God damn hoes, here we go again
Eazy's dead now
I want to make you bleed for the things you did 
When we're dead they'll know just who we are Na, na, na, na, na
It's not quite right 
Could fill it back up right now as the tears fall from my eyes
I'm a mess since you cut me out but Chuckie's arm keeps me company
Cause ain't a fuckin' thing 'bout me pussy
You say that I cannot leave you
Watching the expressions on the faces
Fake me break me shake me hate me take me
Walking on fire, feel the way the world's inclining
Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
To waist this love on no one no half of you
I think I'm losing my mind but that's the way that it goes
She will not let you go
Ignore me in the parking lot
Naw, they can't keep tha black man down
I don't wanna talk to you anymore
There's blood on the good book, love in the bad brook
Like a bitch in heat
He ran away with my best friend
Sick of bullshit preachers
Just the way this would end
I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me
But if she keep on disrespectin' I might just
The pains of man
I wanted so bad to be your girl, I tried
Please believe me
Who the fuck do you think you are to have power over me
You've got nothing to say
Is there nothing that remains
Now you're gonna make me flip this switch, I'm gonna make you my bitch
Got enough guts to sew trash and bust up your fluke act
Hand in my clutch, gun in my lap
Shout shout, let it all out come on, let me shout, shout let it all out, these are things I can do without
I am every fucking thing and just a little more
Rip rappers a new asshole I never hesitate
But it makes no sense to me
Oh, you know how to smash a dream
The dope fiend splashes gash like a nailbomb
I worry about how this album will sell
But right now I just don't like you
Not right, I'm not right, you're not right
Whoa I should hate you 
Hush, just stop
Have been known to ride the rails
I don't know why I feel the need to lie and cause you so much pain
It's the reverend from the church sultan of swish and swat
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
The skin around every city looks the same
But if you'll be my enemy
This time I'm not lying
There's no telling how long
And after this black winter, the thaw
The drinks have faded along with her good words
Segregate the mind
Sayin' sorry is my problem
Left before he raises his fist to smash all the lies he thinks I've told him
And don't talk about war, when niggas know that your puss
You know what I'm talking about, dontcha Dammit
To make a poem sing
Another dead end, another lesson learned 
Because you've got no time
Hope he never comes back,
But I'm still standing
As she stabbed her  times
Oh Zion please remove your glove
And now I ain't buyin' that
And better than the oxygen network
I shoulda known I was in for it
And I'm thrown around the room like party confetti now
And if another fan asks for a photo while I'm snacking on my pizza lunchable
Act like you can't tell who made this
Another broken promise tips the scale and it goes pale
I feel like a monster, oh
It's the awful truth you fight for your life
You can say what you want
If looks could kill I would've never had a chance
Watch the dance as they dance such a pretty dance their legs are worn down to the knees
I fired my weapon
Dalle mie parti i torti restano
Don't want to hear it, don't even want to think about it,
I hear Mama they got her working on tha Payroll
You left your blonde wig in the car
Don't ignore the 
Never mind the fools who know what we're getting into
I keep my smile warm in case they turn the camera on
What I'm capable of, Without their bullshit life
And in my mind I make perfect sense
Little bitch wants money to burn
You made me such an asshole
You're all going to die down here
The boy I love, he, up and left me,
Hot enough to melt the ice cream that's on Gucci's face
Some say a comet will fall from the sky
I've seen it all before the way you disagree
Hey now, all you children
Lot of fools, lot of fool scum bags
I don't wanna say
And do you know that you are saving me
No, nothing ever shames me
Giving up control and buying into fear
Then I'll turn and walk away
The war on terror, war on drug, now everybody have vices
Always move forward
We are the thorn in your side and the bullet to blow you apart 
Virginity was torn Soon babies was born that was half white
That's me with the holy ghost
My tears have faded, all hope of your conviction
With his crying statues and his flying bomb
I do not feel the romance
Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry
Come on now, come on now
You tell him that I had a skin full
Laß die Mädchen bloß in Ruh 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
'Cause the Serengeti's bleeding
Another day, some other way
How does it feel to be down on your knees
It just sickens them what I consider fun
You say you a good girl that's no fact, can't roll smooth 'cause your axles cracked
Turn your back on me, and I'ma make sure you get it back times ten
Y'all don't know what it's like bein' born with stress against you
Poisonous seeds of bad apples
You know I'm sorry darlin' don't you cry
Naked and cold, nothing left to steal
You'll just love the way I move when I dance
The end's just begun
Oh no
When truth turns
Forget the black man, neglect his baby, ignore his hell,
And throw rocks across a bottomless lake
Sure enough it don't take that long until they find a reason
He told me that he thought we were sellin' out
Dancing while the blood runs out
Who doesn't have a wife or a girlfriend in a closet somewhere
When all of your friends refuse to be alibis
And I think if we got back together again,
Evil, evil, quit while you're even, evil, evil Evil man
I want to know, exactly what you, exactly what you intend to do about it
Don't pin me up Don't you know my cross you'll never carry
I know another way
Do you wanna go our way
Kill the motherfucker
I kick you back can't say that I'm able
It was you, you're the fool
And there's no future for England's son
But that's the way it is and it's the way it's always fucking been
Then We watch the other two die slow
Ain't that nothin'
I erase the lines that you mend, "I've done it before", I said, "I'll do it again, do it again"
Needed to feel you so much
I just made you up to hurt myself
Tarantulas, burn flesh like a nine glock
She doesn't want to
I've been writin since P
And there's nothing left to burn except for ourselves
It's not without reason that accidents happen
Mommy was a living single queen with a lot tee
And I will never bother you no more
We can all kick back and we can laugh tonight
But every time I come, only a few could understand it
Feelings of love became feelings of hate
You're not the one but you're the only one
They'll whine, they'll bitch,
Just watch the reversals
Do you remember
But it's not
I let the dogs loose then I let the dogs sick 'em
That's a lie, lie, lie, lie
You wanna act funny
In the end you're gonna wanna pay me
And though Her eyes still held fire
You see I don't have a calms day rest
Done dirt cheap, yeah
Twothirty AM talking to sleep inside that diner
What left to do but complain 
Say hey Mr driver man, don't be slow
Under the floor where I stand
Man can kill and man can drink and man can take a whore
My heart cannot be found
We americans is dirty
'Cause I don't wanna be
And each desperate drive
Disconnected my XBox and ditched all my friends
It's a motherfucka
It's not gossip if it's the truth
And erase his name for good, don't you know that I would
Had his finger on the trigger; just about to end everything
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I wanna live in a bubble
And I'm nothing at all like you
I've got to get the fuck out
Johnny Rotten popped an Oxycontin, nevermind the bullocks, oh
They give you life, and in return you gave them hell
Go 'head playa boy that's how you get shot
The prince opens his mouth he vomits shits and pees
How familiar
These kids is wildin'
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
Met back up with the boy I love
And that seems pretty damned American to me
'Cause you've been lied to and humiliated
Man I work hard do you really think its lucky
I never thought this would be such a nightmare
Left wing violence, right wing violence, all seems much the same,
Lookin' back at my short life, the few pleasures that I've found,
There's something disturbin'
'Cause I know that I won't be away long
But I'm not looking back
Got no selfdefense
When your world comes crashing down, I want to be there
Maria says she's dying, through the door I hear her crying
E ad andare con gli scemi le tue chance iniziano a scemare
It's truly mind blowing, I can't deny it
Bent out of shape from society�s pliers
On your brain I induce pain, so I'm insane
And the worst thing you feelin' the blood curses
I have been working all of my life
Life burns from the touch of the reaper
And everything that you touch in this life will simply crumble and dissolve
If you're really mindless
I'm your darkest fear
Heartsick
Give me a hundred grand, give me your watch, give me your chain
Comprehend the ways of man and under a flag
So go ahead, go nuts, go ape shit
When it comes to sex, you know my motto yes I can, can
Just death to thousands
You drive on my ass
They continually blow my mind
Of the game
This is the fence that turns one into two
But I'm telling you why so don't cry baby girl now it's time for you to be back on the right route
Oh I am a fool when I need you, I'm a fool to believe
And now,
But you, you're nothing, you just need a dad
In these days I don't know what to do
This is the break up song
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life, you can't blame me
And I may not be able
I wrote your name in my shit across the town to warn the kids of your bloodshed
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
And havin' lunch and brunch with the motherfuckin' enemy
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I'll tear your mind up, I'll burn your soul
Stolen land  and we're not through yet
Our struggling faith,
The way it is does not have to be
You're disgraceful, like getting caught pissing in the sink
A fool among the scholars
And I am no longer afraid
Don't you come back no more
Let's break a smart ass grin
So I won't have to feel like I do
Time it just passed and we had some laughs
And now you got to deal with the niggaz that I feed, greed
For five minutes at a time the power held true
That you were standing in the middle of an open grove
Vielä tästä nousen
So if I stick my hands in others blood am I sick
But then you're shooting me down
Our ghosts were made of good that got in the way
'Cause you know damn well if I was fine
Though I run into the twilight Incomprehensible
Where you think you can run, or you can hide
Mistake the pain I feel inside
Send 'em to the seventh level
And then she reeled me in expecting nothing more than kissed necks and quick sex
Her chin is wet with someone's hate
Quitteront la banlieue pour Paris 
It's war 
I can see you're new to this, you don't know the rules
Aight, man, whatever
And I don't want to play no more
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
Rocce, vedo muovere la bocca, ma non sento niente
When the party finally ends
I stay diluted to avoid the pain
I can't believe this happened
Throw your rude insults against my face
Practically singing it, the song that tears the world apart
Get outta my face
And now I have no shoulder on which to lean
But you know, but you know
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
And you made an island of me
And my brother, all he needed was his drugs
You fucking sweater neck, feather peck, rosetta checks
The kissing of feet
Oh shit
They say jump, you say "How high"
Left robbed, unwilling Can't fight the feeling
The ones that can lie to your face
And I hate everyone
My shoes have been stuck with glue
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
'Cause I am not your savior
But brains and wearing all black
You just tore all our kisses right in half
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
The lord god almighty, creator of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen
I made a word to give this state a name, this game a guess
With scars from breaking shell
The sky went offwhite, it snowed for fourteen years the sunlight splintered into all our darkest fears
Don't want to feel this pain no more,
And buried the pain inside
No more fear
But though the masters make the rules
Now your brilliance no longer shines
Stab the devil in his belly, took his Pelle Pelle
Got this creeping party doubt
So fucking sick of your politics
That's all you gon' do cause you niggas is punks
Living on borrowed time so I'll die tomorrow die
Oh, now baby, please
Our boys need something to rape, I want to taste you today, like kids kissing
When I wear my Mary Jane's shoes,
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about that mom, but uh look, I'm kinda busy right now
Well one day you will look back on your life with just complete disgust
If you lie you don't deserve to have friends
Speak English or die
Who's ready for war, I'm ready for war
Get this monster out of my head and stop wishing that I was dead
I want you to take me
Try to remember how it felt
I know that everything can change
I am not dead
And they keep finding more denial stuff There's a doctor now, I'd like to see what size he is, a doctor in LA came up with a theory that being fat is actually a virus Ah, I guess I'm the asshole here, right Cause every other virus we know about is a flesheating virus the common cold, AIDS, cancer But he's the found the one that makes ya bigger Okay, yep yep yep yep yep That's all the fat person in each family needs Now we're at Thanksgiving with the fat person going, "Well I'm not actually overeating AHHMUMFMUMF, I'm trying to keep the virus at bay, AHHMUMFMUMF" Look, I'm trying to help here, okay You have a choice it's either me, or Richard Simmons coming over to your house, okay He's gonna cry and shave his legs, I think you want me, I really do I think I'm the better choice And there are definitely signs, folks, that you should stop eating Let's make that very clear
My freedom is best, whole country's on house arrest and everyone's a suspect
  Just another name in your little black book
Ufo's and locusts sing the same old song while the weathermen get retarded as the day is long
And I never bought all that shit on love anyway
My perception with no conscience 
Super double agent, shoot your mother with my brothers favorite
Ten million opinions in your skin color face
I should have seen my end coming from a long way off
And what I'm goin' through, shot lipgloss through my veins
I'm standin', in a shadow, hating the world
It's a rat, it's a rat race
And my mind feels like I'm about to erupt
And I know now they're our heroes too
Mais j'ai crié mon innocence, demandé de la reconnaissance 
Those who betray all must fall
When you walk by a group of quote unquote normal people
I try to maintain, the pain is unstoppable
I want you to, to kneel all day
I'll break the top off it and shove it in ya ear
Soon enough we'll be the
Feeling so damn humiliated because they looking at me like I'm hell bound
So you pretend to reason
You broke the rules but I should have known you do it all the time
These motherfuckers stepped on me,
Don't strain, 'cause nothing ever comes from it
No there's no such thing as an unjustified existence
Live hard, die great
This twisted mind
I love you to death
And all my love was left behind
Face down in a cell in a pool of piss
You love this ass, so just take it
Blow in the face of my rivals
And I plan to get on your little sister just as soon as I give her a call back, oh and you know what else
I'm leaking the blood of a fool I'm full of it, I'm full of it, I'm full
Little droplets of oil for bracelets Little jewels
Gravid with madness
All our efforts seem to fail
No escape from the mass mind rape
You can fuck a man, mack a man
Be a soldier, what for
It makes you want it more
We never bleed
Is if you think I give a fuck
Can't you fuckin' read
You're not the only one who can smell fear
With what I want to do
I never meant to make you cry
I don't get it You know, I just don't get it I missed the fucking point some place The boat left and I wasn't on the boat Explain it to me Heavy metal bands on trial because kids commit suicide What is that about Judas Priest on trial "because my kid bought the record, and listened to the lyrics, and he got into Satan" Well, that's great That sets a legal precedent Does that mean I can sue Dan Fogelberg for making me into a pussy in the mid's Is that possible, huh Huh "Your Honor, between him and James Taylor, I didn't get a blow job till I was twentyseven years old I was in Colorado wearing hiking boots, eating granola I want some fucking money right now"
Some bitch was like, "Hop, you got me crying
Spreading lies spinning stories
 'Cause we want to live not like a fucking dead fucker
We're back in the barrio and to you and me that's Jingletown
Died with your belief in me so who the hell am I
Hey God, I believed the promises, the promises and lies
All my fault 
Evil siren sings
And if ya didn't know
Don't need no more boxes I can see
Chorus x Willie D
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
A non com observer  I assassin the collector  defector 
Cherish the fears
And sunk her teeth into breakfast
But that wind that blows across your room
And all of the lies, and bad things they did
Some love just fails without a reason"
And I wanna be a local face and play the social game
Before the smile starts to blend into one big bullet hole
Expirations are needed, I facilitate the end
With your eyes turned up above
Get the bird, catch her, shoot her, I don't care
Cypress Hill, breaking you off a pedazo
Please nigger find me a glass, no
You can have him, I don't want
You filthy liar
Home's only home till you're sick
>From a nogood man like you
Never thought I'd be this way
But I don't think there is no reason
I've got a bad feeling about this
That's what you get for fucking with us
Looking at the ocean  sail reflected in black eye 
Though you made it clear from the very start
Black heart pumping discount rates
Kid Creole killed all of his own people
It's a rat, it's a rat, it's a rat race
Everybody knows you can talk all day yes
She'd want a cloud that's *floating around*
And now it's time for me to get
Non mi abbasso a certi schemi
Rip the quality control from your burrows to your borders
When we get delayed can we cast a line towards anyone dismayed
You chuckle to yourself patting yourself on the back as you scoff
Believe in neither but fear 'em as well
When you're talking to an idiot
And I fell into the beauty of another
I cannot answer that now We're gonna have to remain as technicians come over
I feel sad for you
I can't stop that fight
Please turn that fucking radio off
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
You'll beat me with your bitter lies
There'll be no more cigarettes
I can almost reach it now, now, now
Either I'm crazy, or the black Slim Shady, or
We've got nothing left
They got him in chains
You know that I know that we're infected
It's a fucking crusade
Now you've grown into quite the man who beats his kids and slaps his wife
We want your oil, we want your land
And I try but I can't and I want to so bad and
And then you realise that it's nothing
You'll return
Start bleeding, stop breathing
But I'ma let you know now
In a Betty Crocker oven that I will break
I'm a junkie and god is gay
With a bullet in his head 
Entangled beyond all my control
But it seems like I've got everyone fooled
The devil's on sugar smacks
A witch will burn
Don't ask me why, you know the answer
He made a decision
A rat done bit my sister Nell
If you wanna fight with us, you've got to refuse to please the game
Yes, it's all over now All over now
I hear her crying too
Spill his blood between my jaws
Want this my love your mistake
You was brewed up, booed up, ready for a new fuck
It must be this fucking dark winter weather, I torture myself too much anyway
Lost soldiers coming home
 revolution incomplete,
Lend a hand to hold you down
This is how it has to end
Ha ha ha, I love this shit
Whether you levitate or bend spoons x
Do you want more
I woulda shared eternal time before I left
I wanted you for nothing more
To hell with you
Yeah my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
Che sia un sogno o sia un intento
Involuntary servitude and slavery it prohibits
Let me touch you now
And Jesus drives to Mexico
And Romeo wanted Juliette
You wanna make me sick;
Is that a way to treat a lovin' woman right
Tired of giving, lend the tools to rebuild my life
There's an innocence we look for in the stars
It's simple, soaked, and always on my mind
But the emptiness is more than I can stand
Listen to that bass Rhymesayers entertainment
We're a schizophrenic race
We don't need to know the answers
C'est dur de ne pas être rancunier, business is business homie
Run away, run away, run away yeah
Is just the time that I'm bleeding you
When there was no giving up
If I wash my hands in others blood, Am I sick
The die is cast, the scene is set
A cutter in a forest of industry
I gather strength to spread the disease
No noise can shake me but I feel me breaking
Tell me, how does it feel for ya
Take your rapture blister burns
I know you're faking it
Tongues touch, feels like a gun bust
The lies, the cries, only the
And I don't know, and I don't want to know, if she floats or drowns, if she floats or drowns
I had it all made
Burning rubber into the end of the dream
You fucking eat shit, you filthy shit
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you fuck you fuck me
Guess I'll talk to you when I get back
Piece of garbage with wings and she has the guts to sing
Some of them slang guns when they six years old
You lost control of my life, you want control of the rest
Someone's gun is laughing
It's your fault
Blinding me with smoke
Home grown vision compliments the senses, opens up my mind
Better back off if you know what's good
We've been missing long before
But I hate you
Shut the fuck up
Fear I leave in the back of your mind,
Faces made of wax
But God damn I'm the biggest fish with the biggest mouth bitch
I don't know Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore
The world I know aside
Colorless men and ladies of the world unite
Ohno ohno
What would you cry for
Mä oon isin pikku tyttö, se on musta ylpee,
I drown the fields
Losing ground to the things that matter
uns manipuliert, uns wegzensiert, uns exekutiert,
With only one match and one chance to burn,
But god knows, I didn't wanna be alone
You black people still thinkin' about voting
Remove me
Everyday  I hate it
I'm a living shadow in doubt of shape or size
You have no time for that anymore
And we're treading water now
Stand up now diggers all
U talkin' like a bitch
As the blood is dripping
You used to be such a loyal friend
To all the suckers on the block talkin' shit while I was locked up
And when I die, won't you bury me
Now I'm with all of my loyal niggaz, breakin the bread
And I'm real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
Though you maybe made it clear
You're bleeding
Single, no more, no less, stocks rang, yo
I'm gonna break his face
Who's this that lies under me
A free ride just to bleed me dry
When there ain't nothin' left
Consume me with your shameless want
But you don't show compassion all I see is a killer
Oh no, you got me in a headlock
For knowing this
I broke my crown while kissing little flowers
It means take a fucking walk
They don't believe in crime
On est né sur le sol français contrairement à nos rentpa 
All my friends ain't got no voice
And as the vicegrip choke holds
Battle, battle, battle
I believe that morality's gone
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
On yo knees like a Bitch
Whatever man never, never, never, never
I get a feeling that you're doing it on purpose
From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black
The coward who lovers kill off inside
Oh Baby You just want me empty
Live your fucking life and give me respect
Them niggas psycho how they ball
To laugh or cry
This motherfucker thought the coochie had a padlock
He'd go to work, he'd come home,
I'm not a Christian or a Jew
Starfucker, just like my daddy, yes
I know what darkness means
Sunshine has always been an enemy
Don't you ever try to bring me back
Don't know just how I got so low
Away from all this violence, live inside each other's head repeating
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
And I know first hand so well all the high times you direct
When he died, looking in his eyes, glossy as he cried
I'm sleepin' in empty pools and vacant alleyways
In a black hoodie, nose bruised and a gold tooth
I thought you should know
It's payback
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
I had a good home but I left, left
Despite your pseudobohemian appearance
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'm at the mall, buyin shit, like hot dog on a stick
You smell the scent of something burning in the kitchen
And the message coming from my eyes
Quand j'vois le score du FN, j'me dis qu'on peut contrer ça 
My life is back on course
Your episodic aphorisms plague me like the poor decision to play the disinterested listener I'm like the old child that's grown an earachefull of manipulated tones, tired pragmatics that practice spitting verbs at their perfect prisoner And you navigate that skill with an aristocratic arm, yeah, you brew your toxic fantasy with predatory charm, you are an atheatric amateur who drools over every word but can't memorize one single part And you'll get what can't be got, ain't gonna never be received If you turn your back, boy, then you'll never leave
But in the end, what leaves you broken
Not now
So live it up now
They'd stick it in your face 
You had to rub it in my face
No body's getting in, nobodies getting' out
Concrete and bobbedwire, babies screaming
And I also don't go for this other thing now, with MTV being so big where you get a band that gets a hit video, and all of the sudden they think that they're like icons and they can tell us how to feel about environmental issues and how to vote and stuff You know what I'm talking about Like REM "Shiny happy people" Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Pull that bus over to the side of the pretentiousness turnpike, all right I want everybody off the bus I want the shiny people over here, and the happy people over here, okay I represent angry guntoting meateating fucking people, all right Sit down and shut the fuck up, Michael Don Henley's gonna tell me how to vote I don't fucking think so, okay I got two words for Don HenleyJoe Fucking Walshokay Thanks for calling, Don How long's your pony tail now, okay
And know that I'll always love you
Man, fuck dem muthafuckin' pussy ass niggas
Like candy sticking to my teeth
I got a rock and roll life
I know what I did was pretty rotten
Holding on to let them know
Then you turn the other cheek till the bruises fade
I don't want to follow you down
Another empty promise
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night
I got no desires
You know these fucks have the balls
Think it's time I got stinking drunk
And Dublin in a rainstorm
We have a struggle of wills all for black swollen pills the semiconcious thin lines my fucking truth so fucking blind
The city's not the same,
And talking shit will get your neckbone disconnected
Rise out of darkness
It didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it
No hope or faith
Always darkest before the
You give me stomach pain
Understand it's all about the Bengi's man
No, I want to be more than a pretty girl
As far back as I can tell, I think maybe it's because
If this is today  well, what the fuck's tomorrow
PCP  a PC police victory 
Without your fake teeth in
You know what you know what
Keeps us always returning
Just one fucking thing
Well, who is working, who is not
Europe's gravestone carved in plastic 
She's overbored and selfassured
The rage of Angels Yeah, uh huh
Don't be afraid the threat's not for real
Now you roll alone wit no one to bone
You wanna go, son
Tell me when did the light die
True like friendship
A kiss in the shape of a bullet
When I write my bitter songs
The failure which brands
Got a fucked up equilibrium
So we decided that it would be in your interest if we put you somewhere 
You said you're working for it, but are you fighting for it
Oh, you catch me if I'm falling
Erst wenn i woass
His mother's bad
Oh Look, man, we just gotta get some sleep
You know I wish them all
Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
We'll squeeze his goddamn brains out
A sample of the battle we waged against an animal
Your shit's like chocolate cake and 
If I am just another girl
Yeah, I wanna say nothing, nothing
Telling lies  I kicked it  I won't kill myself
It's like I concentrate on it real hard and it just doesn't work out
Smoking the bones of children
Distrust is my middle name, self hate is all the same
A little game of who's distracted more and
Jetzt ist er explodiert
But love is passion, may love is vengeance
Forever and ever since this cold black world began
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Seeing the first star burn white
While playing on the ignorant storm
Where kisses rot and die
A thick lock and sheet rock is on my windows in the kitchen,
No, not chewin' poppin'
I will never tell a lie
They want to take away my emotions
Gargles in the rat race choir
Everyone has a different fight
I work my fingers right down to the bone
And the air is filled with shit to breathe
You know I'm kinda glad Nixon died
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Brother john saw visions of god
Fuck you asshole, yeah, bite me
I wake early in the first to help supply the second type
You know how Uncle Sam treat it's veterans
Psychiatrists play god
I start to cry, I start to cry
He's calling for backup
And say that death was on sale today
Nice spite work, the fancy knife work
We end up right here my friend
A pussy is a piece of skin wrapped in a pocket
Laugh at tits, slappin dick, in yo' bitch bitch
You talk about peace it's a very strong word
You ever had a friend kill
Kendrick, And I wear pendant on my shoulder, soldier
The fire
You're not mine
And I hate to say it, but you're perfect together
Tomorrow call me the fool
A long time ago before the ice and the snow
Silver steel towers stalk rolling land
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin'
I feel like I could loose control
Will I burn at the stake
Your tragic disco
Do my dirty work, do my dirty work, yeah, come on
Did you want me to give in
And I know it's hard sometimes, 
Ain't no hoes fuckin' wit this bitch
Nnnow that don't kill me oh can only make me stronger oh
To make a trap for fools
Torn reflections of burnt out trash
The feelings, the question, the price is too human for fucking sake, this is
And it knew not to swing
Just to get in my face
It's time that we rocked three daunting nouns
Halite rock salt tastes salty
Make it hard as it burns
But I wouldn't have none of it, no, no, no
Know that I'm just fine
And all this time I never thought
Heaved into the ocean to drown with your brothers, your brothers
Everyone knows they need a piece of lollirot
We never doubted ourselves for a minute
I'm singing you in every breath I'm left to heave
As I wake in my sleep and it's you I hold
Who the fuck am I to say
Well it's the man with the plan to get all your skins
I made the mistake of trusting you
Yea, though I walk, I used to fly, and now we dance
I'm talking cool, calm, dominant phenomenal, monitor face to the wall opposite
Whoa Tell me what you believe
Walkin' barefoot cross the floorboards
Rassistische Polizisten oder Saharasand
A mother fucker like me don't give a fuck to say
Never know, never know
Long ago if not for my condition
Say lick my face
Seems to describe every part of where we're at now
So sing for the moment,
A way of saying no where we'd always said yep
He says I run and then I run from him and then I run
And I can watch Good Will Hunting by myself it's cool, it's fine
And world war is the battle cry 
Sometimes you still think I am crazy when I'm sane
To feel the sand between my toes
But nothing will grow
Carved in hate, carved in hate
But I'm not going to let you go
He wanders  he wanders across the promise land
There must be some solution but I just don't know
She was good for one thing and that was taking the rock
They told you not today
Oh, She'd just shut up and do what she does best
Dancing wildly
Another , children were born into this world
Taking all you need but not this time
Your art, it brought me to my knees
I'm so relendless
Will you need us to fucking show you that we're harder than finding a fucking snickers bar in whole foods
With their buttersoft skin and their curly hair
It's easier to bow than keep these knees locked tight
And as the final sounds of battle disappear, I had to say,
My faith has waned
You handle shit sloppily, I drop a ki properly
Now you say you know how we feel
I must say I commend you on all of your fire,
To live or die
And I never eat you unless the fucking, meat looks fresh
You didn't get the message
"It's cold out here"
If they ain't never heard of it, ain't nobody trying it
I nailed my faith to the sticking pole
Why 'Cause I think it'd be best for the who To hide the mess from who
A million bodies piled to the sky
Now I have taken control I was taking control
This is what it feels like
You lock your minds up, shut the curtains, you close your ears
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant
And wish that it was never ending
 Go ahead and cash in your antiwar songs sucks
'Cause you know about that, aw aw aw
You know someday I think you'll
And the whole world sucks
So this is how it feels
'Cause I don't need new problems today
It doesn't matter
And you know that it hurts
All right now
No matter how much medication
A light that burns to reconnect my heart for what it's meant to give
I go wild
Like American companies that did business with Hitler
I don't understand
You can't miss me, I'm white blondehaired and my nose is pointy
Just to fuck you up
Sink her to the level of the rest of us that inhabit the earth
But then I thought
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Just let me die
I want you so bad tonight
Jerking off with god trying to run peoples lives
This is what you want this is what you get
And take your sorry ass
Hello sun, hello blue sky 
They said it's all you want
Not a single soul is breathing 'cause the Serengeti's bleeding
Goodbye dad time to make amends to me but you don't see me
I need money,
They killed the last man that had proof
Set free your fear, it's a perfect day
I got the minerals
That you're the selfish shit
Right through the rest
Neon black flames cook the calm air
Embrace the wave
Help you move furniture
Keep you against my chest
That bitch, the cinnamon spider
Keep your head down, go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums
Blistered and bloodshot,
Love makes me want to melt down
And not two hours later there's a song up on your website
Now you're crying on my phone
I don't know what's wrong with the youth of today
My fist'll break a fuckin' boulder in half
That he don't give a shit about me
When you aren't here, it's got to know
So before you put that Red rag in your pocket I wanna see your fckin resume
Someday you will see my face
A disease of the mind, it can control you
Into a world that you may not remember
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning,
A threat, a break, a mistake with the pulse
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
And watch it break
All my scales For your own selfish wants and needs
I'll never understand
You know they got me trapped
And they pretend that they are sleeping
Tell your grandmother to stop bitching, load your bong up, take a fatass hit right now
A lover, a fighter, a saint, a sinner
You're just a baby in the back seat 
Hot tears come splashin' down
The tricks, the blessings
But, Lord, there's gotta be another way that's better than
'Cause I can feel it "In The Air Tonight"
Every time you think you're talking, you're just moving your mouth
It's us, find power
I forgive you now I'm moving on
Truth and lies has consequence
I I we're not thinking my stromata
And lay the barrel to the ground, hold the gat steady P Dog
Into the sink of your faith
Say, "Fuck you I don't need you  get out right now"
Woman like a man, woman like a man, like a woman like a man, like a man
My flow is too fast, you can't contend with me there
Is it in you now
Show me that I'm not the bad seed
Are you happy now
Devour all our pride lead us to disgrace
Trapped a loose cannon
I consider her my blood and it ain't come no thicka
I'd go through hell for you no matter what,
I love my smoke when it stinks
When I watch you I'm proud
I found myself on Forrest Road
Ooh, I really hate your ass right now
Wings of the arms when you heels like Pegasus
Motherfuckin' rats,
Drowning in a sea of rage
Blood and disgrace
And I'm not living without you
She told me she was pregnant and I pray to the god
I took your piece of shit for real
Everyone you love, but does she loves you back
It's a violent pornography
You better watch how to talk when you talk about me
Or the animal that died just so that your wife could wear that minks
You kick my foot under the table
For the sake of escape, to turn a knife on itself,
If I'm wanted for leaving I will leave here alone
It's an inside joke
White kitchen walls with a thousand windows
But it's all you want
You fight from the day you're born
One way or another, I'm gonna see ya
According to you you're a god fearing man
We are all angry, angry on the inside
I walk around town with a frown on my face
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh
I hope you feel it
There's something about this psycho bitch'
No matter what you did or who fucked
People rising from the highway 
I give it all back to you, yeah
Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Devastator violates with dirty fingers
Military confrontation, safe sex, and masturbation
Didn't turn out just like they thought
Copters break up house parties
Well let me tell you this, I am shamelessly selfinvolved
Will you fight or will you run
I'm not living without you
Never went commercial, Never TV screened that shit
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
To save your disease
Jetzt wo du für immer verreist, werd ich noch mal zu dir gehen
My banger is great, it split the top of your dome
Tomorrow, I'll know I'm just dirt
Well, I drug your ghost across the country
My life I'm feeling so sick your life
e le coscienze si disperdono
With all the foods you hate
You're not so sure but you heard it's great
"Leave my fucking life alone"
I got to get on with living or get the hell on with dying
Perhaps he's got a shot and now he's dead
There would be no music
In and out is like this it's like a fist
When the madness stops, then you will be alone 
I'm kinda mad and I don't wanna pile up the anger
And a thousand times I've thought again
Wear your disguise and I see right through
It's a nonstop disco disco ddisco ddisco
Uhha I got my mindset,
Something spreading in my veins
As soon as you're born they make you feel small
Don't ask me what I want from you
So in  they already had control
And you must stop that damn track from going
Been slaves since days of Julius Caesar
Oh someone stop me now I can't do this
Don't smother me 
How could I let you play me, I don't even know
I can't help but believe
You're staring at me from across the room
No it's not all true
Dependent deep ended friendship
Soldiers are cutting us down
My girl's knocked up we're in love
You're not that smart your not so strong
Got their sorry asses stapled to a goddamn desk
So muh'fucker if you want this encore
Let them split their tongues to doublespeak again
Fuck silence, fuck that
To the same old pain
About who is running this mess
This is the cause, the root of my anger
When angels fuck and devils kiss, I'm sure
Kill, kill, kill x
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
George Bush doesn't care about black people
We're the bullet in the middle of the belly of the beast
Whatever makes you happy
I'll remember it
You're the new disease of today
At least you could just let us die
And then shit down his neck
Do it now, I told you do it now lets go
There is no one here but loneliness
Fiending all the foes in middle
Hey, you're not rid of me
That raised its branches into the sky Every branch of knowledge
Oh, that's bullshit, baby, you just want rid of me
I'll break all my strings, stop playing shit
I ain't went no where
She stopped to see herself in the mirror
I'll hit her with the mother fucking branch
There's no blue left in your eyes
I run from love, but seem to feel the pain
My old girlfriend's studying medicine
And ever since the s I think something's in my Tylenol
I fuck up everything but let me explain"
Lend a hand make all the right moves
All your lies are bound to break your neck now
And in the end you'll never ever ever
I'm not passive aggressive, but I had to leave
I'ma keep mine tight
Raised their arms to the leader outside
She said "I act tough, but we both know
Don't need to be taking no children into this abuse no no no
Another nigger used to make another buck
Down into these desert veins
Is my back all that bad
So I won't repeat it no more 
Get me the fuck right out of here
Makes you believe, makes you believe
That's man who says it's your turn in the barrel
I've been hanging at the end of her fucking rope
You thought I'd be crawling
The Unites States wants me for what Hahahaha
Well, go on and dig your holes in this ground
I'm trying not to hear your lies or see your makebelieve 
I love to watch you tear it up
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore
Sad little boy, I know you get confused
Tar and feathers hide your feelings
You're under my skin, fuck
If I won't speak her name, if I won't face her grave
Get your forced confession, I am fucking lonely
The blood is coursing through my veins
A holy war  through your veins it courses
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Waiting in the ground
I am feeling weak again so please rest with me
Law and disorder is all the media choose
The thought of slavery far behind
Even if I'm not serious
You wanna be the master of yourself
You wouldn't like that Oh no, oh
You know what I mean
But she told us where your safe be it's what I know
Ask the angels if they're startin' to move 
Then they could ever try to fine print on the inside of that warhead
A burning heart deceived me and you really put me on,
Just to drive me wild
Choices made
And if I grow old, well, I know I'm gonna be
In a betty crocker oven
Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't apologize so much
Even though the car is cold I feel your body heat setting me on fire
I don't fuck with no phonies
Oh, do me a favour, don't put me in the dark
You say your hands are burning
Two grades below, she pierced her nose
No crooked spine no tornup rag
I'm not afraid of being sick
But I changed my mind 'cause he's broken the law
So find a man to fit my shoes
Ain't nothing on the air wave in the despair we feel
You and me were best friends but I'm the one you talk about
Makin' second to none shit, nigga like Quik
Wanna be somebodies
Whyeeieei do I cry when I say Good
Kill smokers through blind vanity 
I know you ain't blind and I know you're aware
I swim in blood
I can't even beat my dick without getting convicted
Keep your teeth
Deep in the ground
L'armistice pour les nôtres qu'il la fasse signer à d'autres 
Has fingerprints that belong to you
Two thousand years of babylon rising
Mama Mama Mama Mama I couldn't say no
Talkin' 'bout the Moron Bros, tattooed fingers tattooed toes
D'un passé lourd de portes a casser
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
INC niggas what's fucking with me
They'll make you kill
If my father was still alive, he wouldn't stand for that
That I've been messing around
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Don't you wonder why we never talk about the future
If I was naked and screaming
Crossing my fingers and my t's
Is love an infection or a sick addiction
I love the way you kicked my face in 
Oh, ya sit all alone in your rocking chair
I can't speak whatever I can speak
So you can see the faces of everyone
They'll be no surrender bender in effect,
Got guns for the strength they lack
That I do not want to do
With a smiling face
When the smoke settle
Just thought you should know, nigga Ooohoohoo
It's just because my frown
They're runnin' this here town
Land sharks stole the tape, money money booze
This time I'm not coming back
My swag makes the ladies wave like fat stomachs with bone ripples
Cover up everything you know
What ever we want
But you're still spitting fire
The sicker the quicker, thicker, the fatter watch 'em all scatter
Just get the hell away from me
I can't say, I've been drunk since noon, kaboom
Sighing and humming and watching the clock
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
What you see is not our sight
Why you don't notice your folly
You try to find another way in
You can try to pretend, you can try to pretend
You shit lover, offbrusher, jaded, bitter joy crusher Failure has made you so cruel, you
When I don't like what they talk about
'Cause what I got to make a knot, is very hot
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Uh, now, it's the opening salvo,
I can't understand it must be crooked
För att bli skjuten i bitar utan att någonting märka
I know
Listen, I don't give a fuck what you believe most guys don't want you to see
But it ain't far to fall
But when I'm in my car, don't give me no crap
'Cause I still want to be the mother of your child
The bible tells us Jesus Was a rockstar
It would've made a mess
You can't help deny forever
Griff is back got  on it black
Checkin' out the punkass creepin'
Dreams where the TV made 
It's not my fault anyway
To the chest I bust Then we ride till the sun come
It's moving back to the sea
What about those times you left me alone in the bed, well I didn't mean it
Cramer dans nos clichés, renfermer dans nos carapaces 
Do what your mother tells you and put down the sheriff's horse
You're gonna die tomorrow
When the fabric of life is a horny goldmine
See me coming through your party hard without no bodyguard
So urban, so infantile, so angry, so young, and so poor
'Cause they know the only thing that they could send me is cheques
But you turned you back to me
Do you really want it all back
Passer à l'urne afin qu'ils cessent de nos casser les burnes 
Your turn now
A black flag and a red star
The root of the problem has been isolated 
All hail the rest that never gave a motherfucking shit
In Vietnam a lot of niggas died young
We drowned them all in their swimming pools
Reality fired her wooden bullet, splintered under our skin
On peut pas nous l'reprocher, quoi qu'on dise ou qu'on fasse 
I'm not what you want
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Enough in a way that I'll probably say you destroyed me
Just another day in the city life
That run's down the th street intersection
We don't need your fuckin' war, so get your asses out
You love this ass, want me to make it
In combat  attacking since way back
Emotions they suck,
Cut out your tongue, effigies are sold 
I've got to burn your eyes
And Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran
No more cheat n' lie
I hope you see my middle finger from the stage
I believe in love, I'm married to my work
Praising the devil they said
She leads me to the edge of my own frail being
I'm killing everything you know
Is one to put me to sleep in such a way that
Pasty, dirty, sweaty, faithless
Just an employee of the country's real masters
Transcendental illusion
The incredible, heterosexual, credible
You never liked that necklace 
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Why don't you want me no more
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
Was I not what you thought I would be
I hear the dying screams
I know you used to be him
You rush in a game of lies for need
Ask my pop, "Can you solve it", this game, I'm bleedin' to stay
I don't wanna wait
No, no more your life
There's nothing special about it 
And now we're lazy
When I choke
E come dirlo allora che non serve
And lives that hide in scriptured lies
Oh, you don't even try no more
I'm the land you kill for in the name of your kind
I hope you hear this song boy 'cause I want your life to end
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
Lets see just how imposing you can be to me
Keepin' warm
Already made the news
Come on, gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground
You feel helpless, real jealous, we killed Elvis
Enough is enough
And if they don't know then tell 'em this
I've never killed nobody
That won't ever seem to break or bend
You build up walls around you
A failed attempt to capsulize a feeling
She said, "You've been pushing me like I was a sore tooth
Or get the fuck out this bitch
What we're dealing with here is a total lack of respect for the law 
It's not safe out tonight
In these days the beat is militant
Heavy crystalline 
Well, your kids use drugs, same difference 
Now I know it
Instigate the beat genuflecting in the steeple
Way they planned it
I can't get enough and you know it's righteous stuff
Soon the drinks have kicked in
Counting out my sins on rosary beads
For no cause, no cause at all
I couldn't keep her clean at all, every dealer that she called was a friend
Laughing aloud at your expense, fed themselves on innocence  knife in your back
And tellin' my screamin' mind what to do
And the evil inside you is my revelation
Do you know how they prey
Produced by your god
Even restored Man is cattle
I'm not no animal in the zoo
Go on, get back to where you belong
Now lost, replaced by fear
Your brick wall it stays up
Disciples of the watch
Let her sink
And Juliette wanted Romeo
Confusing what is real
I just wish you'd get the fuck out of our hometown
Whoa, oh, oh The grip of fear
Our cities, our farms, our factories
How this broken down machine pretends to try
If man makes death then death makes man, tear the torso with horses and chains
Alert the masses
When he sucks you deep yes
We will fall
Why does it feel like
Their twitching never ends
Antagonism rising
The end
Rants and fictions of violence
At the thought of being stuffed in my home
And when I scream, I will scream until I'm gasping for breath
Missed the bus I'm pissed as fuck need fifty bucks got lots to find
Where I am stone and you are glass
No more sexstarved teachers
There's a shiver in my soul each time you try to break me
I remember when we used to want to hang out
Fuck tha police
"Last person in the world you wanna fuck with" repeat X
From the th police office in Sao Paulo is investigating it
To make a dent on ignorance
And the gun's in my hand and I know it looks bad
I got a fresh pair of nike shoes
Sie verdienen einen besonderen Schutz
Did you pass 
It isn't in your fucking Paradise
Your fingers string me like a pearl
Hunyak Uhuh, not guilty
When I come back like Jordan, wearin' the 
Your darkest little lies
 Well she was asking for it
Où je reste ici, ou je meurs
When I'm lonely, yes, I know I'm gonna be
Let's put this work horse in gear
Like a motherfucker from hell
And the blood poured off the pulpit
Told you not to hang around
Bridges to bridges, you're nothing to me
My leader told me to jump in the river
At times I feel like my whole life's a rhyme
I mean shit he bought you things and gave you diamond rings
Hottest masturbatin' off the back of the neck of my soldiers' rhyme and
We are all sick
Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow
Hey God I really don't know what you mean
Are your memories pleasant,
Speak your mind and tell me something
And I might just fuck up the place, a disgrace
They wanna ban us on Capitol Hill
So if you're gonna lie
Because the drumline's going wild in the San Francisco streets
Said one thing and mean another
Though awkwardly unnamed
She wants to be a fallen angel without their swollen scars
A knock on the door brings no smile to his cruel lips
Which make this mother fall apart
A disease of the mind it can control you
Nuuh not stopping now
I wanna see it when it's comin', so I can open faces
We got the mother and her kids
Then amidst the noise of a thousand people's talk
I got no life, I stay in the attic
I hope you get all that you really wanted
k for a verse, no album out
Take you away from your lies
Suicide  I kicked it
Love can't be forced as you know
Won't you say goodbye now
You needed someone to depend on you
Why do I feel let down
Fo actin' like a bitch
But I don't mind tonight
Souls burn bright
I made my own world
And now you're gone, gone, gone
I wasted half my life on the thought that I'd live forever
You've got to break out, you've got to prove you're alive
Now there is one less tongue that will bend to say your name
Where did my money go
A police pig in every head
Time will not erase
He's just damn bored
Popping shots through ya rearview
I'm the ghost that grew from the ground, 
All I ever wanted was to be like you
You leavin', wasn't part of this plan
A chainsaw
For the creation and cultivation of the plant marijuana on the planet earth
Beg until you cannot speak
It's no bad mood
Comes directly from God so there ain't no holdin' me down"
It's a nonstop disco
So sorry
And it's wild wild wild wild 
I keep a wall around me, block out the herd
I dare not ask, I dare not ask for more
Grand dissonance
And I scream as loud as anyone,
Looks real cute, her lips are sore
Oh my god there's assholes everywhere
Before you sit back down
Asking can't you see 
You were dark blue
Illegal business control America
I see you crying in the sunshine
Temptation's page flies out the door
I got poor eyes and sore eyes, and no eyes at all
Give me blood
Wait, what are you talking about, WE decided MY best 
Don't give a fuck if she lived
Alguêm me chamando, dizendo meu nome
So you can live to face more punishment from my divine lips
And I believe what I do'll come back one day
My deck is stacked, if I could only get my shit on wax
It's fair to say, could not believe my eyes
I'ma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit
You lie to yourself 
He said, "Son, remember where you came from"
It's not the first time I've tasted pain
Ich reiß' dir die Gedärme raus
I don't mind if you read while I'm coming
Breathed hope into our future, before he died, he smoked the sky,
I've got the love that's strong not weak
I know you're gonna leave
And I told her "Sorry baby, but I'm not the one to blame,
Blackout, it's gettin' dark in here
But if they could talk What would they say
And another exwife
The subconscious is burning
Yours are not lives I would save
Do you know how they play, how they play inside you
What would you feel
Of this honest fool
As the crowd shouted, "off with his head"
Suck, suck, suck, suck
You make me hate
Strike with a serious vengeance and before you die
This bad coffee's filling me with equal parts joy and rage
You can try to fight it
I can't stop thinkin' bout what she did wrong to me
Now that I'm getting closer and closer I know that you feel it
You know you're being used but still you play along
It's life or death
Lke if he had a shotgun
You take back what you said now
As the new master twists the nuclear screw,
I am down on the ground, yeah
To erase yank crime
We've all been fucking each other in bathrooms at parties
Slum teasing
You're my ball and chain
If you ain't got no chains
And no one promised you
Layin' down, suckin' up
Hold back the day
I've always said after we tear it down, burn it to the ground
To be back in Glasgow again
I want them to do this to you
While preachers preach of evil fates
From fake motherfuckers to my future I'm trying to get in line
Je weet dat ik dat liever niet wil horen
You don't even know of the shit that drivin' me
Was there nothing in that promise
So that my hate can be heard
I use the back of my hand
Instead you made it with him
Tell you I got fire
The building and the club you niggas know how I pop off
Cyanide in bullets, so I should follow my stats
I don't want you to be alone down there
I need it in my veins
More bereft of life than an old jackson pollack painting
But my heart is a whore
It's not so bad and anyway
The wasteland to maintain sing cavaliers by name
On the Island far away in a place where NOBODY know
Would you break me out and would you help me
To be the man who walked a thousand miles
And when you break our hearts you toss it out and never miss a beat
A knife of relief, from all the petty insight,
Now I know what a fool I've been
Instead of fuck him up to me fuck him up
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Across this big wide world
A life of guilt and pain, of holy misery
Why they love you when I hate you when they hate the way I love you, solar 
Yeah, the war is the enemy of all mankind
I don't know who to trust Tell me what you believe
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it, checkin' the 'male' clicks tongue twice
Lost my faith in everything
A massive offensive you seem to me obsessive
I taught you how to cyclops rock and then you turn around and break my heart
I want my money back
He will not stop
Shapeshifter, guest lister, big faker,
Die little baby screaming
It makes me mad
And rested there on you
Life burns
Not endearing to any one
That said the things I dare not say
They say jump and you say how high
Into another cerebellum
And she's shakin', breathless, holds her tongue
All of my memories
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me
As your wheels hit the gravel,
Your grave, it's your grave
I ain't trying to be another one on the list, that'll make me a true son of a bitch
Im Badezimmer rauscht die Dusche
These niggas think they sick I come and kill the infection
Gotta fight back and reclaim what's truly yours
I can't even help my little brother,
To feel you squirm
It's neither sweet nor bright
Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
Into the air, into these walls
You got nothing to say, gettin' in the way
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
No it's okay, you know I'll figure it out, just leave me alone I'll figure it out 
His lips an' eyelids black
You're not getting through
No pipe did hum, no battle drum did sound its loud tattoo
They had the run of the house
All I want is to see you in terrible pain
Whoopee, two holes in my neck cause you like me Bite me
You're a sad little cliche, you say sorry
Killing friend or foe
Hate  and fears
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word
I'm gonna fuck the whole state of Illinois
But you're not the kind who would be waiting, not for anybody 
You want a piece of my fucking time
Project war, spill the one verse four
He stayed behind the assembly hall,
Just a little reminder
Take it how you want it but your bitch is on fire
Your enemies and your choices, son
Might our anger not find a better target than ourselves 
It's the breaking of the circle right at the start
A little closer to the edge a little deeper in the mud
Answer me  answer me
But as I was talking, I couldn't look her in the eyes,
Your man power, I sabotage the fire flys
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
Ill bust, if you act all determined
Well, I don't mind dying
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'll fuck you in the hole
We have shot them down from the skies above
I am a fool I know, I know, I know
Every time I turn around you're there
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open
Cause yesterday don't mean shit 
Absolutely nothing
And there's Veronica and Charlie
So don't try to be nice and don't you try to pretend
'Cause I'm the gunshot
We still pretend
Accept this red shit that drip from me
To be taken back to younger days
Mary's got some deep shit, Mary does not forget
While them that defend what they cannot see
Empower me forever
Please, just remember me when I am not around
Ask somebody Trina been the shit on the streets
And I don't really care 'cause this is my life not a game of poker
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It tell me just what to do to spend a chunk of this bread
Then you walk on, I'm running after you
'Cause I'd have left otherwise
Splinters So you want a piece of this
I've covered them in blood, but this
Every scratch every click, every heartbeat
Could it be that I'm still hungry, hungry
And there's no one for me
All I can say is "I know I'll find a way"
You just don't get it no
Oh, I don't know just who I am
Enough blood in these eyes
My emotions more fear than rebellion
Pain and misery my only friend 
As minutes pass we keep on dancing on our graves
While the fat lady sings
This is how a heart breaks
Does that mean I'm burnt
Oh fuck
I thought you were a better man
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
As long as your mouth is shut
I can always break but I can never bend
denn er wußte noch nicht 
So pass me my rose tinted glasses again
Well I'm not gonna sit around just waiting for you to get over him
And you didn't see the rain you didn't feel my pain I was left inside with no complaints and with lies you feed these fuckin' guys though you know she's everything you'd like
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
In the end, makes you better, yeah
Right now whoa
I I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
I'm no musician, but the pain has been instrumental
I only wanted to be somebody
I decide whether you live or you die
You say you're feeling lonely
Did you sell me to wanderlust
So assinate me bitch
Oh precious wife
Step out of the fire
Vague is the flame that used to burn in your eyes
And you know it
There's a crack in the blank stare, back in the black raised hair
The dull, the dumb, the dirty and the dumber
We've underestimated 
Obumbrata,
You would leave us only the more upset
I'll shut you up
The workers need ambitions
Do you only want me 'cause I'm gone
There ain't no doubt about it
With a peanut for a brain and volleyballs for chest
Fighting back the tears
Dizzy at the falling stars
Hush my baby go to sleep
I guess not and you don't deserve it
Just wanna' run away today
I go wild, 'cause you break me open
No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
They're not home to find us out
That puts an end to their days
Is this supposed to break us
Worthless denial across your face,
I'm starting to wonder if you really believe
Ten seconds left
The grace of falling snow
Okay I don't know what else to say
But that's the only way I know
And I'm feeling bored 
And I know that you're trouble but,
You will feel young again
Just burnnn it down
Oh my god hardcore kids everywhere
Is there more to this than I can comprehend
Nevermind him, he's not here now
I don't believe you'll change
Heal yourself with sinner's salt 
Cry on a pillow, weepingass willow
A noise, your phone is ringing
You're not welcome here
This ammunition never rests
And want to fix you a dream
Yeah, foul play nigga
Another cheap shotgun in your Benz
I want you to make me
Just like they want you to
Sure enough they'd both go out 
Saw you fake it
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
You step in my way, well now I have a little more to say
Now I'm on the run, I'd do it all again
Pretend you're the daughter of elvis and you're married to
Niggas be shootin' the gif like they for real
Running through inside your knees
Afin de replacer nos amours
I watch the rain
Snap your fingers, snap your neck
But don't inspect it after dark
I cannot tolerate you
Turning you on to a world full of shit
Well, everything you look at dies
To sit and witness your illusion before you burn
That's why they giving drug offenders time in double digits
You want me to bow down, lie down, accept it and die
That new style, break ya off like a chicken wing
The tunnel two thousand twelve the way the shit packed up
And I'm wild
Somebody said each day's God's masterpiece 
On my hotel t v, turn it off
 I became what I hate
And I can't help myself, should let it go, wanna believe
Think I'll drink the sea
Don't fuck around this is how I make a livin'
As hot as the block as cold contradictions
And now I see that I don't need friends
Trying to remind us it's time to awake
We sit her and hope that it passes by
Of course not, I got no mercy for no one
All you have is yourself and your mind
The bitch, who told us 'bout the bricks exposed us to the nigga
And I'm like no other guy
I think I sealed my fate
And I got a habit of gettin' away
And I should have known
But straight away you just moved into position again 
God bless no one
Soldiers are gunning us down
What kind of love from a nigga would black your eye
Fear and a snare hell has eyes
Now say you hate homos again
Tell me where we stand
Who will remember me
We'd hate to see 
Until they run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
So don't you dare mess with my mean machine
Till working it out
But I know your master plan
Lot of knots, lot of snags
dimenticata in qualche oceano
Like such a stranger
Can't forget the war mode
We should have known better than to trust
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
Fools think they killas, they own a
Put your mind over matter
I am bending over backwards to get close to you but still I feel so far
My rage burns deep inside me
I'm sure she doesn't know 
Means my Grandmother's gone
But they're helpless here as babies 'cause they're only here on holiday
And showing up to church half drunk
You'd have to be damn near dead to see the nights I been through
Hey, do you feel our pain
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
I have the scars to prove the clock strikes with her hands
I hate the way you look
Doch dann fing es an mit den Sachen die war'n weniger zum Lachen
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living
And you don't give a fuck about me
You poisoned me through and through
Do you know when
Happy now
Her tongue was like a scythe
The ballot or the bullet, some freedom or some bullshit
I pined as days went by, but now it's fine
I wonder how much shit you'd talk
Lie  don't lie, x
Everybody wanna be some fat tycoon
Excuse me, Mother, while I scream and shout
"Next time," she said "I'll let those people choke"
You've got money, you've got fame
Is passed over looked over 
And my lust returns
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
Now it's fucking gone 
There's no god
You fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun
And I want to see you when you're on the deck of that ship
I make hoes pop collars
For as it was written my friend
And make mistakes
Deep sleep covering
And in this decay I find another day
He'd rather be doing something else now
She's shooting up the junk again
I wanna hear you say that
Scared the shit out of me
Push me over the edge
Telling lies, alibis  Selling all the hate that we breed
Dmx, swizz beats, uh, double up
If you wanna sit with me and talk about existence
I feel my meditation so deep within
Well you can't say nothin'
I want to get off
Accept me as I'm not, and that's a shitfit
Needless to say That you've got problems
And said it like you meant I wasn't a woman
The more I know the less my tune can swing
Severing every animal
Stomp stomp stomp on the bodies below
Blood roses, blood roses
Hair in the blood, fly in the disappointment
I can't feel my faith
And you know
'Cause I ain't dyin' in the middle of nowhere
I'm not that girl anymore
Feed you lies
What about cigarettes and alcoholic drinks
But that was knowledge we weren't supposed to have
 You know she liked it
Watch another burn to the death to the core
Many miles away
Betrayal is a sin
As the world hurls towards seven billion more listeners
Oh look, they're trying to bite the helping hand that feeds them
Now it's on, pow, what you to do I'm askin' you
A passive aggressive, you didn't get the message
Another load of shit about how it's never been
It was just two miles from here
Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong
If you were a woman and I was a man,
Grew up to be and do all those sick things you said I'd do
I'll stop worrying 'bout what you're doin' doin'
The last call, ballin' up my palm in a fist
Out on Bail You know what fuckin' time it is
I don't mind seeing your face around, but we can never speak again no no no
We want to, have to, need to 
We know you got 'em, we know you got 'em
Another suburban family morning
Down Now we agree and understand
Real niggaz, biatch, you know, ha hah
She'll turn around  you'll dis her
Because I'll finally touch what lies behind your walls, I'll make them fall
A little bit closer
Can't recall my crime
You might as well be talking backwards
To rush baby don't mad I'm sorry can't you see I appoligzle
Reagen plays the lyre  the flames are burning higher, while the world burns down around you
And no one's gonna save us from the lies
Oh God I wanna hear you say
And now the world is full of sorrow and pain
You're so full of sin even the devil rates you
So you could go to the opera, dumped all of my girlfriends
Still, I lie beside you
'Cause I'm a prank call, CopShot, just for kicks
That there is no race more human
I can't remember how I got my last scar
Do you want me
You drive like you're in a tank
A les paul single cut away
Stab me in the back, preney
I'll be there for you as long as it works for me
Theirs just no point
Opens up  all you can see  knowledge to be
I'm sorry for the time
Time to ask if you're alive or just pretend that you died
I'm a negative creep
I've come to bring you to hell
See the world inside out and scream it out loud
I'm not buying what you've sold
My quija board told me I should go back to bed
I did not shed a tear as I watched the snow fall
My mind gets filled with rage
And waste my cyclops time and mess up my cyclops mind
But much worse to hate yourself
Me and that sweet woman got a license to fight
A break like this is hard to find kid
Don't mean nothin' anymore
Well, I don't care now what you say
When I peal the blind back, up jumps the iron cough
Never feeling normal, can't accept the truth
I got no love in my heart 'cause I'm heartless
Taste the salt of my tears
When it's all burning will we see clearly
But I don't need to hear your depressing remarks
Pretentious fucking assholes everywhere
You can make me wrestle naked
I'm bein' attacked
BSide of the single "Old before I die"
Meet the lies and see what you are
Streetwise paid the price never enough nothin' to lose
He's right beside me when I fail
I shout out loud
It's another tidal wave
 You know it's real because
Just another day in the city life, city life
Take what's yours and leave the rest
I don't need your shit
Close your ears if you don't want to hear
It's no mistake
You lied to my face
Never say no
While you were selling your soul you mess
Skin against skin blood and bone
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against
No body had been capped no body had been killed
What you got yourself into Great Milenko, wave your wand
The motherfuckin' world is a ghetto
From the boys in uniform  now you know whose side their on 
It is you I set my standards to to every walk of life
No one took time to comprehend me, or even ask me what was right
Whispers in the walls I hear
Just let me die here
Well I'm not afraid
I want you
Tu non lo fai perché sei delle Marche
Breathin' for me now
How you really feel
As soon as you put that gun in your mouth
Ten years from now I'll be paying still
Want you want from me
Who's next that wanna ride who
But them things wasn't worth none of the pain that he'd bring
And I know your coming backwards 
The people that you know are the ones you hate, the ones you hate
I'm sick and tired
He's life's on the line with anxiety now
Or degrading and dirty
Italicised lies, headlines, bold type 
Get ya drink on, we build the bombs, spit in ya face
And there is a hell
You turn on Winston in the den
I got a rock and roll band
Is she gonna say yes Is she gonna say no
Every time that man struggles and fails
Chun King, not home
He's just eighteen for now but he's going to murder us all
Like a lieutenant, and the coupe tinted got pulled over
On my life, on my head, don't wanna think about it
That I'll never end transcend transcend
That forest burned The radio
I don't know how you call that love
But the rolling papers for your grass 
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut
I want to see you fucking dead
You promised me another dream, another day
No one will accept all of me, and the fire will stop
Your lonely ache, I can make, disappear
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
There were demons with guns
Dictatorship kill off inside
It's just a pity about all the redneck fucks
Courtroom pulls an about face
"Now I can taste the war that I've been fighting
In theory I respect your right to exist,
I dress to die, aw ,aw, aw
Right now, somebody else has that number
We need help, we really need help
Ain't no way for a boy to be
I wanna be a stupid and shallow motherfucker now
Y'all be killin' me
I'm sorry I don't swing that way
This is not culture
Complained or assumed
I'm not a virgin but I'm not the whore you think
Fuck this I won't bow to you leave your chains to me
Face to face with hopes of longer days to build on something we should save
This is the beat that my heart skipped when we first met
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
When I'm standing top the bright lit city
We'll do more than talking someday
The weak are the liars, the strong think too much
But the boys run away leaving blood on the pavement
Until I fall into a dream instead
Where she gets the habit
My hate for you defines my lust
Where is the courage that
I don't really want to be a pretty girl
Let's sing the death song kids
What the fuck you think you're doing to me
I can't pretend, that I'm fine
Keeps you always believing
I think it's time we let this story end
Sayin' we left the hood
Get me out of here right now
Don't you know I gotta get away from you
To get our fam in other lands to understand your pain,
I'm not afraid of looking ugly
Barely got the time now
So back out bitch, see how we knocking the most hard
What the fuck do you got that'll impress me so I can feel half of the magic
I think I sealed my fate
Darked deeds to marry mine
Where everything that I say could just kill it all
Girls on a free ride to an open grave
I don't remember
I gotta get this shit off my back
Hey man, you know I'm really OK
And that nothing can be taken and that nothing can be taken from me
My life is a game, my life is a shame
When wicked thoughts come inter alia
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes
But it feels like something's missing
The beatings will continue
I'm burning
People call me Strokes, aka you know the Iceman
When what you don't bite you write halfheartedly
Turn your anger into lust
I guess there's no one to blame
About the mess your clothes made
The heartland ma'fucka, sippin' whole milk ma'fucka
I had to wear a paperface
She was lying on her back
Und diese Kinder führn uns ans Licht
And pull the ground right over you
Then we would be relieved
Ya dis me and I'm a dis ya back
Pretend it works a while don't try
Go on get back to where you belong
And the forests belong to the king
And if you ever said you missed me then don't say you never lied
What a disgrace man and you know it's true
The matador in black, killin' bullshit allegories
In a year no one will even care
While my medication's kicking in
Bit heads off those who fail and try to imply her
Freddie Mercury
Feel no shame, feel no shame, feel no shame
Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces,
Genocide, revolution, lost souls, prostitutin
Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
But I got 'em back
Crazy talk, I fucking love it
Moving like a hunter through my back door
And then you watched me fall
Hunting to find the answers
Tell your husband that his screaming just invited it in
Everything you say's gonna turn on you in some way
En unión con sus hermanos 
I never thought that it could be painless
Under mass hypnosis
You're not dropping me loose without a fight to hold on for my own life
They'd have you believe, everyday was halloween
With this hungry girl 
I'm in the same old mess again
Else's mind
No angel of love takes another man's gain
I don't give damn, I don't give damn
And the trees are on fire
You've got to know you'll burn in hell for all the lies you've told 
Another industrial ugly morning
So far from roadmarks or homecoming games
I could've saved some face
Or could chose to be moved
It's about a faith
Ah, but now the tables have turned, my move
The lava of a volcano
Or the way you talk
Do you ever cry
I've have been working the treadmill
For those we've known
Woman like a man, like a man, like a woman like a man, like a man
To runaround kids in getgo cars
And gold lines no lead streets
I'm not saying to go out and do some stupid shit, commit crimes
I'm not sure I'm prepared to write it down
With soul and my goal is to bring a little passion
And if the blood on your hands turns to water
I'm a fucking ill, trill, kill at will etc
It leaves me bored and black inside
Slowly moving from bending to breaking
All its innocence
I haven't drank or smoked nothing in over twentytwo days
The reak estate is not to blame
You can't just work it out
And you know what they say
And your mother got scared and locked the door
I can't sleep until I see you sleeping
I be hearin' these niggas
Feel my pain
What you want from me
Of an SS whore
Thing to ever hit since LSD, hallucinate while I dominate
Twist your fingers up, grip your balls
After your second LP sends you directly to jail
Abgefallen von Gott bin ich der Versucher
Will turn and look at me and say
You were left behind you weren't watching' you were sleeping
And you were never a good friend
Control the audience
'Til you died but you're still alive
Everybode wanna be on a tropic honeymoon
This is only temporary, no
You never actually get a grip of my lithium spit, saliva acid trick
Can we run away
And your Valium counterpoint bullshit excuse
Everyone ignores you
So why don't you suck on the end
If that is how we let it burn
Jones house, cough without the bones
With any thought of you
You know however cute, she's a monster in disguise
I am too cynical to say I don't give a fuck
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
Too tired to fall for that
They think the south is like a planet of peckerwoods and bozos
Ich pflück' dir Gänseblümchen, weil ich dich liebe
Oh, big grey mother, I love you forever
Lead protests, kill women and children
The one who's bed you sleep in
Jesus saves Domi shoots and scores
You can do anything you want
Dig me in the white stone gravel
"Hopsin, I fucking love you, 'cause you supply the best rhymes
When I rolled your fat ass over you were nervous and scared
Super demon seed running wild and below
Please write a script that's made for me,
Ask me why you feel deceived
Hey you know, sometimes I go down to the club
The gentry are all round stand up now, stand up now
Why and how you had the heart to fuck up my whole life
And don't forget to give me back my black tshirt
A bass beat transforms the level of the street
I want to make you bleed 
Damn another alamo
Where no passerby can see
Well, maybe I put too much faith in the accident
Money can't buy skill flinging at will
Is a land where the sand's made up of crushed up wax
Now you look so seamless now
Who looks vaguely familiar
She'll turn around  you'll trash her
To die nameless on my floor
Dinner's getting cold 
It's so hard to find out who you wanna be
Willemite turns green with cobalt nitrate
Fake a face to make the kingdom clean
Shit hawks abound, in the town of bullet dodging
My morals left to decay
You listening I don't care no more
Saw heaven and hell were lies
We can hear the black out orchestra singing
Causing head spasms
I am the whiteman and I paint you black 
Take in the sights, feel the breeze
Repeat  till end
Silence is golden
And to all the girls from back in high school
Fight or flight, who gives a damn anyways
I can smell the hunger, taste the angry air who resurrects this
There was an element of grace
Asking can't you see
And the life you lead is fake
Under my skin For your own selfish wants and needs
Lockin' us up I got a feelin' I'm
Worried you smoke too many cigarettes
They know all the names of your relatives 
If I did it fast you know that's an act of kindness
Oh, this is what you get, karma bitch
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
I submit no excuse
What a life, I watch it like a scary movie
My heart is filled with disgust I'll tell you what you should see
But the more I turn my face from the crowd,
Driven by hate, consumed by fear
I just want it to be over
All the fucking clergy men
Fuck the glass we pump the keg
We'll bite the hand that feeds
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
I attack all the lies
To suckup and give out
Where kisses go to die
And mires me down with velvet arms
They're buggin at the eyes 'cause I got mad styles
And I fired two warning shots
And make me feel the danger
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
And I spark a fire for the cold in the dark
But I didn't know the meaning of pain yet
Suffer not Your neighbor's affliction
I'm on fire I'm comin' around I'm on fire
For the creation and cultivation of the plant
Goin' fo' a nigga neck
She don't remember shit Just the two hits
I'm getting sick of it
As the songs scream to fill her quiet evening
Now you know, now you know, now you know, now you know
Take it pull my hair back My hair back
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
They say the road's a dangerous place
But I know there's someone that loves up above
Take everything left from me
On the verge of knockin' muthafuckas out for no reason
Been traveling on the road to nowhere
I am tied to the ground
Got friends but I just can't pretend, I'm alone
Provoke the ravenous mischief the counter rhythms are rowdy
While money doesn't talk, it swears
The West scratches onto my skin
And judge on subjects muthafuckas read about
Shadow whisper, breaking chalice
Chico Science talking about a folktale from northern Brasil
I miss the warmth of the summer
Ain't no one safe no more
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you
I'll bet he will die of loneliness, yes
But this is not my trip 
I want to know if I'll heal inside
Break your fuckin' face tonight
I don't give a fuck
We're passing slow, we're passing slow Slow, Slow
How much more for power Hands tick towards devastation
Done dirt cheap
Taco, oh, young bitch ass, I should, I, fuck, I hate all these niggas
Bad blood crushing your dreams
But doctors warned him, he'll die if he fights again
Because everything I say is everything you've ever wanted to hear
But I've never seen a time when they've done shit for it
To erase the thought
You one I know you won't go very far
Ever since we said it
I cried and now I'm over you
"Violence in America today is not cause for the war
With this blade turned in on me
Backwards gibberish
I've made mistakes before
Make her know how it feels to miss you
All those purple track suits make me sick
On loyalty the victims choke
Into the dark is where you're draggin' me
I'd have jumped out of bed with a scream
And it holds only your ghost"
It may be dark but I wanna talk
Can't turn my eyes from the past
I'd remind you of your promises now
Sie lieben mich nicht, ich liebe sie nicht
Dass du ned nur so duast
Why don't you lie down
You give me yours, I'll give you mine
Vent these voices from the dark
You're not a movement
When the storm rolled in
I'll look back on my life and say
I know I'm not insane
I paid dues, nothin' to lose, Steady bustin' off weapons In 's
It's four months now from when we started and nothing feels much easier
I want to cry inside
While so much still stands in our way Yeah
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
Come on, motherfucker 
She likes to drink
Got niggas wondering like "What the fuck did I do"
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But promises mean nothing to me anymore
Strike the match and watch the doll come open
My eyes are bleeding
Am I lonely Heavens, no
All of my hate cannot be found
That's I know about the girls he had
I want to drink the honey blood
And now I feel like I'm alive
And hated them
And when the smoke clears away
When I need to wipe my face
Out on Bail These motherfuckers are harassing me and that ain't cool
Until our deathbed
A middle class and an open sky
I thought if I acted like someone else
Would do you no harm
Don't want to know how many people are like me
It's the nature of business
Feel the burn
Listening to Common's last album to get pumped up
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Boy, she makes me sing bambalam
I'm not afraid to take the fall
These memories never fall, yeah
Vielä nousen
And fuck all his clones
I had to beg you not to leave I thought you were my friend
Like a woman, like a, like a
What a habit
Brings the pain of light
Walk 'n' cry
It is not romantic
God Tell me what you believe God
We're not the ones who leave the homeless in the streets at night
Done dirt cheap
How's it feel to be the prey
Into a shadow world of painted girls and marionettes
Rotten and dirty,
He's just damned
I've tried to wrestle some unbalanced nightmare
It's Long and Slick and Olive Green
I'll be who I wanna be
Sing it, sing it
It was a scream last night
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
Love me, love me, hate you
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"
All good clean fun, have another stick of gum
I'm drifting off into nothingness
Remember the whip, remember the chant, remember about rope and
The wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
But the birds will sing a sweet melody
You end up right here my friend
It surely works its ugly way outside
The disabled
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away
Gonna break you
Your race, your faith
Mentally controlled, Never to be set free
As we grind ourselves into early graves 
 dispatch ma'am where inside the house are you
You are not
You don't want to sound dumb, don't want to offend
The promise that you made
Now I'm fucking ruined 
Tired of wasting all my time to take back what is mine
All dressed in your black
The Jews and Hitler come to mind
He's got a gun
Hardness of the heart reprobate mind
In nowhere In nowhere
Unless you kill a murderer with a lethal syringe
Cover up your face
I'd never tell you, it's something you should know
And fuck you motherfuckers in the jury box fuck you
And left, right
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody needs to know
If I thought you were clever, I'd be even more upset
For everything you cry for 
Tell me what you think your pride is worth to me
Everything breaks down
You die alone, the victory's none
That's what you ought to know
 an x an o and I can't think of a better way to end the day
Got sick and tired of seein' sistas being treated ill
Was losing them to drinking and to driving
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
She's talking to a hypodermic reflection
I thought you talked to God
And the ring on this finger
While you maintain control
And to kill another, and to kill another
When I say you sucked my brain out
Shared by the high school jocks who made your life a living hell
I see the shelter and contrition, best to limit wagging tongues
In front of the classroom
As they lick their cracking lips
You lied
A respected occupation
Yeah, turn on turn on, turn it on turn on
Oh God, he wants to break you
Though devilish karma can't penetrate the steel in my armor
We cause tragedy, erratically
Here's some mud made of blood
Man, I could use a metaphor, but I can't get beyond this shit
I should have turned away and ran
Sedan delivery is a job I know I'll keep
A whole world full of hurt, addiction and lies
Get drunk, get drunk, get drunk
I wasn't made to suffer, huh
You surrender
I can't sleep
Criminal, you goddamn right
The best friend
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
If I could only see you now for about an hour 
Prying up So you want to tear me down
Obedience achieved through fear
We've had enough
Well the only person talking about love
Malignant intentions bingeing on the lie
When was the last time you talked to me
"Oh, you are far too cute" or whatever he said
The faulty mechanism of hope has disintegrated
And disgranite me so you can take advantage yeah
Now you're aiming in the dark I see your face no more now you've ruined everything and let it go and there ain't no heavy law to lay you on the floor
Bad ass at bat, man, forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win
My pulse reverberates through this malleable shell
While emcees fight to see who can be the commonest
Off with the friends you couldn't keep
Deep in the sky a storm he'd seen
Just think bland thoughts
I have just one thing left to say
I know the games pms must run through you
I need someone, a person to talk to
And leaving with my life essence embedded in your dirt
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Gun control, the sound of soul
Evolution killed it all
So, so, so sick of this life
Your problems are not our concern
Game came through, put the city on his back
Snap your fingers, snap your neck
We thought for one instant we forgot our gun now
Silly shit
Take the time to learn to hate
I feel the hurt so physical
Combien de personnes n'ont jamais cru qu'on aurait tant de plaques amassées
It's gonna set the sails, and send me back to you
No you must, no you must not go away
The world sees no difference
'Cause you're drivin' me mad
For fucking freedom
This cop who died in Harlem
Midnight's on the way I'm losing my connection
Why are you so sick
It's murda murda, you know it's murda murda
I don't need to take your shit, get away from me
That you have made
Gotta find a new place to hang out, because I'm tired of living in hell
Forgive me as, I burn into the evening
Their tears they form a trail
All I ever wanted was a piece to myself
Its meaning is lost on ears shut tight
"You shot the s out her Lent I'm proud of you Go home"
While I'm standing in the river drowning 
Stand up now stand up now
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your needle inside
And give it to a police man
I can't feel
I'm undead, unfed, been sleeping on bunk beds since ten
Found another lead singer
They'll get you in the end then you'll pay
When reason dies behind closed doors
Discover dishonor with its thousand commands
A meeting point off underground
With no hair in between, know what I mean
Swarm of the pure blood like malicious piranhas
I drawn to the sound of broken glass
You don't know where you're supposed to go
I can see it in your eyes, I know that you're hiding
Well you know I nearly fell down and died
Didn't stop until she hit New Orleans
So stop breeding violence it's neither the time or the place
But I always feel I have to
Toward distant stacks that shout "Feed on demand"
It's so hard to find out who you wanna be  oh
Wicked games that's the way how they wanna play
Do you want more more, more, more
You're skinny
You know the feeling and it's stronger each day 
It's all about the sin that you're compiling
I bare my cross, my soul, myself
There'll be no lullabyes
Wild animals show their teeth
They askin' me what happened
Through myself and back again, where I don't know
We sat on my back porch and watched it
I hate you
The restless comsumer flies
What the fuck
Oh, nothing is ever enough
The game is lost, eternal love united with the eternal hope
Become frail and fall to the ground
I was born to pay for my previous sins
But you know I ain't no clown
These are the things I can do without come on, come on baby I'm talking to you come on, come on baby let me shout shout, let me shout
Walk the coolest walk you know
The crumbled cities stand as known
The truth hurts, no wonder people rather pretend
All women wanna lay
What we most dislike
Son lies about, taking classes at community college
Cut your pride and watch it bleed
Did the hate filled wanna build bunkers
So I swallowed the shame
A perfect kill 
And now I know what I'm about to lose
I'm a knife, I'm a rope, I'm a bitter pill
I think you know what I'm getting at
Doesn't end at the end of your block
I wanted to be friends with her too
Send me on my way with a question to ask myself
And, kid, you're sick
All its hate, All it's pain, so
I'm not running down
The clergy they come in and say it is a sin 
Oh you got to go nege wanbyeokhan sarang chaja garago
The white boy's plan is being readied night and day, night and day
With every bit of my heart I have tried to believe in it
Dying fighting a life of abuse
Plan your attack, and I am still waiting
It didn't turn out the way you wanted it, did it
Into some bleeding hands over solid lands
And I know things could be so much better yet why don't we just give everything up
And candy sweet faces
And this is not what it seems
Some people can't be told you know they have to learn the hard way
To shut down the devil sound
Mother, mother
Dead girls dance they burn and twirl
You call yourself a friend The teams are drawn
And see that look on your face
Attention thrills and then it kills
The masschosen leaders for a brutalised nation
You don't have to do nothing, you're just being you
I touch on the shit that they be leavin' out
Blood on her skin
Feel somethin' move
Always remember
Why, oh, why does she treat me like a snowman
All you fools out there wanna get him on your track
Now you're all alone now
Turn the bass up, get mothafuckas to go shit
When I'm working, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
Every thought got lost in the translation
That's enough to make a nigga flip
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
Drift among the faithful, bury your desires
Just shadows on the ground
Your weak eyes cry tears of the meek
Never been hated
Licking your own skin, so trippy
'Cause that's all it takes to buy a gun
Full of device, not devotion
And there's no more disguising this decay
Kill beasts like heart disease
Like in desperation, murmur of a heartbeat
Pleasure knowing you I wish you all the best of luck
Can I give you my pain, to feel
Da war ja noch ok was ich gut versteh
Who the fuck do you think you are
Into the toilet with faces removed
I believe in moments, transparent moments
Took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us
So many dirty little places
Did I fool you too
Wild boys will be wild, still acting like a child
Look like death
Before you point the finger
I wouldn't wait around if I was you, na, you're good but if you ain't team clean, nobody gets anything
Sensitive, a painter
And I just do not got the patience got the patience
So why should I try, act like I'm a little pissed off
Sell a nigga rocks, bail a nigga out BUT
It's the emptiness it poisons it lies
He runs the gang on Pastrami Row
In your face, ready to ruin
Yeah mother fucker, I'm sellin' narcotics
I'm fighting for gun rights to shoot a nigga in his dome
Singing along with their dying concern to my bullshit
Every day it goes to try and get votes but don't know the correct tactics
Have you seen your dog it's a lasserapso
These fools are my fuel
Girl you're out of your mind
And I did, clear shots and no regrets never
Ninini "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
I don't even know you and I'd kill you myself
Sometimes I sleep past noon, Daddy
Do you really wanna be the star of it
From Marcy to Madison Square
Who can make me feel like
Crawling in my skin Crawling in my skin
You're so respectable
To kill another and to kill another
At those lies that night or empty promises
The virgin's feeling cheated
You break me up 
I won't play the fool, I'm not screwin' around
Eye on metronome, watching the way you write her name
Why I don't know
Stop caution hard hat yellow insect machines
This shit's making me crazy
Doubling back at me
You said"run run run as fast as you can but you can't run run from the childcatchers hands"
Close my eyes on y'all niggaz, the bullets'll watch yours
Another rider, he was a talker
I've yet to feel that brilliant afterglow
Don't move, the mornin's not a pretty sight
Your ass will make ya shit your meal
You can never fuck with the Esopterodactyl
Ignore, this curse
You smear your filth across the world
When there ain't no other way to feed us all
I've seen a lot of shit
You ain't a friend of mine
And Everything I do and everything I try it never turns out
Grab a gun, grab a knife, even hands will do
Kick his ass till I'm smellin shit
I don't have an agenda
Cut my skin it makes me human
I know he's in his grave turnin' like a ferris wheel
If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with the new style
Well, nobody cares, well, nobody cares
Now watch me kick in the teeth of the track like my mind was a steel toe boot
'Cause I browsed down, his fingers curled
Drowning out the constant nonsense
God does not evolve
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
You're so pure  you know the cures  just keep us poor
Then your religion is losing face
A word that turned into a crime
When you've left it all behind
She don't have far to go to drive me crazy
It's always best to keep it in mind
With fake tits and a bad dye job
I've cried myself to sleep
Don't you understand
We need smoething to break, I want something to break
Where is the god of men and children
Before she jumped in a cab she said, "Get home before sunlight"
I try to relieve myself 
Is it tough to watch
I wanna scream till you see
In sterile black and white
You wanna be ruled
This animal will jump up and eat you
From now on, I'll try to find someone who knows I exist
Love, I don't get enough of it
Hello, hello, hello, hello
I ask why But in my mind, I find
And played a different game
When all your worst fears materialize
Praising the devil the said
Of my dick that cums lead
I think I'm losing my grip
You could lie again
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
Halos of truth now they surround
I can't do nothing
You won't catch me crying, 'cause I just can't win
La laisse seule face à sa table 
Sad news, sad days, where are you now 
Ich sah mir meine Hand an, sie hatte noch nie gesprochen
Is every time you make yourself beaten, yeah
I believe in defending
Yeah you are the good little holier 
I'm a shoot your funky ass bitch
We're runnin' in a circle
You serve no purpose
Believe it
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
I've come to bring you hell
I've had enough of feelin' sick
Is mess you up and lie to you
He said "Don't ever mention my name there or talk of all the nights you cried
Gifted with talent are no big deal 
Whoa, oh, oh Johnny get your gun
Und verschont mich nicht und verkürzt die Frist
I can't fight it I can't hide
Well, I'll wear the claws if you'd like that
There is no design for life
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell
Got my bitches on the outside writin' me letters
You go click, click, click
Godspeed the day, godspeed the day when we're the
So you could go to the opera, dumped all my girlfriends
Are the uranium deposits and the genocides you closet
And you won't do shit about it, like the Church during the Holocaust
All the branches of knowledge All the branches of knowledge
It's a fault I have, I know
I made it up to make up for all that I never really did
Old ways don't seem to know
The enemy The action I can't condone
The limit of your mind is what they're counting on all ends
You fucked up  you fuckin' nazi whore
She had enough and he had plenty
I've got them in my garden now and
I wanna rip you open while you're laughing at me
Though you know she's everything you'd like
Out of my mind, there's no love in fear
Let the roof burn, Let the girls love, Let the heat flow
Now it wasn't on the nightly news no more
You're skin and bones, I'm a nervous wreck
Promise you won't ever see me cry
Does your life stand for anything
She didn't wanna be, she didn't wanna know
I won't be there no more
So it seems our people starve from lack of understanding
War censored, no blood on TV
At least no jack and I can't hack it
It ain't no secret we be headin' for a bust
I know, now, that I'm forever dirt
They'll tell you that it's not going to hurt
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
And leather whatever, however, I'm still rockin'
I'll watch you sweat
She's the one that's full of shit
gilt weder Ordnung noch Moral
My heart and my soul have turned to push and shove
I'm having trouble trying to sleep
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
Don't you give me give me give me your nothingno
The lying truth, the virgin whore, the quiet storm
Will look like it was my fault
All these noflow, gimmicky ass fired up behaviors
I'm so happy now we're through
Y'all gotta feel us
Especially in my Pastelle, or my Bape shit
Another memory dies
The palace of answers with me, Marie
Don't give me give me give me your misguided help
I can't believe I ever hurt you
Start a fuckin' cult, clash his talents in a brash way
I know you're always telling me
The whole world hates your song
I wanna be a horse full of fire that will never train
All you want
And everyone that I ran into would know what I came to do
The face of Eve turning What sky did she see
And the road is coming to its end
Life's cold
But it's so different when I know you've gone
Don't cry Just die
No one's comin' no one's comin'
See, they're not mine, so you gotta let 'em go
My face
Snoop Dogg
'Cause you're not worried bout what I'm doing too
We got no time for fancy mathematics
And the worst of the three, you now have to expect
Chucking up  burning bodies in a 
You're the god that makes me stronger
Sad can't stand back at that deep end
Here's a product that promises to do nothing
Wait~ The promoter bitchin, is this asshole trippin'
 miles later the sky has changed
Class rebellion
Knock, knock, baby answer the door
With all of your gold stories all told
Are you happy, mad I am
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press
Treated like a joke
We've done nothing to brandish our disguises
While bloodhounds wait down in the lobby
I am the assassin, providing your nemesis 
Makin' niggas clear the room, like a dyke flee a dick
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Like you wanted
This is how I feel
How many motherfuckers gotta pay
The bayonets clamor on all night, hemming scars into the hillside
War tactics, they make me sick
Goosestep bravely on every face
I want your everything and I want you dead
This night will not be forgotten 
Tonight Rat poison for dinner, 
Is it turning you on 
From beating up black kids
My fist is for your face to cock the jaw
I'm not listening
And I love to hate you
But it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
This house knows all I have done
I hear the big old floppy shoes
I just want to dance in your tangles
I'm a be right here chattin' with your bitch
There's a warning sign on the road ahead
If you ignore that I'm alive, I've nothing to cling to
So you resigned yourself to failure, my friend
And you hate me now
So you should pump this shit like they do in the future
They dress to kill
My mouth is open, my book is shut
Ashamed, naked
So be sick of listening
You couldn't leave well enough alone
I know something you'll never know 
And as I lie awake now crying and bereaving
Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill me now
Sleep in a warm bed
When all I want is near
Inbreeding scars to innocence
Can you hear my scream way up there
Something too massive to hide
There's a rising tide in the rivers of blood
Manhattan's sinking like a rock
Without fists
I gave you the benefit of the doubt, it's true
"I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left"
I wanna see you try and take a swing at me
Everybody's riddled with disease
Trapped in a world that he never made
I'll never be a snowflake
My dance has passed
Check before we work
Now I don't live with a prince no tea with the queen
We're out of control
A day we'll never face, we're only
And fuck your short memory
Or like a statue of Stalin after the fall of the Soviet Union
When they get what they want, and they never want it again
You're the respectable members of society
I can watch my world evolve
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
Fuck you for all the shit you dragged me through
Yo, roll the dro and spark, a bunch of animals like Noah's Ark
But we dance to the beat
I'm not always like this
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
And they invented And they mean nothing to you
It's A safe haven of sleepless Where the deep fryer's always on
I'm fucking tired and I'm saying goodbye
I know if I know another way
Come on, now
Now I'm trapped and want to find a getaway
And I hate you 
Kiss it, fist it, 
I work and don't get paid
I keep that on stock for all hard rocks
She goes down, the sacred whore
Plexin and panic oppression and pride
She's gonna be your wife
Black clouds, sky falling
Fate has no compass fear has no driver
You know I've got so much to say
I've never seen you frown this much
There's a fire in the peach pit x
And I remember, when I tried to find a voice
'Cause you can't erase my words, can't erase my mind
Flowers cannot express the loss
Of the original face
And I'm so sorry 
So expect a payback in return
I can call you when I get back
So you start with your powertrip
I was dancing when I saw his brains run out on the street
It's been awkward I still offer it when it's that time of
I think they know that's what's coming nigga, just bring up
Load up on guns, bring your friends
Of what they thought you and I were allowed to know
Bear or it'll die
You will beat this starting now
Get on your knees and let the games begin
And a million watch gideon scribes, but once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide and that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish while profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes
And since you've gone, you're just Another Day
Just so you can have your shit heard by the nation
Make sure that you're watching
I bet you'd only run
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is death and doom, my occupation puttin' flesh in tombs
Whatever
Swimming through a hazy shade of passion
A second of trust or one ounce of faith in anything you're about
The labels are slave masters Artists are slaves
Minnesota nights, but our frostbitten fists
I'm killed by the question
You don't scare me I won't turn my back
When I'm the girl that you want
Fuck all of the people driven by the greed
So you're somebody who brags about their innocence
I feel a lot like this town I'm so rundown
Fuck 'em and their law 
In a normal fashion another  or 
These girlfriend lips
You fucking, you fucking ripped my heart out
All she could say as she felt those tear drops falls was
It's never ending
Hooray We're gonna die
They�say�this�anger,�this�emotion�and�this�passion�is�all�a�lie
You come across impure
As we sleep to burn the red 
You know them type of chicks that walk by
I studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb as opposed to the loaded nose who pray armageddon is numb and that's unevenly rendered to those who grew up thinking faith was the surrender of reason but not a reason to surrender
Who don't know his own name
C'mon niggas, c'mon niggas
I want to know what you do with my grinder
It's a thin line between paper and hate
So let fall the rain
Of burnt out trash
I have grown the soul of an enemy
And I know what it's like, yeah,
Huomaa vaan kun joku sanoo jotain sellaista
I wanna spend my life with you
'Cause I know everyone here treats friends like family,
My friends talk
Ruled by greed and by pocrisy and the superficial mind fuck again
And you can suck a dick, if you think I ended it wrong
And strum down all the pain
War Ooh, it's nothing but a heartbreaker
There was blood on their hands and a plague on the land
A passive aggressive
It will break you
And after all I'm glad that I'm not your type
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
Yeah, I know
In this world of piss
"If you cannot bring good news, then don't bring any"
You've already been paid and made it
You wanna feel it, feel it, feel it
My feathered friends' end will justify the means
Damnit with the blood
We drop beats
'Cause I'm a liar, yeah, I'm a liar
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
U get on the mic wit that bullshit bitch Bitch then it's all on u
You wanna lick my wounds,
Fear is your, fear is your, fear is your only god
Strain the limit of compassion
One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
Go to hell lions, tigers, and bears
Dcups with extra filling, take it out, let me lick it quickly
No one knows your name
You can't quit, you're fired
So, die young and stay pretty
Hmm you're not rid of me
There's no return to sender
Faking smiles, breaking promises,
Don't hang around, don't call my friends
St Jimmy comes without any shame
Pull down the wires, set you on fire  I'm getting too tired to resist,
I know it's crazy but I know
This is nothing delicate
This will go no further I swear it dies today
Please take my life tonight, let's disintegrate
And I'm fearful I'm fearful I'm fearful of flying
And the stains coming from my blood
Now crack another bottle and let me knock one back
Mm, but the way you play your game ain't fair
So fuck Jerry Heller and the white superpowers
That's for putting scars on my mother's back, BO
We live it, we breathe it, we screaming murda murda murda
Ain't no afro or halo can pick the cotton out
I'm tired and I've felt it for a while now
Won't turn
Your back door man, hey
I took my spot nobody gave me mine
I only wish for snow to fall
A silver cross
Left you in a vessel with severe battle fatigue
Ever since I was young
All he needs is a knife
Well, you dicked me over but now you'll pay
Living in fear of Satan and the witches
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
For a foot to kick me to the floor
Spend my days with chauvinists
Step back punk 'cause I'm a Latino
Ice Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin LM
"Murder, you want some" Sample
That we have made
And left you home alone
I know what it's like I know what it means
Little bitch got a lesson to learn
Fast forward There's been a murder and the police know who done it
I fear my selfishness will be the end of this
I'm a lying liar with my pants on fire
Others thought I fell off but now I'm numero uno
I wanna drive them,
We take a pill, get a face
Looked her mother straight in the eyes
And thousands of mothers and their mothers cry
And walk in our shoes
I am the blackman and you are the white 
They said "God made us in his image
With all that shit that needs to stay back in the shelf
Feel the fire
I locked you out, left you naked in the front yard
But now and then
You can poison my cat
But I'll just tell people, "I don't give a fuck about that shit"
The circus has begun, now take your cut
I wanna put you on someone else
Last time I believed
Face and embrace
Ebon splendour
Don't talk behind my back just call me nigga
'Cause I remember all the times I tried so hard
It's bang bully bust rhymes, I'm coming to squash shit
And forget what you think you know
My face has changed, you know it's me
I gotta be a fool
To be beatin' on and throwin' in jail
Darkness can't destroy my drive
As you want to talk some sense
It's time for me to face the music
Never will I front, pass it up or let it walk by
Fucking destruction, fucking destruction
A nice shot, man
Haven't you noticed me fillin' the fridge
I don't feel like I'm doing it, it affects me
And the soldiers stand guard at the keep
Get out of my face, out of my face with that shit
You say nobody knows the truth about your body
And make me a fool
No eat, no sleep all night
He used to pay this bitch, gave her lots of shit
We think you're a joke
'Cause you should've known better
Is it different enough
Mais j'attends, je t'attends
The bullet or the chapstick
All I do is pretend to be ok so my friends
Don't fight back
You're fired too
I see you, I see you, trying to break free
I remember I kept thinking that I know you never would
She burns me up
The face of alexander remains not only solely
This one is mine
Another summer rolls by
Fuck tha police comin' straight from the underground
I know she loves you
I can't and I want to so bad
The devil made me do it
"We've really got those suckers fooled,
Blood, blood, blood everywhere we go,
The warmth has just been choking me
Tell all those other bitches they can kiss my ass
What they want from us motherfuckin thug niggaz
Now they're fighting to get in
I hope you know
You know anklebiters gave you a false perception
All your misconceptions pummel me into the ground
I'm that heathin always bathin in christian blood
Hold my knees, lick your treat
I never had faith in you
We call shots and the beats are rolling on
And every time you make your friend the beaten, yeah
And when you die it's a shame
Just sit back and let your soul decay
Instead of pride before the fall
Look deep in the mirror but try not to see 
All this bitterness wells up inside you
I'm counting sheep but running out
If your money ain't right
I know you've been lying boy
All the things you thought you had
Smoke my hoochie, you say that I'm the Devil, reali THC
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope
And I'm feeling so sick your life
She said, she likes it better when were angry,
A system of gods from each of the brawling tribes
Lock and load your favorite gun
There's no room
Voices screaming in my head
Take control of your soul
Mina läppar de avger ett leende då jag ser hur du faller isär
Believe relieve
Mais dis moi qu'est ce tu crouais kpone inc
Whatever you want
Of endless oppotunities
If I give you just a little bit you're gonna try to take it all
It's not over till you start again
And it's not what I thought it would be
So much to discover
Instead of a cold goodbye
Left Brain, that nigga ugly as fuck, big ass nose
You'll probaably only get to see a dollar in the end,
Laughing as these lies unfold
Drown your fears in alcohol
When they were kids you'd beat 'em and leave 'em home
When I wake up and put this suit on, I feel escape begin
Ni moseubi kkamadeukhaeseo
Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me
Millions of tears for a soldier's wife
I never thought
But if you're gonna bark boy, you better have a bite
I feel free
You cannot change the way I see
'Cause if you can take a fucking dick, you can take a joke
You got me on your hooks oh no
They're looking for a motive 'cause they don't know why he done it
Bend the people to our will
Lets go to war
Rat race
Here's the thought that gets me
That says I have about one second left
Just another day where we live or die
But I don't think I can so fuck you anyway
Why you trying to be hardcore, you fucking homo thug
My, my the cruelest lies are often told without a word
It's all a fucking waste of time it's getting nothing done
I mean cool, run and bungie jump off the fuckin' roof
I wanna hear you say that you were wrong again
You drive me insane
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Stop your shouting
Losing it
You'll never know
Forgotten and repeated
How I love to hate you repeat
They wanna get with me
Io che non sono neanche carne da cannone a Dio
But I wanted to
I sit observing in disgust
Burning candle, blackened malice
Mix blood on blood in a family recipe
Everybody knows what's goin' on
Out of the mind
They spit on my name, and now I have a gun
That I was right in the end
Baby no half stepping yeah
A sea of sins left unredeemed
So down on hands and knees
A drop of blood to welcome them
Then tell me who let that fucking door half open
I'd be a miner
Not leaving, not talking
Like that game where you gotta put the hobnob in your gob if you're the last one to cum on the biscuit
Gotta make this money and I make this money
Drink fast and enjoy your buzz, take back streets to avoid the fuzz
Just go up in that motherfucker, get the motherfuckin' money and get the fuck up outta there Aight
Everyone wants to be a murderous fantasy
Me and amount of people that's feeling me is a hot percentage
Ich hab die ganze Scheiße satt
With halloween teeth
I feel it slipping
Go getcha gun go getcha click
And when it all goes to hell 
Doesn't matter what we say
Ask my mom, "What's the problem, why am I feelin' this way"
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
Do you remember me
Forever I've searched and now I'm found
Whatever you do I'll agree
I don't care for the government, neighbourhood watch or health warnings
Punk, 'cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck wit
I see you standing all by yourself
 When I write  thrice divine with this goddess sight
I feel like shit
But  if you know a bitch, you don't listen to that bitch
So run nigga run
Love her and she'll return it
Twixt Her cold, silent hips I kissed
I've never been on the receiving end
Theyre asking me to export all of your insecurities
Suddenly that joe kicks hard in my veins, I cool down
Who shot four puppets in a line
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep Don't fuck with me
Will you ever feel ok
Hate on me, but you can't deny skill
"I'm gonna be your right of passage, so boy you better spread, spread em"
In another town down the road
Checkin' in the same hotel in the same suite bitch same balcony
Would you still know which one was me
I hated everyone just like you
I see how you're playing innocent
Get the bird, bring her down to the ground from out the air
Their attacks inserted doubt, now you're stranded in the cold with a knife in your back
All the things you knew Science, mathematics, thought
You know its comin'
Poisonous screams
My mind is set on overdrive
I ain't gettin' my leg shot off
I am the power of a woman
What did you stand for
 Like forgotten merchants of disgust, if I don't crap out
Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Living like a house on fire
It filters through its neverending shades of green
Please use my body while I sleep
Not close enough to you, not close enough to you
Don't you hesitate now,
After me, there shall be no more
My face has shamed, but you know it's me,
E' un amico che non vale
A lot of you drink and smoke, suck a lot of dick on the low and probably got HIV
Whyeeieei am I feeling no pain
It's not everything I am, my dear only friend
I could never swallow your false ideals
And fuck 'em and feed em
I recall a friend of mine
Throw the bodies into the streets
Get in back of the line
I've had enough
So all that I believe I am essentially are lies
No patience is in me and if you offend me
Detonate feel it break
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell
Oh what is truth and what is fear
Some people just don't understand it
And ready ass, splash in the Jacuzzi
Oh, Does he know that place below your neck
But we don't talk to them
Laid my clean face on the pillow
Do you sleep anymore
Turn my bones to sand
Don't you give me give me give me you're here to help me
Until the crystal cracked
All of the drugs that we took
Airplanes falling out of the sky
Somewhere someone's gun
So when the ghostly ruminations that are kindly disobeyed
Never get what I want
Hoping that the pain would fade away
More motherfuckers die by accident than on purpose, why
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
"We had a friend, a talking man
For these drop shots who wanna be down
And it feels like that your promises
Justice is sinking to the bottom of the sea
And now his skin is kind of light
Listenin' with your arms crossed
This bitter sadness overwhelms me
And still we stand tall
You make me hate you
That you never say when you pretend that you 
Will you die in the perfect war
'Cause you're not fuckin' me
Darling, I feel like a god when I am next to you
When there's nothing left, on this plate your handed
An image that you hold in your mind
Die Verkäufer und die Käufer deiner Waren, sieh sie dir an
Sleep and not to wake again
It's not the way I see it, man
She was a bloody disgrace
Something happened I don't know why,
I follow you across the county lines
Don't you know I won't pick it up
I remember when I used to feel somethin'
Picked up, chewed on and then spit out"
If I'm'a die, I'm'a die bustin' and strugglin
You know, I'm beginning to think
Yo, I talk morbid, just to make you feel awkward
One day you'll kiss your rabbits nose, pick up the phone
I'm gonna kick it in the ahahahahah
But I'll still cut ya neck out, how's that
Only stands as proof of man's insanity
Used to love niggaz now I plug niggaz, and slug niggaz
There's nothing you can do or say, baby
You might as well be talking to yourself
Constantly harassed, And brain washed into believeing
A breathing piece of shit
Midnight, I'm drunk, I don't give a fuck
I wanna take you home, but your friends won't let ya
I can't believe I hung around with you
I never meant to make you cry 
You're the one who's crazy being institutionalized
And found your faith
No sleep, no tears
How many minutes until midnight and you get your eyesight back
Forgive me for my sins and all the shit that I did
Drive in church drive in back
Un étranger devient français quand il marque deux buts pour c'pays 
Shots heard underground round the rapture
I haven't heard a beat like this in ages
Four walls Four walls
Some say the end is near
I got some deep dark issues within
Just kidding world, you know I love you
Show and prove no grease couldn't scrap a lick
I am the blackman, you're the white 
I assure you
Ah, how do you sleep, brother
This bitch thinks she's in Hollywood
I've learned to live with the lies
Why don't you go fuck yourself
Pushing So you want to tear me down
No bodies
And I cannot give up
Get out of that bed right now
rivorresti
And from a throne of their bones I rule,
Don't need no Madison Avenue War
'Cause I've trusted for nothing
If there were no rain
My mind has settled
And in storms my husband Wilbur in a jealous rage
For every fucking second the pathetic media pisses on me and
Just face up to the fact that you get what you give
I can hear its melody from here in the waiting room of hell
Best believe that I'm a pass on that, ain't got time for no asshole acts
'Cause I'm in no mood to hold back
Look, I mature day after day nigga
Hey, yo I don't even know you and I hate you
Who was cursing him out
You'll cry out for mercy, but still there'll be more
Get the fuck away from me
And there is still nothing about myself I respect
Little bitch is the queen of the virtuous mask
Où on exile ceux qu'en savent trop et assassine les marginaux 
Down on the ground
On and on to the break a dawn
Rappers nowadays are all phased when it comes to soft shove
I live for You now
Some things that should have not been forgotten
One cannot stop the wind from blowing
As they burn alive 
And now he's gone
I hope she know
Well it ain't easy to be bold in an unknown city
'Cause I can't stop now Simple as that
'Cause I feel it too, we all love to hate
So what I wanna go off and fight a war for
Back and forth through my mind
Bitch can hide a treasure chest, in her breasts
Bloodsuckers looking at me stuck with mice
I don't believe how you lie, you don't care
Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
Resting your head on your best friend's sister's shoulder
There it stands way up high
I used to want to make you mine
These words do talk
I'll survive without your help
Lick my legs I'm on fire
Passing slowly though a vector
No more drinking until you fall on the floor
It feels good to see freedom embraced
Time to get scared, time to change plan
They surface up through the cash crops with clippers for your bellyup mascots,
And they try to take the money up front
So scream, I heard about your message,
'Cut Up Your Friend'
My deepest scars
That you never made
Off of his own employee, now don't ignore me you won't avoid me
They just wanna know if they can come with us
You're free to whine, it will not get you far
You know I love to hate you,
Who cries for the nameless whores
I step into the great unknown
Feel the might of his evil wrath
Slip the little prince in the back door
Hark the angels sing
Cause no one is around
I'd give it all up for one shot at
Hush now, don't say a word 
Don't need to bring no kids into this mess
Do you fall gracefully into bed anymore
I'm told the case is now closed
Check before rinsing
And if I haver, whatever that means
Running here, running there
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command
For these four walls I love
The record goes from blue to gold, so thank you for all your help
Maybe you thought you could throw me away
Bourgeoisie brothers talk about sufferin'
Die muthafucka, die muthafucka kill
It's sticking to my face
Me, I'm unworthy, callous and cold
And I hate it when you preach your case
Don't think you'll upend me
Repeat  till end
Descending down
So if you know another way
Mentre le ideologie si estinguono
Drove back home and slept a few days
Been a lot of shit that I held back
See me cry
Do it now, Do It now, weak, jealous motherfuckers,
Silence overwhelms my mind
Ain't nobody say that it would be smooth sailin'
I didn't come here lookin' for a fight
She's yelling on the phone, she's yelling on the phone again
So why does everything seem desperate now
Now, now you know
I've been itching to get it, I've been given assistance
To feed the need to feel the need to feed the need to bleed
What the hell was it that the President said
You can't bring me back
My heartbeat
All this makes me wanna shout
What more can my friend do
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
But a faggot nigga nut huggas and big hoops
Inside your head I'm singing
The ground, what a dead head
Things that I wish you could comprehend yeah, comprehend
And flowers die
But I'm not going down I'm not going down
Rise up against your fate
When I start drinking, my dick does all my thinking
And Romeo had Juliette
Here it comes hissin'
Can't you see my walls are crumbling
God bless the fucked up usa
Those nails did lay rest another chaste and serpentine lunar sacrifice on the eighth or ninth
And every time I try to see the bright side, shit gets dark
Gunshot
I will break you 
He said "You don't understand"
Now, this will be the last bitter song
Laid bare at the end of my rope
To wipe up my drink
How many guys have you let bone you Uh Let me guess, you don't have no clue huh
The heart rate crashes and the rings fall out
I'll make this week disappear
It's the ache inside when it all burns out
Bleed motherfucker, bleed
And I don't want to hate
That nobody liked me anymore 
I don't want to think
 No security, no guarantees, nothing like that for you and me
You lie, you lie, you lie
If you ever want to see it again
Bought some smack tried to break the heroin ringring
Now my ways will be dissolved 
But before you go there's something you should know 
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
Boy I gives a fuck, me and the homie Al Swearengen chill, brandy I'll swill, taking synthetic heroin pills
They don't understand It won't be long
For you it's a different notion of music and motion
They fuck in my head
Your left in the past
And I put her in my claw
But we are older than you You come you wanna
This is who I crown, now without me
If the answer is so clear then why are we so blind
He's got the bad boy snot
Mummy, Mummy, Mummy I'm not an abortion
Why can't I get my girl back
And I Want to believe
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
See I'm not your friend
When we find you we will skin you alive, we'll pluck out your eyes
Scratch my face with anvil hands
You're no friend of mine
There would be no hell
You love this ass, more than her pussy
And talk like you're a pro at this
Until I made it
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to
Well you ain't shit and you ain't nothin'
Someone, somewhere might understand
A black out 
se vendió al aplauso de los cursis conscientes
Still, ling'ring on, the disconnect
There is a feeling I can't hide
We the clearest, you can fear us
With no sorrow, with no remorse
Koitan nousta ylös, polviltani
To give birth to a mighty assassin
A billionaire chatting with his friends,
Go sit back down, 'cause I can't go back until we just finish
The ones about serial killers Let dreams flow into savage times
Let me know the way through this world of hate in you
We drop beats that'll crack your cranium
Are you feeling happy
I am not your savior
I want more out of life
I just want you here with me
Ignorance is bliss, no wise woman's failed to mention,
Don't stop thinking
I'm not easing the gas until we both can sleep, we might as well be
Can't help but feel this cold
No, I don't want to be
Walking on fire, now the world will keep its distance
﻿Too many faces are glowing with pride and assurance
Believe me Pretty Baby, I don't lie
I can't remember why my knees are so sore
Yeah cancer people can't smoke weed
And scrape the paint that hides the crimes
We'll bring them chasing down till they're all dead, they're all dead,
And understanding eyes
Sole defenders of the longest night new york had never slept,
Now dead Italian tourists bodies litter up the Broadway
See, they're missing the new album, I'm missing my only friend
Jesus filling out paperwork now
Fuck all you Motherfuckers
On your front lawn
We came to defy  living life as a lie
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Fear has its place in the scars that I bear
I ain't goin' to war for a shit talkin' president
 Well, what yes, that's okay, I'm going to let you pass it but what'd he say He had a nice little phrase that everybody should know "Change only comes"
And we want Kissinger on trial for real
Give us water, give us back our lives
Nineyearold puts his money down
And if I get drunk, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
Everybody sucks
Who got biggie and who shot tupac
To give me the needed professional help
To the Hollywood world we made out of Barbie doll hearts
Now, if the greenbacks don't stack large on my side of the yard
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning"
For it means destruction of innocent lives
Oh, I just want more
I don't believe in the fear
We're not here 'cause we want to entertain
Where I don't wanna find him
I've turned you on to what they call the fucking devil's son
I won't be whatever you wanted
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city
And twisted around for a whole fucking week
My soul is reborn in fire
Herr, lass mich auch mit denen streiten
Is how you do it all for your own damn attention
All shall feel my wrath
For our true nature is sin
And I'll pretend that this is real
They killed him then he came back and made a platinum album
Old money and crack fiends was a fetish
I don't know how old she was but it doesn't matter
If you're like me you'd like to think we've learned from our mistakes
I'm sorry
Someone's got his finger on the button in some room
We have had about enough
Beneath the yellow street light it became a situation
Tell me How many niggas wanna ride tonight I do
Little devil run around inside
Thoughts of turning pro have crossed my mind
In the dark and secretly,
Look at your husband now No, I said look at him
What I have to see, what I cannot be, inside you
The mind rapers
Is because nobody else does
So we better stop it now
You want it bad
People don't talk about keeping it real
Tribal chants, tribal war
Into the arms of angels
In the love of baby whores
I remember desert places
Snakes get fat while the good rats die
You only want me when I'm
You print the label that turns me outsidein
Kick rocks, mother fucker
America takes drugs in psychic defense
And under black skirts
Ordered his gun and its done and its done
But I'm not stopping till I'm the fcking king in every state
I wanna be in your head while you're at a bar
No hell
Maybe I'll get another
I'm not a friend at all, oh, please let me go
I dug another hole to bleed
See this through and leave, my friend
Tell me what you want to love, in me
Scarriddled saffron eves bleed like the conjugal
Put a banner over my grave
Make you think I'm gonna kick your ass
I really wanna, wanna see ya, wanna see you explode right now, yeah
Faded pictures on the wall, it's like they talking to me
If all must we damn for this moment
Always one fateful night
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it Forget it
Yeah, you're not rid of me
I'll turn up the volume
Eight faces turned away
 bass over twisted metal
Voices with nothing to say
Independence baby I shot off all my
I sense the end is near
Oh, the parents are the problem
Convicted with no excuse
Brother kill brother, side by side
No, you're not rid of me
From the pain that's here to stay
Change must come through the barrel of a gun
Be careful, we're watching and you can feel us stalking 
Let's face it you're basic, you aren't half the man that I am
Damn near dead to feel the wind beneath you
Seething, blinding, screaming
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
The clergy they come in stand up now
Go back to sleep
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
Gocarts and guns are treasures they will bear
You're full of shit
Assassinated fast if they catch you talking trash
"Scratch my back and I will stab you in yours"
zurückhaltend und nüchtern,
I'm sleepin' in every hallway
I don't want to let go
Now you've got both, what do you want next
Fuck around with NonPhixion that's a bad move
The slave master watching over you,
Hot tires sing like a string being bowed
We're sinking
In these words, tearing me and make me bleed
Lemme know where to put your rosary at
All you know about me is what I've sold you
I don't even want to try
But I gave my life to be your whore
The sound, what a broke neck
I tried, we'll drown ourselves in misery tonight
I'm standing still in a shattered mirror, staring at somebody else's face
You're under my fucking skin
You there on the fault line
So now you're scared of love
Release this hate from inside
You turn into monsters at night
It ain't no pop cause that sucks
To miss such a beat would have been outrageous
You think you're the shit
Expect nothing less
Dealt a dirty deed and
Peace I hate the word
I'll rock with it with no competition on this shh
An earth we made into Hell
The neon forest is lighting up
All along it was the Geto, nothing but the Geto
With that there's nothing I fear,
Fuck everything, fuck me
We nearly signed it with our blood
Get up off your knees
A sink full of dishes and some aqua lube
Yes, I think we got a problem
I wanna see your brain start shrinking
Or does it bring you shame
Your mind I know you like the fact I'm so bad when I spit up on the track
Ladies know how it feels
To watch the things you gave your life to broken
You should spend some time sometime with the person in the mirror
Real sick hearing these pricks talk shit
Dass du mir weh do host
But here comes a warning,
Like the noose on my na na na na neck
I slap you after bustin' a fuckin' nut in my palm
Mama always told me I was crazy
And I'll tell you things that you already know, so you can say
I am so distant myself
'Cause what I'm talking about here is
Too many happy faces
But really I'm just giving them back to you
Movin' 'em back, clickclick goes the gun
Ever since
Cause now in your eyes, I can't find you
Wage war on the weak
Super size our tragedies You can't define me or justify greed
I can't take it, runnin a space ship
She ain't gonna wanna share
Enough blood in my eyes
The drugs are late
From fucking destruction, fucking destruction
'Cause dumb is back
Oh, they say the battle's over now 
Then they fall apart and blame it on cheddar
Fuck it all and fuck
Woman oh my god
While you sittin' here hatin', yo' bitch is hyperventilatin'
The loneliest place to hide
So you look around the tiny room and you wonder where the hell you are
You liar, you liar, you can't live the dreams you're spinning
To scared to ask for help
Personal ambition usurps justice
And a cab driver's in a hurry that matters more than 
You're giving in to failure
I thought that you, you were the one
Was the fin on your back part of the deal
Do ya wanna getcha teeth
My words are limp, and my mind is dry
You left your guru out there hangin'
And hey if you want me to 
ma di questo nostro amore
And you are a liar
Falling together, going for forever and never ending
Anata sono made hashitai no
I watched closely as the you I knew forgot me
But I'm not quitting no
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
That's all, that's the end of it
This is the first day of the rest of our lives
It's been headed this way since the world began
Yeah this is it now
Let's keep it friendly
He wouldn't stand for how you act like a bitch
I'm sick with this
Yeah, I'm only people's sole assassin
This message is for anyone who dares to hear a fool
Yeah, gonna bleed from life
'Cause the dye is cast and the bitch is back and we're all dead
For the love of Christ you're the boss boss end more like
Destroy your customs, you'll have no say
Just 'cause I'm screaming
I'm not some kinda superman
It's time you woke up before it blows up in your face
She had eyes bright enough to burn me;
On your head, on your chest
Now I'm somewhere I am not supposed to be
My blow goes like a quickie in the snow
He spews out his sweet and salty sermon on the audience
To a no one there
Across the country through the fields 
I'll break your legs before
Dass wir nicht mehr befreundet sind, da ließ ich es lieber sein
I'm alone on my throne in this universe of fear
I swear I have nothing to prove
And my arms get sore
He'll fuckstart your burp hole, jet in burgundy pleather
Du FN, des flics et des skins armés 
And she can't give a damn on cue
Waking in a sweat from a burning dream, yeah
Ignore the sun, covers over my head
I'm feeling kinda trapped, I gotta go
Don't wanna sing about no vivisection
Nothin' stands the test of time
Soon as my back is turned you're like a rooster at a hen
Just don't know
She got me down spinning out of control
Every time I turn around, it's there
And punish the whores of your wishgod and the martyrs that they slay
Before the hail of bullets there is silence, the pow
Buddy, we need to talk to you
Die ik heb gekend
Staring back in front of me
And I will make you understand what it's like to be me
No, I can't fucking stand it
One of these girlies made my day for real
Being half dead wasn't what I planned to be
Fresh from the northwest the hottest thing lately
You just got burnt, they're gonna rule ya
Beat a police out of shape
'Cause now that I am gone
Hittin fools up with the big ass L
Paperface, paperface, paperface, paperface
We have to stop this immediately this fucking mess
Put "Walk Among Us" on and turn it up
You want to know why
You bleeding heart,
Nuuh 'cause I know how
That said, We've had enough
Go out and make a last call or sit here and do nothing at all
Sweep the black super market Sweep it up with your teeth
There's a sick mother
Still remember what it tastes like
If I bathe myself in others blood, Am I sick
Oops I meant bastard, a skinny ass disaster
A massive offensive
Say a novena for all those lost
I'm So High and you can't feel it
It's no surprise that a brother's got wise
You never listen to a single thing I say
To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks
There's nothing left but change
I need you more than ever now that I know who you are
Their land deeds, their hired guns
And I ain't seen no fucking talking snake unravel from trees
As far as I can tell you've created your own hell
Get me out just to dry my tears
Drooling polished jackboot monsters, tracking the scent of a sleeping child
You own everything in your sight in your sight now
I'm gonna spit every word
Lock the door, burn the disc now everybody hit the mutha fuckin' floor
Nice shot
Get familiar with Cartwright
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Fuck fuck fuck a war
Sail as white as heroin, white like weathered bones 
I'm the ghost in your machine
It's a bullshit three ring circus sideshow of
Just like that, I turn my back and I
Take it pull my hair back Oh
Then have the guts to stand for something
I stand around at American weddings
You wanna sleep on me Overnight
Can't help feelin' somethin's wrong with everyone of you
I'm not a throbbing squirm
Now I have a perfect world, now you're goneoh oh oh
I'll twist a nigga's shit just like a fucking contortionist
But it's not my scene
A dark angel leads me to evil far beyond the grave
Who the fuck you tryin' to be
Causing more than war slaying rappers, commercial or horrorcore
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear Abomb
Do you want a ride on my death machine
Everyday  I face it
There are holes in the walls
And as you passed out fast on my shoulder,
And fuck the world 'cause I ain't hear to stay, Beyotch
You are a liar and you are a lie
Enter the eye of the storm
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
Here I turn my back here's the knife, for you to stick in me
You so used to running back but I won't let you do that
We're not afraid of you
And they both fuckin' smell like shit
I am a fool I know, I know, I know
One more day of eating and sleeping
Woman like a man, woman like a man, woman like a man, like a man
'Cause we're perfect together and never wanna be apart
The morning is hell
Candles burning
Now my world is disconnected
I don't know
Brush her hair, noone else will
pois no fim da guerra todos perdem
And when you get to the end you'll find a chair
I'm gonna kick it all in
Madman, madman
Your composure gave you away, next time it's best to cry havoc
Like white celebrities buying black and brown babies
At least I'll die with a name
I can't stand you hoes, uh
Make me feel like I want to kill
I ain't bendin' for the soap
And I think you know that
While other MC's are talkin' bout up with hope down with dope
That binds moment of thought
Keep your drink, just give me the money
A hooker's scream heard around the world
But you really can't function you're so full of fear
The number of my moves
No, I don't wanna
Though I know that I'm not useful anyhow
And throw coins on his back to taunt him 
It's all implied
Shoes off, hair down
Leaving me broken another time
I can't take it, I can't take it, I can't take it, oh no
 dispatch what is your emergency
Siihen painetaan
Oh oh oh oh, If looks could kill then death would be my name my name
Flushed in their list of crimes
You got tha realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt
Mom works hard, still working on her masters
It was my father's once, I still see his face
A tragic poem that forever burns on my brain
Tony Touch classic, knowhatI'msayin
Shivering in static for us in this place of angry tears
A pretty face may last a year or two
I been stabbed
Uh, I want you to trip like I do
But if you kissed me now
And then you pretend
I'm with stupid, caught my finger in the door
Live the lie and take a dive
What if there's no time to lose
The more I feel my back's increasingly compelled
E il mio rispetto non ha prezzo, non puoi prenderlo
Well I've been climbin' and fightin' to heighten
Stag shit
The sound, what a dead neck
I seen this muthafucka's  smokin'
When Radon levels drop we walk the trails and talk and laugh
You move your mouth, you shake your tongue, you vibrate my eardrums
The city was evil, some country was evil, the hippies were evil, the writers were evil, the homeless were evil, the workers were evil, the summer was evil, independence was evil
What the fuck do you got
I can't breathe 'cause I don't want to breathe no more
Let's just say enough's been said
Please believe this
I feel so sick and lonely, I want a real girl that will get to know me
And come back for my Rolls
Don't stop
Or drive a cab in New York 
This house is full of mmmadness
Why does it kill you
And you know what Thank God
Don't need no ad machine
In the back of the spine where my darts is lodged
It's four o' clock in the fucking morning
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years yea, yea
You're so in love, you hope she wants
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
It's time to fear what we should respect
Dump yo' bitch ass back around your way
So sit back and have a cup o' joe
Aaaaall you lil' faggots can suck it
But how the fuck you s'posed to grow up when you weren't raised
Eternity is not a sunrise
Round here, we always stand up straight
These memories 
Get me the fuck off this track
If that's what you wanted
Go on and drop your fucking names
A gaping hole running right through their neck
Attack medic stretcher call cracked crazy header fall
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
It makes you a liar
But for now I'll lace up
My way, remember screamin' my nameame
And if I ever let the words, of another nigga bother me
I guess I failed my test
I'm just being real nigga, fuck you
On the warpath once again
I'm just so sick and tired of playing the game Forever meting and deleting all the simple mistake Here I am, god, help me I am slave to a name not possible or possibly the person that I'll became See, everybody's borne in battles but I'm trying to breed out, by never doubting that in doubting I've created the doubt if I'm about the best bred to lead the canon'ed devout then can I realize and factualize my fictional account of how I'm born again Forgive this life loving friends and friends don't give a damn for damning is the means to end I've been trained to live lost in a hole, where poison could equate to control, is controlled by my hand, here it is, here I am
Handle whatever's comin' when I get there, but I'm good what
And in the back of your mind
For the sake of our own skin
Run away, runaway girl
So fuck all your protests and
Grin fuck
Me and your mom we've been noticing lately that you've been having a lot of 
Aw, honey you're a bitch
Watch your step to Hell it's a long fall
Inside of me I'm crazy I'm just crazy
How many wishes do I still have left to fix the way it ends
Hey hey, now mother mind
But I know that it won't be this way
You want to feel it
No fiction, no fact
Your bed's been made, now go die in it
Es war ned einfach so vorbei
I know you are so am I
A rock could fall out, traded for royalty rates
I will fall completely
Nah you can't borrow shit
Watchin' Good Will Hunting, holdin' hands and drinkin' milkshakes
You should be honored by my lateness
I never knew it, but the rest of my class knew it
When I'm pressed up on the wall
Our hearts beat in slow motion
I never liked working at Mickey D's
Let's burn him instead"
Go home you fuckin' slobs
And cursed pride
Is he coughing now
I said I'm under the gun, round here
I am the assassin, with tongue forged from eloquence 
I am pure fucking evil
You hope and pray everyday it works out
They eat shit, like faulty plumbin'
And God knows they're breaking in me now
And get it made overseas
And I've just worked out that I'm falling apart
You were never shit,
It's a rat race
There are things I got, there are things you're not repeat
Get down  back where you started
Development wants
You take your turn lashing out at me
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum
Swing back at you and hit you up black and blue
Baby, you're mine
I have been fighting the good fight
Make him feel like a congressman
Push shove you're always in my face
I want to cling to something soft
Be offended by every sentence I jot
Cleansing yourself of the past
That's the word don't you know,
I still don't blame you for leaving, baby, it's cold living with ghosts
Wealth and power crashing in
Not a single soul is breathing 'cause the Serengeti's bleeding
I can't allow what has begun to tear me down
e violinos em canções de amor
You and me were best friends we talked about abortions
I'm so glad I got the fuck out of our hometown
Amongst friends
Ieeieei and I cry every waking day
You ask me what size it is, not what I sell
Dass I jede Nacht schwach gwen bin
But I'm the song, the song she doesn't want to sing
Must be having a good shame
It won't be enough this time to say sorry
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
They say they are Christ's disciples
Fucking fuck it
So come at me with your moon and burn me in the stars 
When we're dead they'll know just who we are
Gym Class Heroes
It makes my feeling go numb and black
Or maybe it's just a game
I'll be calling out names but I ain't taking attendance
Got to keep it on the surface
Let me bring in the memories
I don't want what else is running out your mouth
On the sacrificial altar to success, my friend
Of this stupid game
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
And then look at all my friends 
I just can't stand the bullshit I wish I was so far away from it
I am  your  friend
And I don't know how much more I can take
Überall Bilder mit beklemmender Atmosphäre
She say I got nothing to fear
But you turn your back when I walk up
You've got nothing to believe in
wünsch mir ein großes Schneckenhaus
I feel like I could go insane
Tie it up, now boot it up
I'm screaming through your door
You outta work, I know it's tough
Down wit the niggaz that I bail out
Crocodile tears join to flood
In my arms and I will never set you free, set your free
What's this madness all about
The  winds blow 'cause the  winds know
Jacob wrestled the angel
Just how to make my world fall back
While it tears me apart
wie es die Frauen lieben
When all I know is what you tell me to
It's the beginning of the end
Excuse me, Mother, I am only bleeding
Acceptance of normality is what they want from you as proof,
Just when things are back on track, I sabotage myself
I am made of shamrocks, I am made of stern stuff
Let it go fall away back 
Honor lies in an unmarked grave
And you think so you're so fucking right
I'm a God with spoon and syringe Oh' sweet Jesus be my friend
And I'm still here singin', thinkin' 'bout the government
I never told you, but I feel you must know
And let me sing forever more,
You're my perfect tragedy
Better, better, better, better not tell
That I was wrong but not a crime
Bring her to my door now
Contract your own sale, fuck a deal, you're in a option
'Cause you just get fucked while you're locked in a prison
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
With a fake ass badge and a gun in your hand
So step aside and I'll take control
I know I am so fucking angry
Made the fear seem almost right 
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Veins are a racetrack for fuel that I need
I sit back with this pack of ZigZags and this bag
"I'ma let y'all know one thing man"
See the broken glass
When I lay myself to sleep
In my face
It's not for love but I'll gladly take your money
When you know it all
I look like a devil's child
I should've known better when you started to act weird
Pacifist guerrillas move undetected through concrete jungles
I'm disappointed
Und viele Tränen dick und naß 
I'm still standing here on my feet, God won't you just knock me to my knees, please
It's a shame because tha man's slain
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
My enemies, I let 'em get a load of me gat
And let's just say that things look different now
One good turn deserves another 
Hell, there's a car in the driveway
Chi scorre così Nessuno
And I can't cut a rug, without my fashion drugs
The sanctity pushed me on and off to the depths of my own cowardly demise
Nigga, you couldn't handle half of me
Heavenly devil 
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a hasbeen
That she's above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets
I wanna ride in the bat mobile,
As if it matters now
All I want is a little respect All I want is a little respect
Get it, abuse it, and what I'm left with is useless
My darkside love affair come to my protection
Pretend it works a while, it's transmitted live
They teach them how to kill when they hunger
I want to tell you
And I'll see you in hell, I'll be laughing 'cause you're dead
Be coming don't believe it just belife it
Virtuoso is an unidentified flying object to make your space shuttle 
I'll never, ever return 
Nigel just needs this helping hand
You thinking with your one brain, watch you decapitate
A generation with no place
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
Here's a new chicken shit angel eyed boy
And left, right, left
And feeling someone's hand around my neck
Walking like each others ghosts
I know you won't
Since you've been gone I feel so much better
And someday every man's best laid plans
How many happy endings do you need to change your fucking mind
Babes on the run with poisoned lips
Beat the drum, beat the drum, beat the drum
Never ending persistence
They're an inhuman race
He only wanted someone to play with someone to play
But the prince got colon cancer fate takes a dump
Mine is paradise
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of my boxcar door
But this guy, he said that I was on drugs,
You're accused but not on trial
And rape your children now 
You thought might kill
Twisted beyond a return
Well you know that the world
I know you'll think that I don't seem to care
You're the pain that I feel
The thoughts you think
Back stabbing hypocrite
They say, "You're wrong" again Every bit as wrong as you were before, when you first divined your word for love, now you wear it on your tongue, saturate your lips and kiss someone You're beautiful
'Cause they don't want to go home
When heaven falls
When the cops show up, they're gonna get the finger
Drunken pussies, what I'm thinking
I'm the selfappointed queen of shit
Venomous verbs of ruthless candour plagiarise assassins fervour 
They're hawking me from high atop the food chain
But when you come to my house with that draft shit
I'm a pound of flesh in a drum machine's dream, we watched
Don't know how to treat a lady, don't know how to be a man
JFK sold us freedom, or was it just a business toke
To defy the lies
Seven deadly sins are my commandments
Turning your backs on the problems that surface
All I feel 
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me  look bitch
Trying to step in my circle I'm leaving you purple and black
My mental state is fucking me up and I cried a pond
War within a breath, it's land or death
Just let me have one single day to myself
Go to hell, go to jail
With the spark to bring my punk rock back
I don't need nobody, better off alone
Just another face in the crowd
Break me, tell me as I die for you, for you 
Oh, don't you know that anyone can come
Working for the devil
I'm going to Hell for that bit And you're all coming with me And don't try to get out of it "We didn't laugh at that bit, Jesus, please" "Shut up Get on the bus with Leary and Scorsese You're going right to fucking Hell" And you know what Hell is, folks It's Andy Gibb, singing "Shadow Dancing," for eons and eons And you have to wear orange plaid bell bottoms and sit next to the Bay City Rollers "How you guys doing This is gonna suck"
Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sellout
Well I'm a truth addict, aww shit I gotta head rush
The world like cold as shit
I do ghetto shit
Gurgling bloody mess
Believe me now  We have no choice left with our backs against the wall
Mais toi dismoi
That I can beat, I can beat myself up with
You don't know what
Shock around the clock, from noon till noon
Bend me, break me, any way you need me
Rolling in pain
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter
There'll be no sleep till the morning
You swim I follow I'm feeling my head sink
Every feeling that I have
I rock a BBoy stance 'cause it's time to explode
You break my heart
No way, no way, no way you're gonna stop me
But I dug my teeth into my knees
I synonymer till fantastiskt, ja det var vad jag var då
That you know, and I know better
When this plane Crashes down there goes all our luck
There's blood on your hands
It feels like everyone's asleep
May turn may turn, may turn, may turn
Brother, get a fuckin' load of this
With no sacrifice
We're kissing violence
And let you know tonight
You know it's only the beginning
The memories are bittersweet;
I hope you get the fuck out of our hometown
 Okay What was the basic premise of Mao Mao Tse Tung said there's only one way a revolution can come Do you know, Millie How did Mao Tse Tung say the only way you can bring a revolution and keep it
As some warn victory, some downfall
I need a piss
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
It's all according to plan
For another unknown soldier
Beg a hoe, let it go, dick ain't edible
You've got commercial sex appeal
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
I'll lie again and again and I'll keep lying
I'd trade an eternity, that's why, you fucking forced me to say
Makes you believe I'm one of a kind hey, hey, hey
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
You better take a good look 'cause I'm full of shit
Millions of men with blank faces, 
I'm a rose petal fallen from a mainline train
Sharpened tongue
Lost your rhythm and your stealing' fire breather bringing smoke
We get they ass up off the corner 'cause they dyin' tonight
Don't kill me, I have two kids at home, don't kill me I said I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you, hurry the fuck up
The deepest black
Despite your reaction
But bearing the taste that moves either one of you
Well I'm not
Now all my niggas gettin' bucked, overbite
It's not that No, you think I'm ugly Baby
Backstabber greedy fucking fit haver 
I don't wanna be up or down Why
I'm the one that speak the language of fate
They spilled his brain like homey the fuckin' clown
Me, I have the odd future motherfucking sargeaning
The pain
há vida na terra, há rumores no ar
I'm living in a dream, and no one hears me scream
Yeah, this movie's gonna kill me
Everybody, everybody, everybody dies
All alone in my thoughts and fears
Look motherfucker, my words damage and slaughter
I do this for the dead, rest in peace I'm holdin' you near
You liar
Mistic, With the mischief you bring you senseless bitch you out of
I need a new feel dirty
You know why
Choked back years of memories
I gave your friends all a chance
You feel like you and that's just beautiful, that's beautiful
And I don't know just who I am
I'll spend the night in here
Alone, you support, and embrace
Oh no, I don't understand
So fuck you
Now who's a faggot, you punk
When I wake up, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
Would you save my life is I got sick
You say it offends you, all the talking it never ends
Until my friendship is a part of the phase
"They can have this revolution as long as they remember who gets to win the war"
And firetrucks
You empty shell
 miles of separation, you're still real to me
With the sound of a shotgun cocked and realized you're fucked
We'll scar your minds
Believe me
That skate hard, Thrash black hoodies, try something
Tragedy in your own dream
I'm gonna run away and join the circus, oh yeah
I told myself to keep my mouth shut
Yeah what's the good of forgiveness if the sinners go free
All your sins will be forgiven
I'm gonna like you know, I'm gonna prove that it's my own voice
I listened to everyone now I know that everyone was right
To bow out at the end
You, alone and graceless
Always darkest before the dawn
You're no longer daddy's boy
Huh  well that's not my bag
So you can suck my fuckin' dick through a glory hole
You say I'm not your kind of girl
There ain't nothing fucking with this ya know why
When you come crashing down and there's no help around
Fuck his ass up
And when you get to tha end, you'll find a chair
But I won't stop now Real Niggas
I'm not a slave
The qualifying factors are politics and class,
There's too much doubt in my mom's words
As we go up, we go down Is just a lie
The crowd you're in thinks you're so amusing
You can jerk niggaz but you can't jerk me
So you want inside of me
I'm not a body
They sniffin' yeyo, I don't know what to say, yo
You know
Aim for the face lift
Cause this one is mine
You're a bastard you know it's true
Stumbling around in a mental circle because you never cared enough to be black
I am the animal who will not be himself
I don't know if you got a man or not
You think I'm gonna come this far and let you niggas stop me now
How do I say no
And Goblin You get no props on it
Big guns are pointed at me,
Cause the wrecking crew come knock'n down the door
Don't know what I'm doing
There is no fucking you, there is only me
See when I be coming through kicking it raw, niggas like, "Gee, he's dope"
Still I do not understand
You gotta get it all out now
Solarising future pictures
Chorus Second half
And you swore that there was no one else with you
I wanna drive to vegas in your nazi car
Bury them bones
Love stirred up a storm inside me
That he not busy being born is busy dying
You're dancing in your sleep
"Death campaigns are a fucking gold mine"
Push pause on the game What the fuck's your name
Don't give me your shit, don't give me your nothin'
I do it because I want to, not to stay in the game
Funny, how familiar
But I don't know when it comes and it goes
I'm not your family
Il nome intero è Marracash, ma
And burned beneath the ice
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
To my everlasting shame
Someday I won't listen to you bitch 
And some scars on the skin
Like stop suffering
I can feel it in the air breathe
I'm gonna be the man that gets drunk next to you
Show me respect
No no no more wishing
I learned just how to beat you
They just swallow me whole
You're so fake, you make me shake
There's nothing left to use
Pass the buck or pass the baton
That blurs like an answering machine
I know that they do it better
Perds pas de temps va, va prendre l'air, va reviens pas
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
I guess you're happy somehow 'cause you made me stop believing
Yeah, I've been through some battles before
I'm not too amused with humans
And she lost the game
Spread your legs shut your mouth
Life gets dragged like racist lipstick on men's faces
Two tickets to a film I don't remember
Janet Reno has no ego when devoured by the id
Beg to join me here or stay where you stand there to deny all your faults and beg to join me here
There is no way to escape
I swear, I shall not deceive thee Yeah
If anything happens, don't fuckin' blame me, white America, fuck Bill O'Reilly
Who the fuck wants to live forever
Your face looks so green
Though I know that I can't help you anyhow
And it's hard to believe it could come down to this
I'm runnin' from friend to friend
Pretending not to notice
Whatever
Old growth forests, first you go and log it
And you're gonna need a lot of information to know what you're gonna wanna do
Whyeeieei is my bleeding heart beating
When you peel out and drive away
But extend your hand Extend your hand
I'll die
How the hell do we set stuffed
But that's no excuse for it
I'm through cryin' for you, no more lyin' for you
We wanna live our life
Do you think I'm scared to play your games
I had myself fooled into meeting you
Makin' on time,  years we on tour we blow you back off
The road is turning for me,
Stupid motherfucker, pull your head out your ass and see
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
That Paincave Kid talk, at the end of the painbow, the permanent stain bop
The rain burns in my eyes 
You want that personal attention
I've got to find something new that I can be now
Just let me lie here next to you
To make yourself the fool
Then I gotta open up another can of asswhippin
You want me to believe 
And you won't feel a thing You wont feel a thing
Something inside your head made a violent change
You must understand me, the end is surely coming
Blow up in the face of my rivals
Love, hate, lust
Gallons of crap that nobody really needs,
Bark out abuses to the weakest at the back of the line
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
It creeps up on you without a warning
Well I didn't wanna hurt your feelings, honey
God's truth, I'm not lying
I am Sam, I am known to go HAM, the full retard
They'll never break you, but you keep it comin'
On these loving tongues
It's not what I mean
And the gun's in my hand and I know it looks bad 
I'm not crazy, I'm a fucking table, I'm a fucking table
Counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums
And across the kitchen table
Unstable situation
But now you'll have to pay
You're so fuckin' big
The one mistake you made was in your head
Nothing is worth the sleep that I've lost
I say, "What you wanna do " She say, "It's simple, Marcus
We'll make a joyful noise
I just end up getting hurt again by myself
Wanna end up with no one to talk to
Lemme put you on game
Clear your thoughts with Speyside
The motherfucker's on selfdestruct, nobody guarding your back, it's all a front
And now I'm ready for my adversary, talk is cheap P Dog
Where are my bones
Now you're dead, now you're dead, now you're dead
I know it's sad life's just a piece of fruit
I'm broke as hell, my attitude is no good
If we make it to the final scene fake flowers
He knows that something somewhere has to break
We americans is positive
Buss it free fall
Där dyrkan utav döden är den enda sanna tron
I'm not like you 
Well they can fuck off, 'cause they ain't got me, and they can't buy my dignity,
And you're mine
This song goes out to my good friends
Who hypnotised the guilt in career rhythm trance
Don't feel right
When she's thrown into the fire
Open it up, the stink of you sin
Can get a woman thinking her period is late
We're ascending through the hollow mountain
Well, I move in another dimension
I'm a razor blade slittin' through a wrist of hate
Rule nigga
In the few short years since I was a young boy
Don't want anything I want nothing from you
Like no other guy
Living in a world full of cokeheads, butchering jokes, wanting all your attention
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Oh no, I don't think so
You all are the people, they're runnin' around
I'll kill you right there
As tears roll down below your knees
You had a chance but now there's nothing
With scars from shaping
There, now that's not so bad, is it
I'm a selffulfilling porno queen, yeah
Ignore it
Did the job but it up and died
I want to kill this killing wish
Oh, and this gift you left for me
Little punk needs to be inside the public eye
You know I hate you
Don't go knock on my door
I don't know why all I need is someone to save me
Put the plastic back in the machine
They ain't shit they ain't sayin' shit spray 'em 
Here comes the war Did you think we were born in peaceful times
Wild when the waves start to break
Now, now, now
Kerosene around, now what do we do
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get Hello
Crawls back up his cheek and slowly disappears
So debauched in your slick mink
Start a riot in this Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch x
I'm not here to let you down
Fill your hungry wretched life
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
But I hate to leave my children crying
Do you eat sleep do you breathe me anymore
And head trip news turn a trick to the flow
You thought that you'd find me in tears
At first, I'm like "Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine"
Could have been , could have been , could have been a million nigga's that hopped on you huh
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
I got a rock and roll car
So now I've got you wonderin' if I've got it in for you
I'm a sister and I'm a motherfuck
Pay in blood
My soul tickles, but this ain't even fun and games
Promptly fell asleep
Forlorn dispised
I got friends but they don't know me, but I'd tell the world to blow me
Back up in your ass with The Resurrection
Won't be my fault when you're painted in the corner of a nogood life, this is
A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not
Every time you think you're walking, you're just moving the ground
You gotta scrape the concrete off your dick
Behind my back
I wanted to be free
All the shit that you ever wanted in one MC, Hop has it
About you standing in the doorway
I want to live
Afflicted by their dispossession
But every chance I get to put a smile on someone's face I will take it,
So I resolved to make amends
I don't complain and I don't take a stand
Pocketfil of mistakes
I'll carve them all with a flick of my wrist
And you talk like you're a pro at this
The size of a half a dolla'
This feeling of anger
 I did what you want
I feel like a boy the age of 
Kasamas hold me down and remember that I love you
And there's no crashing until I see this through
I wanna party all night 'til they call the cops
And I'm wild
'Cause if you're not trying to make something better
To strip tender flesh from these swine
That's a great message but I smell your lies under it
Don't let it fuck with you
Starfuckers, Incorporated
What's a man now, what's a man mean
Asks that you not smoke
Buck 'em and scram, don't use the shotty no more
Of the psycobeta beatdown, boy you get done
The nose in the clouds
'Cause I got a bad habit
And I give it all back to you
I'll make you feel LIKE A NATURAL WOMAN
Knowing full well they'd prefer you were dirty 
And a bleeding hand
And I've got to tell you a little sum about the way that I feel
Keep me company as I hunt down and kill my enemies cause there must be
Freedom holds a doubleedge for me
Watchin the danger and niggaz double crossin they peers
All these little dreams you got, they're not shit
Not with grace but loathing
I got the boat so we don't drown
The queen of clubs drinks in pubs on days off, over
Everyone wants America's
Woman hello , help me, help me
Your thought of revenge makes you blind
Your democracy, is not for me
You pretend
'Cause I make you feel so strong and so powerful inside
Do you know what they do
I was hoping that you'd know better than that
I'm not no animal
I ain't got no muthafuckin' daddy, he ain't teach me shit
To war, to bring death not peace
Swallow all your bitter pills
The fools Slogan has become an anthem I watch ascend the charts
Offering forgiveness, then they talk of eyes for eyes
Lives no more
Let me burn your eyes
Within the rhythm of my fucking feet
Fighting to stay ahead a part of the game
We animals out the zoos, with a fuse abused
That we should now begin our freedom for to win
Where all my lovers turn to stone
The enemy is right here g, them foreigners never did shit me
And some talking about our car and imaginary mansions
Did you want something
Burned all of my porno, you say it offends you
And you have no idea
If there's anyone throwing dirt at my name then you know he be toast
Then you know a bigger burden comes with it
Oh that drink went down smoothly, just like the one before the last you had
I may not mystify you
I then rolled wit the traffickers worked in the Maximas
I feel good
Is not my volition
And I lie awake with an achin'
Twofaced junkie social mores
You're saying words but you know I ain't listening
I bet you muthafuckas will too
Set me on fire, kerosene
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough
When another girl violates that
Nobody knows anything at 
And it feels like that you're with me
Seven hundred plus see the killed and held prisoners
Living in a rat race
Marijuana on the planet earth
Am I to believe that you hold the key
And his her power all in her club sandwich
Uhhuh I'm at home now
When you live in your mind
And I won't talk, I won't get stuck with you
You should've left the light on
I know now that I'll never learn
I wanna see you when you're high
On a ticket back to London
Were ya waiting at the bus stop all your life
I'm not underdressed, you're overdressed
There's nothing here but a shadow, nothing here
Your now about to witness the power
"It's a lie, it's a copout and I know you know I know why
And I don't know whether
The angels singing
I taste the embrace
What the fuck do I know about a grenade
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
Way before Christopher Columbus set sail
You'd be wilding out if you knew I had packed my things,
They had our brothers beating us Called us createns plus monkeys
We could've made it out, but oh
You can never touch me now
It's not cause for a repression
Me you're sorry with a straight face 
The silent guns of love will blast the sky
Now is the season for war with no reason
You know I feel like a preacher waving a gun around
Her heated head and arms across my chest
I know the the PJ's the plats and the plays
I feel for your lies no more
Kansas City motherfucker, full of dangerous skill
Out of the blue and into the fire
And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise, sounds like a fucking poltergeist
I'm the Everlastin' freestyle assassin
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
Spray paint the walls
Will you remember me 
Got friends to see,
'Cause I'll see your face in hell, my friend
Even I'll let fate decide
II want you
I believe I'll be taking my revenge
She then strung me along threw away these years
So don't you give me give me give me your nothingno
She lost all her innocence
RULE love me or hate me baby
As I move upon the slate
I'm here to tell you loves not some fucking blood on the receiver
My mind's a nonstop tape playing and I can't rewind it
Taking no shit when push comes to shove
And then the stillness of the night reminds
Look at the tiger jumping out of her mouth
You know that I fucked all my homies' ho's
Well lady and gentelman, boys and girls, you know what'll happen next, I've got my prince, and few weeks of beautiful happiness, and then the prince got ill and die of colon cancer Fuck I found love, and it got cancer So I gonna hang around the shithole called no more, boys and girls I'm gonna kill myself like you will, and I'll take that bitch stepmother with me
Shut up When I'm talking to you
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic
He screamed you fucking crack whore called me a fucking bitch
To feel like I'm alive
I'm not affected you've been rejected
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love
You want someone to hurt like you Forfeit the game
Count your sanity away, Put your faith in misery
I'm just freeing my mind
Sitting here tryin' to get that old thing back thing back oh
And a law that they set out what's love
Never get to fall in love
But your daddy left you with no love
He seems not to wanna trade
Not from me its no no
I even signed it at the bottom so you'd remember my name
I don't have much time left
This cannot be all that there is to life,
Yo, Em What Don't kill nobody this time Aright
A lot of people ask me, stupid fuckin' questions
Screaming, there's the asshole
Black women you are not a bitch you're a Goddess
A spider underneath my skin
Poison, girl poison
With nowhere to hide
Silent screams, quelled with pins
How the birds will sing
And don't remember
That we're sitting still in the garage and nodding off a mirage
I don't wanna
Oh, I see you in my mind
Is our relationship and breakup is not a competition
I know what's in the air
Ain't it just a bitch
I gave you a wristwatch, baby
Please someone kill me, tear me up and throw me away
Oh oh oh oh, If looks could kill then death would be my name
Welcome to the death of a century 
And if you're gonna cry to me baby
Yeah, rock out, whatever
That's why I give props to niggaz who is independent
The girlscout fell from grace
Here we are now, entertain us
I wouldn't have screamed
There's nothing no trace
And I'd like you to know that I don't care
Now burning black inside of me, inside me
I know your name
 miles from Atlanta, this is nowhere,
And I don't care now what you say I don't care what you say
Everybody wants somewhere
Blessed be my fate and my tools of expedience
This nigga screamed like a bitch
Eradicate my knowledge of my history
So next time someone makes you feel little
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
There ain't no scapegoats left to blame
And burn them and flush 'em 
You promised me another wish, another way
You wanna get burned
I torti restano,', fra questo so
Minding my own business,
When I come home, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
When in fact they're not
We've all felt like shit
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if
These are the vices of the pnoid bastards who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest,
I promise that there's no crashing until I see this through
I like doing it with you because you love this ass
We always seem to fall without family to hold
With your narrowminded cronies who are fools of the first division
How many people die
There's no reason to live at all
I can't take this now
With a boom box of beats and a book of rhymes
Gather round you sinners who don't believe in peace
Boy you don't wanna fuck wit me Don't wanna fuck wit me
You only want me when I'm gone
Giving back a bit of never giving a fuck
Nail your remorse to the cross
Tune into the prudence of the dark heart news
All our pain
So I'll beat my meat like I'm a fucking butcher
Seeing you is like pulling teeth
The fire burns inside
I want, it want it, need it done
Stalk my enemy and let the fuckin' silencer cook
No one no one
When you leave him your key, he ends up having sex in your apartment with miss NonBitterness
Has been eating my belief away
She sees her stepdaddy comin' and her knees get weak
And I couldn't care less about what you want to say
The missing bride
Voting doesn't work, 
And I every time I tell that lie, I live without guilt
The disenchanted, the romantics
I wanna hang your windows when you've gone to the sea
Zawsze tak pełno krzyku
So now we've all discovered the world wasn't only made for whites
I need to know
Of the disease riding on your lips
Who the hell are you to tell me
By a memory that won't help
Do you know
Hat es zweck zu fliehen
It's that famous shit, you know
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you
And the master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo
These niggaz wearin' skirts like the pope
Pollution we fumble till the end
And said, "God, if I have to die, you will have to die"
The world will turn with no one left to live
I feel my blood boiling
My gut feeling says it's all fake
Bring them up in noman's land where no one really wants them
Ill make you feel just like a lowly worm
Play a fool
Waiting innocently as time went on life's gotten worse my resentment's strong
Man, I been waitin' all night now, that's how long I've been on ya
Or at least I can feel 
To my old best friend
ma se io prendo chi è che dà
Dus stop met al die verhalen
It will be my last, real bitter song about you
Your paranoia is starting to boil
Tyler you obviously have some fucking problems
Your absence beating inside my chest
Is there any way to stop this merry go round
Oh yeah, he wants to take you
So go and speak your mind
You know you're not the boss of me
On a bus bench singing that song
Well, if that's what you wanted to hear
It feels good to knock things down
And I really wanted just to be in your body
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Bitches brewing in our stews, on they knees like the pews
And I wanna slave
'Cause it's my fate
Pra seu governo, o meu estado
Ready and willing Can't stop the bleeding
Serve to remind me of all the pain I've caused
Please believe me when I say
I cry out for guidance, I cry
'Cause I know that none of it is true
Better leave real quick cause you know me
But failure's a lesson that's best learned alone
Dope thoughts come when I hear a kick drum
After we smoked too much pot
You best ban TV if you want me stop
And angry men to terrorists
They were just looking for what they wanted to see
Won't you let her taste her sins
And the cannons will roar as we march to the capitol, dragging your hide
Like I don't owe nobody nothing
Please understand that these are the years
You want a choice want to make your own decisions
You lie to yourself and remain alone
And so a third of my life is gone with nothing to show
So you wanted to take a break
With no last words I tried to keep you near
I've lost all control
Fuck me, fuck you, fuck you fuck you fuck me
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
I, I can't and I want to so bad
I'm taking over thoughts in your mind
 No, I'm sorry
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred
She paid for the blackout
He says we're fucked up but we're not the same
You'll feel a lot better
And nothing can take us back to innocence
It's a game 
Ah my mind going next, sucker punch solar plex
Huh, what you want
Intend to deny, but when it comes back around
So fuck it, guess what, this rap is about me
But I don't think I can, so fuck you anyway
I hope that you're still trying to have a killer time
She's fuckin crazy and obsessed with death
I know you're not bashful
She's got his number and she's not afraid to use it
You know that I'm not ruled by laws
What do you want from me
Actin' like it was my homie, just a fuckin' phony
Do what you feel
And I think you need some help
I don't believe you
Your jury they will recognize the lies, the lies, the lies, the lies
Whatever happened to protecting each other
In a face a view, through eyes this world collides
Then you're the fuckin' man as well
I coulda killed you when you said your seed was growin' from his semen
I'm the one that speak the language and the anguish of hate
All the pain inside amplified by the
I remember all the places
The world we know
There was no guilty verdict
So turn on turn on, turn on turn on
Postin my head from myself to get back to me
I am a fool I know
I'm stuck here and I know it
I want to break free with my heart 
Nothing's real and nothing lasts
At least it feels that way
And fuck you and you and in addition
In my glass coffin
And pray the machine falls to sleep
Seems I gots to lay the law down
And you smoked with the ghost in the back of my head
So here's a present to let you know I still exist
Let me tell you something We need a twoandahalf hour movie about the Doors, folks No, we don't I can sum it up for you in five seconds, okay "I'm drunk, I'm nobody I'm drunk, I'm famous I'm drunk, I'm fucking dead" There's the whole movie, okay Big Fat Dead Buy in a Bath Tub, there's your title for you
Behind a plastic wall
When he was standing
The bastards gettin' under like crowded parties wit no laminents
On the warpath, unrelenting
The question's asked, do you still believe it
Sanction to a dirty sow
That's why you're all singing along
Sex, death, sex, death, sex, death, sex
Sometimes you're nothing but meat
What is it you really want
Well the man tells me my future, is not so far away
You were the one who believed
You sucking the life out of me
In these days you can get no rice
When your ashtrays are filled with piss
I know the world's got problems
Rub it better till it bleeds
So don't be trying to blame the world for your nonsense bitch I'll fuck around a smack yo ass
Study of a face in a figure 
I live like a dog in a house full of shit
Und warum
What you're seein is a dirty splash of Kansas City Eurotrash
Hey rabbit, I came to win
My optimism is masking my failure
Lately you've found I break between white walls that burn the nerves
And the anger builds up inside
 Sameh Zoonoobee Allah 
Real thug shit
When you go in for the kill
Push or click over like somebody's trying to beep in
Devil's got dandruff got her nose to the grind
I tune in with a bullet to shut down the devil sound
All I know is
Und sie fragte  was ist gefährlicher, rassistische Polizisten oder Saharasand
You drew the sparkle back into my eyes
Sit pretty now, watch the wishes fall
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
If she could put her hand on the brake of the land, find the treason in the diesel and the smoke, she would jar the teeth of the dull and the meek and feed them the truth until they choke
Deine Ketten sind verschweißt, keiner wird dich wiedersehen
They will drown in their greed
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic
Just remember this fuck, I'm the dead guy
You're driving me crazy being institutionalized
That you make underground
I don't need you telling me I've got my back against the wall
Good grades on the wall, niggas hate to see me do it major
Where's the fuck you
Life's not meant to be disposable
And I hope she knows I've got this memory,
Album version
Sometimes I get pissed
Make you sorry for the fact that you attempted and failed
It can be really dangerous
You're, you're looking distressed
It makes me wanna bite who's on stage like Carlos Mencia
How dare you stand corrected
U sound like a bitch
To make fakes promises to me
My tongue gets twisted in your twirl
'Cause I ain't ever had no beef, but now I need some fuckin' heat
I shot Reagan with the help of the secret service
If they never know I'm gone, they will never notice it
I, I know what you need
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
My arms hit the water past the disappearing shore 
And I know that I'm better
I might as well use a gun
And I learn every room long enough
Scarin' motherfuckers like Steven King flicks
Use a whip on your ass so you behave faster
I wanna try and die
If I gave you all my heart you'd send it back in pieces
When you know God is dead
You try to get me back
Kiss more ass like you do
Sparkling darkly as it cuts your feet
What color are they now
Thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
Far from the sirens and the screams
You assume just because I'm a rapper, you can approach me in a hoish way and get something out of it
Strangers in the world it seems
Or keep you from the cold
And the mighty of Earth will have no other recourse
You know I love you baby
Some people chose the road to be hoes
Fall in chains
Ici on prend des risques on mise gros
And you know, that little short gay lightskinned nigga and that fatass nigga Domo
My mind is blank
Now that you're aware we're gonna give you the message
What the fuck you doing in there
Got the town crazy over beats rhymes and life
And then the blood from severely severed ear
I'll bathe in red, I'll break his every bone
But you're not benefiting
It's just a natural  you never fuckin' possessed
I've lost my mind in wanderlust
Surrender
In their rendition of
And with our flesh and bones
None of this really matters anymore
That she hadn't any money
You've got a knife for the girls and a knife for the men
And even if her plane crashes tonight she'll find some way to disappoint me
Is like an evil sin
So back up off of me in this Bitch
And I got a habit of gettin' my way
I'm gonna get up, and out, and wild
With no expression at all
Wrap your arms 'round this everlasting kiss
And I'd have no time to grieve
Mouth loaded with a gun
I've given you everything, baby what do you want from me
I knew my enemy was near
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hiphop
'Cause *trying to sing like Aretha Franklin*
I don't care if you're ready or not, the sentiment tears my hold
In der deutschen Verfassung steht
I'll make you lick my injuries
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
dass alle über mich lachen
Think before you sink to the bottom
You're pretending
To bleed and die quickly
So get with Ollie 'cause I'm probably fin to make you mad P Dog
So, go on and make your families proud
Paranoid of my retaliation, living in fear
That I know, into the decay, another day
Courtin' fate and fate 
Do you remember my name
I wanna think of nothing
You don't know what's right or in your mind
You adhere to a set of standards and tastes
In the s when the bricks came on military planes
If only I could release instead of talking to myself
What the hell am I doin' here
To the beige row of houses and the prospect of spending
Are you still around, why haven't you managed to die yet
And you know, you know, you know it all went wrong
Something you don't want to view
Know I don't hate you
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine
You just got burnt
So easy to control, bring to harm
I know where I can't know, I bleed for me and mine
"I can not seem to say what I want to relate, but by His power I will say
Oh, god help me
DRE with that fuck a bitch shit fuck a biatch
Nothin' like pain to keep us all the same
There is no going back, this wasn't meant to last
So, one last time, I'm back
With hardened mind I traveled, with hardened mind I conquered 
Laugh like a motherfucker
Maybe I was just asking too much
My tunnel vision for life, it drives me
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
He says, "Give it up boy, give it up or you're gonna die, Women and kids of all ages 
He thinks I've got no time
And you've reached the end
How can I eat such a harmless animal
Oh, you're not rid of me, Yeah; you're not rid of me,
Go fuck yourself
We're headed down to the lake this weekend
Sores breakin' on my funky ass feet
A bump on a log, guard ball, I'm god awful
My rap skills will thrash you
I wanna
When I'm alone and I'm so damn bored
Get served that riddle that kills your character
All the while just showing your teeth,
I still recall what made me like you
No, not chew pop
Does it hurt now
L'Etat veut notre peau, espérons qu'on sera aux choses divers
That you fired the first lethal shot
And I don't want a part of all your hatred
Just a pain
The people who grinned themselves to death
There's a lady who knows
In the darkness where the angels cry
But here's the kicker, it doesn't matter
Deeply I scream from within
You got a piece and hit across the sky 
Feel the love and appreciation from all of my niggaz
I know you're faking
As of now I'm down straight up
Stay TRUE  now that's the one thing I religiously pledge
Could've doubled as a power
From now on I'm gonna be so much more weary
For a sunrise or a sunset, you're either coming or you just left
My best ain't good enough for you
And you're death comes wicked painful and slow
I'm washing my hands, I'm cleansing my soul
One time we believed but now its passé and cliché
And you suck it 
Behind your back in the supermarket
But you know just as well as I
But I'm gonna die
For a bit of cash to spend
Stand up like a man and not be there 'cause I care for you
Schizophrenic nightmares sending shivers down my spine
Bloodsport, anymore heads face the blade
One day you'll be the end of me
You're so pretty when you die
Pretend I died Into the hell I call my head,
He sees the masses dancing so he sternly reprimands them 
There was no young punk
It feels good not to be dealin' with petty cash
You know Casey Anthony, was handling
Everytime were taking one step forward,
ja ruotsinopettajan Visan
And it is no fun
Living for a lie
So you can fuck yourself
Familiar exchanges
I'm not ready for sincerity
Help me to know 
We got a right wing king making third world war
I was waving around a bleeding open wound
We scream it, we yell it, we living murda murda murda
And angels lie when stars cry
Und dann wieder der Absturz in die Wirklichkeit
Future is a mass of shade 
So wear a vest on your chest and the rest stand still
A man dies like a butterfly
My heart is filled with disgust
So I can show you who really ballin' in this bitch
It was just one shot
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
With messages not thought of when released
Disputed I will not be locked down
Just a little break from the games that you play
Let fall your drapes
From Apartheid days, now caught up with AIDS
You can buy god it's Monday
I'm not the one who made the world what it is today
It's not what I took from you
Control your thoughts,
Right,�left,�front�and�back,�it�overflows�with�despair�and�pain
Just a Cassandra too drained to painfully word it further
Choosing left from right
Choking, gasping, dripping spit
Now we drive the night
But no one looks like me
In the crowd of pain
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
Its time to come back around
A plan that I can implement
Bored as fuck with this street cornercover,
Left, left, right
A religious fanatic posts footage of an interfaith service project
Everyone left you where'd you go
I'll be assistant to the blind knife thrower
Always falling
To be able to sleep at night
Hey God, I really don't know what you mean
Make a move, I saw you winking
Come on and work it baby
The flesh summons pain and I do the same
I wanna feel
I watch them cut, watch them touch, watch them do what they came to do
Well, I sit on the corner and I drink drown soda
Who you know fresher than Hov' Riddle me that
I talk so foul, I talk so coarse, I show no regret, I show no remorse
At least you could pretend 
Or a homosex, hermaph or a transaves
I seen your pic on Facebook, the skank bitch done tagged you in it"
'Cause time has no meaning when you're free
The NYPD ain't got shit on me
I knew you wouldn't understand
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Wanna be a member, wanna have some fame
Your disease and you your disease and you
At the bottom of a dark
Well shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you, you know why
If you flip me off, I'll get in your face
I couldn't pull a damn anorexic bitch in a tugowar
There's no one to feel ashamed for
Just passed away in here
One to myself, another to the multitude
Oh burning fire 
I don't know why
And your bass master, singing trout
Points a finger at me finger at me
There is no god behind their lies
The sweat of miners digging diamonds,
I lead a life of crime
It'll get you just a little bit sick
You been hawged and your souls been damned
Hot damn I'm a "Slam" ya like Onyx
I just want you to live up to
Too many happy faces, is that more than you can bear
Don't really feel the need to argue this and that
As human gods aim for their mark
Has never felt the way that I feel
You better not miss it 'cause buddy I swear
Neon black lemonade drip drips from his grin crammed with cool charm,
I just wanna know
Ab morgen wendet sich das Blatt
And maybe we'll come back to earth, who can tell
Raggedy ass, holes in your kneehighs
Where the poor have now become the enemy
This Parisian sex flick
And I know it got you reelin' 
You're the drug that works
You give me dirty looks because I been what you want
I think I should warn you
The game is lost, eternal love
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
'Cause I can sex your brainain
We don't want your fucking love
So 'fore you rest your case
I try to pretend I'm fine 
Peace of mind's so hard to find
So you to can prop up your fake cool
One day I'll introduce myself and you'll see you've not yet met me
Syd gay ass, puttin' her clit on other bitches nipples and shit whatnot
And I don't condone dickriding
My face is scraped and bloodied
Bert, fuck my ass
Tell me How many niggas brought they irons tonight I did
You want so bad to be the victim
Now you know how it feels to drop the ball
There won't be another day
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
Because their hair gel that they use isn't tested on animals
But I'm depressed and I don't wanna carry on
Then they stab us in the back and lie to our face
Understand 
I should've thought things through
You only want me when you're high
We are all crazy
This one's a crazer, daydreaming disaster
He treats his brothers like his enemies
War, war, war
You will suffer true pain
'Til come the day when the last fight's won
Return my love x
Sometimes I feel you don't understand
Nigga, I sleigh, you pray, kill that ass uptown
Are you personally offended by an iron on your jeans
Oh, If I could somehow make you mine
Tried to pretend it was all in her mind
And the phone would ring like a joke that's left unsaid
If ignorance is bliss
Voices healing my pain
It gets tricky don't be picky if the slipper fits you wear it whore
And I can see those fighter planes
Thorn in my fucking side
How I love to hate yourepeat
Cast to the fire
Just bodies, they brightly scratch
I'ma come back for my clothes
Nappy ass hair
Kill your master with one cut of your knife
Go the Motherfuckin gym and loose the gut and your fine
There's still songs about bitches from  witnesses ha ha
I want to sit with my legs wide open and
And I'm not benefiting
Mmmmmmm Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
IIIIIs Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on
And watch the wheels go round
The beat, wears it like a kevlar
And each endless night
I love the way you lie
Voi kamalaa, no nyt se syö makkaraa
What I want from this, is learn to let go
The road you cross, isn't quite a crossroad
And Puerto Rican chicks tell me that I fuck like I'm loco crazy
The tragedies reside in you
A middle finger with a barrel and it's fucking cocked
Trying, and I mean that shit
Or it's gonna be a massacre, Tiananmen Square
You slapped her ass, that's alarmin'
Have you got any money
You wanna be kitch
Why do I feel desperate now
Did you think that I would disappear
Don't believe me, ok be right back, I'm headed to the gun store
Flyin' back and fourth overseas
Nightmare without sleep
Why, oh, why just like a snowman
Systemised atrocity ignored 
Brothers like me fill up with hate
One more girl on an insect diet
Burning down old glory while we jump around and shout
Missed it and hit its face
Kill television kill television kill television difficult, isn't it
Today, my name  is pain
I'm channeling seventeen dead revolutions
io non vi voglio credere
Now meaning is left on my own
If you can't keep your tongue
That day is not today
She couldn't run away 'cause she was crazy
Southern fist rise through tha jungle mist
Got sick and tired of seein' brothers being treated ill
Like the lick of carnivorous winds
Have no regret
Shot and shot again 
I want you to see somebody else
You'd think by now that I'd be over this
And it's not what I wanted ti to be
Now don't tell me they don't turn around and kiss them peoples' ass
Our work is never over
So break me shake me hate me take me over
Make it stop, oh, I can't make it stop, it's on again
And his friends made me swear I wouldn't tell
The sink that by his bed gives off a stink
Reminding you to breathe
And they would take our drugs and money, as they pick our pockets
'Cause I'm not angry with you
There's no cure
And I see you hand in hand with another man
I don't want to be a child of disgrace
Little punk wants to thrive on the industry lie
There's bullet proof glass in case there is trouble
Paint our money black
I could creep up beside put a gun in your mouth
But when it jumps, they ain't got no murder skills
Everyone left you
Disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Please proceed to your gate, we are ready to board now
But, I'm strong enough to take that phone
You can never look back to the visions from the past,
I am  ft of anger
A man has gun
Mai tais on a white beach, coconuts bitch
I'm steady waiting for the day I get to see his ass P Dog
The soulless that you're made into
My friends are turning into opposites
And I am, whatever you say I am
And coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouth
When another girl violates that What, what
When the hook sets in and when this all ends
Time passed, my oppression got you living with drama
Have you turned yourself from me
Out on Bail Y'all don't need to know about
With your pretty little face
Mousey, grungy, deceptive, wrecked
Away from this It's never ending
For everything you die for 
Don't wanna see your face
Neither a joke
Your voices aren't clear enough after all
I'm not perfect, nobody's perfect
She's thinks she's smooth, thinks she's smooth and now I'm saying
I'll be the biggest dick that you ever had
By grace, my sight grows stronger and I will not Be a Pawn 
We all talk having greens, but none of us own acres
And your aphasia strikes a bargain with the barter yardie
Yeah the blood poured down the picket lines
With enough effort and knowledge
She's worked here a year longer than I
And I need you to remember one thing one thing Mike
Niggas off the chain because they affected
"I am not your savior
So much that we don't even notice that we're stuck in the box
We tell them dope stories, introduce them to the game
You can hate me now QB
But see when I've got a bit of heartache in my system
And muthafuckers lost their minds
I won't rhyme on top no tracks
I want to rewind every frame from this moment
As time passes by
Bags full of smelling salts, mad as the magazine
Only  percent that's controlling us
And it turned out to be a scab
Forget everything you think you know about me
Count the bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums
Ain't no fuckin' marble memorial
The reek of your lies draws flies
And if you lie you don't deserve to have friends
Witch cunt burn this girl
Some kids who flash like they assassins
And build up walls that make us safe
And I want to believe
That you want him to notice you
Beyond good and evil
Through the darkness of a corridor
I tore a battle banner from His hide
Like we really still don't know who the fuck you are
If I could find the will to kill
I've stopped listening
It feels like nothing is
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
I'd run so far away from you
And she thought it really funny
It's not the last time we'll fuck it up
As she sent her straight to hell
But no drug war funds for clinics
pero nunca quedas mal con nadie
Let the pass be the pass sugar
Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap
Never anything but jump kerosene
They cannot change me
We talk among ourselves and hope nobody sees us
There's no civilians
And still get called their friend
It's out of key and foolish
Get off my back
"Ever think the world is just one big blubbery walrus ready to sink it's ivory tusks into you Me too"
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone
This is a song about the everyday occurrences that make me feel like letting go
The state of The State, it makes you feel sick,
Believe me when I tell you
Can I just be another risk you're running now
Than sadness and pain
Just like a rat race
Now I know I'm taking the biggest piece
I'm gonna be proud and loud and outta control
Just when you thought it was safe, you got raped
We see them burnin' crosses
They are spelling disaster 
You're gonna die tomorrow
I don't want to hate
I see bitch in your eyes
We want it back today
Belief Belief
I ran with a thug nigga, believe that
Won't letcha in for love, nor money
He could pick up a habit or get in trouble
See that reason down before you die
Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm
Mr PIG, could I fuckin' see
Holding us back
Now your mother used to tell me you ain't nothin' but some trouble
Yeah, I kill what I need
Intelligangsta fin dal giorno uno
But now it's never here
I'm not no red football
And when the fad dies out
Some guy refuses to fight, and we call that the sin
To fall in love with u
Two thousand other souls burn bright
They getting legal, so now I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out
That no one ever knew was love
Now I don't think you care to know
I take one, one, one 'cause you left me
'Cause they don't know what they doin'
Ich hau den Haken in die Öse eurer Sprachverstöße
So fucking bad, I came unglued
It's not enough, it's just a habit
Who cares if you die
'Cause I'm a liar, a liar, liar, liar, liar, liar
Now she looks so happy you don't understand
Kill kill kill for Acht Zwei Null
Milling about, spilling there feelings in the air
Another day
I had to beg you not to leave
Dumb fuck
Some broken glass
I need you right now Me likey
Cause the game is deep and the fame is brief
Don't wanna take a pill
And threaten place always in my face
Er war von Träumen irritiert 
Ride me away  I want shade
You'll never grow up to be a big rock star
The bottles, the battles, the beetles will eat you
I didn't disagree the world is too gruesome
Cause no
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
Dressed up and real fake
So I may continue to find why this childproof's so wild
It's run in the family, hey
Bitch I'm real wit this shit
You stupid motherf*****
On poison control IV's 'cause she can't stand the world
They're your arms, it's none of my business, it's
"There ain't nothing no girl so sweet"
With a tender killing
Remove whatever makes you hurt
A will to kill, a will to destroy
Don't stand to close
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
One thing leads to another
My intelligence fuck him up sacked me fuck him up
I don't live for love, you sticky bitch
There's a woman on our party line, a nosy thing
I call the play, now do you see why
I had enough of this ruckus
Pressures on my back
Slap to rebel yell
But came back, made up a lie about you missing your kids
Streams of melting glass
Ladies know how it feels Oh, oh
Then that would make you the devil 
So let it be known, the only reason that we do this
You hit me and left bruises on my chest
Believe me
And let anklebiters chew up, spit out someone else
By not burning in the wreckage
The guy goes back the exact spot where they found him
But you moved me in a way that I've never known 
I cannot go through this again
Lie are told but no one sees
I haven't got fucking anything
I got a bad feeling about this to hell with you and all your friends, it's on
Let the war nerve break
Because I am blessed with soul, something you would never know
The inhibitions of their prey kept them from screaming
Complacent as a passive racist
Can't do it, not even if sober
You can say what you want to your boyfriends
I spit, I spit in the eye
When the day had begun
But can't knock my door down
With a face like Keith Richards
Red pools becoming thicker than syrup slow down your face
Head down, go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums
Won't need no shoeshine
It's ladies night at the bar
La différence entre le eux et nous 
I like the way we play games
Flashback
If hospitals cure then prisons must bring their pain
Mówiąc "adieu" ty się śmiałeś do mnie,
And as heart beats bring percussions
Sit around at home, stare at the walls
I know the self doubt that treats you so unkind
Advertising signs that con
Oh, we want to live
It's like a storm inside
How could you beat the motha of your kids
I'll watch you crawl
And you know what's even worse,
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
And find you sleeping on the floor
You know they said it all
Don't rap if you do not practice
I want to take you away
Then shout
"Dammit Lent, fire your weapon"
We are dying on our knees in this grey broken land
Slamming down the phone right in your face
I feel you coming, I see you red velvet loveliness
And sleepin' in real late
"I have the answers for the questions y'all been asking me,
Still we grow and then the problems they become our own
Holidays are dirtcheap in the Costa del Malvinas
Buy me a drink and I will tell you my name
But I bet you say "not me"
Hit and run, your will be done
A stab in the back with a smile
They all screamed, and cried
Of the beautiful people who live without flaws
When I found out what the smile on your face meant
See the light  breaking fast
What you want
But where the hell were you back in the day
Will you forgive mine
Each thing I show you is a piece of my death
With this around me I don't feel it's over
But you haven't so now I grab this vocal and just cock it
And I'll know just what to say
I'd have lit the fires but I'd have pulled you out
As I watch the sun fuck the ocean crying,
Stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk
It's never the same Ever since you went fallin' down, down, down
See poison street cred weigh just about the same reflesh
You are nothing without me
There is no you, there is only me
A gathering of fools unjustified, on a mountain
Don't fuck with it
I can feel like I've never felt before
The echoes in my brain
Have you seen the writing on the wall
I don't know how to
And turn it into something you would miss if
So please make up your mind please make up your mind
Your mind is hollow
The thought of War Ooh, it blows my mind
Glad that that's all through, got better friends than you
I touch your naked skin
Prepare for the final plan
But yo I'm not Phil Collins, I'm more like Henry Rollins
You know I can't apologize
Burned all of my porno 'cause you were PMSing
You know, give it a run, you know
Come here and sit and talk about it just for a second
They claw like golden souls
I retain no tact and spit the pure fact
And I went back to bed again
When you're livin in your mind
Nobody gets nuthin', na, no time for kisses
As you pump drugs into your bloodstream
And motherfucker yeah, oh yeah
That love with a new peace of mind
 years of hell
Yo, turn him over wit a spatula
My identity was in minority
We storm the very gates of hell
I hear the gunfire, see the blood run, smell the fear,
But  you can't fuck with cowards, cause a coward'll be a coward
I don't wanna wait for you wait for you, wait for you
You're always at my house because you love this ass
I've been strung from Hell, give me birth again
Fuck women, nigga Odd Future, nigga Stand the fuck up
She don't wanna baby that looks like that
The frames of mind
You want to open up
Even in death it will not fade
See the face of fear
Cupid shot me in the eye so they say that love is blind
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through your head
So break my wings and watch me fall
So just where are we going now"
Now we're so strung out we wanna own
Payback on your ass 'cause you're over due and I know I owe it
Let her know you're swapping spit
niin kaikki on helpompaa
Crying for a love that you know you never learned how to make
Don't you think that I can't shame them
'Cause you can't put the life back into this hospital ward
Angriffslust und die Sehnsucht nach Betäubung
Another day here
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against the wall
I'm taking back what's mine
Wait for me to take a fall
Scar Can you feel my power
I miss the days when this was fun but now it turned into work
Some bullets in the back
Full of punchlines and jokes
And I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm the designated drinker
I wanna see what your insides may be
I don't want to fall behind
You do his work so fine
I can't wait on revolution forever
Get out your money  peel a slab
Well, that's all over now All over now
I don't feel like talking your shit
Only the rich benefit, it'll be a cold day in hell before I enlist
But it's ok we've got old blood and our veins are rooted to the hornets nest again
Back to me, actually, I got a lot of girls throwing they ass to me
Mais dis moi qu'est ce tu croyais kpone inc
Just another puppet
The only problem that I have is that I think too much, pussy
Feed our minds confusion
But baby she's not me
I look back, what a waste of time
As we move toward a new world order
So stop frontin' miss 'cause I want that ass
So I can get back on my feet like Tina "T"urner
Is it my fault
Now feel this come down on you
'Cause to them, you're not an artist You're just another file
We feel the fury of devastation 'cause we tasted defeat
I've learned that this life's not just a game
Keep killin' me baby, put your feelings aside, keep solving me slow with your skin, tell me, who am I
And we know that nothing's true
Or is it a string of endless flings of bitter resentment
In my spiritual form, I turn into Bobby Seale
You move away
Nobody hears it nobody hears it
Oh my heart, my heart's gonna break again
Unsheathe the blade within the voice, my friend
There came a cry "It's The Night of The Hawk"
Your houses they pull down stand up now, stand up now
I mimic out your ever' fuckin' fantasy yeah, yeah
Wanna dance on it, everybody want it
The graves have all been dug don't let me forget one for myself
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
Losing a whole year
And if I need all this pain I will find it alone
Give me my money back, you bitch
I believe I don't know why all I need is someone to save me
I don't know what to believe
What's the matter, my baby's dead
Now the working classes are obsolete,
I don't know who told you that who told you that
Push it in deeper now
It ain't worth a shot
Starin' back in those eyes
You are the slave of a clone of a petrified fool on a throne 
Lies prone, cold and alone
I just want to die
How many times can you race around
Evil, evil, man we'll get even, evil, evil Evil man
But now you're worse than before
And we fall asleep again with ties to mend
Give me justice and I want you dead
Häikäseekö, hei, orpo pirun pakana
Pissing in my head 
But my soul, I pissed it all away
Somewhere in the darkness
Drunk like  white boys in the
Don't wanna stay around now, but I must try
Someone to blame for the way I've been feeling
I've got nothing to lose but my apathy 
I'm not havin' it, My rap attract the service like a magnet
So here it is, motherfucker 
I'm looking back at my regrets, I'm still the same
In due for respect I slap your face
You niggas are in the bottom pit, of nauseousness
If I only we could ride far enough
We may fall
What you did not need was a woman who was stronger
They don't give a fuck And if your shit don't blow up, tough
You gotta get drunk just
If you mind your business, then you sure won't be mindin' mine
And I'm here to remind you
I needed to feel it so much 
Get on the airplane
All us brown rice jack rabbits and lab rats, fattened up
The end of the Reagan Era, I'm like 'leven, twelve, or
We're not the ones who've kept minorities and women down
And nobody's saying a thing
All I get is these vampires and blood suckers
That's the thing that fucks the most I know for a fact
Fuck that fuck you I won't give in
I ain't got no fucking money hey mom
They are na've and are driven to find their own identity 
There's no forgiveness for you, you sick fuck
Heaven doesn't want me 
I'm so sorry that I think
Niggas on a chain gang used to that huh way back
So I'm indisposed
Well they don't care and it's just not fair
So, we treat you like a bitch
On a ball and chain I call my own
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
As the dirty priest confides
And no words were hasty and all thoughts were thought through 
Backstabber
Hellohellohello
Real live thug shit, genuine, you know what I'm sayin'
My mother, the murderer holds me down in the road
Say, "Okay, I've had enough, what else can you show me"
These look like the arms of father so strong
I showed you all those moves she can't do
There's a place in space where violence and love
It's not a dream
Turning back
That you're looking at me like you wanna be seeing someone else
weder witzig noch gesellig
And piss upon the stage
Around your knees that crackle into the dark
In my mind I catch a picture  big black raven in the sky
With the sickest stilo I spark fear like pigs in the park
How could you let him sleep in our bed, look it Kim
Richies, chickens and bitches just like you
No incantations of remorse, my friend
Digest another hallucination psychosis by recreation
And I know about this privilege,
The welcome in a woman's eyes holds nothing for him
I've watched this experience raise them to pseudohigher levels
But I gathered up an army made of those
Feel me coming feel me coming feel me coming
And heat is cold and birth is death
Lethargy in disguise
Is to keep your distance
Do the crime and never pay
I will not be locked down
See I don't care but I know
You know we need oxygen to breathe
And we'll tell you when they're hungry again, 
That you feel bad about it
And they don't give a fuck anyway
If hell is truly Your pit of fire and I get thrown in it
When you want you're bad
'Cause I'll show you feelings that you've never seen
And when it turns on those rains
You cracked a smile but had nothing to say
No matter what you paid
Show me to the sapphire pit fake tomb
I hate my life, I hate my life
Probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing
You'll get a bullet in the back of the neck, 
Why is the world falling in on me
Tryin' to be a damn hero
To stand for you or fall for you ever again
Turn around to see if he watchin'
And I'm hanging on, but I still know the way to make your makeup run
They keep on screamin' these words, screamin' these words
Let the code of silence repeat  times
Yeah, you deserve it now, it's all right
I don't  know
Turn to me,  For the right answer
You'll be singled out and tried
For there are none so blind as those who will not see
But it's not free baby, you'll have to pay"
I'm warm now so I don't care
If niggas saying your flow weak, you shoulda bought one
Too bad that you don't understand why
Along the way I may have lost my mind
You kill me with a single word
'Cause I'm not here for your entertainment
But it's warm
I know you think it's sweet
I Believe in the State of Love
Get your dirty fingers out of my hair
Someone's yelling fire
Looking tight, feeling nice, it's a cock fight
Through the submerged distance
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
Now we've felt this, so you'll get yours now
And well I can't explain what happened to my face
And what you know about no heat and no electric
As we turn each other into the blinding light
Why my cash flow missin'
Me and DDot all we seein' now is ready cash
Why you wanna live out of bounds with a riot in your veins
But oh how I want you to know me
At another's disaster
And I won't know what to do And I won't know what to say
"It's hard to give a shit these days"
You noble diggers all stand up now, stand up now
She's Miss Buenos Aires in a world of lacy lingerie
You're laughing when I cry
Will save you now
Probably learn to die in this town
Who living a lie
What are you questions I know you have them
Can you hear them singing
This is nothing fraudulent
Should the top soil feel heavy
And if I don't get that ass, well at least I did try
I can't deal 'cause I don't want to deal at all
Our patience is wearing thin as we all drown
My heavy steps get a little bit louder, louder
You're none of my business now
You should know that I'm the man
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things,
Look my nigga, we can scatter like buckshots
Hollow minds stalk ropeless gallows in turn to idle on immersed
In honor of the new year
When our hopes and our dreams have all died
Through the back alleys
You wouldn't believe the way it glows
I have left my mark on you
Motorhead, remember me now, motorhead, all right
And with a  like this my nigga don't sleep,
All those things, you taught me to fear
Sachant que celui pour lequel j'vais voter, va pas changer quoique ce soit 
This nigga bought braids for the bitch
Your nobody,
Don't anybody speak English in the grave
Oh God, I need your help
I don't care what you want, I just want mine
When I rock, there is not a label for it
Erasing my legacy
Squeal like a pig when you beg forgive pig fucking ape
What happened on that day back then
The kinda shit you get on your TV
There's a place in my heart that won't kiss you goodbye that can't accept the truth that things aren't working out as planned
Their's no way I'm gonna be able to sing that song without
I'm bound in bitter sorrow
Juliet is up in heaven
No one gives a shit 
I'm living lies and shedding the skin 
You fake it, mistake it
That I'm closing in upon the dredge
I could not be her, I did not want to
Do you really wanna be a part of it
I had a good home but I left, right, left
Let me tell y'all niggas a little motherfuckin' story real quick
Up jump tha boogie then bang, let'em hang
Hell no, you can't heal my pain
Beat yo ass in this Bitch
That's some nasty shit, and you still don't ban it
I was reading an interview with Keith Richards in a magazine and in the interview Keith Richards intimated that kids should not do drugs Keith Richards says that kids should not do drugs Keith, we can't do any more drugs because you already fucking did them all, all right There's none left We have to wait till you die and smoke your ashes Jesus Christ Talk about the pot and the fuckin' kettle
Oh, black Betty bambalam
Kiss your mother now 
Feels so good you could cry
Fed myths to disprove by postcolonial prudes
Back and forth, say I'm a piece of shit, well that's duly noted
Take this to your grave, and I'll take it to mine
She likes to stand, she can't afford to sit
To cleanse now all things
And I'm who you run to
All signs pointing to your sins
So my genuine advances are met with pofaced scepticism
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Yet warm and close
And my blood runs like the venom of a poisonous snake
Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
Whatta joke, I said go, boy you have to be one hundred percent
You can't control your own life don't try to rule mine
No, I don't hate you
For he's a stranger who comes in the night
I go crazy inside but when it comes out it's fine like wine
Yes I know you drink beer
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get
Easy to plant with
Here I go, on my own now
You will become very friendly
Is a living hell torturing our minds
Voting for the law
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
And I know you want me too
Wipe your spit from my face
Carry it with you till someone forgives you, I laugh, 'cause there's nothing to say
And you'll believe me
It feels good, and I'm gonna go wild
I've thought it through for a while but it doesn't get any easier
'I don't know how all this started but in my religion,
Millions die today
You want the loot and weed
To make me turn the switcher
But do you fear me when I say I feel pain everyday
For the ghosts of our love have dried, have died
This is not what anyone deserves
James, how I love to hate you
To watch it burn
I'ma  hit y'all niggaz with somethin' that you ain't never felt what
'Cause they keep half your cash just in case of returns
Don't you tell me not to hide
Now I wanna say nothing, nothing
Drunk on the Amtrak, please shut up
You keep calling my phone nonstop
Hey hey, now killer father
Shot glass seems to hug your soul
So I wanna be a member and I wanna be a name
And you were laying in a cold
Now I'm in it, got to die before we see
Answer me  answer me 
Werd' lieber niederknie'n
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
I can never break free
You wanna bite it
We always knew that it'd work out right and we could start anew
I'm not an animal 
It's disgusting, its offensive don't stick your nose up at me
'Cause I know
Life is off running
Sit and watch the rain
I'm gonna keep you away, 'cause now I'm building,
jos olet hiljaa ja kunnollinen, tunnollinen
Just rear your ugly fucking head 
Hard to believe cause I was seeking and you never loved me
I could be your flower, rise up in the dirt,
You're driving me crazy
Why you so angry
As I  skin the burn to relearn the royal plan
I'm a Rocky, run a hundred a mile before my coffee
For beating up the guys that hung my bike in a tree
I don't want  blend in
All the lies they told to me
You're too busy with the lies they sold you
Just when I thought that you left me for dead
Before you fuck wit' Willie D, 'cause what I got for
Due to sculpture but through the power and foresight
I wanna thank the sweatshops in china too
Will get hung, even if you stick out your tongue
Have all been filled with "You're nothing", I finally want to take them back for me
Cutting through to my disgrace
All this rebellion, all this crazy shit you got, saying this shit
Quinine's bitter, sugar's sweet
And now we're crying
Thuglife niggaz Y'all Blow that shit  Get me up out this
While others say don't hate nothing at all, except hatred
Got sick and tired of seein' people bein' treated ill
Well, why haven't you left me
Everybody wanna talk 'cause I'm rappin'
Once again, it's all about me, and pride is not a factor, no
And don't be chicken if you call me out if you got a problem with it
'Cause I've had enough of bredders acting tough
I really want to understand
Burn singe the hair
As Zyklon beats reign to make carrion crawl
And now I think I'm dying
Yeah man, fight the power fuck the government
And I will return
Yeah I can watch Good Will Hunting by myself
It's too late to turn back now
I raise a toast and I salute the end
Not punish less, rise the pain, sterilise rapists All I preach is extinction
Well if you're gonna lie
The restless consumer flies
Stronger feelings
Passedout in the gutter, wornout in your head,
Hypocrisy and lies
You burn down the trees
You are scum, you are scum and I hope that you know
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Run around like a chicken, grand dragon finger lickin'
I saw a brace of weeping willows
Well the man tells me my future and it's not so far away,
You eating off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick
I do this shit for myself,
And We know the Flag of Love is from above
I'm waterin' my garden with some black bottle bourban
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous
You came to me faithfully
Here's to mad cow disease and all that yummy MSG
Writing on the wall
When the time is right you got to get up and fight
Do a motherfuckin job in a motherfuckin squad
While I feed you the heat watch how my niggas will act up
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
 times the pain, I could never be with you
And we want to believe
Brought blue baby jeans just to shit on the
I'd say nice shot
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Look at me now, 'cause I win
I know your daddy and your brothers too well
This is the end
Don't hurt her anymore, stop now
You gave me shoes and pretty clothes, and I gave you what I had between my legs
There's no signs of hope
Then left me for dead 
You gave me the Bible and expect me not to analyze it
I hope it kills you on your way down
'Cause all I want of you is just a let me be
Nobody's evil, nobody's evil
'Cause I won't believe the state I'm in
Go home, there's nothing there because
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
But I know
I'm gonna force you to bend
And what do those hissy fits teach you except how to cry, pussy, cry 
I'll laugh until I am sick
I won't fall into your predetermined plan
Chillin' with the clique got the mad hops jaming
Well now I've got some advice for you, little buddy
Well, now go on and break your word and it'll break me down
Takes the CD out of the player and puts back in its case
I'm not a Catholic geek
I'm not a Muslim man
I'll be the girl that you hate
Ich bin der Abgrund, die Entwürdigung
Almost near my knees
And talk to birds like Kilgore Trout
Ordered his gun and its done and its done and done
You wanna be rich
Oh backstabber, backstabber
Your friends, they're just figments of your imagination
Your resistance to a mirror I feel screaming from your body
Yeah man, it sucks the world is a war
You're all by yourself but you're not alone
It feels so good inside
And now we're rollin'
If I make it, baby, you can drive my hearse
So what makes you think that I'm gonna believe
And you want a little company tonight
So what if you turn back
You wanna go son
The day laughs in your face
Wanted in me wanted to be
While there's diamonds in the mind
I said get out bitch Let go of my hair
Found so many ways to hate myself
Trying to touch my ass
But I don't want to be alone
That's it, we've had enough 
We're only making plans for Nigel 
They must hate me, every single one
And there's nothing to feel
But nobody will know
D'you get scared to feel so much
Until I moved to the west coast
Wolf Gang in this bitch, nigga, we six feet deep
A knife for the girls who never return your calls
I was not the only one to do things wrong
Converge to choke us
In my eyes and tell lie after lie after lie
Stuck in jail and mad as a bitch
You'll get bladefucked
Everybody wants to be reelin' 
You don't want the pistols to whistle
You've already mastered
C'est qu'aujourd'hui on est kpone inc et regarde bien qui vient de cogner chez nous
I know you know, that
I'm not afraid of feeling and I'm not afraid of trying
Big to little o' brother, you leave me like blood from my veins
To think I once called you my friend
And everything else I'm burning
You wanted me, not to tell me why
They wonder what's on your mind
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
The flies, they all gather around me
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
Mr love man, you ain't shit
And I know it's hard sometimes 
What did I know, what did I know, what did I know
Heaven's not so far away
You're inaccurate, hotheaded like a Capulet wanker
This is that sure shot itchy finger lingering behind your target audience
I'm a liar, oh, I am a liar
That's how I feel about the
Keep singing songs for me
When I'm not really dying
Can't say that I'm crazy about anything that you do
How dare you niggas pop fly
Vicious thoughts are my incarnation
Just trust in us, we know what's best
This year to save me from tears
The taste of anyone's fist
I'd take a whore to the funeral
Leave in the end
All the crap is building up, my mouth is open and just won't shut
I'm the law and you can't beat the law 
But why don't you go upset yourself
Needin too much to drink
Give you something in return
It's in the blood 
Children of every race, creed and religion frolic through fields
You've always had it made
You know I am a Doctor of the third degree"
I better, better, better, better not say this
Sing, sing again
Twisted ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
I covet everything you ever feared
What did you do before the war
Somethin's got to give, now
Taste all your fears, sugar and spice
So while my wallet's piling with symbolic colored paper
Well but honey I had no choice, so
Their broken backs
But it's my first time so please ignore
That I surrender 'cause I've been searching
Looking up without knowing 
When your heart skips a beat it's ruthless and aimless
I had never thought
If I drench myself in others blood, Am I sick
I'm taking back what they stole
Because I warned you
It's the mind manipulator  the WAR CHILD
You brain dead You gotta fuckin' bullet in your head
Und ich spüre jeden Tag was ich verliere
Don't you know that I run this place,
But now the tables turnedI won't be hurt again
Crawling back to 
My name is Soul and you're holding me inside should I be mad at you giving me a dime but you wouldn't be the same 
Who will remember you
Everyone wants to be a teen dream
He only wanted some one to
Goddess, queen, mother, sister, lover
Other people, they're not looking
The Word stopped the game they begin to pray
And I know what I do and it all points to you 
"Trust us with your hearts and minds"
I want the stars
Oh, and in the judgement, he will remember the ones you've robbed,
Be ashamed
Panzer attack
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Hey, all right, it's Kip Kasper, KLONE Radio, LA's infinite repeat How we feelin' out there How's your drivetime commute I need a saga What's the saga It's Songs for the Deaf You can't even hear it
My father was dark, my mother was light
With the falling rain
Come pay me a visit if you feel that you may be offended
'Cause I've been trying to fix mine from the start
Chewed my fingernails to the bone
At the end of the bar
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
I'll never fall again, never fall again
And they would beat us up if we had diamonds on our watches
Abuse  I kicked it
Yeah I am are the good little holier 
I'm hangin' on a ledge
I don't need shit and you ain't nothing
Dirty needles break the skin
They waved their guns in my face
Peanut butter smeared on his chest
Biatch When we ride on our enemies
You better get your homies to suck your own dick
I'm never gonna talk to you and
And took the stairs but didn't stop at the street
And hope they never come back
Bring the gun, your tongue is what I'm slicing
This house is full of, full of, full of fight
Throw my hands up and shout
You can keep on sucking till the blood won't flow
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes
All the words are gonna bleed from me
I see it, believe it
But you did nothing
It's not a secret anymore
That you could sink so low
Or just to die by the hand of love
Seducing anger to haste my separation
Laughs a face of a girl who just got paid for
God damn it's deafening
With a face to rip open all night
Or should you get your glasses fixed
Lionel rolled the blunts up, so meanwhile me and Lucas getting fucked up
Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do
I see the world, and it's full of hate
It takes a hijacking then you go attacking your enemies without any proof
She could be a Queen but now
And I've got no mother and I've got no dad
Life passed me by, but it's not my fault
The walls like a tiny mosquito
Lost my money again
And the night in your soul turns to day
Yeah, whatever rock out
This house is full of mmmistakes
Dear, I'm sorry
Don't buy the shit they sell
So I won't repeat it no more
You are nothing
Feels like I'm falling, but I tell you I'm not going down
You couldn't pay me enough
I divorce control I divorce the faith
It's time for a rest
I know I got to be right now, oh 'cause I can't get much wrongeroh
Your punk ass made it up, or your fucking mind was gone
The neighbors are asking you what it's all for
But not everything that it takes
They laughed at me wanting you
I ain't no damsel in distress
But there was never a moment, not a moment
I'd rather chuck up my middle finger than give a bitch a smile
Until the day I die
We all pass the hat around
I could crush him in my fist
Society has made me mentally insane
Now I know that I had to borrow, ha
No, no, not even if sober
Back on the street now
Because you know what they'll say to you
Look ma how I've grown now
Or do you feel condemned
You make them niggas want to say
And you'd never have known
Take his anger out on me
I remain nonchalant when the drama get thick
Another unknown soldier
On the end of your bed
All that glitter is not gold
'Cause you've always got something else in mind why
Abendessen, in die nächste Kneipe gehen, Bier trinken
Get back, get away from them, it's all wrong,
Shoot, shoot, shoot, motherfucker
We came a long way from not givin' a fuck
I don't mind telling you
But the first law of nature is to defend one's life 
And you, you make it so I need to disconnect
I'm sick like Chuckie was sick, my defeated heart keeps beating on
Cuttin' at the beams with a hacksaw, on a camel's back
All this shit, I gotta believe
I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke fuck that
I'ma ride where I wanna ride fuck that
Keep my faith even through the darkness, yeah I still believe in love
And you wonder all the time why can't you cry
The needle now descends
This whole damn place seems to, lost control
In the falling of stars
No, sorry won't save you this time
Down the barrel of a gun
I thought we worked, pushed toward the same ends
You can go out if you want we wouldn't dare
Shit, you'd be lucky if you walk away with an autograph bitch
Of my days peddling hate out the back of a Chevy Express
It's quite depressing, there's no fixing to the problem
nell'incertezza è meglio prendere
In my sorry heart
He wants to sit down and think
Niggaz ain't going back to court you stank ass bitches
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun
Fist full of bees watch the children change
On the half of couch
I am the worst liar I know
His collar's pulled, begin to be aware 
No matter who you are and no matter were you live
I got four walls I live here
I'd kill a dragon for you
Just as it clicked in
You are the one at fault
More fire for the people
I can still feel the chill 
I'm gonna kick it in the arse Big Brother's got no heart
New day but it's all the same, what a motherfucking basic art
And says, "I got mine, but I want more"
Why wont you stop
See me fall
You haven't got a clue and you don't know what to do
Niewarte mnie
I was busy bleeding and recieveing unholy seamen
'Cause I hate her
The pain
While shining drop your guns and move your tongues
No one will take all of me, and the fire will stop
The smallest matter
Like it or not
It is a plant, not a demon
It's another end of another working day
Of the leftist elite
I'm not a Mormon freak
I don't give a damn about my reputation
Who ain't fuckin' with the pay for play, that shit is gay
So call me crazy, hold me down
So easy to hate
Du woaßt wos bassiert is
In a myth of sin 
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
And I got shot
Wrote a message on my pillow that says "Jesse, stay asleep in bed"
Tell them so right to their face
Still sick
Shit what you know about death threats
You cry wolf like you're the town crier, cry girl
Don't get dizzy, do not fall now,
On to the wall buss it freefall, freefall
Now our time Said now our time
Tell me again your fucked up excuses
They're gonna give you nothing
'Cause every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I could be the thing you want, I could do it all for you
From earliest human existence there proved to be two fundamental ways of thinking
Unknown door
The God machine is hungry
These black eyes and these bruises
Disregard how you feel
We know that your world will hate this
She can clean my gun and I can help her clean the floor
Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
Well You know what to do with your hands
You never leave a message
I try and feel the same but in my dreams your all that I see
I was more fucked up than your sister's tackle box
It's you that I can't believe in
You don't fool me
What the hell, what was that for
On the same playground
And try to control my hissy fits with pride
Turn it on turn on on the news
Left wing macho street fighters willing to kick arse
Cause you know I'm not buying
Especially when it comes to my money and the contract is exclusive
Don't ever underestimate what I can do
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Put away your short leash I'll get the fuckin' chain
STD's, sick, sex, drugaddled, debauchery, monger
Oh and now you're going around trying to sleep with my friends
A bit confused by my reflection
And death rained down it made a terrible sound
But I'm infected, and you're the new disease of today
Cares not to come up any higher
There's no eyes in your own head
In the back of the neck right between the eyes" Italicised lies, headlines, bold 
I still can't believe all your plastic surgery
Can't fake it  I hate it  please help me
Don't push me nigga, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm spinning and turning
And I smell the coffee on your fingers
Yeah I mind what you do
The Hill got the skill for the static like brillo
But there's something about my face that always keeps you coming back
That noone's free from sin and when I look at you
Can't see no future
And right now I feel worthless
Cause you know it's over
The white man doesn't understand our ways
Wouldn't stand for anybody who a rat or a snitch
And dispel every trace
Le noir est plutôt frais
Why do I feel like dying
My mama felt, she never liked you neither did my friends
Saw me once, saw me again got your pistol
The one who lives a lie
And it feels so good to be on top of you, on top of you
Tryna figure out the meaning and break apart the puzzles
Spaz, animal rap, they love when the god spit
I ain't been crazy in a really long time
How fucked up that'd be
One foot in the grave
Tell her she don't want no problems
Yes, it's a war from tha depth of time
This industry shit to hell with that
Oc life is not the life so free
Kiss my motherfucking ass
Yeah once, once is real conniving, it's easy now,
Got a body like a battle axe
The end of life
Ay, run that shit back
I don't believe that she said, you're out of your mind
Free your hate
Politician passin' a bill paid in full
I got creative Oh no
Here's a mirror mirror to peer, fear grows clearer
You grew up with war on TV every night
I see your face on the street
If I can't have you no one will
Feel the flesh fall off on to the floor
A light upon the swarm
I just hate to be the bad guy
Yeah, I'm working
I don't believe in anything
I am a fool I know, because it's all I know
Even though they say it doesn't matter
Short sleeved shit kicking animals lining me up
'Gainst lawyers and 'gainst priests stand up now
Enough to know we can't play god with others' lives at stake
Do you see a long road with no one on it
I'm going crazy now
Flesh for foond and blood for wine
Strange men wanna know my name, sweet girls oughta play their part
While you were looking the other way you mess
Every feeling that we ever had for each other
You make me so sick I'm
Deep inside has died
And go about your life, like it was nothing
'Twas better to die 'neath that Irish sky
Consuming, confusing
People are violent, yes, but if we show them the way, they will buy us power
I was so offended as I sat for three hours
Seein' me is def not repeated or done twice
I know you must have heard it all
And move to a communist country 
I know I was to blame
Oh, I wanted to be a star
Where ever we're standing no body knows
You know how to touch me
Hop on the side of the free world grave diggers
And she's banging on the door; she's losing all control again
On second thought
Backstabber
You better watch your back
Lets face it
I am a bitch
Pay back, for every time that they called me a spic
And on this Sunday night you'll be making love to him, I know because you told me I'm never going to win
Not knowin' if I'm comin' home or not
Tie up your horse before the night falls, can stole your wife,
Has been broken since '
Take your sorry ass
The star probably don't know that he the house nigger
Yeah, if I could change your mind
I been told you niggas, "I'm real "
Irony is waiting over piety and faith
But I don't know where to begin
Wow, I'm gonna kill it
You wasn't born in a cave so you better not behave so
I didn't know what was at stake
I thought about how a couple dollars in my pocket
Please, just remember me when I am not around for the taking
Just to make it die
Blue babe's gasping, revenge is mine
As I squirmed inside my shoes
I still remember a year ago
She says OH Sweet Jesus don't need no Holy Oil
You know
Razem i osobno chyba jesteśmy niezdolni żyć,
Out of the old and thin and control, we spin
I do know how to replace it with revenge
Hands always where this skirt ends
It'll swallow us whole 
I fuck myself, I guess, I guess
Consists of hard drive bits written underground
She wants to be the prophet
Don't know if I can do it
Anata ga koe no, Hey, your voice
You do not need to think
There's nothingwrong Mom
Turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on
Silencing the devil that speaks with forked tongue
They would burn you
'Til the power's cut
Now I'm just here to criticize the lies, the lies, the lies
So open your mouth and the smoke pours in, tastes so lonely
Any remnants left I let slip away
'Cause I'm a watcher and I'm a doer of none
But Smalls don't get down like that no question
There's a wound that will not mend
That somehow sucks me in again
Assassing, assassing, assassing, assassing
And I start watching
And I'll take their fate, and I bet no one will care
Inject you with the gunpowder pegs
That vaguely leftist doctrine of beliefs
You sexist, racist, homophobic fuckers
Ten years of discontent never given a chance
Not that it's my fault
Lest you vanish in the city And be but a trace
And move as one
All that glitters is not gold
Who lives to raise the ones who fall
"I just wanna be with you"
Statements and a plan with a map of the land
Still getting paid without no ties
Push to an end into the darkness ahead
How the hell did we get so stupid
Dass du mir weh du host
They were asking of me
The hand of a friend
Que la millefa est traumatisée et méprisé ces sales races 
But there's nothing left to suck
But this is mere foreplay to war
"The damn thing gone blind" bambalam
The load I am tossing
Pull ourselves up now we won't choke
Tasty but worthless, dogs eat their own shit
Depending upon ones competence
Since you and I shared fears
Total hate Total hate Total hate
Fuck 'em up and give him nothing
They hardly know their sacred mother tongue but they know their duty
I heard you bought a crib on biters block downtown plagiarism's paradise
I'm tired of niggas
Hit the road hit some hoes videos
And now Christmas is for shopping
If you were a woman and I was a man
This one's a doctor, this one's a lawyer
Every day I can feel you so near
And I do not feel the romance, I will not be
Turn, God, strange make a move
When they start to sing,
With your finger pointing at my shame
Or say what they mean without drinking
Stick your fingers in your book
I hope that you're back up if you've ever been down
You're not rid of me Yeah, you're not rid of me
You say there's nothing wrong but I don't hear it
Never break any rules
If I let you in, will you run off with my maid
I kind of get the feeling like I'm being used
They say more independence, more
Try to pull my finger nails out
You can say what you want but nobody's there
Cut away our smiles
Still our descendants will inherit our mistakes of today
No jobs and we want no pope
You're out of your mind, get,
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
If there were no heaven
Hit the ground
Their cup which overfloweth, is just filled up with piss
Outraged against the scene
It don't mean shit to me
We went with what we knew and now we can't go back
Illegal immigration, gun control hysteria
I wanna take you in my arms so I can give
And set them on fire
You've become the sheep you hated
Who you pray to, my God the black God
Payback
You'll find yourself, running the gauntlet, of all these double standards
'Cause I wrote that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
I'm glad ya'll made it
Picking every last fuckin' piece of paint off the walls
And I'm as much of an asshole as I've ever been
I know it's killing you, it's a bitter taste
'Cause it's a breakdown, a breakdown
I'm feeling twice my age and treated half the same
And then he ran into my knife
But it sure is fun to advertise a fight
When you don't wanna wake up
Wake the fuck up to Hollywood, whore
I am proud to shop at Target, I'll wear warmup pants any day of the week
Doing that surveillance on Mister Michael Render
Well it's the funk back breaker
You drag me back there
In the wall of good fortune
Call me God, cause that's what the black man is
So here I go kickin science in ninetyfive
I want justice I want justice
Late night catechism speaks me to sleep
Motherfuckin crew, motherfuckin mob
As it drips from your veins
My life overturned, unfair, the despair
Then the sea gave birth and it crawled up on the dirt
Turned my senses into spite 
And all those clowns, what can they know
You cannot help me to forgive you
I swear I'm down for whatever you're down for tonight
I'm not afraid of speaking my mind
And all the rest of it
Well it's a Pretty Baby, I don't really mind
If it wasn't for hate, baby, I would have lost out today
Cry for help now 
You will remember, remember me
There ain't no ain't knowin' me
Grand openin', grand closin'
It's fuel for the fire of a family tree
She can't give a damn on cue
left with the pain
It ends tonight,
Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
I've always listened to what they told me, never gave in with a fight
Yeah, I'm toiling in shit, he's got no place to go
The bible tells us Mary Was a whore
I want to touch you, want to breathe you,
I'm not like other girls
Baby no half stepping no half stepping
I'm just a face in the crowd
We controlling the crews, drinking Belgium booze
So they don't turn out as bad as me
I just wanna lie here
Driven by restrained desire
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
So she's planned a little trip to France
And what's it worth I'm easily checked and don't control my earth
Then you're telling lies
You're not around
Why don't you sing me that
And cut they ass head to toe, jaw to jaw
You smear your filth across
Or you'll be sorry
I'm not talking to you but you're smiling at me
Why'd ya do it, she screamed, after all we've said
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
We braved the cold November air and the undertaker's curses
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Ripped apart by the crows not the vultures
My life was ended by your hand
I'll never see your face again
"Go, go I'll tell you when to stop"
And the scavengers are feeding 'cause the killing fields are bleeding
Let's get together, make a record, why the fuck not
To sacrifice what I believe
Oh, I thought so
I wanna try and fly
America cannot see anything
Fuck cops, I'm a fucking rock star
I've got my knife and I could get a  milli
My heart is empty and my head is wild
You're not the kind who would be waiting there for anybody
I know I ain't supposed to cry
Only gonorrhea
Nigga ain't federal, I plan shit
A complicated heartbreak losing its direction
So you wanna get it all back
Push pause on the game and get to know each other by our first names
Around her finger
I don't think I remember why
But you're the one who faked it all along
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
Your station has been assigned
Like you fucking know me
Or smothering
That always runs slow
I'm obnoxious, motherfucker can't you tell
How bad do you want it
The way your eye shifts makes me wanna go
Ourselves for taking too long to discover
You think dick is the answer, but it's not
This is what you wanted
So I'll just stand right here for now
When you're feeling at last and reeling so fast
You should learn how to say no
I got a bad feeling about
I need results, I need straight answers
You release you, let yourself out of the manure and the cat piss
But you bend, you're bending my mind
Now who is able to make war with the beast
You got to turn it on, got it turn it on
'Cause I thought you'd know
That's gonna be killed if I talk about it shhh
His monstrous ego, whipped and driven
Talking with you's like talking to a sieve that can't hear me
Cloaked by the blood spattered banner
No I don't wanna here it no more
Choć mieliśmy tak pięknie skrojony plan,
Hello, hello, how low, how low
My mother, in a fit of rage, chases me from our home
On the net, Ken Bigley got his neck tek off
In a day there's nothing
I just wanna say something, something
Just like babies killing babies girls assaulted in some park
I'm gonna rip her flesh
Look deep in the river and try not to scream 
And I feel like a modern day patriot
A me mi basta il sole e non lavorare
What you know about bein' bedside next to your girl
And watch you play dumb I'd like to see
You want my confidence 
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Bend me, break me, breaking down is easy
It is one less tongue that bends to say your name
If I could have a second skin
You left me feeling hopeful 
Make a meal of nothing at all
All of your hate and all of your lies
But their mighty appetites will not be tamed
Behind the eight ball nothing but flimm flamm
Concrete shoes, cyanide, TNT
I know a girl
Won't need no strong man
I hear gunfire, see the blood run, feel the rage,
Don't know what you did it for 
And nobody gives a damn
I couldn't feel her and it was just a game 'cause I was lonely and she was crazy
You're so crazy x
It is tearing up my mind
If you need my shame to reclaim your pride
I am just a man who knows how it feels
I'm coming, fuck, I'm coming on you
Nothing is what I get from you, nothing
The outlaw biker with my big shit kicker
Uhhuh shit hurts, but it works bitch
The lord god almighty
It ain't to play games witchu
I disconnect the act
They don't know that it exists
Stand for something, get money nigga
Can't believe all that you're telling me
Escobar season has returned
Sometimes I try to do things, and it just doesn't work out the way I wanted to
Horny and burned out now is how it always ends for me 
You know that's no lie bambalam
Denn die Menschen verstehn ihre Worte nicht mehr
I feel it slipping away
Wreck nights, spit flames
A couple of drinks on the house an' he was
I'll never be the same, break in decency
Anger steaming up your glasses, you've been holding parties all your life
Let me take this awkward saw
You kept still until the long drive home
That you know, and I know better
Believe what I'm saying
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
'Cause I'm already the consequence of somebody else's fate
Rip away the disguise and you will realize that you find
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
That one inhuman, illegal, single woman
Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
Oh I turn my back, my eyes full red
I'd go through hell for you no matter what
I spend time by myself
No fear, no saint, no Jesus Christ
You think I am bullshitting, then read the th Amendment
When I'm crossing
The evenings get longer and I know
While the winners write the history books defeated die poor
But no, you don't
Everyone I know of
To picking and choosing to screw all of us one by one
I'll not be bothered by you until 
Most don't know were heaven is
You take no control for the pain you seem to cause
I feel you
Thuglife niggaz Hey, pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex
There's something on your mind that I couldn't see
Come father of lies your time has come
With nobody else around; you were outside the house
I want a perfect body
That they just wanna get your ass under the sheets fuck you then leave I don't what bumped you to be
I feel no remorse
Cold eyes and a painted face 
I am the darkness and you are the light 
Was it not what you wanted it to be
You share with none, you have no one
That doesn't make your lying tongue all right
For failing to see
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
Excuse us if we treat him like our idiot cousin
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, 'cause she's fake
So get you're fire out my face and don't follow me, dipshit
Curse my mind and it's allseeing eye
I'm sending you all to Hell
Got a new kind of fear
And I'm fearful I'm fearful I'm fearful of flying 
Stop this airplane 'cause I got to get down
Burned out turned out lookin' for a handout no use
Are you turned on
The rage of Angels
Drugs, liquor, drugs
Hit to lose it to, it's that crazy crew
But for now we'll all just smile and sympathize
Et j'attends et j'attends
Your freedom to uphold sing cavaliers are bold
And if I do, I'll probably be shell shocked
On this burnt cursed ground
I spit upon your test
Ladies know how it feels Hey
Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay It's fuckin' fiction
The radio is filled with garbage over techno beats
Cracked paint, faded signs, she said "I'm done
But you don't have nothin' on me
Drop a tape rock a show sign a line
Mandibles cut like a knife
My flow sizzles, yo boy Hop go hard like some cold nipples
Now I'm no prophet, but the rhymes you vomit
Don't point that thing at me unless you want to use it
It's old and it's cold and it's no longer golden
Yeah, westside niggaz is very greedy, uh
Jet black  the blood that's in your veins
The money's gone and your crowd is too
You say this ain't the end of me
Worthless white power piece of nazi fucking shit
But I'm a fool who's off her rocker
Death with violence
This is how it feels Oh oh
What kind of love from a nigga make you wish he would die
Reach for tha lessons tha masked pass on
Act like you know, this is no drill
So you drop all your defenses, and you drop all your fears
And usually I'm not into dark dick
Some children died the other day
Fucking beautiful screamer walks in with that look on his face that says
You left open the window to the morning and the winter walked in
If I don't run you'll drive me crazy
And the sickos I spend G's but only make nickles
'Cause reality offends
Fuck all these guntoting
Se io prendo chi è che dà
This money is me this money is everything I do and see
I'm on your mind for reaching things that you can't
Because I'm feeling the cold of a last farewell
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
Fall on your face in those bad shoes
Y'all ain't never gonna see me in this motherfucker again
Straight A's on the honor roll
Not right now
Tell, there's nothing left to tell
'Cause words like that don't matter
 Breaking the bones
I want your everything and I want your head
They'll fake a smile and then they'll shake your hand
The breath of the storm that begins
Gotta find new friends to hang out with, because you're all afraid of me
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died
I've seen them give their drugs up in place of makeshift altars
Don't look back If I can get my grip,
The rage that I feel today
Bend me over the back of the car seat
Spoken by Eminem, Dr Dre, & Teller
You're not rid of me; you're not rid of me
Everybody, everybody, everybody sucks
But that's how you want me
I'm feelin' kinda trapped don't you know
'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
If you were a woman and I was a man
So unknown
Picked up my dough and bked this honey passin'
How the hell is she gonna get it back
Fuck tha police and I said it with authority
The sun makes me dizzy the sun makes me sick
Local redneck stare
The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin
They left him to rot in some stinking council hole
Doctor kindly tell your wife that
I fixed him his drink as usual
Fronting stress I'm superman motherfucker
And when the cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky, no love lost baby the future is so bright
And I'm on your back
You see the sun dissolving
You made this little hell I love
Having nothing can be really hard
It's such a shame that it is this way
Hey You erased it but we saw you fake it
Seven sins were wrung from the sight of me,
To clean the slate, to pass the time
I'm strong but I'm wild, they say I drink too much
The hair stands up down the backside of my neck
Looked up to the sky, Ain't I such a beautiful disgrace
Got no name got no brain
Just with your heart of gold 
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
Who the fuck you think let y'all wild niggas in
I need some sleep
Moments in grace when you've got to stake your faith
The race of the Mother Culture is thickening
I'm looking for a way to make a plan and keep it neat P Dog
But, not too crazy to get busted
There's a fire in the peach pit, a blaze in the snake pit
Drop that shit em
For this rap shit that I stand for
Better make a run cause you know it's gonna go down
'Cause she want my worm like Carmen
You're telling lies to everyone who will listen
Yours is no sacrifice
Well I got a bad feeling about this,
Rattattat, kabooboom, now take that and just a bit of this
Load it in ya head play it back slow
And def jam  negroes turnin' up their nose
Rum and guns and smallpox gonna change the face of home
Last time now
It's a legal crime it's an issue of life 
Win a war
I will not forgive
Won't you let her breathe a recipe for drugs to see clear
Some of the image but all of the power
If I fail,
And I know you got the feeling, 
That's the motherfckin West side, you test me, you test God
Just enough water to ensurface the world
Hoodlum can't find no peace only trauma in the grave
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
Get down with Blacksmith or get the fuck out the way
It kills me that I feel this hurtful
Go find relief in your graves
You know I'm here if you need a girl
Till I walk beside you on the street and now
Control feeble minds then destroy our race
Cry cry cry
To kill a minority
Kiss the first night, it's not that time No hoes hopping inside my ride
Thought I'd turn and walk away
Can't block or screen that shit, now everybody sing that shit
The slowest race around
I don't know if they're fags or what
Oh, I am a fool I know
Screaming convulsing
Ain't no way to set me free, now
Familiar landscapes
It's all over their face
The feel 
Envisionin' so much, my minds an open window
So you know I'll be
I'm so happy that I feel this way
Living deaf, dumb and blind will get you nothing
You can never touch me now
I will fight
Dr Dre Why the fuck not
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
Me, I'm so dirty, covered in spite
A matter of fact, exact from granduos
Magnificent blow your back out, if you act out
And he replied, "Well, the secret is to hook 'em young
And now my fist is
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked
Grab two hoes and do some body shots
I'll take you back to '
'Cause what I get ain't half of what I give
We want it all, everyone
I'm feeling like less of a wreck
So you think you've got some problems
But all I want is you
Y a eu de nombreuses victimes mais personne pour payer 
Oh, In hell I'll burn in flames
You picked the wrong time to fuck with me
But all I wanted was love to stay
'Cause he ain't worthy of my bitterness or fuckin' pain
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
Say goodbye now
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Fuck Ruthless, bitch I never lend you a hand
E tra l'amore e far paura preferiscono fare paura
They, they, they, they, who the fuck are they
You cut me off before I start to sing
We don't like you fuckin' bitch, We'll kill you bitch
To every inch of my skin
Now I stand here with both feet planted firm on the floor
Y'see I didn't wanna be with any people I know
Nashes with the Nazis but it's normal what the cops see
They would not subvert you
Last one out, turn out the lights and let me be
A conversation I believe
Our country and all its people could be in danger of nuclear attack in minutes by enemy missiles and hours by enemy aircraft
And it feels like that to push me
But it's not Salt 'N Pepa
Yeah, I'll be fine without these bones
If I was a miner
I feel upset, let's do some celebratin'
We americans don't write
We need apartheid to keep the animal in his cell,
Yeah you suck out of luck
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Only a man could make a girl a killa
Writing on the wall
Turhempaa ei oo olemassakaan
There's a darkness in your soul demanding imperfection
Ahah Tell me what you believe Ahahahah
Another soul is crushed
It's so hard to admit that I drove you away with all this negativity, this anger every day
WuTang niggaz they shine and make the mic glow
Yeah, you're sailing away and the sun looks right on your face
That seems to invade my lungs and mind like salt
Surveying this language as a game,
Had the nerve to show up at her mother's house the next day
When will this story end
One day you will burn for your decisions
And the smoke would curl around my face
Wound the watch till it broke all in hopes of stopping the time
No gold chain, it's a dookie rope made of garlic
We're taking it, back in the day to the Golden Age
Gatecrasher, rehasher, big faker,
But salmon pink skinned Mary's still caring
A loose vaginal passage, uh uh bitch put that back in the package
To hell with you and all your friends, it's on
Found her dead on the ground
Oh mercy I want to be taken in
You cut me off at my na na na na neck
Tend a wound that never mends
I think we finally know
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
You're no Playboy bunny
You see, no, I don't care at all
And I know these things take time
You were there like a punk
To avoid the bitter end
Red, gold, I told
And break the fuckin crucifix
These thoughts aren't mine
I don't speak the language but my last laugh's hell
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
I'm not falling down
To watch ninety five minutes of simulated torture
Men are cursing, women praying for release, but when a white man kills one of "them" no one sees,
How do you expect I will know what to do
I have a life too I've had enough of you
You're like a warped godmother with your baffling love
There's nothing you can say
And now I'm heading west on  again
At the end of the day
You know I still got my one good arm
Punch 'em like a mother fucker even rape a few
But every time I see ya face I think of me and you
I fell between the seat, but nothing broke
As I crawl to my knees
Put the ma' fuckin' Fresca down
She's on a diet but my pockets eating cheesecake
What you fear is your desire
I know that I really can't sing
You know you should be on with me
You don't think I know but I can read between the lines
'Cause they want five mics, I'd rather have five Mallories
Temperature's rising
I'm a beat specialist
What passion can you buy
I want to edit metadata
"The devil made me do it
In black and white, they really really ought to know
Kissing 'cause they never fight
For those feeling that what I said offends you
We ravenous
You make a mess
Send your condolences, this is me reaching to You so don't forget
There's nothin' left in me
Always knocking on my door
Au point de crier nos histoires
That I would cut him down with my claws
You used your money and your friends
They won't know who you are
Keiner weiß wer dieser kleine stille Junge war
My guts are gonna drop like flies
The feeling I get
He's in the street, with no ID
I just know there's got to be
And when it comes to planning
Peel all the scars from our way
You only stayed to break my heart
My hoes say I'm amazin but I don't listen  a lady
Even bitches looking like En Vogue gotta "Hold On"
I can't remember, I don't understand, is it malice that makes you this way
I want you to notice
"Nodbody move, just stay where you are"
And lay us on our belly, while they fingers on they triggers
The rivers are flowing with blood
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
Declares me a phantom demon I don't know
Or am I just another sick bitch lunatic
You are the reason I can't control myself
The cat fights the dog
I didn't understand you
agora sinto um medo infantil
We've watched it all from the window ledge,
I heard a noise, it was probably nothing
And I've begun this race,
Not gonna hear this singing of this ringing triumph thing
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
I cannot believe it's taken so long
But it really did was let the police terrorize whoever
She gets the pills from her skills
Fight the feeling
And drive it into the lake
So scream louder now
From my mind to reality
And took most everyone I know
Neon black flowers on the mass grave
Now there's nothing
And with a picket for a knife
What can you tell me, nigga
A knife for the men who keep you awake at night
Keep her warm in winter
No one else knows,
A policeman makes reverse  calls instructing residents to take to the streets
Who stopped and swam
Se io non stessi qua in zona
And pass the chainsaw to a  heart
And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
A you that the singer sings to
I rock the block with glocks and brass knuckles
Pack your shit and leave
I know the self doubt that runs inside your mind
Long lost in your mind
In joyous hell
All simple monkeys with alien babies
No disrespect
The last game  the last move
And seven, seven for no tomorrow
Instead of playing doctor we play shoot each other and die
And I am not a kitten stuck up a tree somewhere
 I despise the trendies, I know they're lying
The bloodshed on these dusty roads
Shut up and swallow my pride and go
Let's fucking start again
I watch you make the same mistakes
And when I get sick, I will stay sick for the rest
Whoa, just another lonely night
While the paranoid try to stuff the void
You can't embrace it
No, sorry won't pay for this loss
Keep the faithful entertained
So shame on you 
And there's nothing left to grieve
Cause two suckas can't agree on something
Ordered his gun and its done and
It's darkest before the dawn
A man he shouts alone
So you hear all the shit we play just for you 
I drink too much just to fall asleep,
You turn on me, and left me alone with my fate
To pretend he walks with you
I've already spent years at the back of the line
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
Well this ain't no time for bull as I fly into the sun
Stupid fools
I think all the tracks I'm hearin' from niggas is whack
Disloyal motherfuckers I'ma BANISH you all
At the end of his belt
When will they comprehend, comprehend
Then he holds his neck which was bleeding already
I care but now I'm standing on a ledge
Chaos, burning, terror
All I want, from all of you
E non sa cos'è il rancore
Break some bread for all my sins
Can I make it Can I fake it Can I overcome it all
A what a surprise, she thinking I'm the lover of her life, becoming my wife
There is no other Troy
That beacon fallen from your eyes
I ain't trippin' in the county and I'm mad as fuck
The rest is yet to reveal itself to me
I wanted to help, to help destroy the world
You buy me lots of stuff because you love this ass
I see your front teeth sharpen and I watch your muscles flex
She may be crazy, she maybe not be right
No churly g, not a sequel, not even one love,
Mr Moon a man now
When you're in Snowshoe PA
Who's got the last laugh now
Soul and body cold
To make me feel
No no no more son of a bitch
Another reason to see
I wanna get connected
I'm gonna kill it, damn dead
Hey, if she were not scorching the rails with the haste of a bolting ghost there would be no reason to fear the death rattle in the engine's throat
Soul's already black and burnt to a crisp but they wear it right
Why'd ya do it she said, why'd you let her suck your cock
We can run with scissors through the city fair or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs,
She likes to stand
Take me where you want me all over again
We want to live
To feel the need to feed the need to feel the pain to feel the cut to tear my flesh With a razor blade
I don't feel no pain
Like we were dyin' on the long haul drives
If that's what you wanted to hear
Can you listen to me now
Fool, you're never home now
Feel my soul just siphoning, make a girl wanna hibernate
"I didn't want to kill her
I'm just trying to help you man, trust me
I could turn around and walk away
And I've never seen you frown this much
Flattered that you think I warrant ugliness
You're out of your mind,
I can just sing my troubles away"
I know your words mean nothing
Get off my sack 'cause your shit is WACK
So lately you answer to sort this out
Disenchanted, disgusted
Gallons of spilled African blood
With the great spirit on his side
Would you feel everything I do
When inside we'll smoke the, when inside we'll toke the, when inside we'll smoke
It echoes in my brain
What the fuck is his problem, here, we have two doses to give him, here
And you will feel young
Think it's gonna make a trendy revolution
As his gaze falls down on the city
Nigga if you fuck with me I fuck with you
It's romantic if they mean it when they shut your fingers in the door
Lights ain't on, shit ain't right, never had peace, but I gotta fight
He had six wives; one of those Mormons, you know
Bright yellow sun that fades away to black and blue every place
Well it's happy ever after as the sheets turn shitbrown
Each sickening smell announces a flood
But he say's fuck him up he'll run through me fuck him up
Sundogs flare on windshield glass
You held at arms length
Nothin' like survivin the shot
The sight of your blood will lose your spit
This is the way I'll express my feelings
Everybody's living and nobody's giving
Album Version
Let me see you tear the muthafuckin' club on up
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show
Neon black cocks rot into poison wine
Lock you down tight so you can't move a thread
Oh, eye know you're scared
I don't want to see
Still you fool yourself to ask
Nor refuse the falling rain
PC she says inoculate, hallucinate, beware Shakespeare, bring fresh air, king cigarette snuffed out by her midgets, by her midgets 
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Willin' and able to change the game for the better
When you make breakfast after ten
Encircled by darkness
Yes I know that you can't withstand it
I thought we were twins
Don't wanna be famous
And a family of bones
I don't feel what I am supposed to feel
This is how it feels
The cause of my problems
Smile in your face, undermine your back
Put your words on fire till I'm pure
Es gibt keine Liebe auf dieser Welt 
Gonna use your tongue as a stamp
And our backbeat's to beat your heartbeat off beat, let's go
And if all that crap wasn't enough
On my hands after I wrote this album
Demand for lies is high
Social clubs in drag disguise
Buy the anecdote but not the cure
And every night I pray that you don't knock her up
I feed my anger with the fucking bullshit that you preach
And here's my old school, "Jingling Geordie's"
What you, what you want
You mad at me 'cause I'm gettin' rich
And it's not what I wanted it to be
Styles unbreakable,
And I'm talking to myself at night
Is making me sick
You know we're right
What do you know about relationships
Life is a journey, not a mystery
Flashing through my mind
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch
Held the table for eleven games
The devil cannot see through as I unload
I stopped the thought before its drip became insistent
Just a rite of passage, you held me down and said
Someday even great walls will crumble
X This is mine
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
How do you breathe, why don't you cry
Sweat is beating on the brow
A blackout oath I swore and meant
Don't look now, your life is gone
But I ain't saying it to your mothafuckin' brain, skull
Even though you had these tendencies from the start of this thing
He goes to the desert, fires his rifle in the sky
To share in your sickness
Cause everybody's sayin' Lil Wayne spits raw
I still sing 'em ragged for you and Maria
Yeah, I got the note
Then I know I'm going straight to Hell
Spit you out, spit you out
You're the respectable member of society
Made him feel like a congressman
I got a bad feeling about this to hell with you and all your friends, it's on
Innocence fuels my foolish mind
Butterflies in the jar
You drill Pulling the blood of the earth
You sleep alone at night
All my fear 
Never let them make your face real estate
And don't forget to give me back my black tshirt, hey hey
Ignorance plagues up this planet that we live on
Off top my unorthodox style of attack
It's not the truth I see
My first mistake was to smile at you
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth
You need to step back kid and give me some space
Passed down to this generation
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
What a beautiful fucking time to be alive, eh Ha
Plus I really need a rest
I could make you happy you know if you weren't already
Just to satisfy some sick fuck
How do you sleep, you've never loved
When a trembling distant voice unclear
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
'Cause I do know what's good for me
Nobody wanna sing a little bit out of tune
All I feel is pain it seems today
The tears still fall
No stars to give me one wish, so lost in the dark
Everybody loves to knock down straw men 
Love, hate, lust it's all the same
It's a thin line between love and hate
And then come back and tell them villagers all,
As a child arrested, as a man detested
Let them hear it in the night Yes, we'll fight Let the night roar, because they can hear us, they know we mean it We'll kill them if they come
And for never beating the shit outta me
Grandmother screaming at the wall
Chasing me down like an insect
From the movie Ghost in the Shell
We sing that sad song
I go wild 'cause you break me open
If you want it did you never want for more
Do you know you're not dead
'Cause they know when they're hoes, they're about to get jizzed
Oh, she can trace the tricks of the tracks like the ribs of a rattlesnake
la volante quella notte
That's it, we've had enough
You're not who they say you are
I'm at the edge of myself I'm dying to talk
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
Ah, I'm a motherfucking monster
Can't you hear my heart beating
Not enough for me
Would you please give me my records back
You step up to talk and you start to go on
That I wanna be myself, wanna be the girl
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
I don't want you
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
Instead of drunk belligerence
Baby don't be mad I'm sorry can't you see i
I can't hold on To anything, watching everything spin
Just a rock flaoting
You got to steal the time of a life that's passing by 
I want what I need
In heaven in the lies
Wait a min wait a min I got more to say bitch you ain't goin' no where y'all smile in my face and talk shit in back of me I got the ball I'm tryin' to shot but y'all niggas keep hackin me could it be that I'm a king cause r@b been good to me or could it be that us a lame that hate the game and can't beat me I use to rep the chi but now I no my worth I still rep the chi but earth is my curst nigga I been around the world trown bitches around the world hered roomers round the world still I'm tourin round the world talk about me on your records to make your better play it backwards it probabyly say kells is the coolist ever so don't think these is a song it's a taste of my raft back to your nevous nigga I got a dick and a half I'm a beast
I'm gonna put them in a gun man
Seven on the beat
You don't really know why
Spitting who how I do niggas who knowin' they wanna ride who
Was it just another lie
I give a shout out to the living dead
I just don't know
All about how there's no justice or peace
Now your mother's squatted down alone and she's weeping
If one more cop harassed me I just might go psycho
Now I watch as tables turn
We were supposed to sleep together
I am not your friend
Why are you so sick why are you falling  falling
Oh, fuck y'all eh, fuck the judge
Oh, God, police, ah
Can't seem to rest with a fuckin' pain in my chest
Jet black  We say, "how long can we take this chance not to celebrate"
You want it heavy
My god is a shallow little bitch trying to make the scene
They all become makebelieve
But as long as wood still floats, I can sow my wild oats and paint the town red
And in the end there was no blood spilled
It kill you in the end
I want so much to believe
When it get's dark in this town
Not getting an answer
We decided when the hit was, run up on him,  in the ribs WHAT
But I know what you're doing
Can't see my heart in the blender
Allowed you to put down ya guns, and raise ya pen
I've had all the scars and stitches
Remain enthralled as breathing stalls the course of your mind
Do I believe it if I do not want it
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness
Prototypical nonconformist
Speak to me in tongues
How many shows till were back in New York
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
And made it seem like everything 
Put your problems down and pick up what's left of the pain
Still feel it all slipping away
I say do what you want
I don't think you understand
Me and Merse was gun running
Gonna let nobody love
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind
Please, forgive me for questioning divinity  it's an ugly job but I think I'm up for it I'm not saying who's right, I'm just saying there's more than one way to skin a religion There's more than one way to explain our existence
Fight on your own, that's not the point, boy
Your every breath now strengthens my affliction
Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
I don't want to hate you
There's no hope, no doubt, no faith
But he's not in the House
And slam his ass into a brick wall
You said no, you said no
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So be true to me, my walls are flaming
If talking's a waste of our time
I'll have to sink my fangs in someone else's heart to heal my own
Or I could just get a real fucking job
I hope you put gas in the motorhome and know the roads,
Traces of life and look what comes between
I'd have made it perfect just for you
It was far away and slowly breaking apart
I got nothin' to lose
Mindless apethetic fuckers flocking to church
Would help him do the trick
There's no eyes in your head
Bedroom punching
I'd feel more comfortable with myself
And never dine alone, meanwhile back at sea level it was home by home zone for zone,
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing
You better watch where you run your mouth
Will I burn at the stake to have a chance to obey
I know their appetite for me
I'm in the six you got to hop in the three company monopoly
It's hard to live in a world when you fucking hate it all
It has a very high visibility, it is why stop signs, stop lights and fire equipments are usually painted red
And all of the hypocrites lie through their teeth
'Cause it doesn't really matter anymore
Tap into thoughts
I wanna be heard  The TV announcer he talks to the scum
When I want to return everything
Oh my God  I live for You now
I feel as though you're never gonna let it all out
Back in his house, now back in his bed
You feel so lucky
Have exactly the same fate
But now you're staring out the TV with a smile on your face
Tha programs of Vietnow
Just proved jet blue he's not
And does he cry through broken sentences like,
My son says, dear father, what did you do when the world turned over
Geunomhante gado joha
"Drop the guns and grab her, it's time to make a run"
On the very same day in the very same cold
Just give us war, worn lipstick by the purifying flame
Knows that she could never hide
Let bitter silence infect the wound
Now I know what I'm about to choose
It was cool but it was just pretend
You like to think you're never wrong Forfeit the game
Do you know what they feel
So no one gives you a damn
You're still a liar
I feel so stupid when I look back
Just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters
And teach them to hate this place
I want justice
Grey not neon, grey not real 
This girl's getting caught in a lie, 
And three months on in this bad design won't make it feel any easier
She's about to do Karabo's laundry now
It's the social circle that you're not part of 
She gave it all away, she saw her baby break
A week in the forest
Yo I'll fuck ya ass up
There's a base viciousness that nourishes my spine
I wanna be a tough skinned bitch but I don't know how
Just like a diamond bullet where it's crystal crystal clear
When I die Die, bury me Me
Fuck you and I'm gone, fuck y'all niggas
Soll ich die Papiere holen und machen, was ich will
So get your ass out from
Oh lie on me, that's all I want is you to lie on me,
He says, "Give it up boy, give it up or you're gonna die, 
I wanna sleep
Pigs arresting you and me
I need another one to incubate
I never wanna see your face round here anymore
And sitting in the long grass in summer
But without my friends
I'm trapped again in endless rain
Bruv told me what happens when a loved dies
And it's not your style
The key broke off in the ignition humping if I wandered off through my thoughts wishing
Is this what you want for your children
Digging graves to feed the bossman, to feed his family, to feed his slaves,
You liar, love to be deceived
And my fists all fucking red
I got to box you for the money, said it might end
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
Dog with disease
I can taste your innocence
I'm a mess now drippin' with regret from the worst damn night I've spent with you
Ha, now ain't that some shit ain't that some shit
You believed in superstitions
And some decals for your fingernails
Socially paranoid
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Many miles away
Thuglife niggaz Yo, EM Get me up out of this motherfucker man
'Cause I run wit Asians, Latinos and Black fists
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
I'm knitting jumpers, I'm working after hours
And you'll dismiss it cause it isn't what you're used to
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
It's not a secret
I've a hand and a napkin when I'm looking for sex
There's too much scarring when I bleed
This year to stop me from tears
I'm your fucking queen
You alienate yourself,
Disclaimer We should all have hope and look towards the day where a man realizes the sounds exiting his mouth are mostly complaints that a change occurs
To satisfy, insure you not to quit
You're not a man, stand and deliver
The working man got so tired of waiting
Bboys make some noise, get connected
You eat shit, you mean shit, you fucking whore
You try so hard to fake it
Of the mess you've made
I hope she knows
Disguise yourself plead innocent
Hotter than the thought of Nicki Minaj naked, making her booty shake
But flesh and blood never divine
I wanted to heal me and then destroy the world
No way, no way, no way, yeah yeah, to disconnect
Born at the badder side, half this time still await
At those fearless men but few
And show you a picture of yourself now;
An old friend convinced me that he was underjoyed
Take out your sharp teeth
And you suck it
Battle motivation in no time lyrics come
But not today
You're gonna fuckin' die, you piece of shit
'Gainst the lassitudes of Death
Formulating flows in revolutionary science
Sometimes I want to rip out your throat, Daddy
But it feels like nothing helps
Now we're at the end and it's over now
What, what's the matter
U be actin' like a bitch
But still you paint up a picture as if you're the victim of some kind of terrible plot
You broke them now, you haven't tamed me
Instead I set the thing on fire
You punks is petty, still we steady, countin' fetti
But I could never stop the torrent
But no bodies ever knew
Here we go, here we go, here we go, now
There's only one thing I can say this life is fucking mean
They don't need to know about my brother's blood
Everyone wants it all
No need to help it take its toll
I fuck yo ass up
Do you only want me 'cause you can't have me
The king is back
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
Snoop Dogg We tend to bus' on niggaz that get mad at me
Mom's coming 'round to put it back the way it oughta be
On your breath, on your flesh
Why don't you mind your own business
Except perhaps a few thousand rappers in this business
All your innocence for free
*I should tell me not to little everyday*
Lost on the street because you don't know what to do,
Today's the day our younger son is going off to war
Step up 'Cause you're the next one in line for the kill
There's no hope for you my friend 'cause they're coming to get you
And gee, who better to talk to than you
Rest your bones,
I can't feel  I'm disconnected
Knocked the FUCK out
I'm falling down one thousand feet
Who cares if you die tomorrow
To make a voice no voice at all
If I say my heart is sore 
Yeah, interest games, their interest rates
This isn't no fairy tell, I never had it easy
Stuck my nose 
Make sure they won't bite you
Don't drop the beat no
The way you bit off my head
Angel of Death is bloodied now
In the darkness of my dreams
Ich sah dir in die Augen sie war'n tot sie warn leer
You want someone to hurt like you
Tryin' to get what I got ya might get shot
You did nothing
I started this gangsta shit
Thrown back by
Hoping you don't suck it down
"My precious wife
Then walks backwards through the bushes where he's disregarding nature
He's talking fuck him up at me fuck him up
Give it back
And if I get drunk, yes, I know I'm gonna be
Watch you burn
That's what you wanted to hear
He's on a stairway to hell
Get back to the show 'cause it's payday
Your shit is phat but I don't hear it in the format Jack
und heut gibt es die GSG 
Confusing, confusing what is real
Round and round on the rotting ground
Apologies unacceptable now
A minute and a half of having sex, that ain't loving
There's still a hole inside of us that may not ever get filled
No, I will not forgive
A round of applause, it's all that you want
Trading friends for trips to the coast
Guess you'll buy a gun
Not to the next scene bitch the next check
I think you should know we've restored our faith
I've left bethlehem
Because no one is going to ruin me
That is not what I do
Out of your mind bent on revenge
We had to ride on a nigga
You wanted all control so
I'm not liking the sound of your voice
You break the law and you breach
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
You are disposable means
Silent Anguish and silent scream
Put it in my face, I'm gonna do it every time
So you spread lies
Yes indeed a, dawn of the dirt and doom draws nearer
And sometimes I surprise myself I can stand the metal roof
Right wing left wing sitting on a fence
Laws written on paper and paper burns
I only fuck wit niggas that do business up under the table
Come into the world of endless odds 
It ain't hard to be a sinner
I'm so tense, gasoline machines can't save me now
Wage war on the bastards
They don't care and it's just not fair
The cannon sounded
Sorry I couldn't help
We are the innocent, we get framed
Nothing's sacred in the faces of
You wanna be a woman like a man
Needless to say, I guess you know I hate you
I wear the circle in my sleep
Not just yet, not just yet
I tell her she's innocent, and she'll show me she's not
A toast to the end of our innocence
Cross my heart I hope you die
Life bleeds, death is your birthright 
Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment Hopefully we will be able to in the future Until then how about a random page
Y'all free up ya mind and stop actin' crazy
I'm from the city where  of the best died
Well I got a bad feeling about this
That appear to be determined by an unseen panel of hipster judges Bullshit
Your badmouth has killed off everything we had
A little bit closer,
You think it's my fault
Sad to say, it's over now
And I emerged the chilling stranger, my friend
But this city made me so
Release, and run to me
Shoot planets, don't get frantic
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show, bitch
     attackin they frat
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty,
Can't stand weak friends that have pretense
An ageold method towards a new direction
I wanna love you
On roule en caisse les roues chromées ici tout le monde nous reconnait
And this is not a fashion statement
In the mines of Mozambique
Hush now whore
Talk like a big business tycoon
Like this whole song was just some kind of sickly devised plan
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody even wants to know
At the blood on the money machines
This is a war
Like how to deal with despair or someone breakin your heart
Inside your heart I cry for more
But I will not weep
Pervert flesh on a plate
Who want to step up
Fighting off the devil's wenches
I have no snare in my headphones
ThugLife will never fail 'Cause I'm out on bail
Thuglife niggaz You know what time it is
Remind me
Blowing down the backroads headin' south
Feel the pain whoa oh
Everything you've done's gonna bite you back in some way
Oll my friends they got
Ball and chain
He'll never change he's just not there
Fuck smiley gladhands with hidden agendas
Project nigga all my life, but wouldn't say the hood did it
Turned into a ball and chain, mmm
One move and you're dead, 
I can really fuck you up, yeah
I saw horses fall
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
And it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free
Prends conscience de mon manque
Sieh mir noch einmal in die Augen Baby, bevor du gehst
I, I, I don't need control
My skin is not a football for you
The stars and stripes are running for their own big show
I've learned to stand aside
All you want is entertainment
Passengers with destination to Hell
Truth is truer these days, truth is manmade
Why you won't return my calls 
You're on your own now
So I don't know if I can be just your friend
My heart aches to bleed
Where did our honor go
Just another incredible scene
So much more aware
My mother died of cancer, prince died of cancer, that was the end for me I just wanna to kill that motherfucking stepmother, kill myself, and kill all you And fucked of the cancer then I just wanna to be with my prince and my mother God, life's a cunt
They wear hoods and carry shotguns in the main streets of Montgomery
Drug use  I kicked it
Oh, El is back on that shit, huh
Brought up as peasants at the bottom of the hill hobroken's only view a mountaintop rubber plant the factory whistle blows twice every day smokestacks make the skies black so thick I could hardly see I ain't gonna waste away for the price of steady pay townsfolk look like zombies gotta break away got no welcome mats you leave no coming back wasn't the first to take the same old crap this town no one leaves this town no no one sleeps so uptight no one breathes this town ain't for me don't give me no lip 'cause I quit the hometown if that's all there is keep it for yourself I've had a lot of steady jobs I've had enough another day's too much gonna pack it up I'm city bound catch the five fifteen out going to the coast hobroken nightmare used to be a dream hobroken nightmare gotta break free
Just give us war, war, I've been calling you all week
Every karaoke love letter, lyrics undiscovered
The dark crow man sits and stares
I'm barely breathing now you got me by the spine
Enough to fill it up again
You fooled me
Tried to fuck me from behiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind
Laid down at the end of my rope
You can join the "in crowd" for being a whore
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or les
You know you can't complain
Will it help you to sleep well at night
But making no sense
I can't feel 'cause I don't want to feel no more
'Cause you just don't give a damn
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
It was a cold afternoon for a funeral
esperando o sinal
U ain't fuckin' wit me Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch x
Gnash your teeth Like an exploding car
La vera storia non la insegnano
She's caught in a lie,
All your twobit psychiatrists
For the countless counts of low down doublecross
And now my sister's got a fancy car
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is,
But we had a chance to change our mind
All the maggots made
No this is not my name
You never told me from the first time You said you were my friend
And hearts get broken and heartbeats stop
And now I come across without
The enemy in the mirror
I throw to you before I throw the rest away
And make no distinction
Pick yourself up off the dirty floor
See there's something that he used to believe in
I hate you, I hate you, I swear to God, I hate you, oh my God, I love you
Leavin' a nigga, fuck ya cash flow
Er ließ kein' an sich heran
Cocksucker take one for your team
And then I lose my mind
I won the war
This song has not yet been released
Killers gangs watch your ass
And I really wanted just be in your body
But they're all gonna choke me
I shoot the lights out
People just pretending, that's a let down
I smell oxygen, precious Bareback on your horse
But they don't help me get any closer to you
I am the coward and I shoot you in the back 
Got to get with the program, I don't need no charity
Now all I want is my Patsy Cline CD
The ambulances engine turns back on
'Cause I know that none of it's true
Non fai rime del quartiere per sentirti grande, no
"I understand that time is running out"
I don't know what you've been told G
Rough shit, don't even attempt sleeping
You don't want to say his name any more
You can't believe the heart you save
How can I believe this untrue
You used to look my god right in the eye here
I went to your concert and there was nothing going on
So I'll be disguised in it
All of a sudden, this picture I painted just turned ugly
You know I see it written 'cross the sky 
I do not catch the spark x
Wanna hate
I'll set the world on fire and in the burning light
Well, I don't want you to be alone down there
Of golden dandelions
Fear is how I fall Fear is how I fall
I believe the title was "Bin Laden determined to attack inside the United States"
Rotten like a crackwhore, begging out the backdoor Show us what you're good for, post it to the noise board
Give while enough a addon
'Cause now I see the destructive power of a lie
Jump kerosene, now what do we do
And death the only thing you get for fuckin' with lords
Oh, we're not worthy
This is how a heart breaks ooh ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah
Whizzed past his kid and his wife
A shallow little asskiss art disaster
You're in the dark, so I'll turn on the light
You wrote it out, in blackened ink
With blood on his face
'Cause I can't stop now Bravehearts
Since I stopped being a seeker
Cast salt into your violence stop freestyling
And the more we tense up, avoiding pain 
I'm a negative creep and I'm
Sucker fish fuckers down in the sink
So here we are now, face to face
Never mind the l'il birdies wing
To rise above all the dirt and grime
Now as a citizen, I've asked you to stop it
Do you believe I would take such a thing with me
"Mein Name ist Legion, denn wir sind viele"
We love hate
For you the time stops
And you know too much
I'm potent, intact, a blackhearted and lungedup
That I'll never end transcend transcend
How you loved him 'til you hated him and made him cry for mercy
But I backed out
Sucker Sucker Oh, sucker
For the mines of Mozambique
I'm peeling off my skin
I see some very nice skin out there
Keep this rocking it's brown mixed with green we'll be swervin
And I am not afraid of snakes
There's no telling how long I'll be here
I don't care anyway just give me a what I want
I hate the song they sing
Peel away the shell and we're from the inside
I string 'em to get the best necklace in the world
The one thing I can stand up for is resting supine on the ground
Reeking of ether and terminal madness
To say that you wanna
I got a piece of shit from 
I believe in peace
You know nothing about art or sex
Get your motherfuckin security ready fuck em
It ends with me, wait and see
A mac with a pull, act a fool, excalibur
Ain't nobody fucking with me
Did I take too long Was just teasin'
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
In social gopher tea formals or any scene where brie is normal
To dominate this shit has been my every intention
This is a sinking road that we all travel on
Hope you like my genocide
Third person in the inner monologue again
I made it so complicated
Just keep the plane from drifting off course
The mothers will cry
Not broken Still standing
I'll be massive conquistador
I still believe in this society
Freaks here in this hopeless fucking
But now you're gonna have to shut your mouth and fight me
Come move in another dimension
Yeah I know you
From the space between your bed and wall
Look over yonder to that burying ground
Somebody getting' killed from that sewer in her vein
Apathy and a bitter me I will fail to see
Don't give me your nothin'
I would die for you
From earthly gods not heaven,
Is it not what you thought it would be
When I was young PC meant Police Constable 
I'm sick of everything that you say
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
Comin' in to suck 
Nine chances to drown ourselves
My spirit walks the streets of Tottenham
We doin' this shit hell motherfuckin' yeah
Evil, evil, we who would kneel, evil, evil Evil man
Alone you stand with nobody near
It's time to get it over with it's useless to run
Now it's everybody's problem that you're unhappy, oh, come on
Dye 'em black
Yeah you're such a fucking liar
And I don't give a fuck I keep it gangsta y'all
My mind to distress
Don't you know they're gonna kill your sons
Also lasset uns freun
So don't pretend to know what it's like
We kicked rocks a couple blocks and no one talked
And the scavengers are feeding 'cause the killing fields are bleeding
Per questo resto coi ragazzi veri
'Cause it's cold in December and there's reason to stay in
Then you realize you're not unique
I didn't have the courage to say
My inner luck knows better, it's what I wanna hear
What story should I tell now, I'll just expose the truth
I'm hostile for the people, for those devils and corruptions
Shoulder gives way and the ice breaks
Everything you do's gonna come back to you
Tell me something I can't remember
You little fucker
And I will never know you're gone
Wild 'cause we know there's no Jehovah watching over us
They take you to a restaurant for a feast,
And now I know why now, now I know why
Wild boys will be wild, still acting like a child
Upon which there is no price 
I wanna tear it up, tear it out
I can't stand you 
What the fck y'all take me for I love you cause you hate me more
Rest assured but not assured, all is well, but I think we've dealt
I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face
And mother please shine down on me
No need  I've burned enough times myself
There is no fucking paradise
Believe, believe, believe, believe
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Es war noch nie Unwort des Jahres, Kindesmissbrauch
And I know that God had something to do with it
I made my face go red 
Fuckups and punchins
They, they, they, gay, who the fuck is gay
The venom and the vaccine swirl
Ain't you, mama Imma make you look so ridiculous now
And I know it's right, because I know it's time for freedom
Today I cry for my sins
I'm breaking myself away from that chain
Stupid fucking people think your going to change the world
And I don't give a fuck
And she walked along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
You say I'm trapped up in a shell
Lets fuck away morality, you might be independent
The more I want to punch your face I go
I crawl in shotgun and reach into his mouth
To everything that lies in your heart
I want you for your body
Sew up the sore make it fake
I was so afraid, now you're gone away
When I look in your eyes now
Holy matrimony is not for me
Midwest love affair, I bend when I am bored
Now it's nothing but ruffage for lunch and punchlines for dinnerfeed me
'Cause I used to move you in a way that you've never known
And cry my eyes for Your acceptance has brought me here
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
Car Babylone a le pouvoir et l'exerce sur nos frères 
Used trucks dirty donuts you you're the one
Sie konnten nicht mehr lachen sie warn müde sie war'n schwer
Climb backwards through the red room
Here now alone with all who love her
Shoulda sent a thankyou note, you little hoe
How can you ever expect someone else to know you
Destroyed by madness, oh yeah
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
MCs I be warning them
And you're like that every time you pull heart back
So when it's blackhawk over the glass walk,
Mics spray then, bury flesh in wasteland
Kurt Cobain e Billie Holiday senza la roba
On fault lines
She may be crazy, may treat me bad
Shitty little sick kid, the Gipper's hitting for dolo, now I'm rarefied
Can't see no sky
Two faces one man
High class, white trash, rolling a classic hovercraft
We stand larger than life
J'attends que l'espoir prenne mon temps, baby
So how the hell could you front on me
I know who you are
I hope I get to sleep tonight
Corporations cold turn you to stone before you realize
Ripping through the walls
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
Peace and war both pumpin' soul in my heart
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone that's my word
Shop wit thug wit get into some thug shit
I got the donuts that I wanted
Here they come it's closing time
One, two, fuck you
Running amok as we fuck up the stage
I wanna be a pig
Stealing money for drugs, Name it I've tried it
When you got her in the back seat
There is no recovery
Yo, nobody care about how much money you stack
He pulled some teeth and I lost some blood
World turned upside down
Never come back no more
Deep in the veins of the great rivers
How's it feel to be the hunter
Books are easy back ups for what they do to you,
And neon drive nazi cars
Living encaged like animals and cannibals,
Enough of this world
Is like Hannibal rollin' on elephant's backs
It began with a mistake
I don't wanna go to sleep
Oh you say we are friends
Well I'm still working to make life better, though I've fallen from God's grace
Or their ignorance
All these lines fall short of what I had in mind
I'd like to go back  years
Ah, I opened up my arms to You, and we spun from life to life,
I'm not gonna let you, I'm not gonna let you
Can decide you, fucker
Don't run away bring it on
With a dick
But you can't blame me if I set dis stage on fire
When I come home I be smellin shit and furnitures moved
Shook her head to see him snoring in his sleep
Bitch I see you, cause you know I know you
First light a fire
I'd date him with no prob And if he wanted to I'll let him beat the pussy with no condom"
In a way, I failed religion
Silence, quiet Need a little peace of mind
So you want a piece of this
What about all the shit you've done to me
Because this is not my trip 
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Alltagstragödien in benzinhaltiger Luft
I am so full of these feelings
Androgynous
Look at them now,
They're too many stars and not enough sky
Eyes of fire staring back at me
When you know you bout as sweet as a honey bun
Said "I don't mind if you take me down"
You fucking ripped my heart out
Anatomy of my pain
Suddenly it didn't matter to you no more
Yesterday don't mean shit 
You'll never find a fucking fingerprint
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
Young money men play paintball games
It's a miracle I haven't fallen through any cracks
Show me my leader and I'll pledge obedience
You little punks think you own this town
I offer nothing in my defence
No, all my hate cannot be bound
The lawyers work in shifts
The watchman, that kill us in this maze we locked in
I really wanted to be in your body
Listenin' to nobody beats the biz and you ain't never heard hip hop
So nigga fuck you x
Tired of falling backwards
Check my slant on it, give me a beat and I'll dance on it while you act robotic
I would never want to wake again
Oil baron running the government
Alright, not bad
Yes, take me deep inside so I can heal your pain
Yeah, not even if sober
Make you feel this 
Tut es mir leid das ich nicht härter zu dir war
Another tag, another headline
At the end of that dead end road
Gather your psychotic masses and bring them to me
Yeah, give it to me easily, my feeble mind
Like a woman, like a, like a man
In the back, off the side and far away
But that shit don't work I just laugh
In disastrous times
Now I would rather you did not
Smile on the face
All I need is a little respect Step, come on
It Wasn't long till I called you mine
This is my body, this is the blood I found
Cause you like, all of the rest man
Save your prayers and solve your problems with your fist
Can't get my mother off my back
You make me sick
'Cause I made, I made
She wants to be a deity and rule us everyday
When I die won't you bury me
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way rap this way
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw
I wanna fuck a car
But lord knows that I'm not you
Their deep understanding and intelligent looks,
All that's left
I just want it to be the same
But mostly black boys, but they would call us "niggers"
Or did you cry for someone else
Unless I remember it wrong
You're nothing in my life in my head
Just games for days, busy bees makin' our honey
I promised not to hurt you again
The whole goddamned day in bed
Not me, I'm addicted to sinnin
You my peoples when I see you I embrace you with love
Their existence is a crime
I know what it's like to not be able to feel
There is a war going on for your mind
I'm talking to you, so come on come on, come on baby I'm talking to you
But if you read between the lines, you'll see the missing link
My poppa didn't give one, that's why I'm like this now
Picked up thrown down used abused and not even missed
Tell me, how do you sleep
There is never redemption, any fool can regret yesterday
Sing now is now yeah all I ever wanted
Just let me bleed one more
Now you know
Won't you take my sins away
All my friends are gone, they died
Hopsin
And now everyone LIES
A game of who needs who the worst
Let it be known, you can lean on KRSOne
The law won't arrest you
I know she won't take the blame
But I got one foot in hell
I completely blacked out, I can't remember a thing
My live source movin across with brute force
You never did nothing for me
I'm gonna kill him
I'm gonna fight 'em all
Yeah, well we both know that you don't play fair
Fuck you, fuck me, fuck you fuck you fuck me you never loved me
In ground, what a broke head
Empty arms and an aching heart
pretendes pelear y solo eres un mierda buena onda
But it's feeling all wrong
I spend hours in front of the mirror, making my hair elegantly disheveled
You followed footsteps in the dark
Eat what you are while you're falling apart 
I'm number one you ain't nothin' but shit
I open my eyes but I cannot see
Bang bang, down another casualty
That I'm gonna ignore
I'm feelin' really trapped I gotta go
Nigga that's how the game goes
Now, just cuddle up and sleep tight
Life live, mind power
Pay up to the profit, and you'll never look back
No harps, no delusions of losing we're sitting prettier than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears,
If I could kick your ass somehow you've sunk in those stupid lies in a major disguise
You got a lot of nerve to come back
Things are very different now
Atom'll rip a rhyme, and devastate a mind with  lines
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
Don't you dare mess with my mean machine
Is I hate you
Cut glass on my callused feet,
Sold into the fashions of the false heroes' fight
Set me on fire
While on the shoreline I stand washed of my pride
There's a gun at my back
Like you're running blind
I feel like I don't even know you
Right at your feetI don't think so  no
And take another step back, until you find you've walked away
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
Terminator's back on some ol' fools track
I've been shot at, I've been cheated, how could you send me to this place
To raise my middle fingers up and say "fuck you"
Just how to make my world turn black
Shoot'em up, let god sort'em out in the end
I don't give a shit
The sun has set, all darkens
With the fear for far too long
All that tangled talk
Feeling like I'm drowning and feeling all dried up for what
The charges were made known to me
We'll be breaking free 'cause we're far beyond control
So I can fantasize that the chaos is not real
She wants to see galaxies
Frankenstein I'm well aware of
And I'm a make sure nobody ever signs with you again
Ok the rotary phoner grow to be notably mobile
Fuck you hoes, fuck you bitch ass niggaz too
But it ain't mine anymore
Cause now I know this isn't at all right
You scared me with visions of fire
How many niggaz eat it and shit it, you cats want it come and get it
I'll display my disaffection you grind me up, yeah, you spit me out
Take a souvenir and stop your staring
I'm not afraid of screaming and I'm not afraid of crying
F G F C     Enforce your rage
To waist this love on no one no no time for you
I'll see your face in hell, my friend
I'll paint this town blood red tonight
And if I turn around
Because marriage doesn't work in the world today
I will not forget the day
And save your lie about needing to be free
Ok, no more questions, no worries,
Little punk wanna get real far
Just to make ends meet
I go ahead, never, never turn back
I feel so fucking sick my life, your life
Well now I don't mean to offend, much
She'll rock the boat to bedlam
And now I know I want to kill you like only a best friend could
Leave your fingerprints
You fake
You got to let her know you're swapping sides
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
There ain't no glory and there ain't no hope
Holding the mass
If I had a dollar for every time I couldn't sleep,
I don't want to fade away, away, away 
And neither do the  hired sheriks that examined me
Often make a brother feel like he gotta compete
As the pinnacle  lyrical master  queen of disaster
Hammer the battlecry into braillestudded armor
The way you make me feel I have to react
Innovation, I leave to smarter men
Near me now, the demon's son
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Your silence screams
Rev Jim Jones Don't ever say hate is your enemy Love has practically caused me to just get you destroyed If I had hated a little more, just a little more, we would have had a little less trouble Sure you got love Principles But don't say 'hate is my enemy', what'd they say, what's that words "Hate is my enemy and I've got to fight it day and night" and "what else is death" is the line Love is the only weapon, SHIT BULLSHIT Martin Luther King died with love Kennedy died talking about something he couldn't even understand, some kind of generalized love, and he never even backed it up He was shot down Bullshit, "Love is the only weapon with which I got to fight" I've got a hell of a lot of weapons to fight I got my claws, I got cutlasses, I got guns, I got dynamite, I got a hell of a lot of fight I'll fight I'll fight I will fight I will fight I will fight I will fight
How do you pay for war
But darkness is a friend to you 
Wem gehör'n die Drogen
And when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets I'ma handle this
New gospel, homey, Take Six, and take this, haters
I'm not crazy 'cause I take the right pills every day and rest
I never set out to exploit another,
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
She can fuck you good, but I can fuck you betta
Heaven knows what a girl can do
Was früher die Gestapo war
And I cannot sleep without the radio
We float overhead like a space odyssey monolith
Put your money where your mouth is, Mr KnowAll
When it's all burning when it's over
It feels so good to say what I want 
i monumenti a cosa servono
These scars won't heal
You can dress it all up you can try to pretend
You're neve gonna find a love like mine
Where po's scope the people like Muhammad and Malvo
Death's a part of life, you just can't ignore it
About some fear I have of heartache
Soon a dismembered world we'll see
This ain't a verse, this shit talk at the end of the song
Tonight two great ships will pull back to their ports
You can't even pry the nameplate off, now can you
I just want to scream
I'm not asking to go dancing I'm not that dumb anymore
Hope were gonna turn blue
I'm gonna drive the knife through
Of color she left in your black and white field
It's going to feel so good
We all know your secret sins
If I should fail, if I should fold
There was a wicked messenger
You're right where you always wanted to be
Pick up the phone fucker
Why the fuck are you looking at me
On all the pain you've been selling
Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh it's cool now"
Because it's die muthafucka, die muthafucka still, fool
Talkin' that shit
Within a breath, a war from the depth of time
Ich bin der Abgrund, die Entwürdigung, das Chaos
But I still end up saying if and but
I received the spit from a snake
But now we've got tribe
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac in his prime
You were a punch line
Bet a mil that I slaughter, serve niggas, give a fck what you ordered
I will relieve you of the burden of your six figure apathy,
How I love to hate you
So go choke on your irony 
By giving you no time instead of it all
I'm just holding on to let them know
You think that you can beat them
You know it never meant much to me
Quit acting so friendly 
So tell me something I don't know
It's time for you to choose the bullet or the chapstick
And can you keep sleeping metaphysical girl
So you come to me, made of these, urgent unfulfilled
It's not the first time we've fucked it up
I watch the snow cover up the bottle
It's nothing but my way
You break your back for something
I dare not ask who's been helping you fall asleep,
One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
Uh I want you to trip like me,
But they are not going to stop until they see you go to sleep in the dirt
He's not listening to a word now
Say hey Mr driver man, drive that thing fast
I'm not the girl that lied
Never look back and don't look ahead
Us whores don't need you
Daddy only stares into the distance
And all of the questions with no proper answers
I need an answer and humans can't provide it
Like you want you fuck you
We killin' all gorillin with all that screwfacin
Take a lil bit of this a lil bit of dat
I put my faith, my faith in them
You gon'hate me
Lying on the floor and waiting for the break of day 
The rascals win, killing them all with a javelin
I am the assassin
Je peux rester là afin de pouvoir tout oublier
Reclaim your honor
Save me, save me, from my, my hell
And later on, why not, I'll rip your throat off
The leaders of this world have shortchanged the human race,
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Oh well, whatever, never mind
﻿Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Allah stay chasin' dough like wild lions
I got fed like a fish full of open smiles
No one will accept all of me, so the fire will stop
All the searing smoke and the blinding flash
Run out, ah you better face it
It takes thought and time and rhyme
There's no one here to help you, no one's gonna hear
Aww, I'm sorry
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
When the madness stops, then you will be alone
Shut up, I'm not like you 
Hey rabbit
We full throttle in this bitch and never will slack up
Makes my life a war, What a bore
Wild when I know you're near
No food for us but there's another fucking bottle of pills
Its bout ta get real ugly up in yo mothafuckin club fucked up in that bitch
And you bullshittin' bitches ain't changin' me
How can a bed of roses hurt so much to lie upon
Cause mommy's been been drinking again and we don't want to get beat
But when nature turns to habit
'Til she woke me with the knife edge of her glance
I could never swallow
No body no fun
Emptiness, my old friend
Where was God when I needed a friend
Kouluun sä menit silmin vihaisin
All I need is a little respect
That you couldn't read in any trendy New York underground fashion magazine
And we ain't got no money, so she lose her fuckin' mind
I mean it, fucking whore
I got lost, now I'm so far behind
But by free thought, not a gun to the head
With a mind that multiplied
Blood roses, blood roses 
Denn um die Sicherheit im deutschen Staat
Or believe in something without thinking, "What if somebody doesn't approve"
And fuck ups and fake ups
Parallel crossing lines
The way you left me for dead
You fake it
I'm hypnotized by rituals
I don't care if you're ready or not
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Otan sinut vastaan hymyillen, kukkia kaduille sirottelen,
You got so much hate,
Shifting through your city limits, trying to find the raw shit
Why did this feeling
Nigel is not outspoken 
On est venu squatter les sommets you little shit, you don't know me
It never ends, never ends 
And in time you'll face the darkness 
Someone's drawn tits on my neighbour's back door
My temper's burnin' and my face is red
In this motherfuckin' bullshit life
Still we lie jerking back and forth
Then you go, now you're back
Yeah his mamma beat him just like that too
But bobbys truncheon had to wait to show him
Sometimes my face gets pushed against the fence
I never did believe you much anyway
Signals that flash and beat
Fit a hearse with a burner, whip to the church of a murder sermon
These are the things I saved to sink you
I'm tellin' you now
Greasy, dirty, sweaty, smelly
Old enough to understand the shit'll change forever
My brother's back
If you still wanna hang
Demolish every hood, disintegrating the mosh pit
All votes invalid, use any old lie
This is what it sounds like  when we ride on our enemies
When they don't like what we say they stop it in the courts
Been to Vegas lately, any of you 'Cause I was there for a couple of weeks, when we were on tour Yeah, okay You know what I noticed in Vegas I noticed this one little thing we have some fat fucking people in this country It is out of control Have you seen them sitting at the slot machines They're so fat the stool's all the way up their ass, and they just sit there and have food delivered, and they eat and play the slots "AHHMUMFMUMF, CLANG, AHHMUMMFFMUMMFF, CLANG I need money, CLANG, CLANG, CLANG" They fart, the stool flies across the room These people make Elvis look anorexic, you know what I'm talking about Stop eating I am fed up with the little denial phrases they have, too "I'm not fat, I'm husky" Yeah "I'm portly" Ya ya ya ya "I'm stout" Oh, ok ok ok "I'm bigboned" You're bigassed Dinosaurs are bigboned Put the fork down We gotta do something, because we all have fat people in our families You know what, if we don't stop 'em soon, they're just gonna start blowin' up, I swear to God We're gonna have a country full of sumo wrestlers either way
Hey can't you see we've been fooling around
Let them feast upon their own shit
Breathe slow, don't move 
And back through the glen
That you don't believe in God
She will love you, if you return it
The number one defender,
I went to your concert and I didn't feel anything
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit  I just,
Tell, tell, there's nothing left to tell
Did you hear I don't care no more
Walk the coolest walk that you know
I sold my soul but don't you dare call me a whore
Odd uhuh, that shit's corny as fuck
Fading facesangels crying beside me
I don't wanna say, "diiiie motherfucker"
A photo the size of my fist
But I would walk  miles
And so we ran, like the wolves were biting,
Ever heard a Glock go 'click' like a camera
As I'm clenching my fists so hard
Braveheart bitch like the times are medieval
What's the point in fighting
No, I don't need to hear your depressing remarks
Specifically addressin' the oblivion we livin' in
I think I'll send these doctor bills
You can't begin to consider the palpable hate in the air when you're here
You better not test me, trust me,
Broken glass all in my mouth
Sometimes I feel like shit
Hate is a river flowing with money and greed
Another level when it's me and Devils gangbanging
I hate a man like you
Another housekeeper fantasy afrodite
And it's not something you know that I could, I could prove
And I'll know just what to do
Mixed with blood from split tongue
I'm sure you thought I'd be easy
It's happened so many times, I stopped tryin' to keep track
Pull back the covers, read the newspapers
You don't know me
You were only four, but lord you remember it
Despite all the earth we feel
A long drawn out year and I see now why
I'm leaving for myself and no one else
Beat me to the ground
And when you got no one we'll give a fuck,
Stumbles towards a dark figure on the other side of the street
'Cause the harder that I chase, the harder you're running
And I collect my thoughts
I am nothing
I want courage
I say them alound, to myself I am talking
Our Kingdom is slowly falling down the stairs
To the sunrise or the sunset, the master and his servant
Forgive us our trespasses
It takes a wall for the real you to break through
You're so afraid, so you try to break me, yeah
This place is of the dark and I
Why do you, you wanna break my heart
Will I drive out in the night
Get yourself a break from self rejection
All this shit I'm seeing
Now in an afterthought 
I no longer feel the need to rush
I only listen to the demon in my mind,
We always seem to fall with only words to hold
Falling inward 
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you
You're in my dreams and in my mind
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Pass a man walking like the man in the moon
This fucking mind
Everybody wants
I just can't accept you not being well off
Depleted of everything that shoots flames and reports
It kicks my humble heart around
Should I feel grateful to play
Say a little prayer now
Lacing my shoes, we the MellowHype jews
Do it now, do it now
My advice to you, my friend
I like to make you lie
Now I gotta stand with the Glock in my hand
Your mind is SLIME so please resign
And you can't calm the rage
Why do I feel like this
Someone killed
Wish you'd would shut up, you'd shut up, you'd shut up
The brain of a sow kill off inside
Rattattat goes the gat to his devil's face P Dog
Know it's over
You want no part of his life any more
I'm here until the frontline breaks
But I will put right this disgrace
No doubt the body count
Everyday now, for what seems forever
You wanna graduate but not in his bed
Her lips were put on this earth for dispersing wisdom
I'm visualizing battlefield scenarios
Make the coffee black as night
And you know how that goes
If you ain't got no wings
We let him use his powers
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
I need your wars body in my arms
Where was love when I felt like hate
Always gotta scream and shout
My breeze more of a fucking masculine
Under our noses
Even you can not resist her
You lost interest, you lost your spine Whoa
Neon black dirt in the garden
I'll turn you into me, I'll turn you into me
If everything you said to me was a lie then,
I am the pulse of this fucking town, holmes, no
Do you take plight on my tongue like lead
One thing we know that the white man will
Sweet kisses, baby ain't even know she was your mistress
For everything I know
Or your ass is missing in action bro
Don't know what to do with it
I know something you don't know 
The plans for revenge have all been detailed and laid out
Your race is burning the pavement
No no no more talking
My life is fucking pointless I'm getting nothing done
Zabierają mi wolność którą mam,
But what it is I don't know
I need to feel,
You know, she lives in Room 
Your girlfriend told me he'd been callin' out my name
So let's end this call and end this conversation
Giving you shit, cause something in his life won't fold
The body and face and soul of you is gone down that deep black hole
Ya no confías en nadie 
I'd rather die alone in misery
You make the same mistake
Knocking before passing through the doors
'Til you turn it down to  and 
I know the fiction of the fix
So I made a list of how you're gonna pay
Nor use the voice they use the gun alone
That it's all your fault
Hot enough to pull up to your show and steal your groupie date
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
Don't wanna think about the new armed forces
How I' d like to fly in an airplane
It's not what I gave to you
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you
Well I'm a truth addict, oh shit I got a head rush
It's the news on every channel I watch when I turn on the box
Would it be so hard to understand
I feel it in me, so overwhelmed
It's got nothing
There's no fuckin' way That I'm gonna solve them
Need some blood in the cut
When the first shots were fired
Caged in we break barriers, change to new areas
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
Go ahead, yeah, fuck it up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
This father must die
Get used to the numbness, you won't have to feel that anymore
I'm not ready, but have I gone too far Get stuck in a lie and all you'll hear is "let it go away"
tu non puoi amare un tarlo
Forgot my own mind
Was du denkst was du fühlst  diese große Vertrauen unter Frauen
You're unable to look any further than your nose
I'm gonna piss in her face
How does a man begin  fall
Step back
Can I give you my loss, to feel, to hold close
Comprends, la rage est profonde 
I know them
You don't make or break me baby
There's no such thing as space or time
Reflexlaugh if you wanna
May your death come quickly
Is my voodoo working X
Comprendre cada jugada 
How can you doubt a love
In the neighborhood you thought about repenting
Nigga die slow oh oh oh
Everything that I say could kill it all
We slap tracks and attack like M Bison
But there's nothing in this world, nothing in this world
With my one good arm behind my back
I self medicate with drugs and alcohol to treat my extreme social anxiety
Well the clock's heart it hangs inside its open chest
You think they'd get the warnin'
And war war is the battle cry 
The promise never harvested in fallow fields shall lie
We're innocent
'Cause I don't want you crying when we lay down tonight
Blood beneath their finger nails,
Show pictures you won't see, you'll never know
There's bitches in this building and they all in this section
Sailing cemetery seas after crew leaves and moves on
It's all trueit's all true not good but I know it'll doit'll do
Well, you can tell ev'ryone I'm a down disgrace
I never meant to fall this far
All the men came back from six years' fighting
Pleasantly surprised, I never thought you'd realize that maybe
Oh Baby Why won't you answer me
So what say you and all your friends
His motherfucking ass on a rooftop next tour
See, voting doesn't work 
Diamonds are Fuhrer's best friend
I was intimidated, assaulted, and for what
So the wind that blows across your room
"Can you please open up the back door"
Send a reflection of myself to me
Big shot screaming, "Put your hands in the sky," Tearing out all these open pages 
Nothing matters anymore, at all
But in a society so sick
Outside someone's screaming
'Cause when you're lookin' at pain you're lookin' at truth
What do the old people teach us but how to die die die die 
It's Payback
And I want it bad
It's not happening, it's not happening
Throat fuck your lucky day, the flight of a torn kite
I thank you for making me feel
Yo what the fuck do you mean kick rocks, man
We ask nothing less then settle for nothing more
While river rats fall off the raft and sink
Got a half Armenian girlfriend
Plastic faces suck me dry 
I spread my arms
I wanna hear you say, that you're sorry again
Come on, girls, I wanna see you drinking
I tried to move you
Try to focus, can't discern anything but the motion
Everybody, everybody, everybody livin' now
If you don't live what you sing about
Asleep when the storm troopers come
Live by the gun
Somebody gotta shell 'em
So they put him in chains
For just a crust of bread, watermelon, mirages and oasis that does not exist
My niggaz got my back, in fact
Of this dick that cums lead
I came to do battle
Forgive me I'm rollin' with deamon, I'm devilish
I ain't snappin' my damn fingers to get in the game
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Noise control, I've sunken out
As though a thought stole you away
And blur the questions that no one could ever answer
The more you cry your ashes turn to mud
Kicking me, pushing me, biting me, bruising me,
Check our habitation are we a peace lovin' nation
Climb, but they're not mine
Has all but drowned
And I try but I can't and I want to so bad
I remember when we met
Don't leave me, I'm bleeding,
Another love has reached the end
I want you to listen, son
They said, "We're not going to protect this heart you have"
No man abandon his post A gatecrasher has called us to arms Take up your torch
Ou je reste ici, ou je meurs
Around his neck is where my rope was tied
That red diesel you like
Kickin the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin' to like
And I try to find comfort in the darkness
What about the times you said no one would want me
You don't know who I am I'm not your friend
To get even with my enemies
Singing again, singing again, singing again
Rappin' like the Treacherous Three, fuckin' cowards
You got to make her know how it feels to miss you
When the smoke cleared
Bitch he made me moan
In the end unity will be thrust upon us  lanketed, stipled
Those kids suck, check it out emcee
You say I have a problem
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
Behind the fake family image
Buy this car to drive to work and work until you're fucking dead
It's a dirty game so whatever is effective
Pipes smoking litter in church, valiant and thought provoking
Do you want it 
With the bitchass styles I hit you like Deacon
Filthify and punish your mind
But then I accused you in a way that you've never known
Remember the , pound guy on Long Island a couple years ago, had chest pains, and they had to cut a wall out of the house to get him to the house to get him to the hospital Folks, that's the first sign When you're calling the construction crew before you call the hospital, STOP FUCKING EATING "Look, I'm having chest pains Knock this wall down here Yeah, get a crane and a dumpster to take me to the hospital And then, uh, call ahead to the hospital, get some walls taken out over there, and get me a dozen donuts, cause this fucking virus is killing me, it really is"
From one another, no one should ever come in between us, between us and our love
I'm making good friends with you
I am before before before death is eternity after death is eternity
All of our freedoms are meeting their end
And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists
Exposé a mes façons de faire classé X si trop expert
How fucking romantic
II feel like I'm losin' my mindmind
I don't have no time
All I want is a Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me
I don't mind tying up the phone
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
Always comes back for more
I'm the law and you can't beat the law       
And you can preen and dream and scream and shot
Wack MC's have only one style gun buck
Got us all worked up
I always feel I have to open my mouth
Make you hazy, make you lazy, drive you crazy
That a door slam sends crying into the world 
Disregard for bone and flesh
The ground
Keep spinning, keep spinning, send us off to sleep
No need for police
Feels like the future for you and me, fades in the failing light,
Show a little bit of skin
If I listened to all the snake niggaz that's runnin' they mouth
Why'd you do it, she said, ain't nothing to laugh
So don't fear if you hear
I don't know what I can believe anymore
Who took you for a working whore
I just don't wanna give my life to the fans
Well, I'll bleed on through the night
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons 
The disease
And said "My friend you're not allowed to vote"
So warm in here
It floods with fury, fights and fits
You wanna spar
Fuck R&B and the runnin' man
'Til there are none left and another
Make him shut up, man Stay right where you are 
Dripping with sin
I've got nothing to do but
I've been sleeping
But I know a thing or two
Why'd ya do it, she said, they're mine all your jewels
Listen to the general every goddamn word
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
And the sky was made of amethyst
Lying tricks told them dicks I had a key
And I've realized my crime
What you intend to ignore, but when it cuts back round,
Your pictures on my wall
Without the dirt on your face"
Scorn your mind
I'm back to run this, bitch, I strive to keeping it humble
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
I won't remember
We survived through our loneliest nights
I'll make you feel one second pass
You motherfuckers don't even know do you
To get at the girl that just walked in but she thinks you suck
And I'll learn to take what's mine
Feeding on an open wound kills the pain but I like it yeah I like it
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
Cunts are still running the world,
Voting doesn't work I have seen
Such sweet relief
You bloody mother fucking asshole
And after all I'm glad that I'm not your type 
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Take  shots to the jugular
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
But I don't wanna be illicit 
Tanto non li ho mai avuti, li ho sempre spesi prima di farli
When your hands close tight around my neck,
Apocalypse now
It's run in the family, hey yeah
I've got problems of my own
, pops died, middle of the night
There are ribs in the fireplace
The way you turn your back and then you walk away
Your armor cold, your time run out
I'd have helped you out
Taking flicks around the corner
One drink of water and I'm drowning in it
I keep the things you taught trapped in mind
Get paranoid when you hear my Glock clickin'
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
I have known that nothing's fair
I look back behind at the
They cannot control me
I've been staring a hole in the wall
Like she needs to know
I'll meet you now wherever you are
And for not getting pissed when I humped your girlfriend
I'm proud I'm Australian, whatever that means,
Jammin up the border to this game stop
Puts your name to shame
Don't wanna give them a reason to despise and hate
Never want another wife
Sideways eye on a sinister boundary
Then fall diatonically
Once I swore I would die for you, but I never meant like this
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions fuckin' questions
'Cause you could lose it in a tussle, nigga, watch me hustle
They'd go away now
Make no difference what you say
A faded star of yesterday now toothless and jaded
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other
To hate me for standing there
At my fingertips
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
Sphere of storms in my head
Nigga fuck all your cheddah
Die bitches, bastards brats pests
Better back if you know what's good
I love to hate you
'Cause I'm a liar, a liar, a liar, a liar
Evil, evil, we all know the reason, evil, evil Evil man
I only wanted you, to open up your eyes
Casualties of their own flesh
I feel I'm drowning
And creation and time are made from destruction
Hold on now, hold on now
I know I know
Hey hey yeah, be a bigman or bleed
Wait a minute my TV set doesn't work
You get the message
Fuck your god
Cunts are still running the world
You're saving your face
As long as it agrees with how you feel
I know, but you know why let it go So
Trapped in a psycho disguise
Kick rocks
She's a bimbo playing on the damn phone
He's selling poison by the ton
Write your novel
'Cause that's what a muthafucking monster do
I hate everyone I fucking hate them all
And surrender
Who knows how far I'll fall
My faith is lost again I'd say
And my face was scorched, scorched
Why It makes you feel better
'Cause now I think I'm at your mercy
She came with a warning
Hold no sway with me now she's my intended
The lies derail
And fuck you, fuck you, love you
Nostalgia, well you're using it like a whore
Cast Her dispersions
You are a faker admit it
And I always have remembered, in case you're wonderin'
They have no food but the boy have gun
Into the toilet without faces removed
You've got some nerve to come back here
This means war
Show y'all brothers how you not a gorilla
Can't be real no more, your mask is skin and bone
Don't you know gonna kill, kill your sons
I'm messy, what's that say about you
She's got her perfect friends 
The artist with heart darkness
Hey, who wants to party
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait
It feels good to see freedom excepted
I'm not a discharge
Poison my body and my mind will fail
I'm here to put you through hell
Since I stopped being a seeker
You have enough problems of your own
It's destination unknown, so dive in,
I know she means well, but I was proven wrong once or twice
But thanks to Reaganomics, prisons turned to profits
And where was God when I came to an end
I'm hungry, I'm dirty
Ooh, child, the fear I have
Drugs, liquor, drugs
There was nothing I could do
And promised Christendom in flames
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna
Pick and peel it off, this dried up skin
I'm feeling fine with myself I'm feeling fine with myself
Stay gold
'Cause these damned bluecollared tweekers
I can't stand this anymore
Grazing like hungry cows across the stage or page
We never get respect
I think I sealed my fate
And make me your god
It also sucks we had to share the month of June
But there ain't nothin' that you can do
And I scatter the bits
You confused me in a way that I've never known
I let you fool me
I'll shit on that ho
Uoho, hey now
You wanna bite it
And fuck you for standing there smiling
You greedy fuck you pissed it all away
Dusty and disgruntled and crusty,
There's no reason to change
I'm a climb the game till I'm on the top of it
I feel you looking at me thinking that my happiness
You hate my life
To know that the flame will always burn
You kept running
You may not hear me calling
Tragedy
Won't they give it a rest now Give it a rest now
Y'all niggas is lame, my niggas ain't sane
Hating you should be introduced as a new law
And we want to live
How does it feel to be so high
This is a message from occupied England
But you won't hear a single word I say
I hope they choke
Until we find another space,
So we bend the bracket
Your pretty little ass
Hell fuck yeah
Come on let me shout, shout let me
To whisper words like brother nothin' here is any good
You sell your soul when you sign on the dotted line hoping to go gold
I know you think it's all right
But nobody in it there but me
No doubt girls all out of whack
Sweat, tear, and feed 'cause I don't bleed when I cut no more
Come on honey, don't hesitate now
Who would you want
Do you know what they steal, what they steal from you
You're the black ice on my road to wholesome
The rage of Angels
Just can't remember where I left them
Don't talk to me about being free
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
But we've got no future
How in the hell did I get into this mess anyway
I've got to take my life back
I die up inside her
One time we believed but now we don't even try
I want to smash the faces
I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that
These watching, plotting minions of the lower God scene
How am I supposed to sing
These people disagree but I don't listen to 'em though
One day is now
Insult you like a fool
Backstabber, backstabber
You made for a bad lover's liver
You have no direction and you have no protection
Now I know, now I know now I know, now I know, know
Is it because you're a fucking 
Too much guessing, too much "need to believe" 
Some people look at me and talk about me like a clown
Tearing the epidermis from your skin
Do you know how they prey, how they prey upon you
I will not put on a smile
While you handpicked motherfuckers givin' up transcripts
Are you living in a rat race
I had a good home but I left
And that's real from the motherfucking Bush Killa
Makes me sick when I hear all the shit that you say
 No no no no
I don't know if I could trust or if I could sits on my shoulder hell no
A knife for the girls who want to come home for just one night
While you're sleeping
Si on a l'malheur de l'ouvrir, elle sera nous faire taire 
You have to act like you're someone Forfeit the game
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
I turn into the wind
Poets gonna take control
To drive me mad
Adrenaline is the lubrication, focusing my mind
And filled up our garden with snow
Why you and not me
New excuse, ain't thought of mine
And feel the fury of these tears
I wear the scars to show my shame
Straining my bowels, fucking hungry hippopotamus
Suck, suck, suck
I try to extend the line 
I thought that was protocol
I can see the end
I taste it now
Yeah, you're living a lie yeah living a lie yeah you're life is living a lie
Nobody gets close, nobody dares
Can't explain the way that I feel
Fuck this and fuck that
It's murda, please believe
You're different from the rest, sister
Whisper "I know who you are"
Can't you fuckin' see
Like rockets from the crypt spilling the festive morning beverage of your preference,
Beat the shit out of someone so you can get paid
It's getting colder, it's too cold
Bullshit I bet you say there ain't no Allenwood PA
All my friends are broken, too
Stomp Box speak my thought
And for you girls who be up in the club innocent age with a fake ID
Their wisdom so profound to cheat us of our ground
No forgiveness you're no martyr
You take two steps back
I'm not all right, but I'm OK
Little wolf skin boots
You promised to give your family a break
And publicly disgraced
We'll get it back again
Down that hall comes the end of my world 
Then wanna ride who
Say you want to leave 'cause this relationship failin'
I can get with this and I can see it all now
Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized
At least I cannot see them
Here I'll scream with you, "Ah, somebody help"
I could be the million that you never made
But you know
Used to believe in revolution, realized I was the only one
Oh you know, the usual, not much How you doing
You can say I have a bogus mind
How can you run when you know
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
You wore that cross so well
And in the bare workshop they'll be molding plastic into little prosthetic limbs
I can make it go away I can make it disappear
Don't gimme that noise
Woman like a man, like a man, like a woman like a man, woman like a man
Peep the break down If tapes cost  ,
What I feel when I'm playing guitar
The substance assimilating to watch the bodies burst into a string of lights
And give him two from the barrel of a black guerrilla P Dog
Sad to say it's over now
It's like there's nothing there to lose
With my arms around your chest,
I'm talkin' greed
I can't accept my fate
Let her know you're swapping sides
I remember, yes
See my thoughts  and see my scars see my clothes  I dress to kill
But American made
Lying half dressed
To take what's mine
Concrete nigga, that's my reality
Business men and money spinners rape the earth for gain
Because you stole all my friends
Don't try to understand me
Hah hah hah  hello
It's never ending, I jus wanna stand out
Where is god 
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
Then I won't say faith, isn't made for me
Just it's all you want
You need some pleasin' your love I'll be squeezin'
I knew I shoulda chose a life of crime
I made this for you
Husband, I could not abstain
And sugar land express what you know it
Should I bend down and worship the ground
If you wanna sleep with me and talk about existence
You wanna get fucked inside out
Someone gave a fuck Tyler
The face card, mimic of an actionfigure
Evil demon, quit while you're even, evil, evil Evil man
I want a feeling, worth paying for before I say goodbye
It's like I just can't get shit right
And lately being mindful of the babies I admit
He leaves his father's grave and his birthright
They nearly break their backs
Because I feel the strain
And when you wake from the shell of this body
Where a ghost was calling me
We thought that everything
The world is sleeping, I am numb
I'm gonna work the straw
With straps and chains, we slap you in there
I want some
Is enough to decide that some things
Hoe I only tell you once that this dick ain't free
How to sustain myself in storms
And we'll keep moving faster till you scream
Cnote rockin' in a pocket
And if I don't fit your plan then set me free
I said suck, suck suck
Is it straight enough
You gotta bullet in your fuckin' head
Run trains on, golddiggers beware these fo' niggaz
This isn't a game, but I will pretend
But you won't burn long
I'm maybe someone you've never met from across oceans changed over night
I'm the worst of the best, but I'm in this race
Drew a line between love and hate
Bad milk runs in your gorge
Out across the city
Don't need you to say we suck
Oh what a shame
I'm just a cloud watching the moon rise
It's a blessing and a curse
Into the life of lithesome Juliette Bell
 dispatch can you please run by your address for me
I'm left with a problem now
Start a roit in this Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch x
How do I mend my heart when I feel so low
Your mouth is like an open sore
And now I'm
I know, but you know, why let the feeling  show it son
And your daughter's got nut stains on her back
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
You can beg all you want but you gets jack shit
Those downtown hoods are no damn good
I start to sink where I stand,
Miles of flat neon spelling wellknown names
And it leaves you with an empty feeling
If fire is the passion I only aspire to be free
A reduction of their stance to some kind of earthly hell 
Take this I control it
War Ooh, ohoho now
I can't stop
It's THE SOUL EATER  mic bleeder with the voice of chaos
I know I'm not alone and I really want to leave
Through the veinses of the fiends,
And it makes me feel so sorry
You burn me inside, so I put you in your place
To keep from noticing my mind going blank
Shut up, smart little bitch, I don't need lies
Disseminated decay of my death
You'll take away all that I'm asking for
I've been working in the fields
Than I ever thought that I could be, baby
God is Going to get sick of me
I never been on the receiving end
He ran into my knife ten times
I cannot take it, I cannot take it
And you didn't see the rain you didn't feel my pain I was left inside with no complaints and with lies you feed these fuckin' guys
And your parents hate me 'cause I love you
I've found the easy way to die
I can sleep at night
This school's a living hell
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
Police I'm sayin' fuck you punk
She stares at him so madly 
Darling, I fell like a god
I knew a man who hung drywall
 it's life, death and I can't think of a better way to end the day
They're right on the money
Evil thoughts is creeping through my mind
Love is not safe in a world filled with hate
It's hard to talk with your dick in my mouth
Oh my God all the noise inside my head
You're not the same 
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Reagen plays the liar  power's his desire, there's nothing for the world we can do
Feel my with for I am the dark
There's nothing left in it
NO you're on drugs
Unemployment rising fast
Before he has a chance to get in the driver's seat
Talk your shit like my life is some kinda game
Who we gonna look to now
Nigga wheneva my bitch, fuck that my sister
Now I know you're having fun
I had happiness and now I'm just about
I'll surrender to it
Smiling in their faces
A passing phase of quiet indignation
Except fuck you
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
For nothing that'll rock the boat
Eres un artista y no un guerrillero,
Baby no half stepping
Like a bad pill, like a sick thrill
Fuck the motherfuckin' district attourney and the prosecutor fuck you
You can't fool me with that crap just leave me alone
There is no milk
Pump this shit
How the fuck could you do this to me I'm sorry
I was in my room and I was like just sitting there staring at the wall thinking about 
The lines are down, drowned by the hum of the radiator
No matter what I do, how hard I Try
We'll tear your heart right out or your chest you're already dead 
He likes killing you after you've died
Slumped in the back Burn bush by the son of George
Oh my god, someone kill me
You're in violation, you cross the line
And I feel so sick my life
One more time before the feeling fades
I don't wanna be up or down
We have no sympathy for the lost souls
'Cause these damned bluecollar tweekers
 times the pain
Now I'm done but before I go I want you to know 
Everybody thinks they know me
People like you just burn
Still in love with all your sins
U whinin' like a bitch
mieluummin kun olisin ollut massamurhaaja
The conference hall rings to the standing ovation
Mess with the Cube, you get punked quick
A couple of drinks on the house an' he said
And I can't help but feel pain
To the grave from the cradle we don't rock anymore
I snapped "who's that dude", I don't even know his name
Give me a reason to purify my mind 
It ends with me
'Cause you're a fat fuckin' drunk piece of shit
I want to take you in my arms so I can give you my heart
Well if you'll be my enemy
Writing in the grave of the polls
As far as real niggas, bitch nigga my battle's sick
Ich werde nicht fragen
I make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
Spawned from eternal semen bred flesh predators
He feels so damn obvious that he must be glowing
I told her she was killing me and
All your friends got behind my back
In bed she flexes her knees to try and abate the feeling 
Innocent and never suspectable
Watching as the scars fall from your eyes
Pretending your war
To put an end to their lives
I stopped trainin and turning up  matches
So they can get all the money they can when it's released
Make troubles then I blow off suckers then
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
And I don't want to see you fall too far away
You are the one at stake, you are at fault
There's no doubt about it
Spitting on all that make us sick
Hello, this is Bushwick, motherfucking Bill
NOW now I'm God
Nothing matters anymore
Take my fucking conscience from me 
She failed me over and over again no surprise there she was never a friend
And it feels so good to be on top of you
I will burn your love letters in a parking deck
I offend someone
They don't care, and that's not fair
It figures the wheezing will measure your rate of depress and I hope you know
That I sold  Cutco knives to afford, but whatever, hey, it's cool
But kill me first
They cannot take my life
I try to hide but can not find
Never thought twice about holding your tongue
I just can't stand the things you do;
But I was innocent to what they done to me
No I can't believe it's coming true
Everybody wants to make it happen
The will to deny and I'm standing in the dark all over again,
Hitech weapons are here to reassure it
I'ma leave how I came screaming covered in blood
I sleep to dream and dream of sleep
Cause nothing matters anymore 
Ah, it's time to pack up and move to the next town
I lived a life with no regrets till you came around
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
What double up, y'all gotta feel us
The art of killing poetry
Do you hear the sirens scream across the city
So I showered down, left my little room
Did he buy your heart with visa, or his platnum master card
So I want to kill this waitress
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
They all can see him, they know where he's going
I'll be your noise
Some of them end up in some six foot hole
Just make your body burst into single line
And I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Like my guns dirty and hands clean
When all we need is something true to believe
Now what I spit, it's medicine for the sick
You spend your time sitting in circles with your friends
It's certain tragedy
With tears that flooded your heart
Little bitch ain't a genie in a bottle of glass
Look at these niggae with attitudes
I want you for my wife
Creates another fiend
Without your plastic friends
There is no tie
Or shut me up, because it won't work
Let's get this party jumping, let's see some  chugging
It's like a fucking drug deal
All the lies deceit and arrogance
When we ride  on our enemies
Die bastard, die bastard, burn
I'm never coming back
I wanna do you favors
All your blood 
When I got to break you off some
Wake up cold
If anybody do she know how we flow
The bird, the melodies she play
So you know I'll be waiting in the dark
They're the crime
One way or another
Around me, hypocrites, and I know them
I've got this feeling deep inside,
I'm runnin' out of room
You, a cavalier
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Ya running the race again
The end is growing near
Burning candl, e blackened malice
We'll drink and dance the night away, drink and dance the night away
My heart bleeds believe in every dying breath
Far from the places we used to talk about
I did not design this game
With teeth
Look around you, is this what you want
Can I hold grudges Mind saying "let it go, fuck this"
And if you leave me now
Destroying my body and my mind will fail
Before the veil could part our embrace
 dispatch ma'am
Now lift up your fuckin' dress, where's the rest
I realized my idea was wrong, dangerous and foolish
And I know your coming backwards
You gave him your blood and your warm little diamond
We got highschool kids running 'round in Calvin Klein and Guess
So stupid now you're crying your eyes out he's long gone and you're trying to find out
We'll go to the pagoda
And I won't stop 'til I fix your misleading
That's why I wanna break free 
I am not the one to be played with
Just another particular deal
They stand and laugh as they watch you crumble
My toys were my friends
Oh, you know how to take a man and crush him
I've been in Paradise, don't want to go back
For the vibe in the back of his jeans
Thuglife niggaz I'm out on bail
You pass on to me
Sure enough you know who's gonna
It's got me fiending for the fire
The Lord knows,
The drive the idea still existing 
I play the shit out of the drums
Move closer or drive further
Niggaz hit me I'ma turn into the crow *caw caw* and take a shit
Now you know "Now you know"
Love and sex and loneliness
'Cept the planet that we own and its playing nd fiddle
But that isn't true because everyone knows
Just one touch she passes out on the street
They made you the enemy
Pretend it works a while you don't try
God hates god kills god slays
Nothing says charm like an armored car taking the clonefarm 'tards to the arms bazaar,
In my glass coffin, I'm waiting
Line your lungs with noise then just sew it up
Music has another dimension
Listening to Bob Dylan singin' in 
When the sound of shredding vocal chords is what I want to hear
So you better not come alone
An ounze of that shit sittin' in your motherfuckin' lac
I will watch you while you're sleeping
This fire will burn
Mother fuck a war
When he gets out, we're one hell of a team
I'll take a knife to 
I ain't fuckin' with it
And niggers know I'm blowin' up shows like a terrorist
I will never break don't lie, x
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you see a devil down
It's strange 'cause I feel the same way
Then me and my friends
Leave me feeling ill at ease
I'll make you bleed
To fleshcolored Christs that glow in the dark
Cause all I wanna see is motherfucking brains hanging
That it was her life and stay the fuck out of it
Said, they pack the , they fire it at the prime time
And all this empty space that you create does nothing for my flawless sense of style"
Execution needed, a bloody vessel for your peace
And all this tension back and forth
Wild 'cause you left me here
Go away always in my fucking space
This is the new fucking millennium BRAND NEW AGE
Pivot when we visit, spit victim if you stand there
Oh oh, you backstabber Hope grabber 
In this fire we burn
And it's colder
When there's nowhere left, this crutch is broken
Feel the pain
As I'm made to
I am just so sick of thinking my head is broken
To fight the war on drugs
I know in an instant I could lose everything I'm working toward
I'm�just�a�thirdrated�star�covered�in�blood
While you were licking your lips
Every night before I sleep
Not a scratch, not a dent
A bullet in your head
Wild wild wild wild X
Ooh, baby it ain't enough
Sick, sick
And her eyes have the surprising effect of rendering me restless
That's my place, give it back
The birds still sing
Love in the middle of a fire fight
I'm getting sick of it
You trusted the devil
I'm always around you to show that I care but I don't know what for
Until you're somebody and then they want to be your friend
They fucked us all 'cause they wanted to
And the other kids hated me
So involved in all the wrong fights
I wanna feel you, feel you, feel you
Somebody as guilty as me can break this spell
I don't know, it's just the way I am
We americans love guns
Bitches  all in the back, they knees waitin' to buckle
Status malus, vana salus, semper dissolubilis
Now I understand why she gets up after sundown
Niggaz resigning, now master
Like nine fricking hours and fortyfive minutes now
I keep calling but nobody listens
They must of thought id never remember to pass to it
Decide what's right or not  I know
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assist
You are so fucking paranoid
He wants to pour you a drink
Welcome back to the start
It's unbelievable what they'll put you through
The  I put in to stop the brown bag smelling smelling
But all that stands in the way is
'Cause the devil borrowed my clothes just for tonight
Now I'm dealing with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian
That skin will get numb
Looking for a wall to kiss
The memories that you select
When all you're going to do is just pretend
Penetrate the clouds, loud, and obnoxious
Kill that man, kill that girl, kill anyone you want today
Credit cards and memories all dumped into the sea
I will drive past your house
You and I are like when fire and the ocean floor collide
But I can't help what I feel
Like some, some Imagined warrior production
Little bitch got lost in her own confusions
I fell in love with my enemy
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
Once upon a time, there was this group of dusty ass motherfuckers
I'm being dragged down, for how long I don't know
Everybody will know your name
And I think you suck
Sunday morning it's the same bullshit
Hoping to hell someone's forgiven his crimes
With the help of the president 
Are you ready to face the Doom
Well evil in your eyes baby I don't care
I'm a kid with a vision runnin' a label
I'm standing up, Headstrong, In control of my life
Its time to let you know that
Cal state, no fun
Keep you away, 'cause now I'm building
Hate to bleed but it heals my pain
In each stranger's face
The sun was setting on a golden photo op
In da back of a cell
Short, sharp, bloodlust reality
Denied our movement
No bodies felt like you
They press auto, and you kill it with an automatic
I'm too sore from fitting exactly to ride into setting suns aching to
Just my luck, the bitch got us both touched, it's like a rush
So I surrender to impulse
Would you turn on the light and come down
I feel it coming slowly
I'm singing this song
And to kill another child of the flag
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
And it's been a while, I'm a little annoyed
And if I made a perfect world you'd be gone
Sono andate, sparite 
Croaking its drama across an orchestra of friendly faces,
This bitter drink
We thought for one instant we forgot our gun
Everyone is sleeping under one tonight
Minus the text in the language of ghosts
I got the face of a million strangers
You're not walking away until your heart is torn, our tears are reborn
I make the beats that boom boom boom in they trunks
Staring in the trees, paranoid, are gone in the breeze
Someone to understand this misery
So the mind can fake it
Ask the angels while they're falling 
And knock it off the hinges now
Everything around you turned to silence
By focusing closer
Your surlyass uncle, counting dirty cash
Wolf Gang Fuck everybody else nigga
The empty movements
It won't kill me
Grazes my skin
I've never felt your grace, understand
I gotta know the truth
I care but I am close to the edge
And it hurts to keep learning the same lessons in pain
See who's the champion pace coming down break you fall
Blow a motherfucker to smithereens
I lay on my back taking shit from you
And told him to kill that man
The hammer and sickle
Too bad you had to have a better half
No hot water, no toilets, no lights
As the shells just kept on falling
And don't be sensitive and angry at the shit that I wrote
He sees the family home now, looming in his headlights
Hard life is hard as hell, better back the fuck on up, 'cause this is
Ain't a god damn thing
Our real selves take a back seat behind the pomp and the façade
It's a breakdown, a breakdown
With the clouds that fall with poison
I know exactly how this works
I have when I'm dead I'll rest
Mean it, or seen it, to feel the reason in your mind
If that's what you wanted to hear
It feels so good to knock things down
Beg and steal and lie and cheat, d'uh
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds, toilets clogged
Versace on your back sideways and il
I'm sorry I really need to take this Hello
Throw you in a choke  gun smoke, gun smoke
I fuck yo ass up fuck him up
The gunshots in the class
I don't know who told you that but it's a lie
Oh shame, shame on me
And there's just one more thing that, I have just got to sing ya
I know that it never goes away
That blows up spots like Supernova
And when the money comes in for the work I do
And a good place to shoot from
Why are you falling falling
Men with stamina or money on the plate
What's the matter if they're crazy till you hear what I've said
For the last living rock king
What I want from you, is empty your head
And if I haver, whatever the fuck that means
You can bump your gum
Ladies know how it feels All my ladies know how it feels
Taste the wealth of hate in me
But it's ok we've got old blood and our hair is woven to the same hotel again
But keep gettin' money
ne sanoi lapsi on sekaisin
Crawling broken my face is
I'll hittem with tha bum rush
My mother ain't have a job, poppy was on his grind
You will know my name
So far away, I don't want to stay
Ah, this thing's run amok, this luck
Don't move, don't breathe
You woulda jumped him too
Wired over the thoughts I've dialeddialed
Future of a gerbil up ass of masochist, that's my word up
Taught not to bite the hand that feeds
From the guys that's running the show,
Out beyond the edges in the depths of spirit land
Honey from the movies, south notch cutie
I master the rhythm like heartless ambition
And there I stand in the middle, and I was
Brothers from the bayou, so why you wanna trip
Can there be another outlet
Our lives run different ways
I know it's sad
Would you help me to get out
Yeah, when I'm gone the weight falls on me
You can hang out with your friends, that is if you had any friends
You, you, you oughta know
So doctor won't you pull the fucking plug Won't you cut the cord
I was half the naked distance between hell and heaven's ceiling
I'd disappear under a bush
Je ne prononcerai
Scriptures on the wall
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide
Were not afraid
There is nothing you can do
Hmmm, what you talkin' 'bout punk
Jesus fucking fucking Christ
A life of regret in a rock and roll band
Looking back at the words you said
You know ya need it all
You cannot take it
Unable to express the pain of your distress
Take what's yours, Walrus's of the night, take your prey, with tusks bared in the burning light,
