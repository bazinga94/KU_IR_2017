I go home
I knew that I'd found you
Won't you just give me a chance"
Our hearts speak the same word, the same word
She lay under the midnight moon
Darkening the sun
He stands there, an empty stare, trying to make enough money for his cab fare home
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet
This is the room where we always dreamed of grass and splendid evenings
And I'm quite alright hiding tonight
Where flowers turning crane their fragile necks
We need it all
I threw a rock at a crow who was playing in the mulch of some rosebushes by the motel office
In ways I always thought were new
Tearing the very heart of me
It was never to you
Dying to get away
You lie down on the roof and watch the sun rise
Then we can jump and pretend we disagree
Can you look at the truth
Maybe next year I'll be good
So now we will rejoice
And bring his victims here
You're making it worse now every time you womanize
You can say no, to being a man hoe
You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind
Hand me your head 
By the way
The way our shelter moves above
'Cause I was made for loving you
To the holy water
Baffled by the lies we blamed
The one that I loved, wouldn't stay by my side
Drug in by the reign, of the crooked ways I think
And the Wallflowers CD ended half an hour ago
Together we shall roll until we die
And there ain't no place to hide
Internationally fashioned eternally
And in these times that we're apart
Like remnants and doubt from yesterday
As the music swells somehow stronger from adversity
When do I call my feelings on their bluff
She's been falling
Crying in the night
You won't matter anymore
I'll come right back for you, for you
Maybe it was the rain
No, the blue one
The butcher waits for someone's desperation
Underneath stormy skies
Don't get that face lift as a result
Please Mr Lostman �れ�全�だ�う
For the ignorant inclination, 'cause when there's nowhere
If you leave I'll still be close to you
Who would take my word
There's something I'm ready to say
You're still holdin' on to them days when everything was about you
From the street, rock radio plays Crimson and Clover over and over
While the telephone rings
You need not to reach for the stars
Stinging and older, asleep on pins
By saying, "I love you" and nearly meaning it
Down by the water and the tide keeps rising
I'm wasted on you
This is a place where I feel at home
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
Days can be lonely
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean
Tugging on the string, a travelin' thing in my soul
Ne plaisantes pas avec mon art
Find the hand that fits the glove
Like an eagle testing her wings
To the wind
Everything you need to be
Cold, on my mind, yeah
Found himself involved in a sea of blood and bones,
Somewhere in the rubble there's a flame
State of dreaming
And begin to relax
Nothing is quite what it seems
There's something in your ways, that makes me wanna stay here for a thousand years
Red and blue city lights
Is there something I'm doing wrong
You thought you had enough
When everybody says no, no, no,
In your eyes
She got a lightskinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Faith is true, she knows the way 
Now we can be together
Yah, She's my butterfly butterfly butterfly
My brother is gone
Sell our little home
And when you call me from the other side
But it doesn't mean I didn't make it hard to carry on
I know everything is all right
Holding down my feelings
And I barely really know your name
That says "where were you last night"
Until their toes are cold
And then it all came back
But I'm going Island hopping again
But something's got to give
When it feels right
While you hold mine I cannot wait
Drive wherever the roads will take you to
Get a voice, don't get a doctor
Copenhagen, you're the end,
That shit goes on forever
If mountains crumble to the sea, there would still be you and me
And I won't feel like this forever
There's not enough years underneath this belt
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
con tus tantos dulces besos repartidos 
It's been two years since then I think
No need, at all
In das die Sehnsucht sich begab
Because it happened in a remote parking lot in Las Vegas
And you accepted as fact Behold a white horse with you on it's back, A bow in your hand, a crown through your hair
So say it again
Blue skies smiling at me
To work out all these troubles and what there is to gain
Changed all the things that have made me Entertaining, thoughts are raining
And realized that our lives aren't so bad
Holy water cannot help you now
Wonderful
In llamaland there's a oneman band
I'll be around
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked
And every kiss is a goodbye
May we meet again in another life
To be in command
And they both wheeled their barrows through streets broad and narrow
But you're young and in love
Don't go looking for him lady,
I pretended there was hope for you and I
Away from red to black
For all leaves and winds
But I'm looking up the skirts of the stars
"Free ride New Orleans
All will wash away
House lift up, trees lift out
That's my shot, that's my shot, that's my shot yeah
In your dreams when the smile now comes
Who are trying to bury me
And it's all right
I try to run away
Open your mouth
Keeps coming back to it his voice in echo chorus
I gave my hand 
Were all in my mouth
Given away and now she is tired
When we made love to each other
You with the sad eyes
Tunnel and sky collide
'Cause I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee
That will come to part us
And from the people come the power
Now I'm standing here alone too late to cry
Unusual people
This city swells up like a symphony
Or some song that's full of lies
But I don't know what is to say it
When from nowhere my eyes fell onto a girl
But did I see some value there, or am I going blind
And it feels so free
But there's no time, just stitch us up so we'll keep 
Well maybe two is better than one
Another top up for a change
When my legs no longer carry
I hope you find what you're looking for
'Cause you were hangin' with him and I got something to say, I love you all the same
But your lottery touch feels lucky enough
At each and every corner
And in these winds came a change
You better practice happiness
Isolation will cradle the lies
If you wanted me you would just say so
Manchild in wood
EvaIvaOvaAvaline
And talk about how the love never dies
And if so I hope it left a sunny day through your window
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
Music stops and the spell broken
And The trouble with the straight and the narrow
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
I can be the right notion in the meantime,
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
And no amount of tears can bring it back round till it comes again
Love in the morning with this halo all one size
Refaire la chose que je préfère
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
December come to me
Hinter jeder Bewegung
Mwol guri mangsorinyago guge guri oryobnyago
And I'll promise to fight the wind and waves for you
Sure we'd met in another time and place met in another time and place
On my way right now
Her heart is full of kindness that she's
And When you find your heart, you'd better run with it
And I still hold your hand in mine
If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan
Though I am the reason
Stairway so unclimbable,
I got, I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
In a world full of lies
They've got a dog she named Trey
I know the place you left
Ora il tempo è un signore distratto è un bambino che dorme
All the cuts and bruises suffered in whose name
Or is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
For leaving them when the sun comes up
And under the water you scream so loud
Sorry you won't fit inside my heart
Experience brings,
Like your hair and your face and your smile
Then rent a husband to keep her for life
Minutes later we came back
Why don't we just sit back and enjoy the silence for a while
No need to argue
City bird, haven't you heard
I could get intoxicated just by looking in your eyes
Put it aside for his family His dream
When I drive
Like a pendulum
If the road I travel goes bad
Baby, I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright
I say it silently
Countless have fallen before
Each drop of rain 
I wouldn't say that he spent his time driving over
In the mirror staring back at you
And time is come and gone
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Ja sem nenhum sinal de amor
We don't know anything
And you wonder when you wake up will it be all right
Is worth more than diamonds and precious pearls
The river is deep and the road is long
Silent from a night so cold
And if we had to talk, what could we say, sitting side by side
'Cause ten years ago we all strived to be twentyfive
To say you don't understand
And checking what mirrors don't see
Because you're young
My soul is weak, 
As the moon rose
Oh, nothing left to find
You're tall and you are skinny
What time is it
You're onnly lyin' to yourself 'cause it's evident in the proof
It ain't a case of no one cares
Across your heart, across your mind
You'd help me find my way
My attends to you
The pressure I know you feel
'Cause I know where it began, and my heart still pounds twice as fast
Then you must lift your head, keep it there
A broken heart and he doesn't even know
My verses stand gawping a bit
Nahnahnahnahnahnah brave new world
A lesson lost again
Makin' sense of it, we hustle for change
So I pull my collar up and face the cold
I know exactly how you feel
Hairy lung
What have I done
And heaven is the whole of the heart
You make me want to cry
Her beautiful heart is drowned in grief
I love the way you dress
At the shyness that surrounds us
But I still act surprised
Two words
Now they're cold and dark and gone
Still singin' his tune
Oh how we'd fly
And together they planted flowers of warning, fearing frost
Come on and show the world the you inside
All day long she's with me every day
In every skyline
Trying to set this trouble and problem free
My world is turning too fast
I want the finer things in my life
Gazing dreamly at the door
The angel rides with hunchbacked children, poison oozing from his engine
Well I wouldn't want to ruin something I couldn't save,
And I'll take you, ooh ooh
Invite our friends
But till then no, Daddy, don't be surprised
An angel kissing on a sinner
All der Kleinkram neben meinem Bett 
If I could see you one more time
There's a word in your eye
Do you remember baby, last September
Under the waves, now that I'm giving up
I've been living underground,
We got sandwiches, chips and cold Gatorade
It's just it's nothing so simple 
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
Oh my army of lovers
I never needed words, I never needed hurt,
I am, yours to mind
I do a whole lotta lookin'
A mother told me just before she died
Do sleep securely free from love or hate,
A helping hand or a kiss goodbye, to ease it on it's way
This Butterfly Effect
When you thought I'd looked away 
'Cause I've been drinking all night
And we knew what time we had
One false move, baby 
I wanna be there, it's out of your mind
To be me ooh ah ooh ah
When you grow up, what kind of person will you be
Now darling what are you thinking
Let's start living life
You do it every other day
Under the covers I'm okay I guess
And some roads only bend
I feel like a prize asshole
That it was her heart that he was stealing
For my bones have found a place to lie down and sleep
Some are dreamers
I'll miss dreaming with you
My eyes open wide
Some make exhaustion a mode of expression
Here I am all alone
So every lonely night, I sing this song
Way home
And then you kill them, yeah
And the battles you lost and your bitter defeat
Drinking cocktail wine or cottage cream and passing strangers' cars
Each time you come to town
Why are they falling
The weight of my words
Wie soll ein Mensch das ertragen
Today is the only day
Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh but when we dance
Pretend that we're both older than we seem
Hit the jackpot rolling through a pipe dream in a knot
Just a slob like one of us
Some depart but a lot come too
It's everything
Their melancholic overtones
There's no one doing it for you
And all the while I clung heavy to your back
In a way I am free
I think y'all love me, but y'all place other rappers above me
Oh, please fulfill me
That's some sad soul to keep
To my people doin' time
And though I didn't know it then
Wearing stonewashed denim again, straighten
One tiny, tiny move
You run the disco infiltrator on down
If rap was the block or spot, I'll be potent product
Like apples from a wild tree
I will commit 
Da wurden sie füreinander zur Medizin
The orange was the size of a watermelon to me
No car wreck, suicide,
In the cold light
What day is this
Eric B man looking like touchitheshootme
Moving cross the land
But you already know that because you used to crawl in bed with me in the morning before work
And I would not have you walking through this world
And they'd, and they'd get themselves a hair cut
Yeah, that shares no resemblance to that at all
Speak Cat got my tongue
In present pain
Forget about the world tonight
Their mouths all shouting asphalt and their bodies torn apart
So if the world ends, I hope you're by my side
Of your heart
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Lets just forgive and let this child
Come to me tenderly in the June night
Falling in love with some back lighted stranger
I'm yours forever and a day
Not a man alive you owe a thing
To some foreign land 
He puts his red coat downstairs
Without ever going home
While the present shatters all around you
And I called you back to a place beside me
And in the moment I knew you back
Ich verschwende Deine Zeit
But what I can't carry is my love for you
Blue, because I'd still have sad days
Spinning your umbrella over your head
I said don't get upset 'cause it's not a catastrophe
Up above the clouds, it is always a blue sky
Pounding on the earth and yanking at her hairs
I won't live if you died
It's been seven days without a word
Our screaming in the willow tree
Singing right with mine
Some bloodstains on your shoes
Nobody knows where they are going
The rain came again, cleaning the dream
'Cause I don't want to end it
Busy talking, busy talking
Come back here now 
Don't try to understand
Every day will be a holiday
I stay
What are we if we're not in love
What did you do
Rain drops bouncing off the leaves
Am I lost in a world
That only love can blind
No matter how strong
It says
We'll find someday
You're not the kind that gets out of your head
You must have loved
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Nothing has transpired
I was drunk again, causing accidents
And sometimes I feel you
Det kan tänkas men han
My shadow played a bass clarinet
Open my eyes and I'm next to you
I'm never alone, I wish they'd leave me be
And the heart keeps bringing you home to
It brings me closer to the place I fear
The moment soon will pass
Someone I would call now
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue
She's crying as you're climbing down your claim
And I want you to know that you'll always get your way
Then close his eyes
Can't hide another smile
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
We can forget all this
With a melody that climbs and then falls, then falls, then falls
So maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
All hands up, salute the Empire State 
Yeah, I'm a young man with an old school, girl
Cause your eyes tell me the truth
Vet hut, Fredrik Åkare, skäms gamla karln
A million times, my private gang
You'd help me find my way
Until the very end
This is a place where I don't feel alone
And tell the whole world there's anger in all of us
And at every light where the roads will cross 
Yes, I'm on my way, yeah, I'm on my way
It boils and boils and leaves you dry
Oh you'd have my heart
Put your hand in the oven there's A heaven in side
Your heart already knows
To let all of the love
Trace it if I could, but it won't be understood
Meant to go 'round in pairs
But we're all just an end to a simple thing
So don't ever don't ever, don't forget
And your eyes tell me we've made a mistake
And all the world is green
The light color in the room
But I'm doing all the best I can to leave this nowhere land
After you die after you die
When the clouds move in
Your image did deceive me
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
Under your trees I forget about me
Saddled my thighs around your hips like ropes
Someone, much better
All of the good things, good things
But then again how come my shoes are so light
And I'm screaming for the breath
Lying here with you reminds me of those days
Without the courage to give a new thing a chance
Till all the pieces scattered
That time won't heal a broken hearted me
vereinte die Macht der Liebe die beiden,
I was too Busy staring at you
You are so hot
She always belonged to someone else
Oh water that had kept me alive
How many eggs make up a pound
Through a land we didn't know
Aishiteimasu *
I'm talkin' 'bout your tear drops
Fighting back the tears
Every time I think of you
Dave, w "on fire" being sung by Jian and Mike
And it's painful
It's just full of thoughts that act as souvenirs
From dry land, he rolled it over to wet sand
I za was, i za siebie 
Everything's confused, harmlessly untrue
With their prairs, and loaded guns
I think I'll go home and cry
It's not over till it starts again
Such sad eyes
You're gonna be the one that saves me
So sing along street children
What is there left to say
You're so flat and one dimensional
There's mending for my soul
Now she's waiting at the stoplights
And I've seen the ones that come get reduced to bones and rags
Still I continue
Sometimes I wonder why,
You wrote me a song
And the girl that I love is on the other side
I remember what you wore on the first day
Everything's cluttered and pretty
Haunting figures around me
It's so funny, we went down to the store
Will the sunlight heal the core of your body
And where the rails end
Memories got spilled without shame
Don't be scared it's over now, I swear
I hope you find what you are looking for
You not just in dreams
And when my party's over
Everybody's happy
Sur ta voix son corps dansait
That if you take away the sunshine
My mind's hallucinating lucidity
oder nur im Kreis
And he thinks "What the hell
Too young to fall
Ten feet tall in this an empty space
Maybe I'll see you in another life,
I think I need a big vacation
But now times led my mind astray, something was changed along the way
Your mysterious eyes cannot help you
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
In spring they lie flat at the first warmth
The strength of a tree begins in the roots
Daylight dreamer
And everything matters for a second as we fall to the floor
There is a growing golden light
All my friends say I'll survive
'Cause she was there boy when nobody cared who you were
Sexless and comfort in your mind
Do I kiss him
We do a whole lotta laughin'
It'd be better to forget you
But fate is cruel sometimes,
And it can't be stopped
I see the crowds running,
Create wonderful dishes
When I ask her what she means, she says I ought to know
I need to find an engine for my car
Call out my name, when you call I'll be there
I'll wear my sword at my side x
No, you can't do a thing to stop me
Do you know where your love is
You're the ruler of my heart
Go east on Sunrise Highway 
The days whispered and shouted
Faces come out of the rain
And someday I had lost you
Singing such sweet rhythm and blues
And after the winter broke
Gave myself in that misty light
Your denial still persists
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
Trying to find a fact to frame a fully righteous fire
Go to sleep my little man
Brain's a square of grass
I was too Busy staring at youInto your eyes Getting wood for the fire
Without you I'd die
There I could feel
Give me a boat that can carry two
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
Smacked up again behind the door
Long days filled with sunshine
Only a few things
The Earth swings
Behold the pale horse got me trapped like R Kell, I bail and it
Smokin' pill and lovely too
I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone
So alive though our wolves might talk about it every day
Take me back to the days gone by
You hold it in your hands
This darkness will turn to light
The whole time
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
There is nothing left of my nerves
I'm looking out for an ambush
And gets herself lost
If it was my last day here on earth
She'll watch you drink yourself to death
A lifetime melts away
They search us out wherever we are
Like a sound of love and peace on Earth
I've been scolded for stealing 
In times of trouble, your words have helped pull me through
And I know it's getting late
The darkest light before a darker night
And I keep on wandering
Take time look at the sunshine
So the bartender who tends to pretend that he's concerned
Our eyes met as you passed me by passed me by
How can the light that burned so brightly
And it looks so alive
Oh, you live till you breathe,
I feel the sickness taking over me
Thinking about you, baby
A little underhand
I praised the Lord for drunken honesty,
To nothing
Gone gone gone as ice melted in summer
There's nobody here now beauty above all
And I'm only halfway sober,
These names live on your lips
She's allergic to "I Love You"s and staying in one place
Why is life made only for to end Oh
Losing light, a selfish kind
I held on to the shore on to the shore
In my heart
sonst kommt der Pöbel und nimmt mir alles weg
You must not leave me alone anymore
As its worst it delights me
My cosmonaut from Leningrad
"Oohweeee man" without your sunshine
Every word that you press against
Feel a breeze of a new beginning
How can I think of tomorrow
But the silver moon
This is no, sad and sorry dream
But I am not sure that I'll get over you
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
Memories, memories
To spend your time and pray
I hope this heartache of mine won't get any worse
Alongside you
By the Sally Ann just barely 
To improve, nothing to lose
Your hands made sure I'd stay intact
Sometimes a dream is all that we have
Barely breathing
There's a piece of a puzzle known as life
I got deep warm drunk
To forget you
The slow decay of my mind
Always had a feeling it would pass
Stood on the sand in no water
But I guess, I guess you just ate much better than the rest
I wanna be the one you can be around
But when it is all over we will still be friends
We can take our time and you can want to Stay in, go out,
You can ill aford to hold to this views
I fell asleep in the chair by the fireplace
In my own mind
I dream
How dare you
No solid ground
I wouldn't do you wrong, honey
And drowns with the stones
Or foolish
Sleeping on the way
Landing at night
Let me make you say my name
Wind down, wind down and relax
That's it just let go, and relax
Oh, look who it is
And there's no place and I can't wait 
She was talkin' about the music all fast in the club you know
With nothing but this girl
How I love you
About the stuff they never did
Papa isn't dumb, he understands what this means
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
You have all of my heart
Gaping holes where diamonds should be
Back into the womb of the world oh
Or maybe to the last, but I'm still not sure
Can't say for sure
I've never gone
There is a ship, its sailing the sea
Time bends broken bones
Of our love and trust
Oh, they can say anything they want to say 
And neither have I wings to fly
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
This is the last smile
I wanted to show you the stars
The same word x
I'm filling in the empty spaces
Right when I need you most
That the pain is worth the thunder
Darling I feel you, under my body
The floors are all collapsing still I'm begging to be free
And I am not frightened although it's hot
But you make it go away
Far away a good bye, good night
Let the poor find money
In a half life
The sun is shining bright outside
'Til sleep, she overtakes her
I hope you stay
I'm lost for words
auf das eigene, entsprechend große Land,
Look at you you're blue black and through being that kid I knew 
But I see the pictures of every life
It's a cold night, beneath the street light, there's a man whose pants are too tight
You and I are we
Seem so thirsty, smell fresh meat in the air
Beautiful world, it's a beautiful world, to me
Give me your hand
With not much to say
Waiting alone
Cars intersect in the middle of the sky
This is one thing you can't take away
Fight your way through crowds and cars
And preyed that maybe
'Cause I already know how this thing go
Threw his watch away
In your eyes
I'll hold you Hold me and touch you Touch me, baby, And make you my woman Make me your woman, tonight Tonight
And not return to the shame
And that everything is free as long as you do what they tell you to
When you need it I want you to
Outside the storm clouds gathering
To lay yourself down and make it so
Show the world the you inside
When does the ice break
Fall the gather, forward
He let slip away
Unmatched to match the unmatched plates the sun sets in the west I really really really don't want to do this
And I hope you take this everything I know
Do you notice Do you notice
Is never going to mend
Until the hammers fall
Let's run away from here for good 
Tell me, oh yeah
Not much chance for survival if the neon bible is right
You're beating yourself up baby don't you know
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
To say a single word
Reality starts to settle in, you're sweatin every wake up
You can't tear us apart
You say you got a heavy load
We are their mortar
Now and forever till the end of time
That shapes are for looking at
It's our life in the city
I can't go out in the world without a little fire in my soul
Will you always be
And dressing so sweet, all the people to see
You'll still be here
How you get your adrenaline flowing
And I'm so glad that you were fired
Now all of these voices
I could be anyone alive
Bet you thought you'd hide from me, didja
I will come to you
And I'm feeling good
If I could lure my singing bird 
I'm trapped in a state of question
Sometimes there's one with big blue eyes, cute as a bunny
It gets cold in there
I'm not trying to find a way to get in your bed
You are so transparent
These foolish things remind me of you 
I saw her face on the back of the door
When all the stars were aligned
No one really knows about your soul
How long 'til you're gone
She was brave but she caved
But the future is already known
But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
Searching for a piece of mind Hey
Some other gonna come too soon
Cuando las almas van enredadas no hay más
And always keep thinking
This land is a young land let it stay that way
You become your parents' parent
I'm just a boy, not long for this world
You're changing skin like I change clothes
Ah yeah Sounds a bit gay
You broke another mirror
This time I won't be caught off guard, just like all of the times before
The second time this year
With your tender touch
The light is fading and the sun has gone down
River so clear and blue
You look good, and you smell sweet,
I hope you'll understand
Dans son regard je voyais
But it doesn't do a bit of good
Where your shadow blocks your light
To remind me of how it used to be
Some cats didn't make it alive
Why do I love you so
Sends your ships to the rocks
Because they've taken enough and you've given them all you can give
She came back even from far
Every other little night
And the business was doing so, so great
And it counts my time
Still at it
She want's you to say;
Some of them got closer than others
With words that tear and strain to rhyme
I know something's got to give
Damn I hate a yes man
Forgiveness for a man who was stronger
I'm gon' be around
And you'll hear this simple song
Hey kid rock and roll
Shorty get down, good Lord
The softest voice said to me all through last night
It was a triangle with soft, rounded edges and a split down the middle of one corner
I'll dance whatever dance you need to dance
I don't wanna hurt your pride
No, I never look back Never look back
Where I remember everything you want me to forget
Ihn dann zurück bringst unversehrt
To change
Still sang your songs that felt our songs just right
It's dark again
Another stone
She dived beneath the water's icy skin,
They become so dull and dutiful
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
And I wanna pull things up
Break the barrier of sound into the sky
She's never coming back again
Fill my life with pleasure
Underneath the lights of the city sky, baby, ooh baby
You curse my name
Is when I had you my love
Supercollider
We're speeding into the dark
As your world continues to crumble, come to terms with the truth
I'm no light weight 
Is it a boy Or a girl Or a gun
When you see them hoes, little homie, drive slow
Sag mal, hast du das gesehen,
I saw you, I saw you standing there
If only the morning would come and the world would be old and wise
Back past the place where we met
When I learned I found my eyes were open
Me enseñaste a decir mentiras piadosas 
You might as well surrender now
In another place, other space and time
Maybe we are the damaged ones
A vision too removed to mention
Save it and it ends up wasted 
But whatever you got right now will probably suit me fine
I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
But they are not laughing
Snow drifts through the pine trees
Oh it's getting better now
Who will take me home
'Cause baby I'm a dreamer for sure
And I faced the truth
If God had a name, what would it be
Jennifer left for school up in Boulder
And I'll give give give until there's nothing else
But you're always on the run
Qui illuminent, qui touchent l'infini
I'm taking no sides
You left my love on the line
Die Kinder,
That talking is sexual
Straight through the land
You curse at girls
And from where my hands are situated
Your way you get out of this mess
What we got is hard as hell
Now she's gone
What days have come to keep us far apart
I Pray that the sun shines in the windows
Women seem wicked
Maybe next year I'll be better
Or if I'm just looking for an excuse for us to break up
Coincidentally, that's why today you're not with me
PC for life and death
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
Like they could burn forever
I'm on a plane at , feet
As I went out walking, one morning in June
But you get the feeling
The water falling from the sky, the sun that's breaking fills my eye,
Catch his dreams today
There's a girl here and she's almost you
But really I'm going places
First star I see tonight hangs on my wall
Wake in the night
Look so warm from here
All through the night
Something always brings me back to you
I may be slower than some folks
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
You stood still
Hard to say what's on my mind
Who made these customs I can't seem to get past 
Your tears have turned the water black
Under broken shards
Putting all the vegetables away 
But please come soon 
Don't make no difference what nobody says
I don't mind, was all me
This chest is full of memories
When dreams made real become less sweet the orchid and the metal
Are you lonely 
Morning skies all for you
The longest time I've been waiting alone like the river
Me disse que era um dervixe 
And in the morning
Feat Wendy Stubbs
I got a perfect set of blue prints
Another breath without the girl I like
'Cause he's forgotten all he's known
When the game starts and one person's left out, it used to be me
I wish that I could make them stop
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
Won't matter now
We're Ships in the night
Snow is on the ground
If no one is around you
The start of the journey
That you couldn't help but care
The cars and the trucks are falling
And how my thoughts they spin me 'round
And all my senses' honesty
My heart liquefied and I sighed, "Oh, this must be a dream"
I need someone I leave through the front door with
I mean, I went and found the modern world
We dare to breathe
Just a moment in time
They roll their eyes and they call you crazy
Something in the way she moves
The rain came again,
You need something to blame
For the next good crop would pay my way
The eyes I gave you
These are the cages
There beside yourself, choking on tears
Take good care of it, babe, take good care of it, babe
But in darkness, I'll always see those eyes
We miss you when you're gone
When I got prices on my head, feds rushin' my spot
I'm just a childhood prisoner of the garden gate
Settling down in dark waters
Get me a small man's wetsuit, please
'Cause you the only boo who do the freaky things you do
The one thing I refuse to fake
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Winding as they may 
But there's a wife whos wondering where her husband could be tonight
Just a dance to the music of time
With no call back, where was y'all at, gimme the ball back
Be they hope
Who has to say goodbye
You go north walk the good red road
They tell me I'm too young to understand
I don't wash and I don't comb
Your pop says, your ma says
It's the book of my days, it's the book of my life
At quarterpast the doorbell rings, the water faucet drips and sings 
And it's hard to say what you've got
You gotta a bad old habit of making people sad
You're late again, you missed the last bus home
You close your eyes
But it's just you and me, baby, if you wanna play this game
These feeling, they don't mean nothing
Now it's white as snow
The joke's gone too far
To reach the coastline
But the letter jacket wasn't yours to own
The streets are all narrow
Whenever I get weary
I can't go back
und Träume die du hast
And bleed into their buns till they melt away
Kissing my head like a brother and never asking why
I used to think the world, could be so kind
And there's alot of things I wanna learn about you class is in session
Inside your head
Sag deiner Tochter,dass du sie liebst
Seen enough to bend him off the frame
Near the east Waverly Hills, your hair pinned back
Because in a village a poor lad
If you spread your wings
I look outside, I know you're there
My soul is pinned
That ain't no one's job but mine
I'm on fire I need somebody like you, I ain't afraid to die
Play the game
Because when I am drinking
And when our day is done, then we shall be one
Pinch to snub that restless nerve
I saw them and I knew them all
If you fall in, I'll jump down
I have always thought
I didn't see the brave girl so near me
Well, the night eats up my body heat
It's only human to wonder why
You've got to fall apart and put it back together again
Goes back to the beginning
She says it's the best place in the world
I can see our bodies burn but sense no fear
I need everything I've done
I ain't running away from my mind this time
Are in my hand and just up the stair
Now it's two hours to go
Study at the dock where the schoolgirls flirt
Hold me in your arms tonight; Hold me in your arms, ooh, baby
And suddenly we're all alone in silence,
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin'
Falling for a bad joke, you love to be the fool
Well, this is a song for you
Because I'm guilty just the same
Says he's sick of living his life
To pull ourselves away from the lives we leave back
You have a place to hide
This world, I've been right
Remember me when I'm gone
You've got a chance to retake a bit of innocence
Know your name
Yet standing in a pool of light
Shut up and shut your eyes
That's what they say, they say of me
Then fell asleep under a tree
Je suis le musicien, le mec sur le microphone
I know I tend to get so insecure
Because you instantly felt warm
Down the walls, you can't help the way you feel
And please remember me seldom
We'll bring a child into this world
A substance state of mind
Lay your head on my shoulder let it fade away
As for the past, it's all behind us
I found your house and I saw your car
When the birds keeping singing
For I could see for miles, miles, miles
To just believe
The ledge of life goes under
What I do is nothing
The words you say to me are unlike anything
Need the light but not the heat of the day
I swear I really didn't know
Oh, I could see you smile, can you see my tears
Round and round and round my head
I'm trying; will somebody make her shut up about it
ja tästä ilman sua ei tuu mitään
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
Some learn the hard way,
Plastic cups for rum and punch, eating chicken that's hot and sweet
You got from a giving kind
I'm not asking for more
I Don't know if I want you to understand me
They all show love to my shorty doowop
She thinks that I've already gone away
But I push him away
Take us anywhereoh yeah
You're a drunk and you're scared
And float over the tired tired sea
It resonates inside my soul
But the spirit of life keeps us strong
I can be free on the weekends
To soulfully be one with your creation
And we are breathing deeper instead
Auf einmal stand er da, sein Name war Tara
And she takes her pills, and she tells her lies,
With  glasses
We won't be afraid of getting lost in the sea of emotions
When no one else could see
More of you buys my time
I don't doubt it, I feel it
It all just seems like yesterday
Never ever thought it'd be this way
Act like big city kids when the sun goes down
Denn mit dem Herz sind wir meist blind
Youi love would bring an end to my despair
J'ai voulu retrouver son corps
And you're dreaming, and you're dreaming, and you're dreaming
God knows I couldn't make it one day
Caught a bird and let it go, had a rope and don't you know
To all the people underground
But one of these days Ill grow old
Well I don't know I don't know I hope so
And let me heal your beautiful pain
Is it all in my mind
Is this feeling you
I'm a wanted man
Oh no don't run away
In his mind I'm proud to roam
We can be ghosts now
See it all come true, come true
Shattered from the start
Put it on my shoulder
You used to lean your eyes on me
You just left 'em with nothing to say
And I wanna stay here, so just let me be
No way out for you and me
I'm the weatherman
Now if you are who you say you are, get up here to the bar
And the night becomes a musical extravaganza
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be well, well, well, well
Shock to my body as we tumbled in
Straighten up your life
But I don't know if I'll make it
Cross our fingers and dream on
You will learn to lose everything
Lord have mercy on the frozen man
T'es restée la même tandis que lui changeait, te brimait
She's a rich girl, he's a son of a CocaCola middle man
So here comes a breakdown,
Summer, Summer, Summertime
Then it all just falls apart
The day after my birthday is not my birthday, Mum
All things change
Just because your eyes are open
That she bears a wingspan
Like the town where I was born
The brown shoes are old
Baby, I just don't reply 'cause I can't find the things you need in me I can't, I can't girl
Why give up our lives to the brutes and fools
They both look the same, they're overjoyed in this world
I've been told it's not the best thing that I can do, right now
They just sit back and they watch TV
Derramando no espinhaço quase um mar
If only I knew how to fly
Only demanding the right numbers
Eyes that look away in pain
These sheltered hearts can't make me stay
The spirit of life will keep living on
Fieldfares' song skirmishes
In faroff lands on distant shores, so many friends to meet
It's my birthday, 
And it finally feels like my life has begun
And hung 'round like echoes
You had to drink to stay alive
Power Team breaks flaming blocks of cinder
You may have been one
We could be anything you want
When your heart's in pieces
I don't dare to touch your hand
And I can tell that you need to get away
Now and forever our love will remain
Our hands are in a knot
Time passed and that was that
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right
There ain't many folks
Can't forget the feeling of
Above the end of the street,
It was all laid out just for me and you now
That the ship will still sail on
das was morgen geschah,
That you let me in tonight
I cut the red one
I've got a girlfriend out of the city
I'll come right back for you
But now I can't stay 
She was cooler than you
wie diese Landungsbrücken
Mexican border
The spark in your eyes is gone, somehow
If I tend to lose it and steer into old tracks
Or do all things end
"Swallow your pride", he said 
Yeah, they'll freeze and fall on down
Oh why But sometimes I'm the night
I was so full of you
In thrall of weathers wit
Warmed my feet beneath cold sheets,
Sure as the setting sun
Clouds drift through his mind as he walks by
Everybodys wishing for no more mistakes
For our world without sound
Never caring where one's branches have been
Far away
There goes another day
The morning scratched with static loud
Sailing for the setting sun
And our lives will fade as in darkness we will bathe
Halfway between
Words of hope and words of spite
I know you're somewhere, unchanged
That I won't die for some time
Non nul naege malhaettji wae saranghandan malhaji anhnyago
Do I drift further every day
Fucked around and got attached to you
Ich habe so lange gewartet und dann ging es viel zu schnell
I've been going alone to the cinema
That just comes with the cost
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
To empty places on my own
The many touches on my skin
Would we still walk hand in hand
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
The crowds slowly fade when you come around
I've never been one for goodbyes
Und allen Dingen über die ich verfüge,
If you ain't running games
Can you hear the night's deep song
ocean, oxigene, space
I've got a taste for it
You need not to cross the sea
To the blue ocean floor
Blood in the breeze
I need someone someone who hears
For fifty years I lived there with my man
Don't run away now now, ooh ooh ooh
But I say
If you cling to your pride
Until the end of time
y te llevaste el cenicero
To save everyone from this brilliant light we've won
River so clear and blue,
I'm always falling down
Cause you were cold as the ice at your front door
How big, how blue, how beautiful
Eu vou ficar com Jackie, oh
One more dollar and I'm on my way
And we are here while you are far
Scènes de ménages, manèges Elle déménage, s'allège
Oh the things that summer brings
Rattled till it stopped
But I wish you did 'cause I can't rid the thought of it
Cursing the skies of this company
It walks the street as the chimneys burn
Because you're young, you're torn between
I'm in a car
Neither one can tell
To conclude our love affair
Wasted all my days over you
I'd be out of line telling you, "leave her"
I see fire
It's harder than I thought
Like the days when it would rain
This ain't no game of kiss and tell
How would it be to love and feel everything's the same
I have water for my journey
Always till the end
You're not apart of it You're broken now, like us
You live your life like you're stuck in hell
Call the ferryman to cast me off
They never say to come home
Because I've noticed one thing
Down towards the happiness that you deserve
Swaying like the children
You gently nourish my dry skin
Baby, I can't sleep at all until I see you again
It ended when I lost your love
One day it's gonna happen
Like a river running dry 
Diamond in the back,
So without trying to breathe only the sound of little feet
A satellite beside me
I lived alone but I was only
Was in your way I'd move it for you
Holding our breath
Call up, call up bring a rhythm and a chorus
Do it faster, baby, do it faster
But so hard to see at night
Looks like you're never coming home
I realise if you were mine
The men are wailing toothless, the ladies ghostly pout
I close my eyes
It will pass in time
You're my kind of girl, no diggity
When you look in my eyes
Hey, I'll take this day by day by day
How come we never came closer
Open your arms and sing
Can't you hear they are singing
Now we just sleepwalk We drift through the week 
The cannons' thunder can't prevail
"Remember, it's only the start"
Never will stop caring
Seems I'm standing on the edge
Oh look there you go again
I'll just think back on it all
I'll make it through
In circles 'round the well and where it spells
That Heaven is of honey
I'm asking y'all please chill wit the violence
And then we found our bodies
And heaven don't tear you apart
Out of mind
Smoke fills the room
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
We just say life's so unfair
Live on the freeway, listen to signs
Dragonfly in the sun, you know what I mean
I feel alright, I found a face that fits tight
Yeah somebody's bed will never be warm again,
Don't play around now, take my life instead
You're wasting me
So much time on the other side
We got all the time we need
And through her dooreen peep
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Retrieve unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness
When she drifted off to sleep she had the whole world at her feet
Oh you could see it in her eyes
Don't know what to say
In the little dance of tongues
Barely surviving has become my purpose
Well let me tell you a story
You can't do a thing to stop me
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
Take it back and then let it go
And longing for a life 
To warm it up, be wise and be smart
The pressure
With every hag waves me on
I lay down on the grass
I am falling out of you
But I'd sing it from a place of pride
Hold my head high and walk away
With equality and justice
Smokey Robinson, Ashford & Simpson Are you gonna be
I don't need you to save me
I feel a change coming on
Now, there's a few things,
Wenn ich sehe, was mit deinem Mund passiert
A whisper in the garden of Eden
On this bright spring morning
Her hope gets so high they're too hard to handle
Baby, understood, sunshine, starlight
There's just too much that time cannot erase
Be they changed
And on and on from the moment I wake, to the moment I sleep
An angel named Gabriel is watching over you
Trying to quiet the unrest
All things strain
Maybe you're headin' out
Everytime I think I've finished being young
But I don't care where we go
Olden times and ancient rhymes
And got lost in the sea
Who I wanted to be talking to
An eclipse of emotion
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
In the other I've got a gun
The crowd was bouncin' in sync with the pulse
You used to open up and share your world
And did we grow apart
And never show a single piece of my mind
We were glass
She doesn't dream
And for my missing heart, I carve one out of wood
Is as meaningless as it sounds
I'm alone for our last goodbye
ich weiß dass unter uns beiden der Boden bricht
This is a song for you
And you swore you say me laughing
Send her seeds, a painful sound
You will make it through this night
Surrounded by everything, I am
With all the vampires and their brides
Looking through the window of your mind
And a man who loves a woman, ah yeah
Was the proper point of view
und jeder Salto verlogen
So don't you go and let the world bring you down
Whenever we come undone
I kissed your hair
I'm so full of these endless rhymes
It's everywhere I look
And there's a glance in time suspended as I wonder how it is
Let me see who you are
Actually it was probably me again
It's constant as the stars
Now my nightmare is over
I make a date for golf
Leaving everything behind 
Only pain and sorrow
Just make sure that I'm remembered
Is it time for the road
el amor, la pasión, se quedaban adentro
I may lose my fear 
Higher places you can't reach without me
Please, God, let's not resort to minimall parking spaces
That's why I know you are the one
Steals the feelings from a love affair
Or maybe it's not at all 
I know she's watching that star
Might have been a while
Oh, I hope you don't mind
In the orange sky
Just you and I, a summer sky,
We were giving on back on all that's left to do
Did you know that you can dry your pillows with your dreams and smile
Um den Sohn meines Vaters endlich kennenzulernen
Measured time
Keep both feet on the ground
It takes a whole lotta medicine
There is no one to break your fall
No past or future here
Looks for lights anywhere
That I could be so foolish thinkin' I'm alright
Come into my space
So long, this is goodbye
Entre o céu e o firmamento
Enough is enough, no one stops the catarpillar
Two teardrops for somebody's hand
The morning brings 
And one could get lost in all of these stars
Maybe I'll walk the line
Maybe it's time to go
No doubts left standing
Flying alone
I too fear the change coming on
It resides within the dirt
Nothing was as bad as it is tomorrow
Barefoot on the floor
The best thing that you ever, ever had
Strange it may seems
Got no money left
And here we are in Heaven, for you are mine at last
Who's your only friend, kid
Would you take me for a ride
It's colder in house than you think,
But with the will to work hard and a library card
Misspent with angel eyes tonight
None of these things have changed
She's a party queen and she's in party heaven
Speak to me with your sweet voice
Nothing but silence caused by doubt
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
But they're crying inside
Of God wears camouflage, cries at night and drives a Dodge
But he's not talking to me 
From the start
You don't mean anything to anyone but me,
A broken promise or a broken heart
How long can you hold your breath
I wanna hold on to you baby
Every day is a door leading back to the core
I feel it on the shore,
She handed me a broken memory
Can't stare it in the face
There's nothing to give no more
Subtract me from your heart
But I was younger then
I thought I made that loud and clear
Long gone before daylight
Please hold me back
But she was almost forgetting
Tsuki to taiyou wa it's a regular rat race, yeah
How you get your kicks for living
If you lay your money down
While daddy was busy putting on his pants
With every word you say
All I wonder As I wonder Is this all the
A long empty road
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
It's about yourself and the life you couldn't bear
Grinding down the long ones
In the end they are the ones
Held my head and said 'poor thing'
May we never be called to handle
Why tear our world apart
You may hate me,
Because I feel my selfesteem is caving in
Only a few things I see you, I see you
I never felt this way before
And everything I want for us to do
It's just a runaround
To stand before God
Yeah, she'll always be the girl from yesterday
Don't you go and let the world weigh you down
The missed call the missed flight
For tears my heart is caged,
I can make it digitally bright
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Vapor hands released the blade
Is it a kind of shadow
Es war immer hier,
On the way
You pour out your prayers and weep 'cause you care
As the city slowly lifts away
I'm alone but I know everything you feel
And by chance her eyes fell onto mine
And looks down on such slight a thing
I remember every look upon your face,
And to whomever she fancies
But in this life
Try and start again
My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
I believe now
Some things just happen because they have to be
And away he gone day
To twist your loving arms 'til you capitulate
The time is right, to begin
über die wir rannten
You just stand up there and watch
We got the money
And I do believe it's true
Except for across the floor
A shining angel sent to me
Is this the way to be
From all the darkness that I couldn't break through
'Cause tonight at ten
There is no one to keep you warm
Got back to the car in time to watch it being towed
Nude as the news, nude as the news
And how big was the bag
Not to say I'm right
When my coffin is sealed and I'm safely  feet under
He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away 
I don't know what goes through her mind,
The past is still the past
Can't do a thing to stop me Dream
Are you ever gonna come back home
Far from home but near my family
I've always been waiting for someone to set me free
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
und führte den liebeskranken Tristan zu Isolde
Play names and word association
Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
They're all lined up to watch that movie "Maid in Manhattan"
My thoughts are many miles away
Better at your game
Well, she's washed up on his shore, there's no time to get into his life
Then you'll wander in my heart
Oh yeah What was her name
And I waited in my fleeting house
Laying flat on the ground
And he walked away from my fleeting house
Oa, oa me leva pra ela
Now you go your way, BABY, and I'll go mine
And how fragile I thought was I
And that's the way
Hey yo, man that girl looks good
Head for the sun in your belly
We'll get to know ourselves again
But in our town there's just one stoplight
And the cat comes
You know it's gonna be a long drive
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes;
He knows his friend the wind is always standing by
You're all I don't need
Come into your room 
And all it really needed
Racist, pointin at me look at the niggaracci
Combine 'em just right to make fuck the valley fudge
I'm sitting in this car 
I will admit I almost always underestimate it
Will you go ahead to the Aventine
This is the end of the first phase
For the things you've done
Fingerbobs has wolfed the lot come into our room 
Don't turn me away, don't tell me to go
But it's overflowing evaporating in the air
Float downstream one by one until you realise you're free
With flowers in your hair
And tell me I am still the man I'm supposed to be
A waiting game now
Two eyes
Every time your lips meet mine
Close to town but not to the city
And I can't see a thing
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
And yeah, yeah, God is great
I can't do the talk like the talk on the TV
Pay attention to the signs
Falling down from a mountain of frights
You can always tell
To the ends of the earth, wife, kids and a car
Need your hands to show me how to pray
We run away forever from this misery
A dead procession always dragging its feet Well, come on 
When I was younger, sometimes when I look back
Oh my God, you can't believe
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Fought about your taste you were on mine
To be a good husband and care for your kids
And here to please him
Tell me lies
They would shine just like the sun 
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
I tried, but the walls are too thick, too high
Freddie Jackson, everything, everything Well, well, well, well
The moon has blocked the sun
She says oh well oh well you do just fine
The ground
Is the time of the blink
You're asking me will my love grow
Caution 'get out'
The fool, play by your rule
Same great heart, still away
Tu as pris son coeur, je t'en veux
She'll come in blushes
Should he stay or should he go
Those cards in sequence
I've heard it's pretty where you are
I'm not scared of death
And I'm feeling like a schoolkid
Take a year in your hands
Well it still is and if you stop giving into it
But I feel as if I've never had a crush before
That all of your days are numbered;
Every time I start
The day is done, the sun has set in the sky
Of our German engineering
I felt so bound by mindless ways
Once again, they forgot about J
I always want more
But I'll be back someday
But surely by now I could say to myself
Ooh ooh
And so you could become very sensitive to everything, you start walking through the studio, you go 'ah yes, it's going to be a good day, I can feel 
Sooner than you think
It was all so beautiful then
Never said it was good, never said it was new,
Well it's your hometown
Of everything
Das ist das Lied,
I'm gonna give me a good night sleep
Staying young forever
Love at first sight may sound trite
I catch myself having fun
Oh sing your life
Roll the film with all of the car crashes and
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
Through the ice 
And if we're lucky we might see the end of the day completely
Under thousands of rainbows
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like
You could go out every night
I haul up on my gentlemen,
Ja, Fredrik är gammal men kärlek är blind
I lost myself on a cool damp night
But I'm still not a bird
Try to make it delicious,
I know it's mean to say
Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay
Every single move you make
The sea is full of sharks but can you swim
Candy says she's made arrangements for me in the sand
Well, they'll never believe what's been happening here 
Discovery will knock you on your knees
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
And dragging your mother's clothes
And his friends said he'd fail if he tried
I don't know what I've become
I liked humans more than machines
I think I can make it now the pain has gone
Now the fireworks in me are all gone
Here comes Dick, he's wearing a skirt
I'll be around for a while
I feel the warmest light comfort me
Is all we've got
You thought that there was someone else, all along no way, no way
The warmer air rises, and the cooler air falls
Your sofas' old, but I am new
But she never let him see her cry
Funny how you see the truth,
Keine Angst, Du hast nichts mehr zu verliern'
Polyester, pink gingham  cracked my head
And the unlucky dark cloud is in the middle
That sits beside me
Nothing can stop what we do
Id blow you upand block the sun
While everything around me is breaking down so slow
And say you've kept some fire aside,
Devour me quick, accept my orison
Our friends are all hurting
That while walkin' through town
Tu touches mon coeur, l'esprit s'en ressent
Just a memory
Towards you expectantly
You always found the words to say
Breakdown a hurting sound
Can change the way that you see me
So I leave you with a smile
A spoon of sugar sweetens up
Sitting in the sun with some chocolate
Do you ever dream of the world like I do
This is how it always starts, all order falls apart
So in love, love, love, love,
It's just hard sometimes to carry on
I just like to make you see that
Tired homes and tired trees
Ride along the winds of time and see where we have been
But now I'm back in Pittsburgh, I might take it up again
Satiate my mind
Like furniture that I find on the street
Both ways you lose
All love stays around
I don't care
Everybody thinks we're wrong
It's a lie, lie
Weave their weary paths and die
And that way saving me from grief
The demon had a spell on me
You're along for the ride
I hide in the corner
I'm not gonna wear a ladies' wetsuit I'm a man
Ripping her fingers into the ashtray
They'll play my music and then they will cry
I thought we were doing fine with our lives
I can't get away
I've met your ghost, he has proposed
Are your thoughts results of static cling
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
So it's different then for everyone
Moving, moving, moving, yeah yeah yeah
It's been three years or maybe more
This is tearing me apart, I wish I could be in your soft arms
Feels so hard to say
And a night full of no fear
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurtin' me
I've got scars, even though they can't always be seen
Où sont ils allés
para escapar los dos volando un rato 
And it's okay, to not even start
And that moon is
A friendship that meant
Let's just go to a show and hang out and feel good
As we skip the goodbyes
Taking breath of each other
Though you had the world at your feet
Wasn't you who said life was like a plastic cup
Throw yourself up on runaways,
Holding all the pieces of my broken heart
Live, live, live because you love, love, love
My animus was lost, I found when I looked back in time
We could, with a word, become one
Realize how much I need you
'Cause all our days are just so many waves in the wind,
I could live in the breath you're wasting
And the people pass me by
I did this for you too, you still got me around your finger
And it's time
I'd like to meet a mad man who makes it all seem sane
Driving with my friends, yes
It's ok to run we expect you back
Guess you got my number
Out where hope and the highway ends
Letter I won't send
I am done with it
Give me your hand, it's time
One of these dayssdfsdfsdfsdfsdfsd
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
Will it ever change
All our friends been acting strange
How does the motion make me last
Doesn't matter if we lie
It ain't a land to boast about
Because 
Espalhe por aí boatos de que eu ficarei aqui 
Strong behind your young girl's tears 
And so I hope when I am finally dead and gone
Everything rises, going at it all
To turn you back to you
I'll make the effort
Stay in the night
Won't be believed by anybody else
I have seen the world
It comes from cry
I left her fifteen years behind 
Hides the muddy grass no more
To say you must never
As dead as yesterday, yeah
Just to keep you and Paris on my mind
Carrying something wrapped in plastic, straighten
Du bringst mir tausend Wonnen
To let go and make an end
So we make our plans we make our plans
Nobody knows
All you ever wanna talk about is your self and your comic books and your album and your tour
When in walks her father and takes you in line
The way a cold dark night invites the fire thief
J'ai peur que je vais roullier ce soir
'Guess what, mister I've got no voice, no future, no leadership'
All the things that we can be
You want to touch me but there's too much history
When the north wind blows
With love is lord of all
I'm not asking for much
More than life itself
Why don't you tell me where it hurts now, baby
Come on now, come on now, child
I never thought you were here
Everybody's laughing
That tug at the truth
We all want to have some faith,
In need
When tidal wave hit and our house was in splinters
Now your eyes are red from crying
For there's no more world,
That your arms would hold me tight
Your house beneath the hill and up until
First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe
In your fire below
Woman, don't try to love me
All I ever wanted was to stand beside you
And rainbows have nothing to hide
Swallow
You feel the cure
If you're shocked it's just the fault Go your own way
When the dark skies came along to test our steel
I never was the kind to make a fuss
Let's just make a move and feel the earth quake
I bet I say something stupid
Just that burgundy smile you wore yesterday
Sometimes I can close my eyes
The ordinary people they do not know
It's a starstudded event when I valet park
And I knew I was close to you
Tell me when it's time to open up my eyes
Give me your heart I'll open it up
Now everything I do is for King, Messiah, Deyjah, Domani
I never asked for help, I take care of myself,
Some hearts are ghosts
On the threshold of some brighter thing
You knew they'd cry but you hoped they understood
The world's been waiting, they've been waiting for years
And away he gone night
A bunch of bright forgetmenots
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
Und die Domteure Propheten
We don't no babysitter
And don't forget that you called it all bullshit
I didn't mean to leave you all alone
Probably it's the toxin  sorry it's a lot been unresolved
Then I hope it takes me, too
That I've got you in my life
Far from the world and it's violence
And faces
In the evening of your years
Your love
People say they're never gonna turn away
You raised a trembling glass and shouted 'FUCK THE WAR'
Candlelight and all things bright come into our room 
Taking time I'll still be here
We didn't
Car is parked, bags are packed, but what kind of heart doesn't look back
Today I may not have a thing at all
An angel without wings can hardly fly
Catch another dream now
Happier now, look where life finds us
A change in this place
I try to see your point of view
Tidal waves, eruptions, plagues and thunder storms
For me to leave this place
And if the world's a stage,
Who's gonna say goodnight
All for a happy end
Better lock up well before they come
Enjoy this life right now
Mister Wolf knows what time it is
Saying, you fuckin' them girls, disrespecting me
My heart in my throat
Candles in the sun, blowin' in the wind
Who makes me better
With love, with gratitude
There's nothing left to fear
Cause that would really be the kindest thing to do
Wherever you may go
And looking in the morning the streets are flooded out
Free to fly tonight
But maybe you didn't know
An' all you love, yeah
We are heading straight
But I still act sur, surprised
All my limbs can become trees
And you will call it treason
Die zweite sollt ihr Ziel nicht schonen
And they're begging "come home"
He hears the phone and he knows his brother's dead 
Of all the many things
Oh, rabbit wind
Boundless myriad shapes along the sea floor 
In the arms of someone else
The way light means more than it did all day long
Je sais qu'il reviendra Sois forte
I see the road begin to climb
I'm gone, and you're still there
It's coming time to face the truth
We must be getting old
Wouldn't you say
Nu vill jag bli kysst, sa Cecilia Lind
Oh my god
She was too scared to speak
Stay true and sign the cross in you
The interstate's choked with nomadic hordes
They've come to my door
Always making predictions 
Who makes me go
As the sky spills through our mouths
Te tiram da tua calma e tua mãe a te buscar
Worth it being cold, roofing for the lanes
Yeah, we'll suffer for nothing and we'll never forgive
Oh I wish my arms were wider
Overhead
E eu aqui a comer poeira
Leave the nightmares behind
One second in your presence is a miracle of love
And sometimes when the beetles horn
Bound like an anchored chain in the sand
Anyone but me
And all my fragile strength is gone
A tune that only caged birds know
Waiting for a change
Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to a lake
So I'll send you my words
You take a walk on Bleak Street
A sun came
Gone and made me a child again
I wouldn't change it for the world
I'll hang this dream up on display
Now an unexpected peace comes to the day
Got a gun and an eagles eye
We like to time ourselves
And "it's all we need"
A little of yourself tonight
And you still buy a daily newspaper
There's a chapter on love where the ink's never dry
Touch these days and I'll kill you
Never comes around
Who lingers on, who sleeps outside
Each day drags by until finally night time descends on me
I had no choice
One that just had his heart broke
I'm waiting here for the firebell to ring
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
They climbed deep inside of this woman's garden
I won't fade away
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Over where the rainbow meets the darkened sky
And then he went to the bridge so he could fall
Find a way out, find a way
Restless feeling, I really gotta hold
My mind is racing like clouds across the sky 
It used to be sit by the window, and stare at what used to be there
We can't see the start
Light into darkness
It calls me to his holy place
But I turn back when I see where you go
Deberé salir a ver para entender que yo no sé qué será de mi
Even barer than a child's
Oh, that's breakin' all in pieces
I was happy, just getting some answers
When all the world was green
Driving home, the sky accelerates 
Keep me feeling so brand new
All the region trees go the same way
Looks like you'll make that road alone
In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty
I am here for you, if you'd only care
¡Humano ¡Qué espanto Humano
My hands are down I can no longer masquerade
Carrying your heavy old heart
And boy it seems like everyday
Drifting by the Spanish steps tonight
She kissed the world goodbye
Don't make, don't make, don't make a joke of my heart
I wonder how different I might see them now
Weighing so heavy on my body, body
She was so beautiful to watch
I like what your tshirt says
You look first, then stare
Lean back
But then he tells me that everything is erotic, that everything is sexual You know what I mean
But an easy ride
But oh bird you flew away
Judy's day passed out of sight
I am a fire escape
And it's throwing your dollhouse world in disarray
We wetted warmth and killed it and in the water hid
You run away
While you stumble home
I use to live for the weekends ooh
'Til we die we won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
Now I'll never have a chance
Don't get him wrong, and don't get him mad
Backwards, into, the ground
Sich mit ihnen neu versöhnt
I thought I would know when to leave when the time came
She was a friend, stabbed backs and broke plans
I dig my hole, you build a wall
Here I am  the ugliest man
She had some trouble with herself
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
Fated obscured by the passing time
No wasting time
Of your kiss, those moments after
Too late to turn back now, I'm running out of sound
The Upper Peninsula and the television news
Baby fall
May you have may you hold
Through hot and nervous hands oh nervous hands
And I threw it all away
We'll leave on the evening train
Until we fall asleep
It feels like you're near
I'd be the father of your child
Keep it or just let it fall
If it keeps the love away too
Everytime, I see you girl, it throw me off
Both of them dead and gone from extreme old age
He feels the wind is lifting up his people
Cleave to the ground
We will find love
If you ever got the time, darling 
I was too Busy staring at youFalling into Getting wood for the fire
I throw it off my back and
All I ever wanted was to be right here
Repaint where all the paint ain't
As they steal your best memories away
And tonight, how their light sets me dreaming
No, I can't give you what you need, all by myself
Never to be torn apart
All men would writhe
J'ai peur que mon temps soit expiré,
It ain't gonna hurt now if you open up your eyes
I hate this face, the luxury hotel bed
All my desire is vanishing
I can't say I wouldn't agree
And where gravity don't bring you down
Afraid it's so far to fall if no one catches him
I miss you when I can't sleep
Are animals and things on vines
But this shares no resemblance to that
Will speak to me, a bird's wing on the window
Though they may just be absurd
Steal my heart and hold my tongue
Yo, you and me used to run ball in the league
Our walks are now across
Vor dem, was du fühlst,
Let the struggle end, the joy begin, it's true it's love I'm falling in,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
 milli on, that's a must, living in California
See you a lot near the site
I gotta get over you, oh
My only hopes to see you
And my only hope
You loved me 'cause I'm fragile
Playing games
Falling out of love with you
You need me to put you in the trees
Stop talking back, get off the phone
Back with snow even sun
I'm your friend 
Everything pauses in the night
She's gone  miles, it's very far
In pain and ashamed
Truly there to truly care for you
Nobody ever could make me smile
And let the insects do their thing
But you won't be alone, I'll be here to carry you along
Your little world, a little out of place
Two is better than one
And in my dreams
Instantly forgotten
How big, how blue, how beautiful,
I don't mind let it pass,
And won't look back
Know how to climb a tree
I'm going to miss the way I missed you
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again
Too many words misleading
To make everything else erase
The laughter was like music
Sleep so deep, you wake up with a smile
In the morning after
Tout peut s'oublier
I really like it, this rock and roll
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
You are a beast and I am serving up your supper oh
And it's a mystery how people behave
Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Try to manipulate your point of view,
For the sins of yesterday
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
From the cities to the swamplands
Wasted all the years are left behind
The tiniest of things are forever
You're just standing, watch me fall
But the mirror's broken
Fix your eyes on a spot
How to live upon the solid ground 
I wish I woulda told the girls to 'drop it like it hot'
When leaves have turned to brown
On the edge of summer
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
Our voices in our toeses
Feels better than it does when we talk
And I've got this question, yeah
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
No, I can't explain the pain you're going through
Fell asleep by my side
Climb three flights to tremble at the site of your already open door
I wanna walk through the morning
Than anything else"
The ground is falling under me,
To think I have anything worth boasting in
Your love set me free
Caught up in wind like we were parachutes
Something in my soul that they cannot possess
And you never knew my name
Ordering drinks at the bar
That my love's misspent
And went for the sky
So long my friend, so long
This is for all the single people
And I will walk on water
Speaking silence
In the morning sun
Well, I'll kneel down on the carpet here
Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
For you're embraced in my heart
Save me not, I deserve to die
With the world and those who lead it
Our signs, our water slides
Closer than you know, love each other so
Sippin' sweet
There lies a lady, she's gone and she's gone
Oh the wind dies, the thunder of the storm is coming
There blows a lily fair
When no one is around you
Only my heart did hear him
I hear the words you'd say ringing in my ears
And still you look down on the teenage dad on
Jesus, a friend of the weaker ones
Find a way to tell you that I want to let you go
Amanda said, "You have to go"
Niggaz be schemin', I fiend to live a good life
Cause hope stays or it fades
I'll maybe tell you all about it someday
And suddenly you disappeared
The fine lines of your architecture,
Sometimes
I don't know if I can do this alone
Daniel my brother you are older than me
Here on the path of love and meaning
Asleep inside the cannon's mouth
You don't have to worry boy
Muted whisper of the things she'll move
Saying I'm gonna change
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall
When you and I will leave the night 
Nothing more than a longing for being uninvolved
oder niemals mehr
And when you let me taste your fingers
Maybe you were right
How come nothing that I try to do
Made more sense to him
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
It's terrific how was the day after day worse
I want to be the place you call home
And reason and freedom is a waste
Take your broken heart
The day I wept
When I come home
Beacon, don't fly too high
And my heart just skipped a beat
You make this world a beautiful place
Look around now
To buy things they don't need
So go on genius be who you are
Just hit the ground running
The world awakens on the run
Sweet suburban sky
You'll never be alone;
And all our days were a sundrenched haze
But you find yourself alone just like you found yourself before
Save it for a little while
If I forget to set the alarm and sleep on through the dawn don't remind me
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed
Don't you know a girl gets angry
Coldly hurt me and turn away
Standing on the wrong side of the sun
And I have wondered when we die
Stay, oh stay
Where there's a snowball's chance that the personnel
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
There is often a significant difference in temperature
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Love can last forever
Peeping sleepy faces off your tenement
Was right there in your smile
Stay alive or prepared  scared ain't no way to die
Through all of the shadowy corners of me
I regret what I have done
If we don't give her love and affection,
Grace and hope
Where's my love
Oh, weeping night
Wonder, this time where she's gone,
Then there's me no use or pretend
Of the dream that leads me home
Will you see me in the end
Recollection on streets you used to know
They say it takes a ring of gold
But just as he was set to throw, his dad arrived there
Where is your silver touch,
In our sounds and movements
These are simple times
Es ist zu heiß für mich in dieser Stadt,
Nothing is new
We're knock, knock, knockin' on the heaven's door
Or if it's right to try
Baby, I'm alright, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright, yeah
Oh, I'd have jumped from my trees
Your kiss was sweet like an apricot
Ever defrayed your soul
Are the ones I chose
Give me one more chance, forgive me
Beside a setting sun
Oh, it's always
Lose friends to the air waves and the airlines
To feel so much tenderness
I'm out here, spend plenty of time on your own
As if no one knows anything but us
Don't you know it was better than sex, now, now, now
lesht mit ayer eygn blut,
What more can I say Welcome to LA
I hope that you're only
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
Someday
And take your stand
Sol na nuca e o corpo dela
But tonight we'll reach for the stars
You and I, truth and lies
So much for girl staying 
I'll stay here forever
Down from where the trains go flying 
When my heart broke did you like the sound of it
Positions himself in space
They were giving you garlands
Let the pain burn away from our hearts
There AIN'T no use in me acryin'
Now it's all gone, one, two, three
Looking kind of anxious in your crossarmed stance
You don't owe them anything
I wanna go where my thoughts
You're gonna forget 
Turn your radio up
I see what's in your heart
Flying over bus stops and playgrounds
I'm always tired but never of you
Birds without wings
Take a different road
Let me dream all my, let me dream all my friends
Don't take her out of my life
I won't mind
"It's real," you say, "It's real," you say Yeah, yeah
But tonight I think I see what it's all about
Red light crazy shining
I'll give you the room you need
And when the morning came, I was ashamed
I'll stay up all night to hear about your day
Whisper a quiet tune
You and I, in clouds of ecstasy
I try to find forgiveness, in takin' what we'll never share
Hey, newspaper
Through the blizzard, through the blizzard
When I don't know I'm alive, give me fire
We go slow when we first make our moves
Ya make it all right
Walk to the sea
Till the light of morning comes
Your hand's upon a dead man's gun
Or if you want to just hold back cause you ain't up to it
Because all the time
And he's related to you
Got broken wings
You need not to find a cure
The window is broken out and the interstate is far
That we'd never be apart again 
If the world was how it should be
I'm alright here in your arms, darling
You're praying that you'll make it
Never, never knew you from the sun
Immovable shadows
But anyway
That was the moment that you lost your charm
We wait for answers, for hours and years
When we're standing at a distance
Baby our love will always persevere
Is it morning or night
Come on love love love
I know you cry a million tears so I want you to know
Pretending that we'll meet
I was sleeping, I was sleeping by the wasteside
Or make me feel home
I hear children singin'
Who tells me that he loves me
All the things that your eyes once promised
Don't trip, everything will end up just fine
Everyone's pointing their fingers
Clouds look so clear in your eyes
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
"Water, so much water is under the bridge"
Keep it by your side now
Touch of a mother so gently aware
The hand is dealt, the cards are played
All that I wanna feel is
We came together showed the world just how we feel
Wouldn't change anything 
If luck is on my side tonight
Der tag war grau und es schneite, ich nahm ab
Left to hide, maybe then they'll call it genocide
You're a simple fool without shame
Take me back to the days we played
All I need
So sure that I'm losing faith,
It's another grey autumn day
You will be by my side
Pretend that you owe me nothing
To be with you, to be the one
Do your thing my son the world is yours
They will all just go away
You couldn't feel the sunlight upon your face
His story left untold
Who will I find, to stay forever
Ah, She's my butterfly butterfly butterfly
Deep down inside
You kept your feelings hidden like a psycho
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
Possibly years I don't know
Such a sense of loss tonight
The town where she was born
So I lie lonely surrounded by you by you
And it's never seemed so far away
I was sleeping, ladies and gentlemen
Where the pass over I looks alive much as anything
No one will ever love you for your honesty
A wild hope
It will be around for a while
And it's hard on everyone
It encompassed the condition of the human race
Open your eyes, belly laugh, fill up my heart
I wanna get to know you
May you spread your love like laughter
Before this love affair began
Hang my head, break my heart built from all I have torn apart
And the words tumble out of your mouth
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
There's too many things between you and me
If we could rewind all that's happened
Have come true
And we'll drink for the lonely tonight"
And I will love you till the day I die
Go to bed half dead, what about rent
Whatever you're looking for
The noise just went away 
It's not that I don't understand you
Is love, you see
And this whole world
I never stole a happy hour around here
To bury the wave in the tide
I wonder how your body tastes
Now, if you're never gonna move
As if anticipating when they'd be allowed to caress
Oh, Jaqueline Misty, yeahoh
What are we doing now
Though tears don't come to cry some grief away,
They will say "Tom, he was such a nice guy,
The words of love are not enough
Now I understand just what you're playing 
So don't tell me you want the rain
Make believe
And all your fears
maalikoille, djlle, peinttareille,
We'll be back soon
Singing our songs is enough reason
Are the things that make you panic Go your own way
Explanations you say I deserve it
Raindrops fall as an old man cries
Smokes in the basement
Eyes are falling 
There may come a time when you rearrange
This blessed day
You are more interesting than I'll ever be
I never needed you for judgement
For the lonely fool
Do my best to make a drawing
That I deserve everything that I get
But we don't love no more
I wanted a story that couldn't be told
And the snow is drifting
The air is getting thick
All the faithful heal, they're all praying
It's falling you feel
As long as you're with someone and never left alone
Sometimes he takes himself so seriously
Feel the presence all around
I never was a jealous guy
Each time a faucet opens
Lost inside amazing colors
You're feelng calm and crisp and strong
Seducing me to stay
Yeah it feels like it's wearing me down
No other universe but mine
Oh, I just need a little more time with you
Never rest, never sure
There's so much to say to you
Här är jag med allt det andra
My dad taught me the American dream, baby
Oh, is it a dream
So now I keep my eyes open hoping to take in all I can
'Cause I need kicks
Each time you curse at girls
I made a meal of the lighting, this was exciting
As time goes by I know it's gonna happen
Her room is painted heron blue
Foundation is crumbling away
You can feel it in the trees
One billion lonely hearts
Guess you've got my number
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
You will never waste my time
When you come around, everything else disappears, my eyes disappear
All the waves of blame arrange as broken scenery,
The things we know won't last
But something keeps you faithful
Go gorepeat till fade
Sitting in my car
To show you the stars and then win your heart
To break or mend a bond as strong as ours
It's when you cry just a little
But to outplay is not to love 
That move so fast they grow out wings
Where originates all the pain that leaves
There you go and baby, here am I
So that everyone can see
Oh and if you let me stay
As they crumbled into dust and washed into the sea
Let's pretend you've missed me for a while
Make make me make you want to sing along,
Underneath the grass will grow aiming at the sky
Now everyone can share what's left
And I can't believe that I'm still standing here
Don't forget, don't forget
I've straighten across the line
I miss those times when things were simple, and your heart was mine
Tangled emotions between pause and rewind
Where nothing matters
And they smile when they can as they speak of the man
Go out in the light
Dad, your boy he used to run, you taught him how to crawl
And I lost my words
That's not what I believe, and it doesn't matter anyway
True lies with fingertips
In your mothers arms, I have called you son
I tiptoe across the squeaky floor
Do you dance the light Fandango
In the city it's the only light
Fear is blinding lights
We come together, here we go
Then a x drenched my jeans as I tried to cross the road
Why can't you believe
And the darkness, inside you makes you feel so small
You're on every street, marked on the ground
So I blame this town, this job, these friends, the truth is it's myself
He is drunk, he can't find his apartment
And I will be set free from the people
But I won't believe that you were faking
There's a chapter of secrets and words to confess
Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
No one will ever love you honestly
And sends a secret message to that girl
Oh, wait maybe I'll jack a truck
Deep within my heart
Even when the music's gone, gone
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Days are going faster than I ever could keep up
My days now end as they begun
Came home from the doctor
And where do you start
Give me a chance to put back all the pieces
Everywhere I travel the pretty girls call my name
She looked like a Parisian river
When the mornin' sun appears,
Cannot feel a single thing,
Over where tomorrow chases clouds away
I'd stroll around in synthesis
I climbed the tree to see the world
He is sorry for the wrong that he has done
Or right after coffee
We repeat forever, forever, yeah
Until it goes on and eats it with its blue and red orange
Aim for the burning sun
Everything's evened out
She's lovely now, just watch her as she goes 
Lost and found, ailing wanderers
You defer to the views of the television news
Desolation comes upon the sky
You see, every time Ra didn't show
In the end it's all you
I know the signs
That everyone's phony
You can find another man
I never talk to you
und sie fallen auf Dich drauf
And though my point of view seems sad
He loved her, but he wasn't too sure
My body, my body  that's your job
The bottom line
I know we haven't said enough but I know I've never loved this much
Step on grapes put in water and tell you it's wine
I know you're still thinking of me
To my funeral when my days are done
Can you tell me about the intuition I feel
Wall street is a ruthless mistress with a quick and painful judgment
It takes a toll to make you care
I never needed you to be strong
At least for a little while anyway
um zu sehen, ob die Sonne noch scheint
The embers of a drowning man
No more light green leaves
That milky delight that invited us all
It's a lot like life
Hiding in the forest
I look up to the falling snow
No ploughman's blade will cut thee down
It just wasn't enough
I tore it apart
Evolving on a thought that you've half realized
They'd be the same brown eyes
Even in sleep it seems flight's unattainable
So I can't look at you this way
Making love with somebody
Harlem river I'm in love love love love
Don't criticize me for being in demand
Plowmen dig my earth
And kindly stepped away
I have this habit of punishing things
And the sun as it shines
Ought to be on my way by now
Where your shadow blocks the light
Open hearts, empty spaces, dusty roads to distant places
Call me out from the dark, 'cause I'm broken inside
Some cat says "buddy"
Further shame the family name
And a comforting wave washes over me
I would warm him on my breast 
Hot coffee in a clean white mug and a smile when the waitress hears
Essa menina tá dizendo don't worry
Now after two honey blunts I discovered the buzz
You get a case of party feet
Trying to feel what's coming next
Watch the world go twirling by
Well define my love with attitude
To bring our neighbors home from war
Living souls around me
Don't you weep my little man
You are my moonlight, ohooh
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
But whilst it breathes
And understand
In the summer sky
You rode me on your bicycle down Main Street
Ah yeah, they're gonna tear your world apart
Through on your weary head
Sinking Moving deep beneath the water
For children's carousels
There's only so much that our heart can grow
Mit dem Mofa nach England
And we share a name
So much love to give
And nobody knows what state we're in
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Don't turn me away
I'll carry on, I'll carry on
I'll find your list in a different name
If this is love, ooh
And she will be loved
I get to see the scene repeated
But when you touch me I forgot and then I couldn't stop
Jus show me where to sign
And I don't fall of the wagon you know
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
He's been falling
I gave it my soul 
They love my little mustache 
I need someone who understands
I saw the back of the stars
And was crucified by gun
Let the pain of yesterday
They'd tell stories that would warm my soul
Diane I don't say it but I know you know
There's no need to be so terrible
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
If I belong to somewhere, it's to your arms, Kery
From a sea that turns itself
After the flight
Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from
Somewhere Sunday morning brings us miles from earthbound, sailing the wind
At the weekend
But all the time when I'm alone I think of you and how you've grown
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Between your world and mine
You pick my heart with a smile
Six feet under, underground
Hard to believe how people move
We'll all be gone, there'll be no more roads to find
A time when it was true that, love was sweet and innocent
I new a man who was better 
I've got it going X
Joining up the pieces
Keep on kissin' me
Says we will always be safe here in this bed
Of these places that I travel through
While the summer lasts
Forgotten pleasure smoulder
Your whisper in the breeze
Doctor feels the pain, that caused the sickening rain,
Her fever dream a language on her face
You're a bird in the sky now baby
But NASA is on your side
Hoping what you need is behind every door
You know that we're not the marrying kind
And the boys they run faster
Times, times where the lamps were lit so low
They just want to be back at home
Mal sehen, ob sich das Warten lohnt
Spider and I
The sun is out and up and down again
Find them in the heat of day
Hide in a place you know that no one ever goes
Who we are
Why can't I just curl up onto the night,
I'd want to hear you say
Till the sound's so thick it turns the sky to smoke
Over the bridge and towards the sea
She said, "i don't mind, no, no I don't care
Don't know where you are
We were made in the dark
I wanna live like we live in the summer
My life is a fleeting one
Tired boughs reaching for the light
Walk alone
But it was too damn hot to speak that much
And though you might be what I'm looking for
Russell lives in Cov, that a really brutal place
The future ripped from a tattered page
Gone forever, the writing on the wall
A bloody tomb
The ships come in, it's Christmastime
Pretty bird
In the northern snow
Like coming home
And if you look in his eyes
No one knows better than i
This boy I know, he has a heart of glass
Our love has never had a leg to stand on
We played hide and seek in waterfalls
Well buy me the fastest car and throw me the keys
This pipe and these needles are my only guide
Another light is another minute 
The last night on Maudlin Street
And silence is danger, but it's not required here, so why you scared
I come back too 
I want to make much of You
I'll give until there's nothing left
And she holds me in her small hand 
Never thought to ever think twice
You're here just a little while
We are temporary arrangements
Guess you'll stick around
Evey scar and weal
Following deep tracks, the boats kept passing by
Hold tight, fire's almost out
There are promises broken and promises kept
Somebody, somebody tell me
With his methadone
The useless thing again
To pray it's not too late, I hope it's not too late
I lay myself down to make it so
Everyone, is gonna end, up there,
"Oh won't you take my hand"
What'd you say I bless
Though the pages are numbered
Where we'll sleep on the beach
And when you cry, darling, I wish you'd feel my love
And we'll heal our hearts
With all their illusions of choices
I'll carry it to my grave
I'm gonna miss the way I kissed you
But they'll never throw it back to you
I ain't jealous of the way that you're living
Sexy girl, sexy girl
And there's no need to hurry
I watched them go 'round and 'round
That only love can find
And away he gone dark 
This heart of mine was so beaten down
I understand your 
Though I feel regret, I know that you regret this more
I was strong, clearminded and blind
They're not part of your close surroundings
Bye bye baby, baby bye bye
Northern lights and skies ablaze
Sleep my little child and rest in me
And then she starts to sneeze
To shadow an endless dream
And the stars refuse to shine for you
Might have got that information anywhere
Valoa lämmittävää
I can't say when I'll leave you for good
Cool breeze and autumn leaves
Begging for my hand
You've been flashing white light
He realized there are times
Does the soul understand I do
There's a man in the street
Well it seems times change, it all just rolls away
It's alright 
I know who the hangman is
I can feel it in the rotten air tonight
We were born into the new year
Täällä ilman sua ei oo mitään, ei ilman sua tuu mitään
I'm back and I'm throwing
But now I'm lonely all the same
That you are good at simply everything you try to do
Get up and hit up all the hot spots in town
Yeah some feelings they never go
Someday you'd return it
Did I disappoint you or let you down
You've lost your sunlight, your body's filled with night
Only New York can make it right
That look on your face
Goes up into his bedroom
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
I'm like a fly in Harry's Bar
Where I was meant to be
Stricken with the winter cold, sippin' the burnin' hot
Why I can't stay
Your wings are broken
Oh, I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up,
Never let no woman tell you she loves you
You know just where I keep my better side
It was so extreme I controlled my dreams
Don't touch the magic wall, the sign of the crystal ball
And I might have if not for daddy's bad advice
And shortly after, the atmosphere comes to life
Always makes things feel so unfinished
And in truth I saved you
Too many memories
Exactly how many times have I heard that one today
Well, that's how sick I was when JRue
A man inside the boy
You are my best family so far
You gon' think about me when I'm gone
toquémonos más
You're gonna see it someday
Disappear within my mind
And empty rooms tend to make
That could blow your head off
Got some cocaine from a friend
You're still here
These are the tears that we cry
In a melody sustainin'
Someone will come
When I'm wiser and I'm older
That You alone are so worthy of
Come inside for a while
But do you ever wonder what we could have been
Look for clovers in grassy lawns
She got with me 'cause her hubby was a weirdo
Even though the flower dies somethings by it's side
How in the morning everything will be all right
Like the world's tallest selfsupporting tower
And a voice calls out the numbers, and it sometimes mentions mine
And all I've got is your hand
To waste it all on someone like you
Did have some fun
Make you windy windy we were so windy
And they've given you a reason to fight
A constant state 
With gloomy shade of thy still empery,
I've lost count of how many times we've disagreed
I want him but we're not right
A giant in the room
I want to hear it on the air today
'Cause they've all got longing in their eyes
So tell me how do you feel
Don't walk away
Don't you know that you're my pride
In one hand I've a Bible
Outro amor se acabou
Oh, hold its hands, it'll feel like lightning
To an altar of diamonds
Ooh, once I got you in the mood
I have become pure water x
Endless pointless
To be moving Moving Moving my way home
Nothing to run from
I saw you there in blue
I can hear your heartbeat
This dance is hard
When you fall, when you fall
Regrets so scattered through our minds
But I don't want to blow it girl,
That all my friends come over and eat
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
I grow a space suit in the blink of an eye
And if you want to have other people watch you while you eat it
And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again
And beckon for the sweet, soft, summer breeze
It makes me look much older
And build a house
It's twelve o clock and it's getting late
You're to me than any any son
Dusonul saranghae saranghae
I met this guy he said that
Somewhere in the dark is your past
'Cause they come out in the dark
Your collection of tongues you keep framed in parlor with your bibles and guns, the fetus of Christ with a fistful of scars
Follow me into just one more Spring
Lies in the hands that set me, that set me free
A good used paperback living bible
The things you hide, what you don't say
Through joy and pain
I prayed so hard the rain would come
There's nothing left for me to borrow
I live on the blue planet 
With the lights out
And I tell myself that you light up my life
Du weißt um die Welt, die du mir erschliesst
Dread in my heart
A cold sound in the air
I'm call her shorty she gonna call me love
My lonely days are over, and life is like a song
The love we share will never end
If you get to close your gonna know what I mean
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price
The time, it passes by
Please, no more sorrow
Wird dir morgen wieder genommen
You were mine and there is no one who's like me
She looked like a chocolate eclair
We can never fall
Let me hold you until the morning comes 
Come what may
Where I need to go
would have intimidated any mitt that ever tried to catch her
Every time it's the same
Whoowhoowhoo, whoohooo, whoohoooooh 
I don't know, what I'm getting
Love me the way I love you
Feel you like the last beautiful touch before a final rest
billot
And ever since I saw his face 
From this building, from this wall
Lots of milky tea only onward, forward, inward, in, over a field I don't want to do this
And I'll give you more than years
The rivers are wide
And the problem's my honesty
Nobody's perfect all the time
But now, I don't think too much all the time
More luck than good judgment
I'll give until there's nothing left to give
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
Seems long since summer time
Wishing that something would happen
Is the moonlight just a flame for her memory
Or take your time
Thrashing over me in waves
A glimpse of religion, a piece of coming closer
When you dream of me
And got some pliers, held him, wound up, and yanked it out right there
And getting all feared up,
Take us exactly where we most likely need to be
Your best friend in life is not your mirror
Said no matter what tie she's got
I took to the fears of all I held dear
Oh, the grass Burn in bed
When you water down my name
So let's take it higher sweetie Let's take it higher sweetie
Pretty soon Vic was seeing red
And watch the sun rise
Yes, old age will distill you
I know, I know, I know, I know what to say
Snowflakes in the air
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw
So gimmie a little time and you'll be knowin' your good lovin'
They need foregiveness
In love's valley of dreams
And if that's all we have you will find we need nothing more
Take your time
Of having to stop
Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind
I'm up against the wall
She got around
Tiny star she guides my way
Wir haben so lang geredet, draußen wurde es hell
To stay in Grand Hotel
The city is a jungle better learn to fight
And I'm swimming through the ashes of another life another life
I would catch bullets with my bare hands
Either way I think
I know, hey I ought to leave the young thing alone,
A fairgrounds painted swing 
I'm going home someday
In every skyline,
I never said that it felt good to know everything that you needed to know
I'd own no home, I'd own no land
Did you believe them when they told you they discovered you
I'm gonna live till I die, I'm gonna live to get high
Now I'm just a friend
We don't need no father or mother
I'm only sure of things I know now don't exist
You're overcome,
Hush don't you make a sound
Before all the days are gone
By believing in you
Made of stone or of concrete
That I have not been to since your goodbye
I'll see you on the road, ooh
Just staring, closed faces
Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, on his way to hubcap heaven
That lie near the Moorlough Shore
They say that it's okay, but I say don't breathe that shit in
Steamy glasspane window we could only travel at night bang bang bang on the door
I lay around in corners
Gravitated towards a taste
Falling down, all the way to, to love
Only the lonely
These words in shadowplay
These are the moments in life that I seek
I'm yearning, I'm burning
Trying to find someone to sell her cocaine
There is still a Lord
Why does the sun go on shining
Any day now
The photographs without the faces
That even at night overshadows the moon that sings to you
And say that we tried
So far away  so outer space 
My dog said you ain't no freak so you 'bout to prove my man wrong
You're always amazed 
Take it in your stride my son the world is yours
If your fortune ever fails you
Every night the motion must be fixed by glue
Till the next day
I sure need a good companion
We'll rent expensive cars
You have been the one
And Sunny skies has to stay behind
All my matter's expired so I run
I've been lonely when I'm with you
And it's crazy, it's like no one can save me this time
J'ai foutu ma vie en l'air
Just pretend that you know me baby
Sag deiner Mutter,dass du sie liebst
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
That got steamed up
Still smell the rain, distance aside
She covered me with wings and
So call me when you get where you're going
Apart from the moments so dear to my heart
Mistakes I can't defend
You're in a dance and you must maintain until it's done
Did you hear the wind of dream just passing by
And all that lamentation of the leaves,
Just the way I'm supposed to be
Now this one is ours
And when you hear this song, I hope that you will see
I stand on my feet when I hold her
What do you say, do you say to fate
When I opened up my eyes see you standing beside our bed
Because freedom is wasted on me
And if you watch a girl watch her, girl
Open your eyes, you're now a bird
Misteriosamente a lua sobre nada
Will things be any different
And I cry
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul
You called me out from the dark, and brought me into the light,
Life has a way that's unpredictable
Going back to the sea
A crystalclear canvas is my masterpiece
There's room enough, she's generous
Straight through the ghettos and without lights
We'll make a future dream be ours
The God of small things
Beauty emanates from every word that you say
When morning comes
Through the chair
Ally the languished lips
But the songs about you keep coming out
They chanced to look at what was inside
Don't know where we are
And it covers up the cars,
I wanna be the gum on your train seat
May angels lead you in
Find a way to remain
Nothing that's worth regretting
Essayer de plaire à quelqu'un
A telephone that rings, but who's to answer 
Come take us high above our time
If he could return the love she showed
The great indoors
And the clouds all form a geometric shape 
Se as meninas do Leblon
Jo, I know you would say,
If he's out on a date then her life's in ruins
And your mouth tastes like sunshine, baby, but your eyes are all cool buried in my arms
Have mine it's better on you anyway
There's no one else, you know
Will it go on if we start again
Now the days are getting colder and the burning of our limbs
Oh no, I didn't mean to say what I did say
Remember the night you were with me
My forest of glass
Meeting is such sweet sorrow
For a while
Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from 
'Cause when she comes along, she could be breaking it
Don't waste another minute of my precious time
Only seeing blue
We were running through the autumn leaves
Just like it's climbed right out of my
Pancho please forget what I said
Save your days I don't save days 
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin yeah
Got woken up by birds and bees
Blasting their treble tones
And I can hear when they're playing their love songs cause the kids in the yard stop playing with their toys
Has your family ever forgotten you and driven away
Of goin' home someday
There's a chapter on loss and a ghost who won't die
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober I want to be the only one
Sugar, I wanna taste the way you feel inside
Ooh, yeah
Guide you to the light babe
Cast aside old doubt
Take my hand
Oh, wasn't it a long way down,
But baby I was lonely
Yo Ain't no better man, for this hype track
A tiny little worlds that tickles your ear drum
Is washed away like an oceans tide
I know this something is here goes
You're gonna be the death of me
Life is designed With unfinished lines 
The sunlight swims away when you come around
I've got a planet on the line
Let me just be such a deep surprise
Train tracks
Know you'll wander
I need your name
And everything else will follow
Here is a strange and bitter crop
Counting stars again
And it feels like it's wearing you down
Put on your dancing shoes, dance away your blues
I know I owe my brothers
Woman don't try to love me
I don't laugh and I don't smile
I never thought it'd be this way
Me and my friend, we are not friendly anymore
Will you rise or fall
In the desperate kingdom of love
And she had to bring here this
You were playing like a devil wearing wings, wearing wings
Why does she fly alone
She never said you'd only get one chance
But I won't remember anything at all
Scowling away at nothing
Running out of room
Everyone's leaving
I'm in the dark
So dream all right ha
And how my days they spin me 'round
Go away
Should we take the day
It was who taught me how to write these kinds of equations
When a time
No matter how unrealistic
Can I ask where you are tonight
And when I set my eyes on you
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Living on a diet of Chocolates and Cigarettes
All living, all our sin the same
She said, "let's stop the car and slow dance,
You're in my thoughts, you're in my head again
And always know I won't be back
I'm just sitting here daydreaming about you and all the things you do
"Well, all I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head
From drinking the ocean
Just pretend
Forget your scars, we'll forget mine
Put the pillow under your head
One heart in space racing on
How could I stand here
And the streets are all in tears
Sometimes I feel so bad
His tooth to his dog's tail, find a stick, wind up, and then throw it
Then you turn and stop
Ten miles tall in this an empty space 
So let your bare feet bleed
Where everything you fear
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day
Breaking the day in two
I'm a fool for that sound in your sighs
Say your prayers and turn out the lights
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
When you're living in an innocent world
The procession moved on, the shouting is over
Cinder and smoke
Baby love child
Heaven is of honey
Sure she'll call you "baby", she'll look in your eye
Quieren ver adonde van tomados de la mano
A Young girl give me a good luck charm
To work out all these cycles and why I'm standing here
Down in the valley, the industrial estate,
You talk in your sleep
Empty and cold 
So he's well aware how vital a father figure is
Una playa lejos de acá con caracoles y su mamá
No way to speak
I know that there's a boy inside the man
I will feel so glad to go
'Cause love is tough
When I look around
She eyes someone who doesn't have the change 
They echo off the floor and walls
Ha ha ha You died out long ago
Catch a wave on the air today
Everyone wants body counts and I just want to cry
It makes a beautiful sound
He dreams of days that he can still remember now
For better or worse, our history is too real to hate
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath"
Oh, stupid you, I bet' told the truth
Ponder the vastness
Fool, I wonder if you know yourself at all
Take me way down
If the stars say that you can not love
Won't tomorrow come
All the twofaced lies
So it falls apart
But I couldn't bear the burden of never havin' said goodbye
Whatcha doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing and
I'd write you a song
Well thanks for the time, I had to think a spell
Har en massa fuffens för sig, jag vet inte vad det rör sig om
These cells are virgins
I wish I'd never lied
We said "hi" and kissed with some bravado
Try to find a way to make more time, but things are the way they are
And lonely tears can only hope to freeze
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me here, keep me here
Oh, isn't it time Woah
Doves cried when she tried to fly
I'm drunk and so is everyone else
This is a movement made of the youth, 
I know there's something,
A bed of moss was granted,
Song is made with sugar and lemonade
Can you fly
Now everything that's ever gone before, is just a blur
Just a slob like one of us
Everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometime
I know that he has found another friend
Not a desire and not a need
Every time I'm forced down
I wish I could just get it right
And I feel sand slipping underneath my toes 
Just say the word and I will disappear
Of getting high
It's a rainy night and your headlights hit the water in the street
Lets walk away from this hell
And to know you is hard; we wonder
Worries have to be driven far away
My last transmission down the drain
Never clears up above our heads
And medicine makes us move inside a little slower
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Gon' build that city on a hill
Silver strings spun a gentle song the gentle song
If one swept the world away
I am done
Through windows of our past lives
¿quien le tendrá paciencia
Candle is blue, could see me through
And the sunshine shone from the sunshine above
I'm consumed with desire
Softly, children
Well my God, what the hell am I supposed to do
The woman is strong in her warm, bed of lies
Well, future is diminished by what today we did
'Cause I'm not that kind of whore
And why my angel eyes ain't here
Fallen walls all around 
Swears he'll make what he can of this
The sun has never seen
Do you know where the end is
I need some kicks
In a blue light
Now here we stand
They're just there to try and make the people free,
I wonder what would happen if nobody left
What if I was someone different in your only history
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
You tell me what you want I'll tell you what you get
So I don't cry, I don't cry no more
You'd better put some beauty back, boy
There lies a seed
I can not see my way out
And her surface will start to break
And my heart slows down
Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
Midnight cars roll past
She was waiting for her mom to come back
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Lay down your money and you play your part
And you run from it then, now you can't escape
Open your heart babe and let me live
I'll never be alone, no matter where I go
während man stolpert und fällt
And they all went down and did the porcupine
I'll see them, I'll find a flight around the world
And picking up the pieces
You love me yes you do
Personne sous mon balcon
When I said goodbye, I'm sorry
I never gave him nothing I remember
You never, never need to part
What if God was one of us
I will try to dry my eyes
I'm running, running
And though it was predicted
Susanne, don't you go on and cry
Yes I need you at the dimming of the day
I got a phosphorescent secret
Cause nothing,
At the side of the bed were soft cushions
I'm trying to get through
Each time a curtain opens
We lie together when we say it's love
But you don't understand, I wish you understood
We can lay in the bed
Of idle days
Faces under water
'Cause round for round,
If I was a simple man
I'll feel the toil it brought you
I thought about following any of these ships to the end of their journey
It's what I'm feeling
All alone and mad
Hold me in your warm hand
The word 'Hurricane' is the name given to nature's strongest storm
Infront of friends and family
Fools rush in where wise men never go, 
You said every road is a good road
And how my love it's let me down
And as I wonder where you are
I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
And wastes the day working
Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow
No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
Por el amor de una mujer
We're in the privacy of our love
There's nothing more deadly
I'm safe in a corner
On some picturesque grave
I am you, you are me
May we see clearly in a different light
This sordid affair is ending in tears
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
What can I say any simpler
Father once told me that the night is so ghastly
Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks
The music dies
With two eyes open and two eyes staring back
The silence of a falling star
Cut out the brights of the oncoming cars on the highway
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
Open up your heart
Baby, you're the only one that can save me
Turn your hazard lights of when you see them hoes Drive slow, homie
We'd fix the past and pave the way
The gents are gonna try so hard
Mm, stay open
Vrajangana sunayakam sada sukha pradayakam
But just a simple melody
Let me run through the water
When love will end,
We could head back to your crib
And everybody was feeling high
I used to cry for Tracy because I wanted to see him again,
When we were lovers
Depended on it
Moonlit river
Into the night
The night I looked at you
You've been waiting to break since you woke up this morning
The words are too rough, I can't shake it from off my head
I'm fast asleep
It is all unreal in this world of ideals
And in the morning after the night I fall in love with the light
To keep the vultures from your back
Lonely blue and sad times
s�brent briderlekh, s�brent
Lazy kisses
Country fool that I am
Once you really loved me,
On drugs in the dark with the one I love 
And touch your face while we're both sinking, stinking, thinking
But the feeling does come back again
With the darkness coming down
Yeah please turn red 
And I saw the mountain fall
I sing it loud and clear and I'll always be waiting for you
But if there's nothin' I can do to make amends, baby
Waiting in the wings, painters shade
But you can't fly unless you let your
Should there be a stormy sea,
Another disappointing day
And heal what was cut and bruised
That was how he liked to have his teeth pulled out
I could taste the fire on your breath
As I fall to the earth
Or have you moved away
If she don't tell you then she never has to change it
So cut below the surface and try hard not to notice
With all the things that
Oh take me all the way
I promise baby, one day I'll come back to you
I need to hear that you'd die for me
I forgot fools run
Yes all that we were, all that we knew
The police said that they cannot help your daughter
Through on your pretty head
Not cold and windy
Gonna be alright
I was younger once
Oh how did it go so very wrong
So don't you weep my little man
Whole life ahead of her
'Cause I don't even feel it
I've been walking around all day thinking
Loneliness
This black hawk can't find its place
El mundo esta perdido amor
Candy says she wants me with her down in Candyland
Dreamland is hell and I know it for sure
I want to meet them tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, God is great
Grey like the gravel under our shoes
True words that I should know
I'll chase you for the words you owe
That look on your face
Like there was any law
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
To do everything you wanted to
I'd still make all the same mistakes
My guiding light
Kissed my mother on the face
So give me a sign
I get to be myself and I get to sing
All these faces faces
These are good friends, these are mine
Cover the floor same as be fore
Kan du mer enn ditt Fader Vår
What will they do, when the money runs dry
Until the morning comes 
Like a decoration for the holiday
I was waiting on my angel to come
My shadow days are over now
Of the perfect man who may not be you,
My bones are inside
But painting's creating, and I'm just erasing
Wonder where your heart came from
If you won't call my name
My mind changed me so much I can't even trust myself
Ja, da har du lovet bort din sjel
Let my shadows prove the sunshine
Always wanting something more
To lose me to this bed
I would still hear you
Be crazy forever
Show some understanding
In our hearts we're all for one and one for all
And you say not now, maybe later
And they'll stumble around like hypocrites
I wished your love away
And believe it's true
Den mit dein weißen Steinen
And then I can come back to the harbour
Kein Geräusch durchdringt den Raum der Nacht
And many still to be
Dust in a moment
We're born into this world Never, never know the reason why
And expose all the lies
Put my bones in an empty street
I lost my mind, never to find
Had the perfect job called life
Everything I make, I only make for you
Where are all those tears coming from
Here's two for being unaware
All the pimps and prostitutes wave you down at stopping signs
Never really thought about it
But when it comes of course
The love I stole from your lips,
In the dark
Fell in love with everything
Like a little bit of revelation
From Las Vegas to right here
The sky is red, and little kids are running, screaming in the street
When will the water stop I know that you can't say
Tu cuerpo es una parte
While seahorses played
Das hat die Welt noch nicht gesehen
No place in you for me
Be me, be mine
And we'd lay there in the darkness
De ton retour, tout ce qui nous attend
Your face has changed
Her wishes that never come true
Never had an easy love
Oh baby don't leave me alone
On that very last day, he said
If you didn't care what happened to me
We are the bruised and the tender
Like a child would his mother
With my family, and my pastor, and my grandfather who's dead
There's no one in the world who could replace you
We just know that the fight ain't fair
Down in the chambers of law there's a blueprint
I stash it in my tiny house
And weal I will cry every day
Nothing at all
Don't wasting what we do,
Well, today a friend told me this sorry tale
Oa oa vento dá na vela 
Es war zu heiß für sie in dieser Stadt,
You must follow your heart
In these modern times, what your first class said
You're the sunshine trying to break through
California, I hope that it wakes you
I'm trying to make since of me and you
Temaneku oasis on the distant horizon
I'll just think of you and you'll still be
"Home alone, you call that a late night"
And you wanted not to cry
The highway is my legacy
Under a coat of night, it's ohsocomforting
The first day that I met you
Sometimes I'd like just to ask her
Outta debt, outta dodge, out of breath
With transitory pictures
We got nothing that ill say
If I could open my eyes I wouldn't do it
If I could bottle up the sea breeze I would take it over to your house
Flieg bitte los, hier wartet keiner
Many words, many dreams I've got to give
Never to see your face again;
I hope I can see
And she don't need advice that'll center her
Never come around 
I know that darkness before the dawn
Why don't yousing write paint make
Baby, why'd you have to run 
Falling in love with the shivering engines 
She accepted the news she never expected
So I got something new to see
But infinite sympathy's completely gone
Then my brothers and the others are lost at sea
We'll sing the rest in
I wanna live to live and take my chances
Like I'm still trying
The trouble with the straight and the narrow
I heard about your story from a friend
And maybe two is better than one
I never knew I was given the best one from the deck
Across the sky
I'd still feel for you
They'll be firs to turn their backs away
How would your bad side burn
He got me a time,
Il y a de l'uniformité partout
Away from the city
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
I don't regret a thing
Then this is where I can't get back from
He says my destiny
Say it again, say it again
Will never rest
So believe what you want to
I'll turn around
We can bring back the old days again
It sheltered me, from nothing but the weather
To check my head in your pane
Like I found myself in pieces on the hotel floor
Because they gargle with the finest champagne
No, I'm not a gogetter
A menor licença
Are you waiting for a lightning bolt
And I'm trying to understand myself and pinpoint who I am
She hath my heart in thrall
For every living thing
When will it stop
How much of the day will I watch fade away
De outros oceanos
Fallen walls all around
Just to see them fall to see them break
There was nothing to hold so we let it go
But if I make the pearly gates
And forget your name
You better run for your life
I never thought about it before
I would love to pay for you
His mother did separate the whites from the violence
Brother, brother
I close my eyes and remember
Sucarcitanga candanam namami nanda nandana
Like the grasses that blew in the warm summer breeze
And can't we just pretend
I walk on down to make a stand,
But that was then and she is now, I once was lost with her I'm found on this early April morning
I love the way you smell
Like you should be kissed
There is a view that reaches far 
Right back and let it in
Promise not to abandon you, please let me go
But I won't face the ground
Get nervous every time
Who sailed around the world and found
But in this racing world there is no place for me
Of island chains swept with the tide
Refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child
It might have been a while
Then everything else starts to overflow
There's a harvest buried in the bottom of the sky
Been thinking dirty thoughts about you a thousand times
Let your thoughts come in
There's a high wind in the trees
I don't take the helping hand
As heaven blue her light fails
Always I'll want you
When I'm trying to keep my head above your charm
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
I'm coming up only to hold you under
Let me tell you the story of a soldier named Dan
Have you ever been told that you look like a llama
But I couldn't see the light, 'cause I couldn't get it right
They look up to the stars and wonder where You might be
Come and wash me clean a nervous step into the future
Scales were gone and faces lighter
The monuments are whispering your name
And you will be pleased to know 
They were given books to poison their minds
You make it easy
Like some picture show
And I will hold you, touch you, and make you my woman tonight
I don't dare to think of you
There are places, there are places, you can go to
I talked about September
Don't turn back
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
The chances few
Holding my breath through tunnels, well
Do you believe me now 
Don't try to make it work for me
It's nothing at all Thinking about you
My heart
And I can't breathe when you cry
I wonder were you come from
Climbed on the windowledge
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
And I'm feeling alone
And the shadows on the floor
He's the one I do adore, 
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
The sun was setting to the left of the plane 
Can't choose the situation and friend
Pretty, pretty star
As long as you're with someone never left alone
When the one thing you fear
And wiped the sleep from my eyes
Everything is fine in the end
We'll find a way
Inside you I just want to wipe away your fears
I've got to get to you
That bliss comes at a price
Giving love is essential
And some are fighters
To be ashamed like me
It took hours and hours to scrub it out
So I don't cry no more
The crow, the cat, the bird and the bee
Cause your lips don't move
Oh the things you'll be happy
Well they'll never believe it 
Is the time before action occurs
And she's always gone too long
Something perfect for that student
To hold her back would be a sin
The setting sun shines on your hair
And the saints, the angels all agree
Mm  Maybe What did she look like
Feel my hands, love, 'cause I'm numb from the neck down
Walk around
Do you see me when you fantasise tonight'll be your night
Hands you a love only
I gotta find a new career
Since we fell apart I've been nothing but blue
Oh, this is the start of something good
You kissed me on the forehead, now this kiss is giving me a concussion
A slipper by the fireplace
Are you eyes just singing the blues
Oh yeah
From each part to unfurl
I'll make it bleed fate, racing to the gate pleading "take me in," I'm
Up to th St Union Square
And so poorly sung alone
There are times I could come to you and hurt you
Wonderful and healthy
Soon we'll manufacture replicas
Roots are sucking, thieving from my source
Kai tu mane glostai,
Seen fortune in my lifetime
'Cause every time that I try you will question me
Shut up and go to bed
Where the far reaches of this mind
Shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on
Through your weary head
Its building a prison
There is a house built out of stone
Get some tickets for the dance
When most of us are sleeping
Another moment
I read all sorts of things 
The shadow has a dream where
I said, She's my butterfly butterfly butterfly
You, you brought joy to my world
Coke machines, firemen, landing gear and cement
Other people who sign up for judgin' but can't take no
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
I had a very disturbing dream last night
This is my perfect day
Remember the love we had x
But I know where to start
How many ears of corn in the niblets
Weatherwise, it's such a lovely day
And we lose, what's to lose, when you haven't done wrong
Found on a beach picked up in your hand held so close
And a long way from home
When all the spirits burn in lies as center grief by steel
Give me a kiss
Kill myself, the guy in front of me
Is it unfair to ask you
The best kisser that I ever knew
I got my best dress on
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Took me away from sight and the place I know
Reactor reactor do you mind, straighten
Wishin' on your name
The moon begins to sing 
My soul is saved, I see city lights
Well I may never know
Is the shape of things to come
They brought me here 'cause I can't take care
That you're spending with someone else
Because before too long you'll be a memory
Sleeping softly while I sing
Heard a shout of someone calling
And one step back
If you let it shine, you can free your mind
Harder, harder, harder, harder, harder
I'm looking for a remedy
Up till the sun rises
Speculate what we feel
See the star, probably gone too far
She wants to rest, she can't till we have
And it's like every time you look at me
So I can forget them easily
Those guys from the folk band
Nobody cares about you
Oh ah You make it eaiser to be ooh ah
As a mother hears
Of the living people breathing the air today
She was aggressively passive to the point where she
And I loved that nigga to death, no motherfuckin' joke
She shouldn't be dead, she was too busy talking
And said "Good luck, I hope heaven and hell
And I know what's been on your mind
With children my time is so wastefully spent
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
My swollen eyes
My room too small
Oh I bury my head into his hands
Todo me parece
Close your eyes, baby
But now it seems that nothing can change your mind
And we're happy to let you know that, we always will be
Jesus the Mexican boy, born in a truck on the fourth of July
Part of the job of being a man
Well a few things going my way this time
Hey I've flown away
Your only here, just for a while
I look straight in the window, try not to look below
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I said baby don't worry
I'll never love again
And this is what she told the gathered round
Keep on wonderin' about you
Like a woman
My room has a big white bed
Your love's the warmest place the sun ever shines
From our own separate sides
So when I'm suffering through some awful drive
I've never been too good a change
Close their sleepy eyelids, say "Goodnight" to the sun
And you'll look to the heavens above
The women in my life be confusion and shit
Together, to be
Driving around, living the dream
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hoping I'm next
The Good Lord would come take him
Then I won't understand till the end of my days
We wait in your heart
They're the legions of the damned from an unholy land
The calendar was the saddest thing
Of tears of loves lost in the days gone by
It's late, so look straight,
Better I feel
So listen, listen please
You can replace my fears
Was not supposed to make you cry
The channel numbers change
Run away from the things you've done
You said get them away
Hasta llegar a comprender
The juniper bends
The women in Poughkeepsie
I'd fogotten how to smile
And mold it into something better
It's a tune we both should know
Siamese, Portuguese, dirty knees, look at these
Send me
But if you would shine your love down here
UFO's that come from other planets
That my one is falling for tricks
I trust belief belongs to me
Safer than it was two years ago
'Cause I feel it
All alone
She thinks I'm having a bad dream
Noye du sunul saranghae saranghae
In her right dresser tied
What's your plan do you think you're a man
Obscured by clouds, or underground
Do the clothes make the man
But I know that it was not meant to be
State of gray, state of sin
True, I need to be in love
See this glass is falling
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
Deep in thought I forgive everyone
Sometimes it's better not to know
That's what we'll become
And now the hearts are breaking just a bit
What in heaven's name have you done
And I'll send you my words
There's two days, I had to leave
We'll expose all the bicyclists who really are
And I'll shake you, ooh ooh
Nighttime at the boulevard
I see, this is how my little life could be
So look at you now
If you wanna try, you could come out and see me
And there are times I know when I will have to chase you
I never come around
Sunny skies sleeps in the morning
Because I console myself that Hallmark cards are true
Everything comes apart
Oh, when will you wake up and get it
Forget we're dead
Come on please don't be upset my darling, please don't be upset, I'll do anything baby, just don't be upset
'Cause the truth is I'm not alone
To the skies of Heaven
I hope to lose myself for good
And if I didn't hurt so much, you know I'd give you it all
And the streets I see, will stand the test of time
What if we were meant to be together
The way it shines for you and I
I called it home, for a moment of my life
The rainiest days
I really feel quite sad
Then she said her name was Cherie
Until the day it was taken away
All those words came undone and now I'm not the only one
Oh, child
Do I start to feel like I'm losing myself
I guess there isn't any point delaying 
Who will show us how to read the signs
Not much chance for survival if the neon bible is true
I get caught in the rain
It was nothing at all
NASA is on your side
Our heart are in the blossoms
And what she sees she can't believe
They are dead, they are dead
The sun will rise up, and you'll be in Freedom
Underneath the missing roads
I want all that is not mine
And we make love beautifully
That can mesmerize the soul
You can't believe a love like hers
From the bottom of my heart, dear
This is the beat of our praise
Al Green, oh, Al Green, oh yeah
So I'm just waiting on fate to come
All those things you have
It makes no difference, wrong or right
Deliver me, strength from inside me
Here come the sun king
Save my money
Around
You'll be right half the time
Oh bitte, bitte ja
And yes sir, oh no, and yes sir she lookin' so throw
Like a thief in the night
What good are songs with no dances, I pray
I could never fall for an empty page anyway
A chilly wind is blowing
A thousand miles away
I held the stars to light where you are
As we waltzed through the streets of Manhattan
Excuse me did she say
You're back at the wheel
Sinking through dark black holes
So write them in the sand
You won't need a real job because I would love to pay for you
Choose your mood and then start to wreak havoc
When I close my eyes
Give me mouth to mouth
And if they ask what you're doing here, look over at me, baby
Crawls back into bed
And every wall that once was clean has turned a shade of grey
But it ain't how I live while I'm here
My friend
Wasn't it you who held off a surrender
All the colors were bone light and sky new
What would you ask if you had just one question
Ah You, you got a beautiful reason
And stole a kiss at every street cafe
Trouble me or I'll go, yeah I'm human too
So let us not talk falsely now
You're closer than anyone has even been
Made of broken glass and famous haircuts
Because I spend all this time all locked up inside
'Cause mine has come through consideration,
There's nothing so I must escape
Hold your breath and pretend
Blame me for the thorns my friend
Tell me why my angel eyes ain't here
What's cold, you mustn't await
That it really doesn't matter at all
Sweetheart
Every night's a special occasion
A life, a journey's end in one
This is very interesting
And I've been walkin' on these streets so long
Spitting into your own reflection gazing back 
Yes, I remember who you are 
Now you've too tired to care
No one else can understand 
Forget all your doubts
Deep down underneath
Though we're worlds apart
Started rockin' the sleeve, I can't ball with no Jordans
But our numbers they only get higher from here
And all of the times you saved me from death
No longer making sense to me
With what was left of our fair city
Her hair falling all around me
There's nothing you can do"
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
I'm a G prepared to die for what's important to me
Every time he goes, she dies
Tonight with one voice
Look deep in your soul
In the corner of a darkened cell
And so, you see, I have come to doubt
You want her, you need her
And I can't see the view from the eyes you look at me through, oh no
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
Their gold teeth mirror
While we're apart
From the start they didn't know exactly why was
Suddenly is soon, sooner than you think
Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow
But so much to talk about
Und im Garten blüht die Illusion, das kenn' ich schon
All her ideas were like smoke rings, I had to know things
I could hide a million years and try to believe
I could never understand
'Cause something deep inside me wants to turn you black and blue
In my pearl and my diamond shoe
If it's a broken part, replace it
If your friends were all your dates
It was made up in your mind, could be anyone, anywhere
Now I lay and watch the green leaves
I'll think of nice things
I can't find forever in your eyes
Because you were on my mind
That I'm an island in your sea
I will drop to my knees
And I say
Oh in this day
To a fight nobody could win
A deeper shade of Brown
His fading words were
To say over coffee 
Today is gonna be the day
Sing to the world tonight
Possibilities and sweeter dreams
Yeah I'm your shorty boy but you already know
The sea goes on forever in a symphony of song
Our love's all burnt out
She's something of a tragedy
I can't get through
Bird in a tree
How long I got to wait on my girl
You're used the sound of a heart that's breaking
Such a stillness; calm as the owl glides
Hey man, do you wanna hear a story about me
He fought them all the way though
und es fand uns wieder zum Glück
Telling you when you're asleep,
I'm caught in the undertow
The best advice I ever had was leave what was behind
We got the money so we'll put you down
She wants to get near to you,
But they're running pretty fast back on their word
Like the voice that cried on the lonesome tide
You fucked it friend, it's on it's head, it struck the street
He has the knowledge of the wind to guide him on
I call the magical child
So we can go away
You can turn me inside out
No matter how you try
He'll be sailing 'cross the ocean,
Hold fast to the break of day light where
Arms out, knees bend, the motion flows
I thought playing that loving game would never be simple again
And he calls me moonlight too
My selfish heart hopes you don't go first
To let go and forget
It's not too much time left for us to breathe
Well, it is and if you stop giving into it
And fallen into you
I should smile, that's exactly what I do
Like it did on Thursday
Well I could leave tomorrow
You had your chance, but you didn't grab it
No one's heart attack
When I die
Wander or leave
To the furthest place you'll ever be
I know there's something more
When the time will be gone
Have to meet the sun and moon and
You must fly closer to the sea"
A poison victim, look of steel
Flashlight as your guide
If you ever fall, I'm gon' be around
You tellin' me with these seven years of probation
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes;
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
Shadows haunt and taunt your hand
What you're feeling
Started crawling through my bones
He gutted  sturgeons up from the silver bay
Stepping out into the light
And when you feel like nobody's on your side
Just like everybody here
Baby says I can't come with him
Of the order of things
Will you be an astronaut or will you sail the sea
I loved you the first time I saw you
It's never made it all the way from shore to shore, from west to east
But you're a song I wanna sing all night long
That I saw in your eyes 
And I need you at the dimming of the day
It started with a flash of light
And I'll never forget all the things I saw that evening
About time you lost
Just like us, he shoots stray cats for fun
And you hold me in your young girl's hand 
I was just a little girl, but I can't go back
His gentleness flows and flows for miles
Drops onto the forehead of the waiting boy,
Your name in lights 
Right through the crest on the breast of your school shirt
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
Dirty records from another time
Seen all good things and bad
How did I get here
I fly away to another dimension
I tried carrying the weight of the world
It's all really matters
If you're the last one alive
But I'm quite alright hiding today
Catch me drinking of your wine
We end it, it's all over,
Like clouds in the sky
I hear your voice calling me out of the darkness
The way you make us all smile
The ocean is in the tub
Always cry for love, never cry for pain
Overlook
That you're gone
Dreh Dich nicht um, hier wartet keiner
I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock I'm full of love
Your cold marble floors and secret doors,
I take a dive and go as deep as I can go
They can't get the grape and the grain
I promise one day I'll come back for you
'Cause, I'm on my way, yes, I'm on my way
They come for Women, weed and weather
I'm not certain how much time I may have left, so I'll be brief
The thief, he kindly spoke
Two scared little runaways
Spin the bottle on the ground
When he found I had no coins to bum
Seven wonders of the world he'll lay before your feet
'CAUSE I've done everything and now I'm sick of tryin'
I'll call you on the phone
So everything else can wait for you to do
Anything can happen
I won't deny the change
All the time
He left home to find his own, now all he has are lies
It is out of her hands
There are places in my head
Put your faith in me my friends
Believing all the lies
Through the eyes of my parents' tongues
And remembering some pain
From across the room,
You only wanted me to play the fool, play by your rule
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well Yes it will, oh, yes it will
I'll keep the dance floor warm
In strange ideas, in stranger times
Tha ceo air a bheinn  
Born without a name
"Shoot for your dreams, little girl, to the stars,"
And I was beside myself
Cause everybody knows
And if I leave today no memories remain
I'll be there in your dreams
I love five times more then any boy from before,
Every day gets worse
I've checked the phone, no messages on
They leave her with her friend
Ain't nobody like to be alone
So many days in the wind, you been running all your lift,
Life is but a dream boy, you can be redeemed
All of the rest will follow,
And I got high
Tu ne comprends pas qu'elle est de celles qui charment
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Hope to mend them one day 
I know tomorrow there'll be nothing else
And over the phone, he can never expose
Will it ever get here
Och gud vet att jag måste leva mitt
That season left the world and then returned
Oh make no mistake my friend
Fearful mothers, watchful doubters
Kiss upon the lips
And touch your face while we're both sinking
Pull away your eyes it's nothing left to heal
'Cause as the highway unwinds,
Lover, will you spin me round
Oh, desire, it won't bring you back
Didn't I make it harder
You lay there like a thousand mirrors,
Bringing a tear to your eye 
The farmhouse is burning down
Just dream and wish and try to close your eyes
So I walk you to your car
The firemen shake
If you want to hold on to the first girl that you meet
I've got to get it right
Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
This is no, blind faith
I wish you on your way
As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones
So fill it up and spin forever down the wall
He calls himself at night, in soft overchords
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall will you catch me
We were just this close but we couldn't say it
There's my point
I just need you to know
In to the games of
Just bleed the bittersweet 
The snow is up to our knees
Anytime she goes away, Anytime she goes away,
If you're looking for an unmarked place,
Before you know it your life has run away
And then make the choice
Your sister says that I'm no good
Only reminds you of the people you hurt
Nameless was our crime
Always shine
I said someday you'll be happy with me Pancho
That I should fly
And I'll become, as a girl
And says something like, "You and me babe, how 'bout it"
Good times around the corner, I swear it's getting warmer
And I've got another dream I'll keep to myself
His last words were
But it has gone too far,
I lie awake and think of you
He took my bones and turned them into bread
But here it's dangerous, not like home
I have never known me this out of place
Can't set his feet through starry skies
Sweet confusion under the moonlight
It didn't make sense
To pick yourself up and change
Summerbreeze is blowin' through your window
My prize the smile playing tricks on your lips and I wonder again
A running comeback home
You lost employment
When they had the chance
Left no sign, nothing at all
And uproar fills the town
And to my soldiers in the Pentagon
que está agrietado profundamente
Let us stay till break of day
Don't bite me yet, I believe in you
I feel, I feel, I feel, I I I feel
It is gold inside but it has crystallized
And the sun won't shine again
And you, you were the lonely one
Stop moping the rain's gonna rain through
You know I just can't stand myself
Oh, wake up, baby, come and get it
It won't lead me to your bed
BUT I guess it doesn't matter any more
You're never in my way 
This dance is difficult
I'm looking for a home in the heart of the country
Take you to another place
Like to handle with the lights on all night
All that we were, all that we knew
Like a diamond
To make sure that you've moved on
I am here and your heart
Do it now, girl
Where the shallows meet the scratchlands
Where do we sunshine, where the heavy rain
Not before time, not before time
No sign as yet, you're mine as yet
And I was happy to fade
That hand guns were made for shooting people
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
And my loss was overwhelmed
In uncertain times
Live seconds as a lifetime
Is a heavy gold one 
Les mots des sentiments
'Fuck the valley' fudge, it's my hate and my love
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn
Tell me tell me you'll be all right
To find my people's tongues were tied
Simply a lack of love
And, meanwhile, a man was falling from space,
Judy's starting at the sun
Our shoes are wet, our skin is cold
When you come around, everything else vanishes
Like lines around the sun 
I still miss you
One kept occurring and reoccurring in his dream
Amount to something more or something less
And thinkin' 'bout you in the night
The end of the time, they're the end of the line
In your lost enchanted brain
Just when you feel that
Always condemning me
Here and gone
The only way I'm leaving here
She's washed up on his shore, there's no time to get into his life
She's down on her knees my friend there she goes
Or if you want to build a place up in coldwater canyon
And wound up at your door
Put on your spurs, swagger around
Tiredness fuels empty thoughts
'Cause even the Gods outside can wait a moment guy
And I'm all alone for the first time
Removing all your skin
Who goes straight back out to do it all over again
From a cloudy sky
I'll roll away alone
Before they fell away it seemed to matter all the same
ist der Erfolg nur Jonglage
By people everywhere
It takes some cold to know the sun
Your skin was appealing wallpaper
For you are mine at last
Praying that it ain't fair
Show me to the bed now
I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look, before flying east
I love you to death
Didn't amount to anything
On the phone to the bank about a default loan
So hard to understand an unstable man
When you got no life to lose
But still I must die to get to you
That there is no reason why it can't be like you said
New cavity moved into
I'll take you back a thousand times again
Oh, only to wake and hide your face
Trying to find the words to
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
In what ever way feels comfortable for you
And needing to hide out from my mind
Flowers for the lost at sea
Faceless fall from this life and ah, if you can't
Leave inhibitions in the wind
Because there are things I've got to say 
This maze I stand of concrete walls
Generally we are alone
It's a bird, it's a plane
You'll be a grown woman 
And I'll be there just to make you happy
My brother I'd follow you in
Now it's out of his hands
He doesn't feel the heat, he doesn't feel the time go by
In a better place in his brain
Don't wanna feel
If you find the time
I could stand with you with your snow boots on
But this boy I know, he is pure of soul
With your car and your handmade overcoats
I know it's hard to tell how mixed up you feel
Bleed this out deviled soul
Some passing of family, frustration released
We're out on the road again
When he plays the blues
When we live without fear
Anytime she goes away
When my eyes shut, they'll take me to the land
Clear as Winter, storms would be a sight to make us shiver
Once I get you up there
You're afraid it's all been wasted time
And the rainbows danced in her hair
Outside in the distance
Touched by a folded hand
I pay the check and leave the change from a crumpled tendollar bill
Dorian, carry on
And in the streetlights I can't see
But they all sound right
I can see, I can see, I can see a sunrise
I'm just waiting for my love
Nightmares and violent shapes
I'm not looking for a fight
BattleKhaki personality
And only summer eternal
Till we came back down
Deer in the headlights, there goes a weaker one
And everything I could fit in it
When we all fade away
And he wonders if the car will start tomorrow,
Leave it all in a dark past
In search of inspiration
When the hanging dust is clearing from the air
So you live from day to day
In the sunheat
Lay down your head and I'll sing you a lullaby
And then leaves the rest to me
Once we wanted nothing and everything was new
O after O, you know, homie I'm just triple beam, dreamin'
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside
Things turning inside out all the time
She's got a moulding
This wall
That's when it starts hittin the fan and it gets real in this bitch
So I sing the blues
I need to stay alive and this ain't no cure
'Cause this ride's 
Good, Good, Good, goodnight
And if you knew now what you knew then
It's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful world, to you
Chemicals can make us stay
Try to remember all the good times
As I lay down beside her
It's your soul
How much longer can we bleed before we come to our senses again
I want to live today to give You the praise
Will it ever change
A cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces 
I'm a fool for your belly
Caught like a fool without a line
Some things you'll never forget
There's so many things I have to say,
He gathers all of the urchins up in their filthy tearaways,
If you'll bleed for mine
Take me to live inside the truth
But nobody has any wool
Placed in your mind to be a better man
Baby I, want  to decide  by his side I can't, I can't
As I get behind the wheel again
So go unlock the door
I Sit all alone
I would like to say to you
I've always been too lame
It always will
Nervewrecking, acrobatic backwards bend
Of what looks to be an evil empire where shortterm earnings mean everything
Now my door has swollen from the rain
I wish I could fly
I want to play a silver note that fills you with hope
Happen when you're asleep
What are they looking for
You were kinda sorta my best friend
Cause once it is lost amongst other thoughts
And warmed his hands by the fire
All because of you
True love is cruel love
And no one drags us down
Or I'll never fall
Pretend I'm not up here, I try counting sheep
There is a voice inside of me, I don't know
Wer jetzt nicht schläft verfällt der feuchten Träumerei
Not the foolish, not the wise
I need someone much more
y fue por ti que aprendí a querer los gatos 
My car broke down on the street
All is faith
This is my very first love song
I feel, I feel so sad
Where you parked your daddy's car 
Now the days are gone
And high as the flame will rise
I wanted a puzzle with pieces missing
Clearly that is something wrong
It may be over but it won't stop there
My hand between your knees, you turn from me
Please stay with me
"I'm that one who caused all this
Frozen, the river that baptized you
To the sky in
And we finally told the truth
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Send her seed, a painful sound
You know it's going slow but it's coming your way
That girl from the Molino
What I need is a long holiday
Everything, every tune will be played by night
Passed country lines and interstate signs
The river don't know, when its flowing
I know where you hide, alone in your car
My mind is in the gutter
Soon be what everyone is talking about
We'll make it out
A marching band on a sunny day, two pretty eyes or a a pretty face
Like the more that I breathe
Well, I'll tell you one thing, if you're keeping something
Damals wusste ich noch nicht dass Träume auch verbrennen
How you get your kicks for living
I have bread and I have wine
So it goes and so it goes and so it goes slows your mind mind mind mind mind
Like a dog you can always come home
Don't be alarmed, it's only a feeling
They took while we were young
For him an old city
Will you catch me, make it alright, looking down I, see your face, yeah, if I fall now
And name
Yesterday, yesterday
Freeze frame this sedate moment
His bitterness shows it's side
Now we're dancin' to the music that we made
Suddenly everything has changed 
They both got up real fast
Come back away, come back away, come back away
Will you ever let us carry on
Lost my mind
It's only been a little while
I see what's in your mind
A weekend in a weekdays shoes
Years gone by and still
I used to write so many songs for my girl
You are the only ones who know
It's all just a song 
Outside and in
I'm saving money
Wanna jump my train
From lust to truth
We still want to be reminded
A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep
I want to see this sky split
I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
I feel that I am fading away
Black sea of agony
A smile that explodes
I know I could turn to something other than you
So you killed more precious lives then you had let live
Don't forget about me,
Talking to a memory that's never coming home 
From under the covers he thought you whispered you want more
The point of it all was to make much of me
It has never been easy to cross any borders
Lighten up, you know, lighten up
Come on the lip only makes him bolder
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I live in new wave
As the towers topple over ground
In a place
And I've got more on my mind then I have on my plate
Don't pay to fight it; can't change the color blue
I chose to act and it broke my heart not to rap
What did you say Was this your downtime
Yeah but to get to the morning first you have to get through the night
'Cause it's the bolder thing to do
Wieder
Only love can bright your day
Under the table and you'll realize
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be
The way I might've changed my mind,
From another dream
You're holding bits of styrofoam
If you need a friend
But back to the matter at hand
Back away, come back away, come back away
A place of ferns and grass
Now I've got a woman at home
There goes the day, oh what a shame
You have a home here
I've grown old on this ocean, gave her all my stronger years
Still pyre smoldering
And I remember your smile
Went out to fight for equality, hope, let's go,
Whoa, what are we gonna do
All I want to do is to spend some time with you
The time is all I own
On every boy and every girl
That never was,
Thinking of you and the love I got I need somebody like you
I need it in writing to believe
So let every morning come
Maybe I, had too little love to realise
The flaming hair across your cheek
Pay attention, I hope that you listen 'cause I let my guard down
Put's his lips on my neck
I've barely made a sound for twentyfour hours
The sunshine seeping in
Our love is broken
From all the times we ever tried
We'll play on till the end
We could have it back again
There's a calm under the waves as I choose to sink
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings;
Or acknowledge that I don't understand
At the close of day
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
When you said tulips
Owe Tristan und Isolde, dieser Trank ist euer Tod"
You spread your rusty fingers across the ledge
I'll make you mine if you would have me
But like everything I do I fail
Kun jäljet sotkeutuu liejuun
Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver's seat
When the last fish the last tree are no more
I sailed too far out to sea
Scream to no one
Zu vergessen wie schön das Leben bisher war
When we wake, we hate our brother
Cracking boulder
In lines as long as country miles
Need the pulse to feel alive
I feel weightless numb and sore
I want to love you, baby
And there are many who despair
Savor the things that sobriety brings
My life I must live
Between mistakes and new beginnings
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
The moon is a lightbulb breaking
So when the stars look bright above me,
The fear of pity is always awake
They say that they don't see what you see in me
Although I didn't mention
I've seen the waters that make your eyes shine
Nugutte agetai noni 
Who needs a friend when God's on your side
Christ glorious entwined
And put them in the new
So when you finally taste, all of the waste,
The girls are feeling sick
Time, is like a dream
Against the wall and across the hall
Dreaming my dreams with you
And never look back on what might have been
Ghosts stand waiting
Lost words unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness
And tomorrow rescues you
I sell anything I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Sunshine smiles  even when it rains
It just existed in your head, the reflection used wasn't you
She's got class and style
Living our dreams
It's in your pretty head
Sailing over the sea of Maine 
A moment of sun in her eye
Nothing else had a single part to play in my head
The noise just went away
The shrimp newspaper he read
There's better things right now for you than me
Your departed
Different for everyone I see
There's poison in your veins
Tu eres el amor de mi vida
How life goes on the way it does
I thought I'd found a reason to live
Delta Force plays on your old gray monitor
Calloused hands and candle light
Sometimes I'm lost
No I'm not a simple man
I wish you well and hope you find
Never no more to call your name
Sing me that song
Sick of sickness You're unkind and a liar
Take the poison of your age
But my coat's kind 
It left broken and bare
On a diamond in the rough I spent my better years
I could help myself to something
I said it�s been a long time
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
How did you make me go this far
And this house just ain't no home,
That look on my face
Oh you know I saw a city burning Fire
Dazed shotgun your stain my way
They make the biggest sounds
From the ocean to the shore
Is a glass of champagne 
No chains can hold me, no walls confine me
I'm never on your side
Long after stars have lost their glow,
She never thought her love could ever be as strong as this
I'm getting myself in love with you
You see them fours crawling You see them screens falling
I can't leave you and back home my house is falling down
So look at me now
I'm getting nervous, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You are nothing
May be just what I need
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
Well, ten thousand tears passed by
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
You go east for those real green eyes
Show me your rainbow
Oh, you poor thing
Just want to know my little flicker of time is worthwhile
Nobody knows 
All the things you don't wanna hear
Ooh earth
There's no way of not making it right
Oh, lay it down in the night, let it soothe this
And I hope you know you'll always be
Waits for no one
Come in contact with one another
He's soon adjusted and got accustomed to these new ways
I think that possibly, maybe I'm falling for you
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Now we are stunned minds
I discovered that a heart is lame
I'll never let you fall,
Come on love, come on love
At the party at the club
I went swimming in a black and silent sea
But it may be a new constellation
You think you're bad but I'm badder than you
And the sight of you is so in my body
I got to stand here two more hours 
You know I would take back that moment
The only one to see my other face
If it's rock and roll, got to go, go, go, go, go
But I've gotta be frank, and baby
Such a human waste your eyes without a face
und mal wieder nichts untendrunter trägst
Come see what you've done"
And though you cry at night
There were children climbing over fridges
A little girl dreams of taking the veil
When the years have gone by and
With red underwear
I know that I'll find my soul
I've got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
And one of these days I'll get a real job
You alone, you alone and no one else, you were meant for me
Because when we're drinking
Look around maybe buy a new topcoat
For the rest of my, for the rest of my life
And the pain you feel, I promise you, will go away with time
And time waits for no one
I wanna give me a good night sleep 
Somewhere far above has a new day risen
And you'll hear them call out your name
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens;
As the pages turn, my eyes are glued
When a drunk girl awoke me on the train
He feels the power of the past behind him
Every single thought you think,
Too many fucked up years
I'll still be sleeping
Soon we'll say good bye
But on the inside
But I can't find your clamshells
And you know how much I need you
You're someone else
Smiles and says "Aloha" to his sweetheart Hawaii
Past meadow grounds
Standing and drawn across the room
You look like a kitty
There is no such place
Alongside our perfect sons"
But I really don't care to know
Yeah I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
Down, to give over control, the soul's solely yours
And I will love you
Must have been insane, believe me
As you're sleeping silently
Is a rule, read the guidelines
It's like striking a match pretty hard upon a powder keg
And over time they all start to look the same
When he was there
Of your hand, child of mine
And if you really didn't know
Until the skeletons walk free Until the makeup all comes off
Every gem is not a diamond
Wanna be loved
It turned this boy into a man
Now I've gotta leave
Turns out that it wasn't you at all,
The sun will rise
Old times always sound so bad
Making love tooth and nail
Owl said, "Death's a door
Sometimes we just pretend 
You don't need to talk to look good
I held out my hand as if she'd never pushed it away
"Baby understand"
You trouble me
Will not make you come undone
I got a sheriff's name branded where I should of kept clean
And I've paid the price
Baby I'm sitting on fire
For the cute, cute, cute ones
Can't do a thing to stop me
You just stay in line,
I've lied to you
From the thunder that came, I was never the same
And the devil makes good use of these hands of mine
That makes the protections I've built around my pseudo world premiere
Gumdrops and Saturdays
My last thoughts
And everything else doesn't matter
"Gold'ne Nase" heißt sie auf der Szene
Drums too slow for a funeral beat
In an attempt to meet a harsh deadline
Every kiss she gives away, might be a good time,
Your love, brings me sunshine
Oh, what I wouldn't spend to lend you mine, hmm
You make me smile with my heart
Ah, tear it all apart
Do you really think that anybody will notice
My blouse wrapping itself around your trousers
If there is one thing in life I've observed
Who needs keys when we've got clubs
Drive them away
Hope feels so unfounded
Shiny guitar hung on gold lamé
And it came without a warning now
God bless the seeds in the ground
Be they fair
If that's the way it's got to be
Guiding light
Maybe it's time to fly
At four in the morning
While her children sleep
Oh, how we try to wrap our minds
For the boy I love dearly lies in farmed Waterloo
Well, he told me if I try, I could fly for you
What you get is what you got
Smokey Robinson, Smokey Robinson
vajra baua maha samaya sattva
Another love I found not to let it down
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice, once or twice
Your harmony's an open breeze
This time I won't bleed
When you left you broke my heart
Yeah, I'm on my way back home
And I should look after your heart
Rich man's comfort
You've got to leave it
Cherry blossom girl
Uptight when I look at your changing ways
As I've dreamed of you
And your breathing will be pleasing
We're touching faces in the dark
I wanna take up your love, but it's locked in a vault
None of us forget about who we are
And they would float to my lover
We go to the parties and listen to the DJ's
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
You are a drug to me
When it'll stop, when it'll seed, when it'll bleed
Ah Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
Moonlight came upon my worthless shadow
Run, run, 'cause you're not too cool
Small girls with sun warm hands cuddle bring him milk
This loneliness has got me near
I built this sound
Friend of mine
And there'd be sand in your pockets and nothing on your mind
You're not alone
Of that night
I got two sets of headphones, I miss you like hell
I think I'm falling in like with you
Open all your windows and let the music spill out
Because all they cared about was whether you put out
Counting stars again x
And it looks like mine
There is room if you can trust
I go dancing with no one else
I don't believe that anybody
Nothing rad, nothing right, nothing I'll feel tonight
I hope I can find a way of letting you see
And share the love the godly must
Là je donnerai ma vie pour t'entendre
Dancing together at night until two
Grandfathers, nephews, cousins, uncles, fathers, and sons
'Cause you gotta be seen to be playing the game
Por trás dessa lente tem um cara legal
And should this be the last thing I see
Disillusional shadow
So I never ask what's going through her mind
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet
A change is due
She was everything
And as I smile, I catch myself
Your brides are not all as weak as what you take them for
From the sky, the train tracks look like stitches
His only son is only 
And six beers later I was wild
So till then, sweet fiend
I'm still looking, looking for the summer
Han sungando nowa ttorojigo shipji anha
Say you've locked some fire away,
You better come up smelling sweet 'cause you're a long time stinking
And learn to fly
Why is life made only for to end 
The last lighthouse
Somos dois contra a parede e tudo tem três lados
I won't make you, ooh ooh
But you only showed me the door
But I'm getting something
Wrap your teeth around the only game in town
And it always
You say to me
You're gonna be the one who saves me
I'm out of lines, girl, we're not getting any smoother than this
Before your fingers came unwired
My pants are too tight
Voices are here again
I believed that we would never say goodbye
And I've been ridin' on this train so long
Where some bodiless troubles would stay
Like droplets of doubt from yesterday
This mean arena is all the things it seems and more
And count the stars to form the lines
"If you love her let her go,
But the old flame ignites when we part
One thing and another
They might tell you, yeah they'll tell you, that you shouldn't
But you touch me for a little while
Tell me, why you're feelin' this way
You'd be my sun; you'd be my light
To make love out of care
It's a long way back
But I've found someone
The blood of the pretty bird
I forgot to mention
Some days like rain on the doorstep
And go high like the wind don't stop
Looking for love, and getting
mi corazón roto ha venido, me habla y dice
Until the horses run like from the stalls
Oh let me burn the words "forever mine"
Passerà anche questa stazione senza far male
Colors of my home
I feel dead
So I won't be afraid and the darkness will fade
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
It could have been a sign but I don't believe in signs
Flying way above the sea
Two bit bars and honky tonks
No, I'm not alone
Just another grey autumn day
The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear
If most of us are cheating
And I swore I saw you smile
I saw the sky in you
When everyone else is setting up to fall
By chance if we should meet
 qui attend
Ich kann nicht mit
We began dismantling the stadia and schools,
Try to forget all the bad times
To take to flight
It was wrong but you said it was right
That they have to choose pushing for peace, supporting the troops
I love the way you talk
Could be the biggest mistake, that a man can make
For striking out the rain very clean
The good times never have to end
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
Baby, I find it hard to breath
Easy money, ain't life funny
In all the pretty things you could choke on
When no one cares
Every step is moving me up
Les mots sont nos vies
There's a name that plays in my head
And then you realize just how minimal you are
That shows us where we are
You tryin' to hide your expression from lookin' worried
Do you feel the same huh
My homie Marley used to stay th and May
You can't get them back again
The scent of magnolia sweet and fresh
But it'd still be less
I'm living in a home in the heart of the country
See how they're dreaming
Everybody sees
If I were to die today
Poured them out on into the world
There's no one left but me
Where the wind sits by the river,
In the back of the New York Post
Never let it bring you down
Counting stars wishing I was okay
I didn't know I was lost
Won't find it in one place
Yes, that's the end
Is something to pursue
But I loved you,
Let your inner mystic unravel tonight
With despair and desperation
Loneliness abounds
Strength of head is all I own
It's okay, to think about ending
And now their footsteps pass
Tired of what the next day brings
I saw a hundred angels
You're for keeps don't you runaway
Smoke and mirrors playing your wit
I've a feeling you won't look at me that way
Build an island between me and you
The right words
When everyone has gone
And I want to make much of You, Jesus
In the purest and simplest of ways
I will cry everyday
God bless that smile on your face
I said before too long you'll be a memory
Being like you are
She said, I can put your mind at ease
I'll take every moment, I know that I own them
Birds in the sky
Unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness
And I have oh so many flashback scenes that I can calmly walk straight through
I never meant to break your heart
You don't have to hear my heart beat
Its way
I'll be falling for you, baby
The way the moon
I drove you home
Friends of the black swan
As I light my last cigarette
Lord, let the rain keep falling down
And anyway the stars
And weak in the light
I said goodbye to the seasons that were never insincere
I gotta get up and get over you
Looking at the things that passed me by
Many roads are ahead of us
And she might love you for it
And the assistant suggested I try a ladies' size
und werd' gefressen von dem, was mich ernährt
Our life begins with this
E aquele juramento de amor eterno
With a hairbrush and an air brush
I run back not that strong now
Carry past the word
Fever turn the lights out
Winter  the snow, winter moves on
And if I had one wish fulfilled tonight
But am I something you despise
The falling you feel
He would come again
How could we get any closer
Now you think you're wiser because you're older
I am moving house
That special kinda' lady
At last, my love has come along
She looks around and around, you know, it makes me sad to see her like that
And all my love's in danger
Your ghost has shown me
Love sometimes leaves you
So light and so easy
I've been fooling myself too long
That my shadow days are over
I've got a lot to teach but even more to learn
Oh, we could build an island
It's a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
Teach me the way
And dream our dreams
Asleep in my bedroom
Somebody stopped talking
And she will live always 
Bring me out of this shell
Just spin and drift and try to stay in time with me
And the grass is so high
Bless you whoever you are
On my way By now
Describe to me how I look
In the ancient sea that night
You want that girl
They're always there to protect me
Like fourleaf clover
Always to thine own self be true
We pretend not to look at each other
Your arms, your sides
To light, everyone's day
Because I never thought we'd part
The last words
Over and over, we're turning off the light
It depends on who's in control
Ooh, baby blue
Just Take a look around, yeah
Happy years pass by
Don't turn your back
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
And I run, run, run, run, run,
I'll fire at will
She gotta drink water 'cause she thirsty
Don't break down my concrete girl
And this is the advice they gave me
The sky blue
You got a bad old habit of making people dead
To understanding more about what intrigues me most
Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho que canite carousel
There's some sorrow in every life
They fly the colors of their homes
My sweet sweet heartkiller
That try to steal your breath away
Well, until you get there, go on, go ahead and scream it
The Buick's in the drive
Ou será um sonho de criança 
I am the reason
A heavenly host
And then you just get somebody to now, now, come on to you
Now I spend my time
I've changed my plea to guilty
All I want, all I need
But it broke my heart
And even though I'm right behind you
I was gone, so gone
We saw this as a token that we could still run away
det kittlar och du såg att jag log
Maybe you understand that, city bird
That still means someday you might be
Oh here's your love token the gold ring I wear
Take a trip, down memory lane
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
I'll wait for it to come
Oh, bitte noch ein mal
And I couldn't put them back
Oh god I wish it isn't so
In another town
Spend your nights here
But the stars are dancing bright 
And the moment I can feel that
Potential to bend
When I put on a suit and say "I do"
To this rarest of moments
With one last breath
And they all gotta say what you should and shouldn't do
Disappear forever, and ever
My love is a fleeting one
Over conversations Relationships are overrated
But I'm still not sleepy
Don't try to believe in anyone for I would change your mind
I've trashed myself  I've lost my way
Complacency is lost for now
Storied scars and faded stains
The air did bring
Our eyes are in the flowers
As you relax
There is no fortune to be made here
But I can see that star
And let the sun wrap its arms around me and
And for there's nothing left to fight
Why does the night win me always
Others sang your life
This has all become far too loud
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall
Oh jag saknar dig mindre och mindre 
Now there is no story left to tell
Why don't you love me like I want you to
I must make it very clear
A smoke ring rises up into the sky
That you could look up these words
Or you can sleep through the static
I'll head on back to the wall
I love
To know you all wrong; we warn
And I can be one too
When you wear your clothes
I'm hollowed out but resonant, a void is amplified
A silent mind
Its thorn my only delight
And I even made myself the fool
Their feet are cracked
Inevitable cry song
Everybody wants to have a home
I remember who you are 
Cold, cold water surrounds me now
When I need true north and some grounding
But what I do know, is to us the world is different
I hung around your neck independently
Two souls intwined in the blink of an eye yeah And I had to figure
He's the type to fight God but not a vice
With my childlike heart
We've got a dead ball in our court
It won't be long, but it feels that way
So I set the child in me on fire
Sunken with her party balloons
W te dni to godne
Paperclips, memories
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
I'll see you on the road
You bought him presents with my money 
It feels like summer is on it's way
Julie, I'd do the stars with you, anytime
You can walk away the freest man
I took a river and the river was long
But I think something's going on
On the highway, but I'm barefoot
Though many he's known
Backhand, reversible roles
May I have this last dance
But it's not like life's such a vale of tears
I was too busy staring at you
Don't leave 'em nothing to work on
And I cry myself to sleep
How your own choices make your dream
I know you meant to come back, I know you meant to stay
It's your last chance
But let them think what they want 'cause I know it will never end
Yellow roses spring
For tears my heart has caged
It's tragic, I make it happen, and all y'all Shaqtin'
Forget me night
Like big rag dolls just cursing at the walls
You've got to lose yourself, but not let go
I wonder if this rain passed toledo
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
How we envied all those actors lives,
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
If only songs were sung to guide the doubtful ones
I'm called Nelsito and I'm thirteen years old
Bring your loving, smiling, face over
I know you say,
If you just believe that it's true
And your mouth never speaks
I found a shelter from the sun
Bank account found minimal amounts when countin' cause of my now exwife
Tu as pris la route sans dire adieu
The woman strokes his polished chrome and lies beside the angel's bones
I hear a difference in your voice,
¿qué le viene pasando
Is that I love you so
And the place from where you watch us now
He is a picture of Jesus
And it must be displaced
Tears away away away REPEAT
Held you close, but, baby  couldn't tell you
And hope to God she's listening
The world is so pale next to you
And the shadows come to stay
From romance
Just face the fact your shit's a wrap and you gotta deal with the shit
Bring me bring me
Still too young to fail, to scared to sail away
And we don't put enough emphasis on the ladies sometimes
It doesn't we're not still sad
Oh no, his pants are too tight
Scratching the swingadella's dance floor
I've been talking to Jesus 
'Cause I've no time to start again but I won't to a bitter end
When I give my heart
In crystal snow my palace guard
Do you really think that anybody will listen
With a song and dance routine
The laws of chance strange as it seems
Hope you've found your peace somehow
It's not forever we can fool around in the dark
So much in love so much in love
I remember the kiss when we first met
Down your shoulders and back
It's so beautiful to me, it is everything I see
Watch its insides twitch and smoke and rotate endlessly
If you must make me blush
Life without a moon and stars
But I believe in love I guess
Darling tell me, what's on your mind What you thinking
Scratches his eyebrows
Believe in you, believe in me, we're meant to be together
So when the sun has died you dive into your mind
Feel the pain teaching us how much more we can take
I don't mind spending every day
Last thing I remember is the freezing cold
Should we just march without a care
He said each day's harder to get on the scale
Helicopters overhead
We'll bring a child
And I'll remember you as the second or two artists I knew who decided to screw me over
Show me love you can't fight what you been longing inside
Their heads in the sand
And how we stayed awake all night long
And I don't know if you feel my flow
We must always be thinking
But I'm still dancing on my own
I have tried in my way to be free
Like he could talk forever
Is it time to meet my destiny
The painting has a dream where shadow
And you thought I was happy
You made me feel more than I thought I could ever be
O sábado, o signo, o carnaval
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
Been a clog in the drain 
The color of the world had turned dark for me
Say we will wallow away in a world so mild and high
And the things you loathe
We'd speak our minds and change the world
Can we make what lies ahead of us a better place to be
Look, those are colours we know
That he had come to wound my door and jeer
Here on birthplace, don't be nervous
Ren som en blomma, skygg som en hind
Sixteen years later, here I go
Says I, my pretty fair maid, wont you come with me,
'Cause I don't stand a chance in these four walls
Soft haze in the face
Sometimes I don't think
Who turned your way and saw 
I keep finding words that leave you
I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
Fought my boys
It was five o'clock 'cause I checked my watch
Like the diamond that cuts the light
Just what it was I had
Blue days, all of them gone
Yeah Yeah, shine on me
No matter where they are
I don't cry, I don't cry no more
There, s a time and a place for everything
So now hush, as you're dreaming
Without the blanket of sorrow
I keep my cold eyes locked
Alone I feel like I'm jumping on a trampoline
As life for me is life through 'I'
When I go in for a kiss
To wash away the pain
I see it's really hurting deep inside you
We're at the tiptop, yeah, we're not getting any better than this
Beating next to mine
Their eyes aglow and seeking heat
Now she's left me for something more sure
How could I forget
When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther, I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kanman and Twist
Driving the lonely road
First of April, love of your life falls out of the blue
Never let is bring you down
It's through the crest on the breast of your school shirt
I want to run far from this grey town
Baby, if I told you the right words
Open my eyes
We'll get out of this mess
Out of the corner of my eye
Or forget their towns
Floats like a cushion on the sea
All the while you're bones have gotten frozen
The brilliant moon and all the milky sky,
That this poor country's known for the last twenty years,
This is your warning
I wasn't around, you stayed in tonight
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
It's that everybody's got somebody
And for some unknown reason my watch begins to chime 
But I only have two hands
Oh, you're not a friend,
I know there's something
She's got everything I need, some pills in a little cup
You just don't wanna accept when it's time to hang it up
It�s like you knew me
I wanna stand up and walk on my own feet
I kiss his finger tips
Bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum
Swallowed by pain as he slowly fell apart
Before you go, a few words for your heart
But tell me, are you even aware
Moonlight
Was it the home, the car, or darling all those thing we thought we needed
I know you've crashed it  times before
Had room for two
Now I'm goin' home
You'd come to see
Come back
It just makes me want you more
It's desert ice outside, but this diner has thawed my ears
It's green and it's cloth
When the daddy got caught up by the law
Oh don't run away
I phoned your office this afternoon
"Ven corriendo con tu mamá , una tormenta se va a largar
Tears away away away
Sing it louder
Give me your dreams,
The world outside leaves me behind by myself
If it was my last day if it was my last day here
Sometimes life dictates what we hate
Fly away
Well I ain't no troublemaker
Taking things for granted
And there's no grace in what you say 
These parts of life that I cannot hold
Weasel she's in New York, she got it all set up
To the soul you never knew
He comes from east and west
You can bet on your life
But I don't know, my nights are cold
Stop, you can't believe, what you believe
Let's climb to the top of the state bridge
When you come down
Our voices in the breezes
Lamplight makes the shadows play
Put my head up in the clouds
The war outside our door keeps raging on
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love if it does not exist
Standing the wrong side of the sun
Can't go where I've gone before
I am, I am, I am, I am not afraid because
I am living for the night we steal away
I hope you're singing now
We were love at first sight, now it's crush, it's crushing
Man nimmt das Leben sonst nicht wahr
And when the sky's done cavin' in
Well, it's your misfortune that sweetens my song
My veins are poppin' from this love inside
Overnight, start over,
With your costly fine robes and your mantle so green
It was gone for a while but it's coming back in style
These wars, we face only keep me in my place
With one dozen roses
And make you fell all right
It was only a test
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside
Don't forget I'm still around
Some people say that rappers are invincible
No one is there to meet her
Feeling my way through the darkness
Easy come and easy go, whatever
And I know you are gonna be just fine
And all I want to do is go home with you but I know I'm out of my mind
Ain't it funny how we pretend we're still a child
You little wonder, you"
I had a friend named Victor
How'd you like the sound of those four letter words
And to be tired of this little romance
You say my love for you's not real
I'm sorry I won't be there to see our children grow
If I should die before I wake up
Not the meant and not the paint
Why these phases change you
Black coral on the sand
I never knew that cupid felt like this
The sun goes down
Who'd have thought I'd really visit
Pops like a light bulb
Since I met you this house has started to decay
And so deceiving is the clouded heart
Your back against the wall 
Under layers of concrete are the bones of our past
Schlaflos kämpfe ich mich durch die Nacht
Now I see fire
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
Got some whiskey from the barman
Remnants of a deeper purity
But it's the third time we've fought together this week
Would you call my name
Hollow forced inside this empty hole
I make a meal for my friends,
Coils around your ankles
Searching for love
I don't mind telling you
The water runs away 
Candy asked me if she died, if I could go on
I know what it means to freeze to death
The place where we meet
I'm getting bored
Take back the pain, we got the rain, don't know why
And for as long as I breathe I'll save a seat in my memory
Been on my mind
Burning inside
Divine apathy Disease of my youth
Could be rolled into one
You lead me to places that I've never been
This love tonight
Times without changes
Are home and they know
There's a hole in the sky
For money they don't need
Don't want it to change
Love into the light
Have a will so weak with a mind so strong
Water, only water
Accident when we needed
You can be anything you want
You know what you are to me
Except for just a dream or two
Now I just dream about the holidays
Think about all the foreign places we could be
You framed beside my bed
You always seem to know where to find me and I'm still here behind you
And the birds are building nests in the windowsill
With dirty blood and thirty last calls
She's on the ocean
That we're all that we got
I can't move lives
Help me get a hold on you
Oh when you say you know
Forgive me but I think my time is drawing to a close
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And how the wind knocked you down
But I won't let you down so open up your eyes
The windows look like Christmas lights from out here
And I'm back here at home
Have you ever been told you're mediocre in bed
Without you, I'm a nowhere girl
Of the new cobweb
He might be a father, but he sure ain't a dad
We can share our breath
Give me marks out of ten for the clothes I wear
Walking through fire without a burn
In sleep
I would like someone to make a map
I would have kept you underneath my wing
Seduce the world it never screams
But when the bombs start falling you've got to open your eyes
And I ain't wondering where you are
I told my mom I'ma get up out of da hood
I go to heaven
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
Cause in my life
Your friends only like themselves in photographs
I'm gonna make it right
What you get is what you had to give away
We are children born of wars
And I doubt you was last here
Keep in a sack in which it always stays closed
But good things are gone
Everybody's hiding in the neon lights
I don't wanna waste another day,
Her eyes on fire 
Wonder who you are to stay
The roses are sighing
She doesn't know what's right 
And somehow it just don't works out lately, ooh lately
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
Something other than
And we fall through fate
To hold your hands
Losing track of time
Some old news
This old house is falling down around my ears
One step ahead, a thousand miles
Och stjärnorna vandra och timmarna fly
Far from present day reality
I'm ashamed and I need for you to know
I said maybe
I know you're somewhere still alive 
A woman's night is filled with dreaming,
I say no, oh no
I can teach you how to sing and dance
But I couldn't get it right, no I couldn't get it right
I met a woman that night, she loved me for the stories that I told
But it's a long long way to go
The drive onto me
You could go all day
Hold on while you breathe loud
Let the sunset in
Sleigh bells in the air
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
Dreamland is showing the dark of my past
It takes the dust to have it polished, yeah
I can sing myself to sleep
The sun will shine
This is just farewell and not goodbye my friends
Your making me smile
And how I could feel you near
To this priceless ballet
I don't think that you'll mind
When doors forced open shut again a flytrap and a petal
There's no comin' home
We're all that we got
Come see what you've done
And as they all grow older the truth will be understood,
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
And my whole life too
Outside under the purple sky
The night fills my room
I taught you how to feel, but you just feel numb
Breached in straight lines
But when I called your name you disappeared
I feel at home here in the middle of nowhere
From my mouth into your eyes
She's eighteen, he's thirtyone
Why you so still
Sure babe, I'll take you home
Tell them please, how could they know
Why can't you just say to me
As we are standing on our feet
In my memory when I go
But I got a feeling that makes me wanna ignore all
Menm si ou we ou pa we demen
And he knew where the pillow goes
Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth
On our way we will have hope 
So, look up
But the water looked so black and deep
Bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing and feel
To get home to doc
Keep it hidden 'cause you're not too cool
Hoping to show a soul disturbed that
You know we keep talking 'bout a revolution
No matter what I say or do
If I wasn't that kind
I need a little more time with you
'Cause baby two is better than one
So heavy a heart for someone merely ten years old
Her welcome like her love for me
With the straightest face
I heard your bid once or twice
Freedom spelled by a man in chains
You're here to stay
Once in a lifetime comes
Hallelujah's in the morning
Swept back to all the grief and the worry
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look at all the mess I've caused
To make you want me
'Til I was back in your arms again
A decade later and another face
Damn, that's gotta hurt
And loves you like I do
I will walk down to the end with you
I was born crying out and it's come back to me
Falling right out of your sky
Hoping the cold would kill the smell of angry gin,
And breathe you out
Ich hatte viel gehört über die Stadt der Liebe
When they get giddy
As a reminder
Don't you stop till you know you're gone
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
That was before you gave a view
The last I heard she took the bird
Outlines the dead
I once was fooled by cadillacs and honey
My time has come and you will rescue me
As I walk out the door
Cleveland game and two fishing poles
Found in the Vedas
Till the last beat of my heart
When you're an old woman and I'm an old man
Not all good things come to an end
Together
We'd never aim to kill or scare
In your tears and in your blood
Same girl then, right now's a groupie
Like I miss the ocean when I go to sleep
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
And it's bending your will like a willow tree twisting
Come and wash me cleaea ea ea ean
Baby, you'll always be in my orbit
I'll be teardrop in your pillow the beautiful sorrow
He's the last man standing on the track
She pays and doesn't say a word 
She fixes her hair
I head for the shadows
Hey, boy, you can bet it
I'm a new three
Sights and sounds calling form far away
The only thing you have to say
To make them want to glance your way
But, but now I need you to do it faster baby
The seed that left the tree
Relieved to see it says nothing about us
Under the volcano
Memories we share together
A part of him has died
I'm on the road to God, don't know
But I heard something inside you with my head to your chest
There's nothing new to discover, there's nothing new to invent
C'est l'éloquence de mes silences
Goodbye, shadows
Take everything away
Don't take a picture
How you're supposed to keep it all inside
It's okay because one day we will be dead
She homed with thieves
And give it away as much as I can
I see you happy in the front seat
No one gets hurt
Yesterday
We can cope did you know
And decided to give up the ghost 
I can hear you breathe
We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers
Walk through the dark
And no one heeds the crying
They'll drink bad wine and they'll eat lemon cake
I can't tell if it's you or me who's drivin' us into the ground
Fun for all that children call
The lust of love, a brute desire
My apologies fall on your deaf ears
We never die
Love and other socially acceptable emotions are morphine
Because you act so tough, I totally lost control
These screams, they wake me up in the night
Different lovers, different names
The air is filled with computers and carpets
Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points
Look at you you're blue black and through being that kid I knew
Then you get a kick out of closing the door
Seconds change
Ain't it strange that I have brain activity
And if you see her won't you please say hello
And implicate the things I've done
Like I want your flowers
We're living in the wild life
Never gonna be without each other's love again
Oh I know it's hard but you stay with me, oh oh, we've got a memory
I forgot, I forgot
You might need too much
And considering this I want you to know
You said the urn was half full when I said it was half empty
Whilst the snowflakes covered
From my boy
As she wipes the wisps of dishwater blonde from her eyes
I know a man who may need a new assignment
But oh no, no the sky is falling
'Cause I do love you
Go back to that place yea yea yea
I kept on lookin' for a way to take me through the night
With all the demons I possess
There in light
When I'm gone my little man
Though I never was sure of God
daz ietweder dem andern was durchlûter alse ein spiegelglas
So get it now
This love is real
Oh, the places we could go
I'll cry to remember
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it
Everything is perfect now
So now I stand beside
And when you're swallowed up, oh, don't you cry
Seek shelter on my broken pain
And it takes some old to make you young
I wrap my hands around his neck
Let's tell the world what we're feeling now
We pass lost souls
I looked at the sky for vapor trails nobody comes
Don't leave your torch behind, a powercut ahead , you know
And now, it's time
Now there digging soft ground for your grave
And we'll pass on the streets I won't look away
Nothing left to find when you are down
Down to the end with you
Not an easy ride
No one forever young
It's just there's something in my mind,
Secretly wishing me gone
My final place
As the seasons change
It's as pure as snow
And though I write them by the light of day
Oh, pity me, yeah
Where every brother's knife is set to slay you
If ya ain't heard about your daughter, she smiles just like you
All your friends have come and gone
I'd be howlin' out a song in the back seat
I'm not a helping hand
Your voice was louder
Jeremy moved to Rome, Italiano style
Silence seizes a cluttered room,
Man this shit is hella scummy
No one seems to like this
And his pain meant nothing to me
You will be the one who cannot talk
May this day
Lips are falling 
How big, how blue, how
And the despair when you just won't go to sleep
'Cause I've been a bad, a bad girl
Like a friend
When I'm sick of all my choices
Sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why
Breathe your life while you wait,
Then why can't we tell people how we feel'
I like the nights but not the tangled wires
To tell me you're alone
And of all the times we had
Hell stand up, up
On whoever's thighs are warm
My brain's the burger and my heart's the charcoal
My whispered reason is
In the mirror everything's reversed
Never considers your dreams, selfish and mean
And heaven is in front of me
I should be on my way by now
And even if the sun refused to shine
Blood, milk and sky
And I even myself the fool
Ain't it funny, a power comes with money
I'd gladly swap places, if they care to dive
Is it strange for me to say that
Be on your way the sun has set in the sky
And yet I keep on coming back to call your bluff
To take care of each other
Du bist, was mich am Leben hält
I've made amends between father and son
I see that aching heart, but I was fly, I was so tall
But in the right rays of the sun
I didn't know what to say
Come back my forbidden ghost
It hurts me every time I see you
And you're young and in love
You gotta turn everything around
Close your eyes and drift away
I used to cry for Tracy because he was my only friend
Deep in my heart, I will remember you
el mar, la tierra son
Fires burn in autumn skies
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out
You enter the room
Captured by the moon
I feel at ease
I've looked in the greenhouses, one, two and three
To hold your hand
Make someone play
Since I stole this song we have made a new start
Than what we're living for,
And we hang our heads down
Skin untouched growing thicker for every step unwalked
Not to make much of me
'Cause the love
Gaze up at the moon hanging low in the sky, onlookers appear around us
But fear, if she can't dance no more
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
I'll be by your side
And I wish that I could see like everybody can
But it will come as sure as light
My ambers and my blues
Draw near to my garment, and there you will see
Like you've been rubbing yourself all wrong just to be somebody else's genie
The taste of something that good
Where even the gods outside can wait a moment guy
'Cause nothing
At nighttime I go out and see the people
That I am better left alone
Yeah, I just stay in my home, in my home, in my home
The one that will protect her
You don't have to wander 
A keepsake to forevermore say
Ist es besser, wenn wir die körperliche Hülle auf einer Wiese verscharren Ohne Pomp und Getöse, da die Erinnerung in unseren Herzen ist Wir brauchen nicht den täglichen Gang zum gepflegten Grab Wir haben die Liebe in uns, die uns mit dem Verstorbenen, auch über dessen Ableben hinaus, verbindet Das ist gut
I tell you in the kitchen about my day
Lady future's arms are lily white
And the things you'd forget
Mais mon coeur s'ennuie
And even though I may return
All my friends
Lost in her memory
Background songs
With the fairness of your skin
Losing all sense of time
Why I've been feelin' all these feelings that I'm feeling now
A Storm swept into town
In something that's never leaving,
Soudés à l'instar des grains d'maïs
There 's a girl at the Molino
If there's a chance, we'll make it anyhow
That it's only a dream
Share your bodys health
There is always something better
And right over head a great orange mushroom cloud
Temptation is in deep now, threads of greed run through this fabric
It was a surprise breakfast they were planning
But I get the feeling
So I think I'll stay caught up in a silent prayer
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
So if I do not tell you if I don't find the words
We'll be older in a year
I feel, I feel, I feel so scared
Remember this in your head
 Oh no, man, can't believe that's true
I can't come in 'cause it's too high a climb,"
Come a little bit closer there's nothing for you to fear here
This is the place where I felt
Oh, let it free, that caged on fire thing
While the la sun beat out the night
Feeling scared ready to escape
On the good ship hope we sail but the stars above say
When I started ballin' I was young
Somewhere near the end of the world
'Cause I don't want to know, I didn't want to see
Live to believe you are the only one for me
Just close your eyes
My hair grows, nails grow out
The three miles 
And I know, I don't got the money
But I liked my seat so I kept it
 AM, I watch you sleep,
Maybe, you have the wrong man 
The word frozen on
Through faces moving in the crowd
But it beats the alternatives
Nothing will be the same
Are hellbent on doing us both in
And the depths of the sea
Silverwhite winters that melt into springs;
To sleep at their feet
And lonely sailors do their drinking
I like being alone
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
Just remember you called it all bullshit
'Cause none of its easy,
Never turned away
You are the only exception, you are the only exception
A change is clearly taking place
And you will catch me if I fall
So hard to be somebody
Live in oneroom housing, with a roof to meet the sky
Love, I hope we get old
Well, you just might get it just right
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
My heart is full, and my door's always open
If love could've lasted forever I'd still hear her say darling,
Passionless moments and we are homeless
And look 
'Cause I am a fire escape
Every time I want to stay I go
Where the air is rarefied
For a fraction of this life,
Even though I swear I've never been so alone
Someone I am made for
I was waiting, we were just waiting
I wait for rescue and for a sign
On the handlebars
With you on my mind
I tell you sad stories about my childhood
No one, nobody can love you more,
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
At least now the storm can't blow me away
Let your backbone slide
A song, a song
Comes stumbling towards me
Müde lausche ich der Dunkelheit
Girl feels so right And all I know is you're the one for me,
Who needs peace when we've gone above
Each of your reasons has broken
For a Summer day
We can all control the sun
In its place stood a golden town
And when faced with dull and dutiful
You bring new meaning to my life and now
When I'm away she never leaves the house
Ease his worried mind
Do we stop, do we stop in frame
I was when we met
You make it too hard
By your resonating light
Reach out your hands
You climb a flight of twisted stairs
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way
A product of the environment
Your name in parenthesis 
In a way it is I guess
Till somebody's lonely
Windows opened I'd be scary
Sends me away
All the times I thought to reach up
I'm just glad to be in love again
And when she reached the river her knees began to shiver,
Harlem River I'm in love love love love
Like apples tumbling from a wild and windy tree
Don't want to say no more now
Wish you were the one for her
Be a family
Nobody will ever know, just the CEO to the CFO
Saviors always say
I see the doubt in your eyes,
Can't change my mind, my troubles are the same
White collar war crime, money gets spent
Days went by and years went by
The lion stares high
Into the empty space
Break it, 'cause they gon' take it hard if I don't make it through
When all I want is your love
Why would give power to the ones who robbed you blind
From the moment of commitment, nature conspires to help you
With this desert around me
I wish I was in you
I don't know anything
I dig down deep when I say "I love you"
And we're swimming around again, again
Riding on a wave of love
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
 miles is very far through the snow
Every now and then I cry
All lightning bright and thunder loud
I'll never let you see me cry
Why are there so many records of my life,
I get this pain when you're leaving
And still my reason will not rhyme, and still you tell me it's not time
We're as cryptic as the moon
You were my best friend, going at it all
Circling us as if they knew
To let it wash all over me
Hoping for a little more than just another kiss goodnight
Into deeper down
Paint sounds, electro conversation
And your hoping the sun won't rise
Julistan sun sydämesi valoa mä rakastan sua
Weil dich dann jeder Blick berührt
You were sweeter than the blossoms on the tree
There's too many kings
I'm cruising the town, diggin' the scene
But I'm gonna make it right
That any time the girl in mind will come and rescue me
When someone gets hurt 
She's calling all her friends
Oh should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Now you wanna run away but you can't
We long to be a picture of Jesus 
And she fights for her life on the train
There's nothing I love better than a free for all
Me  without clothes
The world is gone
Hello baby I'm pleased to meet you
From love to lust
But there's a calm under the waves
I heard it's modern to be stupid
But in the morning you'll be on your own again
And she fights for her life
Five fingered leaves keep covering me
Dwelling in the mists of cloud and rain
Well, a nation turns its back and gags
Maybe it's time we left
Through the coppice and the chaparral
My road's uncrossed
Major weed smoke in the air
I looked across the lake's surface
Lilac Wine, I feel unready
About the moment when we first met that day
So you trying to do what they did
I've been runnin'
I don't wanna die,
Would you be my friend
Believe me
I throw it up just to watch it fall
And I said venice
And you better bring a change of clothes
Though my vision is strainin'
And this one she explained looked like the devil
Tell me more of the very soul, look alike, look alike
I'm willing to buy his arrows of loneliness
He doesn't know what kind of guy he is
Six feet below, a world flooded free
And as you turn away
Your praise little gifts you spent your money
This is just a test, take it with love and you will pass
There's a world outside her window
All your love could hide
But wondering why we travel so far
I know, I know, I know, I know what to say here
I feel refreshed when I watch her sleep
The night is on her hair
And swallow the smoke in her mouth
Round my cold cold neck
And I can't leave my troubles 
And laugh when life amuses them
And you just curse 'til your head bursts
For the things you've done,
I always carry you inside, in here
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
In our hearts and in our minds
Of her face and of her feet
To catch one tiny fly
And close our eyes and hope that we'll be fine
All that I'm saying, a game's not worth playing
I wander through this world
My name is raincheck in the afternoon
I want to go back again
In a restless world like this is
On the back of a motor bike 
There are days I believe I can heal wounds on me
Trying to fight the cold
Don't you get it
One embrace, one embrace
If I fall, if I fall if I fall
But its the way that she interacted
And when the cold wind's blowing
Don't make me say it over and over again
Stay wait until tomorrow
As I dubbed myself a passenger
Well, something bad happens and a lot of people go
I wonder how long it's gonna take
'Cause I'm still fact she's fiction
How big, how blue, how beautiful
But as you surface you don't really know how 
I'm always so in love, all in
With my head full of stars
The moon is yellow silver
Oh brother, will you let me in again
Now another winter time has come and gone
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
To know me as hardly golden
I will give you my heart
I climbed your arms
We'll grow old and lose our hair
Once I knew it's getting born
I know they know something
My creative liberty is tempting me to hasten to the point of penance
To set light to me some surprising night
Some people say that rappers don't have feelings
If I started my own country
As if they knew
If I wanna see the tears in your eyes
You're a late night faucet that's got a drip
Is it written on my back
You know how to place your feet carefully on the ground
Her weary heavy head in
Your hair is coxcomb red, your eyes are viper black
And I find hope when I'm let down
One day I will find peace within myself
Will you still love me
If you get scared of the space
But I recognize the tone
Alike their love laid low
I'm a foolish, fragile spine
And the Red Queen was waiting for the news
Fading away
Can't tell by the temperature 'cause it's always warm
From shanty town, yeah yeah yeah
Jaganmanah pralobhanam namami nanda nandanam
Find your smile now
Play the curv and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
If we don't look or just don't listen,
Is it worse to smile falsely or to frown
To me or anyone
You stay on my mind
Falling down for quite some time
Of the Dtalk groan and the locker room where we stayed
Is fading away like tears in the rain
Now my mind is free from apparitions
Looking for a home in the heart of the country
Words are mysteries
You're earth bound and I'm injured
I could be your suicide policeman
I'm talkin' to you now
You'll never be a burden and my love for you will never die
"Treasure in the sky" and we had nothing but fun
I always envied how y'all rock wit Dre and the Chronic
It's a passage to another world
And somehow I got to find the strength to move
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin' oh ooh
This time you'll find some other gonna mess your mind
You still can't relate to them
And when the floods they come all rushing in
Oh and now I wouldn't mind getting lost 
So many times, just lovers you know, I know, I know
What appears like an angel
So your heart is warm for ever more
Feet on the ground
Who's gonna save me when the sky is crashing down
May no man's reigns ever chain you
I can't leave a house that I have built
Sometimes when I call
They keep me in tune
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
It comes as no surprise
I told you, weren't lyin', I know you aren't relying
Don't you miss the way
It leaves a bad ache
The light, the sound of the cars
Only love
The small of your back
I said I'm sorry to change my mind
With enough ambition and a firm set of rules you can have anything you want
You don't know how to ease my pain
I have called your name, I've an idea
Rusty spring uncoils in a baby bottle
Velvet ropes around you if that's what you need
A tear was in her eye
With your golden key
Illchosen, disappointing
You were mine and I was yours for one night
But there is nothing everlasting
A farewell to
And all you say is over the edge,
Can you please
We won't let you squeeze right through
Every day is new
Your hair, your gown
You coulda said something nice about my profiteroles
There is another whole world hanging there upside down
Did you hide behind your books girl
Didn't I make it clear
My heart today
Back in our old street
Ever since I was a little girl
Tonight could be the night you crash
Und schließ meine Augen
You say you got a heavy heart
Genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
And the strays are pining for their unrequited mothers
But this time it doesn't matter to me
Your bones crushed and seeded all the clouds
That your words convey what you mean
You can't cry but you'll fall 
In the back of a truck
You better practice humility
Jimmy could not wait to get home
Channeling angels in
I'm always yours
A lot of you niggaz don't plan on the day when you'd have to see me
On love he said
Leave the great indoors
Want right away
Where all my layers can become reeds
ich seh Dich an beim Näherkommen
But it's all in the mind when you cannot see in the eyes
Te seguiré queriendo cada día más
Small steps, they don't lead to your heart
Hush little baby, don't you cry Cross over to the other side of the water
I'll love you
Feel what it's like to be new
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care
Slow bubble boiling on the bedroom floor
Good things come
Know she'll be a part of my life
In my soul
Lessons learned through handshakes
The skies were blue and the grass was green
Deep in the snow, breaking your heart
Running through my life right now
Fools rush in where wise men never go,
And you know that I will miss you when you're gone
If you want to buy a brand new fancy automobile
You bring me courage
No matter how much of a thug you see, I still spit it like it's R&B, come to the club with me
To keep my arms open wide
Let there be no storm on the crossing below
Quando para mucho mi amore de felice corazón
With these hands, I will bring to you,
If your dreaming ever wakes you
This boy, breezes in from the, South Wells This boy, sees his days in the Middle East This boy, eased his way up the silver turns but what is that this boy deserves, oh he needs love, an everlasting love Give him love Oh give it to him, he needs it now, an everlasting, everlasting, everlasting, everlasting love
Si nos vies sont si fragiles
Sleep, child sleep
Momma's gonna buy you a glass eye
And red brick walls blooming
Outside my window
You cannot stop the natural flow of thought
So I must keep quiet, never giving up all the truth
Praying to the wrong god every night
And they throw harder
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
They say the Carolina heat
Well, bless my soul
Sometimes it takes a toughstrong man to hide
Now your skin is just peeling, your skin is just peeling
Either way it's fine with me
Those eyes quietly tell me of a passion we could share
Cold, cold night
And you will be my ain true love
And I know I know they are threatening
Been scolded for stealing
And if time is all I had
I hate you I love you
In the shadows, where I end up loved
'Cause I can see the light all night tonight
But hope is not in what I know
Ich war so froh über die Freundschaft mit Tara
I hope the mourners will bring plastic flowers
Because he's poor but he's happier than you
Just when all the bills are due
Sometimes I watch my life
Since we departed back a month
Let the moon glow on the fallen snow
Oh Lord, don't be far away away
And we talk till the evening fades
And take what you will tonight
Is right in front of me
To cries of, "Amen brother"
He's blessed us here today
But time is like the ocean
Powerless am I to fight this avarice, I'm
What a time it was
Cause even though the flower fades something takes it's place
And he stood before my fleeting house
te quiero pero te olvidaste abril
I opened my eyes
In pajamas and bare feet
Dance and whisper sweet breath
You can say it's night or day
A little girl dreams safe and sound
Still I wanted you to know
My grip was loose, my eyes were open
It was a hot and sultry afternoon
And the last time he saw Dorie, he didn't know what to say but
I guess it's true, what they all say
Always be
No, no, no, no, yeah
But there are more and I'm gonna show
There is still a house, a cage
Air on the streets, lights on the trees
If you fall in I'll jump down
Is it better never to start
Is a sick place to be, to be
Say hello to the shrinking in your head
Half a heart is aching to grow
To make sadness invisible, suffering a figment
They violently fill my room, they keep me awake, I hate you
I've loved that soldier boy"
Let's hold fast to the dream
A stranger gives sometimes
'Cause they are tired of being tied inside the night
From the right to the wrong settle
That she was only saying what she wanted me to hear
Yet another time
Be fighting for no reason
For nearly two decades this vendetta has raged
A voice in the back of my mind said
Maybe bring just my mirror
Swimming through the ashes of another life another life
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Set the party, really set the party off right, yes it will, yes it will Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be well, well, well, well
There will be no game today, she cried across the board
I'm gonna make the most of this day's plans 
Write songs telling why he got blindo
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
Make you windy windy
Pull the courtains shut, try to keep it dark
All crushed upon my skin
And all you gotta do is find a sword and a stone
Lehoien basamortuan
If you don't believe that these things happen,
Across a cash crop car lot filled with twilight Coupe DeVilles
With my innocent hand on my heart
I won't be around
I can feel them move with your body
"This playground is yours," spoke god when you met behind closed doors, "Gesture your hands and the pawns shall subside"
This far down the line
But last night on your birthday in the kitchen
Is there really any reason why we take this crap
Somehow your baggage comes along 
Their face beaten and blue
That he closed his eyes and he went to sleep
I will always hold your hand
When she starts to sway
Sometimes I find myself sittin' back and reminiscing
All I see is your face
I forget but I won't feel bad about it
'Cause someday I'll believe you
But I want his wings
And start to go slow
Some people say it's over
And I'm dragging my feet 
I bring it all back home
And to you I throw a low light
Show your face now and then
Out of childhood into sadness
When all I want is down at the shore,
As death becomes a jest
Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow this time
In these streets we live in and die, when it's your time
es war wundervoll als wir uns trafen
First to reach the stars
My eyes burn and claws rush in to fill them
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Bow I only have things
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed, shit
I need guidance on the river
Don't matter at all
Your waist, your breath
Sono te o tsunaide 
They want that shit, they often feind, I give it to 'em, but in between
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
Woooooh
My heart's in my chest, you snake
We gotta make it through
Spoken in a dream
Something in the way she smiles
And me, I need you so
We have time to start all over again
Until my days my days are done
And it's the fear of you that takes getting used to
I got things that you should see
Keep your eyes to the ground
Oh sister, I am stumbling again
One more picture, one more god
All around us
You'll hear the words He used to say
I followed with the sideshows to another town
I am the heat in an empty room
I feel so scared
Open my veins for your sorrow
She will buckle to that sound
What if God was one of us
Let's say sunshine for everyone
Num beijo então você se rendeu 
I cut the blue one
And trusting mind
So please remember me mistakenly
But I can't forget it
I'm looking in on the good life
Won't you come down Come away with me
You put the ache into make believe
Time to spend some time alone
She always said it again
Her skin was darker than ashes
I'm still forced to remember
Tear drops falling to the ground
With these waves crashing over my head
And I've come home
I like this resonance
How the grass would cheer on
Look at where we are, are, are
So, I will head out alone, hope for the best
He comes dividing man from brothers 
Isn't it time we go steady again
I'll give until there's nothing left to
I lost my soul in Tokyo
I got a brand new set of stencils
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
Of all the dots and lines that took me higher
And he's tired of being alone
You bite your tongue or chew your meat
Snug as bugs inside your love come into our room 
All of the shit talk
'Cause it's a battle when you dabble in war
Have you ever been asked if your hair is a wig
Found new life
Was a chance to let it grow
You're saying bye
Everything that you do's so amazing to me
Bends down to light the sea
They'll throw opinions like rocks in riots
I could pay for your tears,
I am well aware
You can compliment me on the style of my hair
I'm calling from thirty thousand feet above you
Just stick around and it may show
It's withering and untended
It's all about fast cars and cussing each other
Just gotta go with it
I've got to stay hidden in this Abbey"
Tired of cheap flowers, cheap candy, cheap champagne
Um sonho a mais não faz mal
And it's not my fault, it's how I'm programmed to function
Under the waves, caught in a dream
Last boat, stand in the river
They wont let me turn around
And then you wait for winter
You're all I dream of honey
And suddenly I'm five years old
I could wait with you for the winter to come
I'm looking everywhere I go
Nothing so clear now that I'm here
Les yeux sans visage your eyes without a face
Show me the ocean
My head's been spinning round and round
She was the sky
Mare imbrium, ariel
Cause love has no aim
If you blink she's gone
The planet poisoned me
I might be mistaken but I sometimes get the feeling that you notice too
But you're not here to make my sad songs more sincere
I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright
And let the summer rush in
Like stick to the seats of the cars of mongerito
And oh, I'm so scared
I know that you do not feel invited
I still have schizophrenic conversations
Then he'll stay with me
Completely unaware, could be anywhere, anytime
Dance the night to pieces
Like a bad tempered prom queen at a homecoming dance
Just to get back in
But your wealth will never make you stronger
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
Ich will der Eine sein
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Bittersweet
'Cause they have faces
The lights will blind up with blues in haiku
Bring a Coleman lantern and a radio
und nicht die Konsequenzen,
I buy their hardheaded husbands a long cool drink
Soul of my soul
So instead go ahead and say it
The stars begin their Busby Berkeley dance
And now's the time to let them happen again
Every look every look
Coming on forward motion across the ocean
Oh my one, rushing away
Could get it right
When she said, "my love extends
Well I hate to be the one to bear such bad news
You're in past your knees, she taps you on your chin
You hooked the stars with your eyes
I don't see me by the roadside
With no one by their side
I'll keep you warm through the winter
Or put nails through her hand
When there's nothing to lose, there's nothing to win
This melancholy
It's like a sonnet, she's so on it
Ay get out quick or you too will be knockin' on heaven's door
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
There's no reason to stop it
Too many times
Generally we are alone
We felt pain
The woman I'll love
We are small people x
Make all the wrong be right again
Or did you trade it for something, somewhere, better just to have it
Grounds for why I think we should end 
And I held on brightly, crushing quietly
I can't believe
May you sail fair to the far fields of fortune
Driving with my friends
Yes, I'll do my best to make those tears all go away
And baby there's me to make you undone
Then what really are we, what are we
But what I did made him fall dead to the ground
I believe that's because
And torn apart
You'll get a glimpse of the truth
It was only a matter of time 
You turned a man to stone
You gave sense to my life too
With her costly fine robes and her mantle so green
Your love is real, real, real
When things go wrong I sing along
In times without changes
Don't be scared, now dry your eyes
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be
Coming out from the dark
What did you mean anyhow
Chemical fathers
Like it was gold Upon a ragged wing 
Fences divide our land,
Well maybe that's true 
Hoping you'll stop by
Of being together
And there's the corner that I sat on The corner that I sat on
It has started
Insures the death you're dreaming of
If you're out of time,
Getting wet when the rain goes
Break it, the creed is all we got until we meet again
The river flows
But now I'm a man,
All of us are going down
And then it's gone, so you get up
Just let me love you
Silk stockings thrown aside, dance invitations 
Just a little bit of rain
Close your eyes and go to sleep
Ich bin der Diener von dem, was ich verdiene,
Mary applegate, roland grosch, bettina mischke, helfried wildenhain
I heart my art
If we leave tonight
I've got your words in me
Burning in your eyes, when we unite
But with you I am prepared for
They aren't
The things you loved before haven't changed
Every lament is a love song
It has written in my soul
Take good care of it, babe
You gotta run for your life
Even the brave are falling
Inside the mountain, I see fire
Into the air  we'll keep on kicking 
You can shut your eyes 
Last night I went to see my love, 
And all the men are gargoyles
Maya this song's for you
Like their blurring into to someone else's name
Rescue me to come back
And when you get high
Changes in life
When the day dies the night is for living
Everything he's done for me
Gave it all to the man instead
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
On their mouldy bed
I've found the hard way love is true
Don't it sound clever, come and play
I noticed the hair on her head that's not real
Baby close your eyes until tomorrow
He needs some time alone
Don't use my wings don't walk to far
If not, what are we doing
I'm bright as the Oregon breeze
But we still survived 'cause you and I
I can't find the need
Sweet and so new
Never turned her way
The tidiness of cry
Last night I saw a ghost
I told her so many things
When I pulled it down, it flew from the ground
My eyes would become so engaged
Oh, don't you cry for me
Just fix your eyes on one spot
Don't go looking for him now
But you can't help feeling used
Show me an ocean
I live a life of the simple kind
Have not seen you since I was 
You can say I can see the light  roll
A garland of shame
Love come and bless me, show me how it feels
Good times and get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds
That's when they'll come looking for me and you
A glint of white in the pocket of winter
But the teeth you keep clenched is what's killing the chance
Spillin' on the floor
You never really knew for sure
And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes
From loving you, shine
There's a mirror in heaven
Must have slipped your mind
For their song seemed to suit me
And say you'll come and set me free
Heey, uh, ummmm, heey, oh girl, oh girl
Until her new face changes
But I always make my way
And then they went on to say that the pearly gates
Too all the people underground
Now the streets are dark and empty and the problems in our hands
A memory made to last
About a couple on the run
Then the winter holds a bite we'd never felt before
Gettin' down, so deep I nearly drowned
Feel the heat upon my skin Fire
But you say life's so unfair
Juergen lives in Munich, that cozy comfy town
You, you're the lonely one
Go looking for the summer
Yeah heaven
While the children sleep
Wie der plötzlich immer weicher, nasser, größer wird
Even knows it in the dark
Singing whoa, please don't go
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
It's, oh, so late to start wishing
They wanna keep us away from one another
Static when you're gone
I wonder if the days I've lived through count
When I get in from my work
When will it stop When will it stop When will it stop
They interview the people who were witnesses
With the coming spring
We're all still a part of everything that we were
What is your name
The gutters are dry
När jag träffat gamla vänner har jag ingenting att säga dem 
All the times I've cried
Jealousy lay all your spells to bed
Oh, I'm thinking about the needle
So shy and enticing yet I fear
Perfect starry nights
Then I will try to remember all ours, and, your memories I know
Though my heart, it breaks, baby
Boarded a train bound for Vegas and married secretly
From the comfort of your burning beds
What's done is done
Wir riechen an den Blumen
You're down for one more hour
There's a fire glowin'
Who's never quite sure what he's moved towards
Hold together all these memories
All of the feelings you can't help feeling
ei ilman sua ei oo mitään
Don't think I've forgotten, who was always here
From the housetops to the gutters
You hold the seven keys to my soul
True love
Here I am and I stand so tall
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind
Try not to think while your inside
No light
To one spoiled nun who taught you the names
Tills solen har ändrat färgen i mitt hår
Seven sunrises and seven more nights 
Should we carry on
Oh after all our sweet love has flown
I'm never gonna get it
Was dreading the ride back to Little Italy
Where my family kneels to pray
Can't stop a river, when it's burst it's banks
I know what you are, what you are
I give You my life
But harder to mind
When you're looking
Drifting on a bed
Sweet time came
Having a good time, baby
Að lífið hér var hart enda var ég það sem á
I sound the oath to sit
A way you move and hold your hands
I told him I would have to say no
Wears a pretty face and armor
Long distance drunk, long distance drunk
Because we were once cinema gods in the night,
Sail through the crimson skies
My people no stronger
Never knew this was possible
The more anxious that you get 
Because I don\'t associate with fish
One day they will be as giants
Oh I had a friend 
In the car park in between my house and yours
Did you gaze upon the waves and did you consider yourself
One side is made, the other side too soon
Deep in his dreams at home
And daily there's an old drive shaft
Women, weed and weather
And came back for the van the next morning
I've just got away with it
Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky
Ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh
This is why I've been saying
A line that never ends
And no I'm not alright 
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me"
And I will try and dry my eyes
But I still like it, maybe
And I need
But it won't come down for anyone
But I would like to believe
Whores and angels, men with problems
And the horse died standing up
Oh, I know it's hard but you stay with me, oh oh, we've got a memory
Searching the darkness
To the green woods I will wander and shun all men's view
Ich weiß noch nicht, wann verstreicht die Frist
A tear in the fabric that no one could see 
If you should wake to find you're abandoned
With a thought she has caught by a thread
I put my pride on the line
Your gran died and your mother died
I don't try to make love last
Can't understand the reasons why
Send a message to the unborn child
Chasing homeless cheerleaders,
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried
Hold me in your arms tonight
That I swore was everything but beautiful
You can't break my spirit, it's my dreams you take
There is another world
For the places where the memories flow
Lets drive until we hit the sky
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
And you never knew
So we pass the time and occupy our minds
Pick a place to meet
Who's willing to explain this story
Follow me down to the laughing city,
To lose your friends
I sing and drink and sleep on floors
até amanhã eu vou ficar
Oh, no way, no way, there's no movement
And you can bet your life it rains
For you around the bend
You're my moonlight, ohooh
"But you is a seven time felon, what you doin' with that"
I can't see the coastline anymore
This ain't no place for a man of faith
She called the wind and then it came
Yeah 'cause you need from me
I love the way it's happening now
Where people are pleasantly strange
Pulls me out of my lonely hell
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
Laughter and sirens song, in here I belong
With two eyes open and two eyes feeling all right
If it was my last day X ooh
When we looked and we found that it hit some other crowd
Hospital blue paint off the wall,
Now that we spread our wings
I don't know why I do the things I do
Stone throwing I've got nothing to do
Every night is a nightmare
I've been around a long time
Then it goes fast, you think of the past 
Should I write myself out of the history books
It's a new life for me
That sneaks through houses as we barter for sleep
Feel from the world
Some men call me saint
How many smokes till I'm satisfied
And though I beg and plead with you, you tell me it's not time
A pure and simple honesty
You stood alone in the halo's haze
To what I did and said
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling
I wasn't made for anytime
I'm breaking into pieces
At every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
And though you're gone I remember
It ain't so long since you were flying high
He's never asked for a favor or the money yet
When I needed you the most you were, nowhere to be found
Her night was good and long
I love you more with each new day
Than slow growing fear
All night manoeuvre
I love you, I do
I don't say prayer for anyone
Und mich, und niemanden
Got a brand new crutch and a brand new mile
No one never really has a clue
You of all the good times that we've seen
Now his friends bring him up when they're drinking
Piercing into me and I miss your warmth
My clumsy tongue will make it right
When all that's inside is poison to everyone
Well I'm orbiting the world
 gone without a trace
I met you on a midway at a fair last year
You're so hypnotic on my heart
I know I will say goodbye
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
One of your sunny afternoons
el portero dice "¿Qué tal
It's a perfect moment, oh
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Oh, you are the roots that sleep beneath my feet 
Oh just feel your skin
I wanna stay here and never go home again
To a place where you don't know which road to choose
To the unspoken question I say
But now I say either way
These temptations have blinded desires
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
A sun that doesn't set but settles 
But life is cool and things aren't bad
Wasting golden hours in the fall
There's a pressure to deliver here, your gonna get hurt if you don't play this game
My thoughts of you are drowning in the noise
He questions whether chance or fate will ever show a sign
I am so alone
But his feets never been on the ground
Took you all for prisoner with just one line, one lie
'Cause the stars in the sky, and the fashion that they are aligned
Living outside of mutual bliss
You say, don't think so
I believe it's not so bad
Standing on the outside, looking
You bring the spring, the summer, fall
Keep your eyes open wide
It won't be long till I'm back again
Is there a melody  that could lead you to me  like a lullabied child lead to sleep
Hopefully it occurs to me that there's one thing I can't stand
Kusuri mitai ni 
It's not easy to erase your blood
Give it away
And how I wish I could talk to you now
We gon' get more acquainted at a time when you least expect it
And if my day is set and I haven't stopped yet
I feel love's wheels turning
This sweet old world will give it out until it's time to leave
Some people read idea books
I want you so badly you know, that it's a pain to wait
So in love, so in love
When my insides gush out there's no telling what it's about
Just let me love you
It's come in time to face the truth
Talk to me face to face
Postcards to the one I miss forever
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Even if your cheap career
Would just fall apart and slip through my hands
Gonna keep on moving on up, I wanna stick around
And kingdoms fall
Only love can conquer hate
Ride the only one who knows
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings
Washed up by an ocean who had tired of me
Please singin' his tune
I hear that summer's coming back
When I am falling like a stone
With a needle hanging out of its arm
So let's go hold your baby's head
Kicked up dirty leaves
You loved me
Bleed out the deviled soul
Through sheets of jungle rain
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
When we pass on the streets, I won't look away
And proceeded to take my life apart
I'll show you everything I see
I heard you did Pack it in
Lay down your heart on me
Hold me, taking it back in tears
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
Who wouldn't tear my heart in two
Just trying to find a place to lay my head
Building castles in the air
To end the doldrums 
Of your hair
But I've no idea where you are from the dialaview
And all my life
We're all bloodless and blind 
If anyone ever wonders where he went
The piece that I represent compliments each and every one
And I picked my way through elms
You know I like it being in your family
I'll just sit at home
Wenn ich sehe, wie du um die Ecke gehst
Ooh ooh, oh oh, oh oh oh
If all the world could take a moment
If it's real, I feel
To heaven, hell, or beyond to that Great Vast
My place to yours 
And I'll sing harmony
Like dancers in the wind
She was comparable to Cleopatra
 savoir comment
The same old streets just a different name
Just like everybody
Fool in the night
And the rain beats down
I enter the visible world
The ones overfilled
I see the city through the rain
Not coming home,
To love or to hate
I'll be with you till we're both gone
And so he targeted to be the dream guardian
All through you'd battle for the answers you were brave till the very last
Like the searchlights in the parking lots of hell
Barely conscious in the door where you stand
Can't stand it anymore
Snakes of smoke are dripping from your fingers
And I wait with the plate, piled high with my love
And thanks to you it will be done, for you to me are the only one
They converge on every side
Smelling of deepfried beans and whispering your name
One fine night
It's in the season
And poke my head out the door
Hollowing soul
That meet a maid who lends one lively winking eye
Oh, it never ends
So you can get on with your search, baby
Free your vulnerable mind
I think I might give up everything, just ask me to
I didn't know didn't know, didn't know
I can't find one
Life is ill, again life's a movie
This moment's ours to treasure
While he'd tie it to a doorknob, wind up, and then slam it
Mojique sends the package to the American man
To bring the ocean to our toes
Tell God I wanna fly, let me live in the sky
Or threw away
Is everything we have
For all feels like mine
God's chosen a place
No it's in my head
The stars keep this fire
Closed the hatch up with one hand
Take my hand, you're treading water 
To love and let go, was never the design
I don't mind you
So what are we saying
And love is the prize
Well, at least that is my memory
And I am like their mother
And leave behind the springtime days
Give yourself a chance to breathe
Won't you man up now
Love in these modern times 
om tare tuttare
And dismiss your demons
Let me fall apart
And I wanna try for you 'cause
I thought I wanted to be part of you
The river is deep and the mountain high
But now's your chance to shine
She's still my favorite work of art
Thrift store shirts and old haircuts
With a desire to be understood
And my mothers little heart will break 
A family man
They're content with what they've got
You and I belong in dreams like this
Left with regrets I'm sorry for everything 
The Spanish guitar someone strums
Jesus the Mexican boy born in a truck on the th of July
Every love is your best love and every love is your last love
Well you, quit kicking me under the table
She's got me praying to the wrong god every night
And when this game is over
Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down
I had a vision of this place
Rhea sat on the front step getting her hair combed out and greased
One lonely moment in your arms is the miracle of love
That morning the sea was mad, and I mean it
Oh baby, how you drove me crazy
Discipline to prevent things when they're older
Is to make you feel safe
Lay my head against my pillow
And here we are
I'm just a step away
It's okay  this'll help, inside
Has got to last us quite awhile
But now your skin is bare
Look deep INTO the April face
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
All alone with someone
So hold me in your arms
Get you here today
So when I die, I hope I live in the sky
Wanna be on the right end
To rake in that last night's fare
Runaway
Pris au piège par le souffle imminent
She may soon be gone, so don't look back
The writing on the wall at North Point
And no one ever looked your way
And the waves like lessons
'Cause me and you, we are one of a kind"
He thinks to himself, this alone is a wealth
Down we fall  
This boy, thought he had found his girl This boy, ought to have kept that girl This boy, caught up in the wheels of fate, this boy deserves, oh this boy, he needs love, an everlasting love He needs love Oh this boy, he knows, how to feel, the blood in his heart runs strong as , this boy only knows what's real, so give him love, an everlasting love Give him love Oh this boy, he's got a, heart of gold and gold's the most precious thing, you could ever hold and if his heart is made of that, what   be told, just give him love, an everlasting love Give him love
He slides so gently off her hand
Nothing left to ffind when you are down
I can't coerce you into this one
Rotten pulp inside and never well
But I ran a mile in a minute and there's no going back
Your eyes have died but you see more than I
Ooh, stay open
I don't know if it's already crashed on the shore
You openly admit
Stop, you can't believe what you believe
Just think of all the places we could be
Let the rain fall
Welcome My Friends
There's too many strangers on this long
Scold me, that's all you've got to say
Shocking, shocking, shocking, yeah yeah yeah
You slice their throats, continue on your way
And every time I see your friends they just ask me where you are again and it hurts
The pain and the sorrow that you felt
The captain cries "Here comes the rout"
This wasted time on you has left me
And I'd run to find you anywhere at all
A traveling song to ease the ride
He pulls on a coat of new born skin
My dream was this
Who never believed it would end
I'll be laughin' all of the way
It's easier to say it's over,
And the memories of a life I wish we'd lived
A bit more inside
Sea creatures stared at us and we stared back at them
No one remembers your name
With the ghost that was there
Turned upside down
Tired of getting stoned
'Til they are strong and good to fly
I knew I'd run into you, I had that feeling
To stimulate the mind
It's too late now to stop
We were both in it and everything seemed so right
I wanna love ya
Hope you don't murder me
Between, half the time I'm so dead
We held hands and made a circle
Tho' the rain and the sun come through
"No," said the Hobo, "No more tales of time;
Der mir nach all diesen Jahren endlich nah war
His value declined
It's you or none, my damaged one
When you're not home
When I was young
I'd rather be dreaming of someone than living alone
It seems so far away but so close
The things that you love
In the book of my life
That nothing could be further from the truth, my love
Do wake me from my place
We'll forget each other's names
Feel a wave of destiny wash over my helpless body
And hold it till the end
Or will it march to a new beat
You took a long time to make it
He leans back from his desk
But suffice it to say
gegen etwas zu sein
I wait for manhood
But my cries are swelling
Take me into your skin
Clinging a shoulder a leap begins
Thunder comes arollin' down
Close your eyes, sunshine
I can get pretty sidetracked
Everybody else just arrived,
Und irgendwo in Frankreich
But that you knew I was coming
You have no body, just a cage to hold your parts
These days I don't see you walk so proud
There was something going on that night
Sing it loud and clear, I'll always be waitin' for you
If nothing changes then I'm gonna stop 
My star has left me
You looked at me and saw what I never could see
Darling Kings Of the highway We will be
I felt your shape and heard you breathing
But it doesn't matter 'cause I'm packing plastic
And I can feel your pain, deep in my bones, deep in my bones
My spirit flies to you now I can see your soul
Getting wood for the fire
Give me your hand
Because you're young, sharp as a knife
My headphones
He sees the foreigners in fancy houses
Que el olor de su amor
Reflecting only shadows
I really couldn't say I mind
Sunlight pours in
The moon will rise
Something we will never understand
Haunted all this time
I want to be somewhere I can see the roads
Yuletide by the fireside
He says "It's dinner time"
Just leave me your ghost
"Well, all I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head"
And if my time is tabled and my clock is on time
Tip of my iceberg blues are showing
Please tell me that part again
This is goodbye, gravity
Where we're right
And fill it's mouth with the desire
Give give give until there's nothing left
And the birds as they soar on their wings
Even though I'm seeing three of your faces
I've got to get up and get over you
If you let your feelings go, dear
I'm going back to the sea
Costners back into the left
I've been sleeping for days 
But then again sometimes I get really sweet
Why this now girl
That she passes by the price trying not to steal life but they reach beneath you
Keep bumping into walls and taking lots of falls
No subtle men
Break into air
I love the way you moan
And in your bones it is so cold,
On kotisi lämmin ja lohdullinen
How long before the other side
Sits down by the fire
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
But I still can't seem to tell you why
Still I'm unable to inhale all the riches
Of the mountains on the moon and then a Jesuit
On everything from how I act to what I say
The flowers are everywhere
Kings of the highway we will be
Bluebirds singing a song
Let's not just talk about it please
And it takes some words to make an action
Jag kan tänka tills det knappt finns nått kvar
For now I'm just a candle trying to stay lit in this windy night
Keepin' the cool from comin' out, yeah
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
But they're all too busy to go into town
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations, 
A sound that it makes
Det bor en ängel i mitt rum
Or none of it is true
Would bring you back to me
Oh I never knew you from the sun
All these days
You are my precious ghost
A crime's a crime but I don't mind
Just writing little songs to past the time
You go south to the white spirit world
They are like those children
Like they're trying to prove it won't fall out
Here's two for being unaware, that you're gone
What lies ahead is between
At least in the dog's mind
Do you see it's no ice on my wrist
Surprise, I can see it in your eyes
By the look in your eyes I know the time's nearly come 
Facing the ghosts that decide if the fire inside still burns
I wish I had knew
To keep you out of harm's way
Leveled home
Every time I want to say hello
Of a perfect night
And you mail yourself right inside
Moments last and lifetimes are lost in a day
And with Him we shall be forever blessed
Oh, living for the city and it's always troubling
In the name of something new
In the middle of town
And the rest of our lives would've fared well
At the comfortable glow from the porch, the one I will still call yours
Is there a melody  that could lead you to me  like a lullubied child to sleep
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
Quiet dark and small
But together we wandered
On our world without sound
I read them tonight
I've never seen your love again
Let's not waste this precious time;
On the arrow head
But you'll never see I'd rather cry than have you pity me
It's a shame the things you hide behind it
I've tried my hardest since we started
Yeah, need, need, need, need, need, need, need some kicks
Came to an unmanned sort of harbour
Keep your eyes open for a while
And she said, "I killed a man, T
Have you heard the sea
It's almost right
And swear you're right
And they get stronger
So build that wall and build it strong
With all the cold that kept it down
I hear the words you say
I caught your eye with a camera's flash
And I truly believe,
Sometimes you can relate
I was already dressed when she opened her mouth 
When you know I would do anything for you
Where is the sea
Take away the way to ease the pain
Say you'll be mine
A smile from a frown circles round
Or right when I can't eat
Spoke no silver spoon
Yeah I've found someone
And no one waits forever
En faire l'affaire de nos sentiments
I could drive 
I close my eyes, and I dream of my butterfly
Keepin' it in for a later tune
How come I never do
Same hair, revolution, same build, evolution
I know how tricky things can be
That filled the eye
On you to move in and we can play hard
It makes me uncomfortable
Holding my breath through tunnels, 
By the river
Beeing needed 
Take for a while, your trumpet from your lip
Run to a girl you barely know
Körde mig till ett kontor
You know that you're wonderful
Checking out your girlfriend 
Nothing ever changes at the Parallel
The story of a ship
To search for someone
Oh my God, look around this place
Good times come and they go
The word's on the streets and it's on the news
Every doubt every fear
When you said this would never be undone
But who needs to see what we've done
Well, I jumped in the water, started to drown
And all the things I couldn't say
To believe
The women do cry as they watch over me
Way beyond the searchlight,
Is the person we are
There is no such place 
Please Mr Lostman �が�い�い
Easier to be me ooh ah
Know you wonder if the timing's off
When I've gone to find my ain true love
Toda beleza se reconhece nela
Forward Drive Green lights Green lights
The dog in the garden road
On a life support machine 
When all the characters full size and every moon is level
But a cold stare
Clapping with the human race
Watching I was waiting for you,
I'll tear out your heart"
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
You didn't give up on me
He's tryin' to make His way home
Chop down the cherry trees on Mango Street
From beginning to end
Step away, get me when I'm down
Did Eric call by the way
That I once thought had passed me by Thought had passed me by
The music spinning in our head
And in the salty sea, I find you're all but gone 
Olas y olas me llaman del mar
And this ain't no time for games
I'll brace myself for the loneliness
Hope it's right when you die, old and bony
I wanted love without the build up
To be here and be bringing bad news
The light behind the cracks of glass is so bright
To get what you been missin' come take a trip with me
Sometimes the good life wears thin
We're searching for our parts
To show you what I have inside,
When you come around, everything else disappears, my mouth disappears
A place in the sun
But isn't is so unlike us, come now
And if you move to the right 
Ain't nothing but a tragedy
Trouble needs me
Yeah baby
We were young souls
Every time you left me behind nanana
That just waste space
All the times I had to give
Asked to stop
I believe now 
I'll show you how it feels to be fucked up like me,
'Cause I can't even stand it
With my earth in the wind smoking fire, let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you, for you
When will the water stop Will it pour all day
Hey girl now that I got you all alone in my room my room
You got me, sad and lonely
I got more I got no need
Where hope had lured by the thousand
Sydämeni
 am twilight
Back to the start and the scrap
Like winter in July
And upon new road I have started keep on, try to breath in
They say I'm caught up in a dream
I ain't asking you to try it
Please don't be upset my darling, please don't get upset
We were so windy winding flying
I was wrong, so wrong
Schlaflos quäle ich mich durch die Nacht
Mais comment te dire
All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes
Oh, if you ever come at me you snake
I can't remember the last time that it was yours
This is how it always starts, dumb choices from the heart
A kiss'll betray us all
Wherever you are, whenever you speak
Put your hands on me, my love
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream
We're never afraid and the consequence opens the door
Around my golden sky
Well I had no choice
Crooked souls trying to stay up straight
Out of sight is out of mind
But you're just the right size, 
I try to pressurise the parts of you I'm wanting,
They were once in your eyes, but you sneezed them out while sleeping
You can't fall unless you feel it
How'd he get the cash The day his father passed away
I can be the right reminder at the right time,
Lost inside
Merry Christmas, baby
Every beautiful melody
It's the most alone you felt
All marks on my body vanished in a day
Oh Florida please be still tonight
Por encima de todas tus otras cosas, me gustan
Can't get you off or out of my head
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin' money man
Abusing 'cause you're a friend
I've no interest
Now that I know I'll never feel the same way
How my days they spin me 'round
Three square meals and a place to call home
You have been my friend
Just tell me one more time,
I am a mountain out of reach
Unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness into
I wanna pull things up
If your heart is beating fast, then you know she's right
Can't do a thing to stop me now
The curse will come from the underground down by the shore,
Windswept child on a shooting star
I can't believe that it's been three years
Try fastforward
To anyone who'll listen
For  years I've been trying to believe and confide in
I've seen the future and the end is here
Champagne from last new year's
E o que ela não
Never saw things going so right
Things were stable yesterday but now they're blown away
Tief rein werfen wir uns in die dicke heiße Luft
So deep and so strong
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
Cause it feels like static when you're here
Hey man, what's your style
The mountains and the trees
Are you saying that you'd really listen
Gets colder day by day, I miss her
Make it just like new
Oh the sound of distant carnival drums
Does she come here for
Let me watch by the fire and remember my days
'Cause I am floored
That almost made you cry
Darling you're with me forever and always
So if separate ways we go
These eyes on your back, hands in your neck
Exciting and new, shameful and true
Turning over every stone
And both shall row my love and I
To hope it's not too late, I hope it's not too late
Dreamin' like a lonely child
Are you who you say that you are, you
Honey dripping pale of skin while there's bodies underneath
I'm insideoutsidein, I want subdivision
In my life in my life yeah
Make me feel so much hate
A fleet of golden galleons on a crystal sea
Now you come and you arrive by me
Then make a sad face and tell me it's too late
But the landlord tried to kick that good boy out, that good boy out
I love the way
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds
And I have been left alone, with no answers
Han flyger upp bland alla moln och glömmer alla år
'Til they wrap around your throat
As we said all our goodbyes
It's your time
And hallelujah to the one that we love
Summertime after our family broke
You're my wonderful heaven sent down to me
With some other love yarn 
And I've got some things
You can't take it back 
Wish it was goodbye
Observing conversations, lifting them when they fall
All your insides fall to pieces
Wanderlust
Somebody, somebody, somebody left your heart in the cold
It's what I always wanted
Ooh Another love has come and gone
Whatever you do, don't leave me tonight
Flying kites and water fights
Everyone's around, you stayed in tonight
She�s a spectacular girl
All the stupid things we say
Until it all just falls apart
I never thought it would be quite like this
Sometimes the girl is here
Smiling across a friend's friends
Time after time
Call me raincheck, on a golden autumn day
By digitising thunder and traffic noises, Georgia was able to compose aleatoric music
Outside, awake
On the breeze of night
Someone's calling
Heaven and hell both take to this woman's womb
I never thought you would let me go
Corner tubeless dark and wet, straighten
She was mine
Then you take away the starlight
You buried him under rent and low pay
Was to wipe her tears away
I got a get a date,
'Cause all I do is wonder how
Got a tattoo and the pain's all right
Where did we go wrong
Came home late one night
The essential child
Have you ever been told you've got a weirdshaped head
I still feel love for you
Until we came back down
She feels that she has nothing left to prove
Lower them down in the ground
Kickball games behind the school
But from here now baby I'm gone leave that up to you,
Yesterday followed me along,
And then only city lights will brighten the night sky
Everything loses its legs when you come around, around, around
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
All the blue
I've loved 'til I've lost
Fallen in love and I know I can't change me
'Cause your love, our love
Imagine a staircase standing in front of you
A fighter in the corner with no fight
Of what you want to say to me
On the charts of rhyme arts and thoughts in rap form
Every other little way
The lines in your head have to all be replaced
Il est parti sans paix Sans même allumer le calumet
I rolled and I took my chances
And when my story's told
You'll become a resolution
All things past in the pickup
You took the air, you took the time
We said our last goodbye
And we'll never be apart
Juliet says, "Hey it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack"
Their song of birth and agony
I almost couldn't wash the sheets
So take my hands, love, there's a burst inside our minds
Oh let me spread your wings and come inside
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one 
Even though nothing was the same
Inside you are everything else
If love could've lasted forever I'd be with her today
It's not easy for a blind man, to see the Sun
Do you understand
And we don't know what we'll be getting
On the crowed last car of the downtownbound 
I don't know what you're carrying
A sight for sore eyes to the blind would be awful majestic
On the brink of illusion, it's the devil in my eyes
Will your heart still race for me
You're a bird with a pretty mouth
Beggin' till I'm poor
Cover the floor same as be fore 
And you've a smile and a bruise
Seems like it always seems
Your silence
Falling in love with the weight of the water 
All I wanted was
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake
One step at a time,
Time for another smile
All my children can become me
To help you understand
Alphabet das wir Beide teilen
So I'll just give until there's nothing else
Pray that we make it to twentyone, one, one, one
That night you played me �Lit Parade
Sister, walk through these fields of delight
Will you come along to the end
I get the final say
While I'm smoking on a B, dippin' through the streets
Concrete girl, don't fall down
You see we should start
Oh, baby
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
You are such a liar
Another day, another chance to get it right
But on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
A smile, if you dare ah
Or make it happen now
The feeling sometimes, wishing you were someone else
What if you were meant to be the one
I would love to go
I had not had any sleep
And we could jump in the river upstream
Chorus extended
As you fall out of your clothes
Because you would rather that I wasn't here 
Everything haoppens to me
To guide you each step of the way
You run around and you front like you're still on fire
Hardly becomes me
In these nursing homes
Push the little baby down the
And people are such
Fades out like a dance
In the distance between us
You left a hole so big, Lord, beyond repair
Say you're not around, am I finished
Your body broke your fall 
And joyful memories there
'Cause I lit that flame, now it's burning me
Means getting passed around
Yes, then you have given your soul away
Remember our affection way back when
Let's do it serpentine any time
And you talkin' 'bout her family, her aunts and shit
Plans fail every day
That has me crossing over lines
One more dime to show for my day
No one's gonna know I'm gone
Like a child told it cannot play, whoo
By design, God gave me feelings
When it falls down from the pillow late at night
I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know
Und ich spüre die Verzweiflung
That breeze can come before you fall
In the spotlight
No point in asking 'cause I always dance alone
The old times make way for the new
And in my heart I hope that you will fall for me again
You know you caught their eye
The first thing
Brings you sounds you thought were gone
That's rare
And get yourself dressed instead
For the bread of life is mine
You haven't touched your food tonight
I'm living but, really though, it's never enough
Is our season over
In the night, I hear 'em talk,
Well across the fractured landscape
These lovers they ain't the game
I've become what I know not breathes
Sometimes I wonder why
Who needs please when we've got guns
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
But I gotta run
Heart of the country, where the holy people grow
When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes
From every troubled thought
When you thought you were caught with unknowable thrills
The summers they ain't the same
Is written in stone
A world that I cannot describe
When you're in my arms
Because I've come home
Another year is stalling
No, no I don't care
A strange glow in the sky
Don't you fly
I was in a train under a river when I remembered what
I'll pull your arms tight behind your back, use myself as weight
When life becomes so dark
I want a horse, I got a sheep
I just wanted you to feel what I feel for you
Everything that you do's so amazing
David Letterman, even said he like that track man
Soft pyramids evaporate at daylight
She's looking for someone to settle her debts 
You teach me how to feel
Long way out to the air
Full of cigarettes, guns and drugs and stuff
The scent of smoldering leaves
If the sun can shine
I don't know, make it
I know some times
Cold morning, I was looking out it was a cold day
I won't have no presents this year
My hair has grown
Goodbye house  goodbye stairs
I make up a song as I'm aworking along
And everywhere we go, I can feel the subtle taste
Your were the one that did believe
Know that you're sore and sick and sad for some reason
'Cause now we say goodnight
But nothing about measures
And don't it feel all right, and don't it feel so nice
Haul away for home 
Take a look around now
Never need to part
We're all talk, talk
The song of the fly and the rush
Everything would be all right
And if it starts to snow
So drink up all you people
Imagining that you are here with me
How you get your adrenaline flowing
This night right now
In these frozen and silent nights
How about doing it just like yesterday
Hey friends don't you think you better cool it down
From the flames
Won't spend my days in my bed
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs
Loving you is the best thing and the worst thing in my life
Time chasing time
We leave our homes in flames
Yeah, need some kicks
Take me back to the retards; cause the world just make me sick
And I silently wish I was on one
And things, they seem much bleaker
When all the waves and oceans rise
As the sadeyed woman spoke we missed our chance
And take me by the hand
Over and over in my brain again
All the things you loathe
Just through your mind and away from you
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
I could easily bring you tears, I could send you to hell, I know you
Another kiss that I thought I meant 
Why don't you take a friend
I hope somehow you'll know
I've been one in a million 
Even when I die, it will sing to you
Your love won't be leaving
They've broken your heart
We went Beyond where we should have gone
When it comes to you
Squints while he's showing emotion he normally won't
Sometimes in a dream you appear
The honesty of love
And Harlem River all because
Because everyone has hopes, you're human after all
Hey man, what's your style
A downtown kind of baby
Now feels like forever
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I try to believe in anyone look at the state I'm in, I'm fine
Static every time
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out
Oh boy
They've got us on the ropes But we don't have to take it lying down anymore
I've got no space
When you take my hand
And slaps you like a wave
Into dark forests of piano sounds
You tell the stories I need you to tell
So when you walk outside to see the reasons fall
The sun and moon and all the stars
There are people who will tell you
Into the trees
Soon the suffering will end
Even the low are falling
And a voice so fimilar
You made me feel like I belong
Take back the line, go back  I'm sure
"You fired that shot and I simply had to watch
And now I'm comfortably blind to what goes on outside
Could I put my hands up
Ooh, at the right time
This time like every other time I believe that I never find
You say darlin' don't
On his estate
Yeah, drive slow, homie
Starlight sigh and shadow move
In a physical way
When the blood cumma down his neck
No cutlass wound will mar thy face
But he's such a man
Would you take it all back
If you concentrate, mountains will move
Curled on the blue velveteen again, straighten
But all you see is fall, fall, fall
They're driven by a strange desire
My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him
I have seen a true nightmare
Technicolor girls are always on the phone
Sometimes I suffer from distractions like
I can't believe that our trains didn't even slow down
Is her middle name Cherie, so It's a Secret Cherie, maybe
Like the boats pulled up on the sand for the summer
Because one day out there we will all be dead
Seeing if ill come around
Dreams, dreams
Some are lovers
Put it on and get it on with you
There's not enough time
If this one wasn't enough
Let 'em go, give it up, for a while
Machines will all break down in the way I know
Good things to think on
Maybe then now and then I would want somebody
She shoveled the dirt into my face,
Everything will be fine
And I'm only halfway sober, and it's not getting me any closer,
So let us say a prayer 
And if you saw with my eyes you'd see what selfdeception means
Who knows if it'll go our way
I'm warning, not strong enough to take it now
I've clawed it back
The hardest hitter that I ever knew
And press my lips onto his
Me and him are outlaws now
As I leave your side
Nothing sweet, nothing nice, nothing kiss, only fights
But my love
On the top sides of both of her hands
I fall asleep, you come to me
Bang van komen en jouw gaan
Find our way to fall
It's been a long time
He was late this time last week
Go and pester elsewhere, onecent rhymes
When we touched and I was so high
And everything's cool as long as I'm getting thinner
Oublier le temps
I took the N Train in from the ocean
Here we are standing here
No ending, no beginning
There's a golden key unlock all the doors
Won't have to ask her please again there she goes
Now the rain turns into snowfall as the,
A thought enters your mind
But I never forget you in my prayers
'Cause it's filled with words once spoken
Good people for alibis
Candle is waxing, takes my apartment
You love me, yes you do
No, I don't mind let it all pass
Don't say walk 
I know he'd release it like a bird to the sky
I'm living up here and I'm watching your 
She smoked her lavender cigarette
And set fire to the curtains
You're doing your best dance, your best look
I wonder if you can see me
Blaming their troubles
Flies so high and sings so good
Crank the volume now the song is all mine
This adrenaline rush is keeping me high
Maybe I could be, let me pretend
Making fools of all the neighbors
Ah, la, la, la, life is meaningful
There is a hand that can reach you there
Lies in the hands that set me free
Cut the corn, washed it clean
Auf den meisten steht nur ein Wort Namenlos
I'm far away
He's lost and gone again
Is older than the sky we lay under eyes
We move too fast to remember
Orphans always say
Over the edge of all our knowings
He said, "let's get in the car and just drive"
Still it's not really a weep
So don't cry
And I ran off and ran on to something
And all you want in your eyes,
Killed by an angel
And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
They're empty enough to pour in the skies
And as you walk through death's dark veil
Your music was to stay forever
Still too young to fail, too scared to sail away
Roll the film without the love scene
I'm feeling shyer and the world gets darker
Rosalie
Beware the wrecking angel
Instantly antiquated let's wash our hands
He does not look down
Little takeaway girl
You could lie in the face or the look 
Remember, you're gonna get hurt someday, anyway
Flowing rivers may have stopped me when have stopped me when
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
It's getting hard to fake
Don't do something you might regret someday
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
Take one step with each number
Yes fate is cruel sometimes,
From coast to coast, or where ever I find my place
Gone, so gone
The world I can see is a nowhere land
That doesn't mean that we have to part
All of the while, I never knew
Was a windless night 
May your garden be sweet
He made his way to the border
And I could call it many names
I belong with your arms wrapped around my neck
In a world of fading sadness
I was for sure
Under the waves, down in the deep
If this was my last day here on earth earth earth earth
In mine when I'm asleep
She lies still 
We are children of divorce
That I don't appreciate your love
There's no way out of misery
Left for them to plunder
Won't you man up now and
How strange, how sweet, to find you still 
All the evidence points in one direction
I am the shadow on your skin and I'll be gone very soon
Catch me flying in the sun
Alright, you can cry
And I can't stop this rain
And if someone came to be
From your eyes for me to see
But every time the wind pulls back my hair
Stop, you make me frown your little town
So you can get back to where you should be
A part of your soul ties you to the next world
Well the cause of it's a lesson learned
Dressing doesn't mean a thing to me
But no one knows me
And mother and daughter may reconcile but their faces will never heal
And your tree, it never grew any leaves
You killed the feeling but the pain's still alive
Wont sleep the night before I'll be up just wondering my life
While our parents are on Fire Island
Forget about guns and forget ammunition
Just open up your heart and let this fool rush in
Baby, cast your eyes
Down on his knees
Do you know this change of hope covering their eyes
I'll be crashing on you, baby
But I still chased after you tonight
I can't sleep 
Take their clothes off when they're tipsy
I was blue, just as blue as I could be
Starryeyed
Her hair it twists 'round her necklace
And a lovestruck Romeo he sings the streets a serenade
Who's on the pressure I had reason 
You'll be in my life
Parking the sad car
Of her left hand
Don't come to me with forevers
I don't really understand it
I'll find time to throw us down 
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Now despite my fears I dance for you
Abraza los momentos lindos
What's left to say 
I know another love has come your way, just listen to me when I say
Until they rise like mountain ranges at my feet
The roads wind towards windward side
When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer
Why this frightened part of me that's fated to pretend 
A hue and cry waiting to blow
No need to be sorry
Decorative rocks, we'll fight all their rentacops
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head
What is that sad look in your eyes
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
You make it look so easy, baby, babe
If you want better things
Looked in the bathroom stall 
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
Merry Christmas, baby
It's the disco infiltrator gone cold
Except for the sound of Jacob Marley's chain
You can hear ghost trains
Fortunes could fall upon your kiss
I let him wake me but decided not to stay
Messin' up my wet dream
Seems I did something right
Trotzdem ist Liebe wunderschön,
And the bills that you paid with were worth nothing at all
You keep abreast of all the things you think you should
Sun been down for days
Just a touch, a stain, a hole in your brain
And I have been the fool
Autumn falling from trees
Ride that highway in the sky
It's a grave that sings your song
But there is not a day that ever passed by
Suddenly I noticed that it weren't quite the same
Inside us all, it makes me cry
I'll wait for you love
Its burning fingers rummage through your insides
I have become pure water
Rarely seen
But the taste is sweet
For a few days I am the only one
I wouldn't mind if I could get with you right away
Then I can read your thoughts
I got a letter from a dear friend of mine
After all it's the end
Sleepwalking, see you talking
Always got to cosign, everything's a ten
Oh, if I knock on your door would you let me in
And you can take my hand
There ain't no stopping now
Jimmy's corner in Raging Bull
I disappear in those bodies of motion
It's fake believe
One day, you come around to see the other side of things
Cause everything is gonna be alright
And I walked out in the sun
In the end
Overdosed on herion, died at 
Everybody says I gotta be crazy
Take back the fruit, I'm here to rule
So much to fight for, so much to change
Every little night
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices
It's the same old, same old song
What you are about to hear are true stories
If you don't mind, why don't you mind
It is still there
File off the sharpness of feelings so
That money buys everything
And there's no one to break the fall
When I was three, three maybe four
You said I was the missing part
We can pat ourselves on the back
Oh when the cold wind blows
The world is all bending and breaking from me
So poor, so dark
Yeah, well, it'll leave you feeling hollow and helpless
And I've got a bottle I can aim at the center,
You know, I love the way you drive your car now
Can't take my love away, ah 'cause it's here to stay
Rambling through the the avenues of time
The babytalk voices and the post class A nasal trip
Your hair's receding fast and so is your mind
No one should see this
No pressure, I know you're real
All alone, with a heart of stone
I read that independence was a lightness in your step
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Let me get your ass alone
That way
Been the crawl of a mountain 
Oh my God, why are we so afraid
Chase me through the dark
Hold me in your arms tonight;
Tu verses le sang sur mes vers blancs nonpluricellulaires
The longest train I ever saw
E quanto a gente paga pelos sonhos que deixou
I'll start at your heart then move deeper inside deeper inside
And so today, my world it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the miles
No need to follow
Some men die
Nobody's busy all the time
Alles war okay, doch das Gefühl hielt weiter an
They say you curse at girls
In the sharp gust of love
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go Drive slow, homie
Survivors in the night
I'd like to rip you out of your skin
These ceilings can keep the pain
They ruin my summer
And no one else
Is there anything else
But there's none of them can sing so sweet 
Please, please place final bets
Gonna make it alright
Would care
Ce mec est un playboy
Me coiffer, essayer au moins
And she smiles down on me 
That sing of alone
And the older that we get
I'm now required by love
When all the pain we've overcome
As I'm walking and no I'm not breathing
Leavers always say
And I've got scars to prove it
We were looking for the summer
And love is blind, but that I knew when
Mended and all made clean
While trying to keep a hold of your hand
Oh, hold its hands and we'll know what truth is
Yeah we have oh so many friends who like to pretend we're still in high school
And do you understand
Just take a look around, here
But I just have to tell that I love you so much these days
This is for all the lonely people
Sleep walking, see you talking
And fades away like morning dew
Saying hello to men friends
It's blown apart by the wind blowing by
Maybe I could get some sleep
Ich verliere meine Antlitz
That I'm so easy to please, so easy
Chess pieces in some grandiose scheme 
Why'd you have to phone 
Through the window of my eyes
Still he knows how to ease down slow
That Sunny Skies hasn't a friend
I want it painted black and red
The white trash boys listen to their headphones
So count it on your fingers
When panic lies just ahead
All she wants is some breathing room
We won't be living this way
wann kànn es wieder zurück
The tears of a silent rain
Although we're lost in space
Once you filled my hands with roses
But know you're mine tonight
And if you need me, I'll come and see thee, and be your visitor,
Till the night I held you
gestern war es umgekehrt
In the weak last gasp of the evening's dying light
It hinges on the driver's seat
Dinner at eight was okay
Stop, stop it
You take away my firm belief
A lot like LL, Chuck D, Slick and Dougie
It's time you realized
Somebody to talk to
When he decided he was through with love
Love would leave me feeling
To all the good times we shared
In it for love  money's too tight to mention
Ich werd mit Dir sein, an jedem Tag der kommt
In His arms so many prayers rest
I've no idea what's right sometimes
She was a fishmonger and sure it was no wonder
We can be a ghost now
Won't you come
And hope to pay the rent
I wish I could step from this scaffold
You felt it so strong, but nothing's turned out how you want it
Was built by white settlers seeking gold and other treasures
A look into your eyes
I either love it or I hate it
And if the ocean should freeze
Oh when you take my hand
To fight against snow way too thick,
There is no cure for our disease
No work said the boss at the bunk house door
Just dragonflies
Hit by a car
When you're sleeping on the couch
But I need his heart
Walt Grace, desperately hating his old place
Fault lines in her words
Wind heavy on the ground
Yes, I'm on my way back home
Come on, come up, while we're still young
Nothing could be better
That's what you get
It's never easy to cross any borders
It plays a trick on me and it seems to fool us all
Of running around
They traipsed mud all over the house
She thought that she could buy happiness by, by the bottle
The walls were gone but the doors and windows remained
Please don't believe her, she says that for anyone
It just reveals the perfect nothing
In love
That runs from the map off your body
Remember the time when friends were around,
Cause every moment, every second
I suspect a thing, I wish I didn't do
And you clearing my eyes
Shake the floor, move the room with the bass line
The shadow proves the sunshine
There are reasons, there are reasons, you can find out
Stars that shine
I've held a hand
Behind the smile I fade away
Oh revelation, comes in whatever form to save me
You give them what they need
That would be the way theyd remember me
Make the whole scene gather round come see it my way
We'll plot out a plan to take down the man
Every little day
A memory tells us that we're blessed
You get your grip and peer down over the edge
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
In my eyes
Something you don't wanna see ever grow up
While her children fears
And find what you are here for
To see your true colors, and that's why I love you
Couldn't afford that lifestyle, Tokyo's too fast and steep
But I will not allow anyone to succeed
Time is driftin', this rock has got to roll
Here he comes as you're dreaming
That you get when your circumstance is moviesize 
Sweeter than the honey
First to slowly fade away
L'étonner, changer de refrain
Somehow our whole world has gone spinning in reverse
That you're drowned in despair
Remember where we started out 
You and I, where it started, how we lived, together always
With your little head down in your hand
Oh, and the ones who taught you how to live
There are so many things to show to you
Into your eyes
Bret, did any of this actually happen
I left him outside in the snow
To the summers I never see
Säg var det för det Fredrik Åkare sa
So just cry your fears, yeah, I need you everyday
I wanted my life's work
You want my love
Went from seein' how many bitches I could fit in the truck
As you stand
I can�t feel all the things you've ever felt before
But water moves beneath us 
Chandler and Van Nuys
Ain't nothin' that stays the same
I see all the faces
All through life
Do you see that lil' grin when I talk, huh, yo
That was there in the beginning when your daughter wasn't with it, oh yeah
The one you won't regret
Something's coming this way 
I life and death my way through the sun
Some roads are straight and narrow
Puedo ver que en amor el inicio tiene tanto placer
Oohoh summer wine
The sunbeams climb up on the wall
You know how I get
We say no, oh no
Come fly with me, let's fly, let, s fly
Howling in remembrance, an animal has died
Do you want me to stay and say I still want you
When you fall asleep
Shock an awful thing to make somebody think
Come as you please, do as you may
Whenever I get dreary
If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
If it's a broken heart then face it
die liegen jetzt in meinem Bauch
With choices to be made
Or run away
This cities just cementaries enhaced
From time to time
Let you slip away
Oh yeah I saw it in her eyes
Yo, funny how things change color
Go roll down the window 
I disappoint you, I can see through your perfect smile
You keep looking down the track
Especially those that are out at the zoo
We sleep in the mornings
Do you feel what I feel
It's time to wake up
The thing that I've been searching,
With the kiss of lovers lips
I almost missed my death it's so good
Find a love a just because I need you, so much
You came, you saw, you sawed her brain
Why do the birds go on singing
These are the tears of a rapper now
Slide your hand
Before our bones become
Hoist a new flag
But we must back our things first
You take my hand and I will mellow
It only gets to me, in times like these
That all that we did, you undo
I think that I have finally come home
But there's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
I gotta find a volunteer
To set light to me some surprising day
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
Of loving someone so much that you need
I'm lost, always 
Every song, every song
Hung your head in a forgotten stare
We won't even know 'cause we'll just smile and let it go
Clouding the truth, both of us knew
Reaching into the night
The stone's poem is mine
I curse at the windstorms that October brings
Back then, she was like the star in the movie
'Cause I can feel your pain, in my bones, in my bones
The imitation of good faith
But I never changed my mind
Burned nicely
For another twelve lines on this sheet
Can't stop a river when it's burst it's banks
Please read them by the light of the moon
Oh, I know it's hard but you stay with me, oh, oh
She lays like a monkey unclothed in the snow
Longing, things I long for,
But the only one I ever think about is you
Falling from the sun
I just want to be living as I'm dying
Caught in the headlights of a very mixed up world
She rubs against the weatherbeaten frame and asks the angel for his name
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
And yeah my type, I like 'em brown, just like my drink, the fuck you think
You can be anything that you wanna be
Nothing more to say, what's done is done
And helpless in your bed of thorns 
It's as close as I get to love
I've lost my fire overtime
The long straight highways from dirt road to tar
I'm light as a feather
If I know you'll never stay
Who'll change their minds
In a different place
Do you think that you could see your way
My work's won kiddie competitions
For our lives to end quite yet
It takes a hen to make an egg
But have you seen my country skies
Just promise me faithly
What have we done to each other and tell me, dear
Did I say too much
I let it slip my mind 
And you find your dreaming wasn't true
About to come into the light
To let them go silent into the ground
But I did not hear her mumbling
I could stand out in the hall
Another lifeless testimony 
Sag deinem Vater,dass du ihn liebst
Down by the water and the tide is rising
And torn your heart
I can keep it together
We are in love
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
Lightness is forced when you cut out the lines in the paper
And sit back down where you were sitting
Falling in love with the taste of the ghost 
I know your fears and you know mine
So wind your watches down, please
We're leaving the shadows behind
On Bleecker Street
And you turn away
Now we will see a smile again
It's a silent murder
And that moon is absurd
Want to go to bed
The beat a hair behind
Is your mouth a little weak
When they made the new milk turn
Got you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
And they are not in decline
Let the big band play as you tap leather with your fingers
A song for a heart so big
And I thought hey
Through the hourglass
But this feeling's building up inside again
We'll face the winds,
There will be glad and a perfect bed
You're free to fly tonight
How we tried to make everything right
Depends on how far out you go
I wouldn't care at all
He took a plane across the sea 
A kind of weight you couldn't lift
They both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
I hear the sound of whispering
Won't dance, not without you
And we fell in love
And let me see those eyes
A house upon a hill with no windows
I will always be waiting
 Unkind
Anyone can learn the words
They say everything is gonna be alright
And there's no place like home for a little doll from China
Looks a lot, doesn't need it
Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
Take my heart with a grain of salt 
Just this one last sunrise
Burns like you, my damaged one
She sleeps like a girl
I've tried to care
I swear this time I mean it
Virá com ela que entrega
Faces look ugly
And don't say you've never been told
Swirling in and out of view
Know your mind don't go running around like this
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
Every day, every day
Too bright for me, darkness descends
Put all the linen in it
We want you to know we feel better, we won't have to worry anymore
Take their passage into night
Life will carry
Ever since "Summertime" they ain't liked none of mine
So breathe while you're alive
We raise our heads and look
Our love sometime will start and end,
Who are trying to knock it down
It's neither heaven nor space, It's just high
You may never be or have a husband
My only friend keep on
Now that's the sort of smack that leaves a bruise
They love a man in uniform 
I hope she doesn't like me
You are a beast and I am serving up your supper Ohohohohohoh
I'll hold my hand over their head
It's a long road to Caanan
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
And I'm not sure that I'll get over you
When they cut the clothesline loose
I'll drink my rivers, drag my feet, and drown in my dreams
Before a while it all made sense
My brother wander in the tall grass
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down
She gave you the phone, said it was for you
If they call don't very soul, and the land on the moon
It takes those tears to make it rust
Wait a minute baby, listen up now
What I saw when I looked in the distance
If I could only stop my mind
You come to realize
In my life 
Yeah something's got to
The world can be quiet when you're up too late
bin ganz benommen, von dem was ich mir nahm
To try to throw some light upon the gloom around our bed 
Please let me make amends
The wind in my heart
When the sun's too bright
Just once, I'm gonna go and get drunk
This house is full of secrets that i
Your face is inerasable
Till my name escapes and I'm set free
Oh why does hate bring forth more hate
Fall in love is an idea for sure
I wait on clipclops, deer might fly
And they get silly
Your comfortable caress
You search for someone like her 
You never mean what you say
'Click,' call it quits  bring all them walls
I've torn everyone who reached out for me
It's what the broken hearteddo
To strangest hand
Bombs outside, such a small forest laughing at me
Better call the undertaker
To the one I love
Coming home
Gaze up at the moon hanging low in the sky as we slip away into the darkness
Just won't let you put the days to bed
I'll know the way back, if you know the way
My barren heart and I
Falling softly to the ground
For the faces
Why it is you still care
So make a conscious try
Shh, now hush, as you're dreaming
Well, it's your misfortune and none of my own,
And realised the process, the ships and the people within them never differed
Die Antwort liegt in dir,
To sit around and search for something I ain't never gonna find
And you are not alone
I see the pain in those 
Like I miss the ocean when I go to sleep, 
Blue light is flickering
las piedras, los pájaros son
Cover it with semen
Passing night and day
Voices
Sit watching the sky
Is still the same
If you get lost
And I can't say and I don't know
That you've done  times before
Everyone, when she was young, 
In the way those eyes I've always loved illuminate this place
And I can't taste anything less
Find your heart now
Grip the heater twice as hard  it's this reality I battle nightly
It was just before the moon hung
Sing a song, get you through the night
Laisse le vent prendre soin de nous
Somewhere all the minutes stay around
Forget the story you heard,
Peace in your heart
I feel it I feel it
In a sleeping bag fajita
On the back of envelopes
To my people in the Twin Tower
A lone pair of watchful eyes
Take a look in the mirror
As he hit the Earth, I left this place,
As they say it is
So please remember me, finally
I started searching for a better way
How you get your adrenaline flowing now
Now it's you and me who walk away
How bad I need you need you
And I never asked to feel this way, or put you off
Just another red light 
Laying everybody low, with a love song that he made
I've been in the world
I wish I Knew
Ooh, it's a blue sky
Long before us crazy soldiers
Your pain's gigantic but it's not as big as your ego
And now you're gazing at the moon
The winter though it darkens me
And I heard of that Japanese girl
So can I come to see you sometime
One of these days you'll be
My dress is torn, you have a black eye
All we are
Through the fallen memories when that angel baby signs
I saw a shadow touch a shadow's hand
The tongue on the side of his face meant
While I struggle to breathe Is this all the
I don't know whether to drink or stay at home alone
For the touch of your hand in the June night
But the seasons, they were sleeping
At first I thought you might break this jinx for me
We are in bed at night
And bear all my shame
Moody It's got me Mooday It's got me
Now only ghosts
The sweet flower that they both seemed to hunger sweet flower
Anonymity sha la la la
I've driven
No one even mentions my casserole
Ooh, we cut up our old jeans and go outside
We all want, we all yearn
Hitching your wheels to truck, bus or car
And finding something else to learn,
You don't care you never did
With Daddy and Mammy standing by
So much time on the other side,
I mean after all the things that we've been through
The plants have died,
We all go through changes, run to different places,
No more pain
Nobody knows who I am
I see the seasons change
We are a part of
'Cause I was too wrapped up in the dream I was dreaming
The shadow I cast only grows, largest just right before
As long as I've got arms that cling at all
As if you had the right
Now sleep
My horse was fastest but yours di okay
She thought too late and spoke too soon
I wanna be your alarm when you sleep in
Laid on petrified trees
Cause you don't want to feel you are alone
 O'Clock you're still sleeping
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again
You'll always be my silent valentine
We just feel like we don't have the means
I feel you cry, but I can't speak my mind
I will lie awake
If you feel you've paid the price
Breaking down the surface in the night
All the things that I couldn't say 
I wonder what we could have been
Cause life is a war fought with tears
It's a long way to haul
Softly he glides along the streets and alleys
Though you are far away, I know you'll always be near to me
A place some say I should go more
Crawlin' towards the door, just the same
Mumbling to the girl in blue
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
When we're far away, so far
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant 
And those dreams that I hold
To get closer to the sign 
It's not me you're looking for
Up and away he gone away
All the things I should have said to you
To get by without the help of alcohol
After they are finished, I wonder where you'll be
Used to spend my summer having parties on the drive
Everyone knew that he was really a pornographer
Well I try to carry the load 
So take me under the schoolyard, there are kids there who got lost
Den som lever flott och gott han lämnar inga spår
Then there's a Reba designs
I believe
Making phones that hard to hold
Let's just make this part go faster
Refrain
Everything is done
The purest light
You know she won't make it with just any guy
And I will never forget how you touched my life
Looks like light and love
I gamble it all away, tumble into fall abased and ablaze
Boys I'm going home
Baby, can I hold you You'll be mine
Somewhere downtown
In the night
The city you've made on this ocean of sand
Of the dreams we dreamt together
When we reach that awkward moment
If the rain has to separate from itself
Incisions in my head
But now I can't speak your name
Moves with a dead stare
Until the magic morning hour
Picking the straw from our clothes
If I've been unkind
"You can't win me back, win me back
Warm days filled with sunshine
Until you're walking down the isle and she takes away your smile
Who walk like dreamers
Cross my fingers and dream on
So I wait to sieze the day
And she'll say "Wait there must be must some mistake
Who's gonna stop the word from turning
Or leave you alone
I couldn't hide it even if I tried girl
Not coming back,
A long life you'll lead and The Way you'll under
You never need to part
Both take you to the floor, to the floor, to the floor, to the floor
I never meant to turn away
I hear these voices in my head competing
I've been starting fights
But it says so much about us
Ooh and winter
You came down, hard that summer
Take his limousine, you gotta get back to me
As I fall
Had a tough time, got a rough start
When it came to chasin' rustlers we'd always win
A woman's day is filled with longing,
And touched you in a dream last night
Internation space station 
Way back home
Why I played myself this way
I'll see you every day
And everything was quiet
I no longer live like a man in the dark
I won't know when to stop
Now gasp for air
The world's weight is over limit
I thought it was for good
Waiting on a clear reason
To be gone EP
Between doors, walls and chords,
And the consequence was a negative
And everything has changed
O love is handsomeand love is fine
Questions I have answered, you are still asking yourself again
'Cause you'd be living in a world of your own design, undermined
Everything would be alright
And barely heard
The limbs of life left low
I wish I had knew a
And bleeds you of matter
And I remember when you started callin' me your Mrs
All of the lies she tells herself,
That night her mom said that the two of them, and the now dead guy
Bin ich doch zu etwas gut
The hurt across your face
And now all we've got is lunchhour light
To open my door
The river is deep and the ocean wide
New slang when you notice the stripes
By the bed yes, I told you it was silly
Clareira azul no céu
An evil wind is blowing through the land
You might speak, would it be words and what would you say
Saw it around you taking you on a tour
One day that wall is gonna fall
Don't make, don't make, don't make a joke of my art
Is from her heart within
hopelandic
Were stars
There was a good boy inside me
The righteous 
I'll make you mine
This wind is blowing colder and too soon I feel its pull
Everybody's got a hungry heart
And love, it isn't love until it's past
Baby, you look so confused, cause it feels like, there was no way we could lose no way, no way
Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Tubehole wind in my face, thunder in gentle distance
We don't need to escalate
Burned out flames should never reignite
And it's not getting me any closer
From London Town I wave goodbye
My words are frozen
Olen väsynyt moniin sanoihin
And I did not hear her stumbling
And what you least wanted, holds you down like a stone
I couldn't spend
No one understands me quite like you do
Because I can't give you what you need
Let her get on with life
Watch me waiting, take my hand
You can only tell if remorse has done you well
I was thinking possibly or maybe
I see your lonely shadow running out of time
Her warm kiss is felicity
Just wanna feel your kiss
Who've left their pride on the other side of
I'm always running, chasing flames on a dare
I hope you look at me through patient eyes
I've gone to find my ain true love
Tryna sit in the back of his whip
Nothing clear, nothing bright, nothing I'll feel tonight
In the arms of the world on the doorstep of heaven shining down
There is no end to what I'm saying
Là, sur ton orifice ami
And I'm the wave that crashes
But what happened next damn near stole my tears
Amidst my foolish pride
Your sister and me have a set of keys
'Cause I know it's hard sometimes, baby just give it some time
Take my tears, they say a lot, since you're the one who put them there
A satellite inside me
Yeah but I've already gotten over you
I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this
And all along baby it was understood
She's out on the street again there she goes
I will say goodnight
Take the past and cut it out
The sun that's going down the bed that breaks the fall
I wasn't scared
Putting the needs of others ahead of yours
It takes some good to make it hurt
Touching the very part of me
The night you showed me I could see,
I'm the night now but I will shelter you
You spent the night with me
And times like these are getting to me
Like I'm always missing you
I stroll around the passages
When it's deepest in the ground
Eine Woche später, eine Nacht, die ich nie vergesse
If you love her let her go
But it doesn't change who I am in my heart if I look like a dime
Even though the scene was never golden
Depending on where I am with you
To be alone for now
It's not warm when she's away
My heart's against your chest
As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear
I watched you grow up from babies on the floor
You think I'm living it, living it, living it, living it up
Lightning comes astarin' in again
Lord a fresh young breeze 
In my head and in my thoughts
Till slut kom dom fram till Cecilias grind
If God had a face, what would it look like
Don't want to be alone
You caused me to moan
And the cattle that you laid down drip on the pavement,
Since you've been around
'Cause there's a light in me 
There's always something in the way
To come out from under the covers
That ravenhaired beauty of another time
I'mma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
Now the daylight's returning
Oh shit, I can't let them see me like this
You know we don't really love one another
You're not seeing it in one area, 
You and me always standing at the threshold
So bring the discrepancies, I'll pour the drinks
I've only got rejection letters and a sense of impending doom
And I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be
She bought a country dream
Every year for a thousand years
I touched his hand
Don't just let life pass you by
Skin and bones and telephones and file cabinets
No one sees me
The distance and a dream
And long gone fevers reappear
In the broad light of day
You'd think that we could learn to do it right 
Awaiting redemption for a lifetime
I miss the love only 'cause they starve'
A sword someone would keep at their side
While your reaction is nothing new
I'm not scared of dying
Rendesvouz where to my place, say  & we can do anything you wanna do
Feels the way I do about you now
My mind's distracted and diffused
I wrote another song for you
Death's angel looming in
I'm wandering
So I go by myself, I go into town
You couldn't hear the ocean, you couldn't hear the waves
A good friend, unique, wellread, goodlooking or smart
Let it breathe, I control, California living till I am old
You're the only good thing
And if we find gold
One not subtle, one not on the list
And my beating heart
Break it, simply took a leap of faith and virtue
And the fields they're under lock and key
Come to the water, play in the water
Beautiful things
This is not four years ago
Where can you run 
Lying on the bright blue jumping mat
In a clear night under the stars
Till my eyes have left your face
Do you feel afraid
While the cold winter waitin'
Wove with regrets Upon a golden string 
Wearing that smile
Some people live their lives with a violence that's pure and clean
Oh, you, you, it's always you
Bleib bei mir, bis der Morgen graut
Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight
It can be scary but kinda funny too
Yo, It's a black thing
The air is running out we're sinking much too low
Your skin protected me from sunbeams
You go north, walk the good red road
Down the streets on prospect
I think my time is running out
You know you make me so lonely
Don't hold your head so low
Where there's no one else around to hear
Now to know it in my memory
Had an element of danger
But still you want it, oh
All the barbershops and funeral homes were open, oh
He stands with his head in his hands
Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
Simple is something of a mystery
Neon signs in the night
Tonight
Why did he offer
As I suspend my breath
But maybe it's time to go
Until the day he'd see them
Written in your hand
I'd chase him round and build like that
Don't you walk away from me
But then you told me a good woman
You know this could be something
I should take the time to just explain
Angels falling through my hair
She can even move to Kansas City
Swept away
It is so wonderful
If your lungs are aching
wie dann die Worte verstummen
You keep me up at night when I'm worried sick about you,
And love'll make you give, give, give
Just one little lie
We do the best we can in a small town;
Strange days, she said to me
There's no way out
Like a flame in the dark
The two of us used to hang every single day
Long way down if you fall
I hope they won't make you blue
I wanna make it right
Like a pony cart and an old bird bath
From a bus you saw an old man
I wouldn't mind pretending,
It's a oneroom city here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've watched the end of the thing that had no end
There was an earthquake
When the winter was over
Notes that roll on winds with swirling wings
I'll breathe you out
For the very last ride of the day
She was caught on fire
Of feet, of feet
Like when you want it easy and you've got an uphill climb
So you thought that getting sober
And the jacket too, I always knew you
Sleeping on a bed
Too many times I've felt
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
I'm home
Ooh, man ooh, hey get over you, hey get over you
When he kissed me I gladly gave in
If the world ends, I hope you're here with me
Aside the lions and the ladies
All of me back
Spins like a winding wheel
Maite genuela elkar eta
And with these hands, I'll provide for you,
Hanayo lives in Berlin 'cause she says the rent is cheap
und sgleich z'ir beider herzen în 
I won't forget all that I've done
We hold our horns like credit cards
I will carry you home
Some words sung are as solemn as true
It feels like feathery dust everywhere
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I don't front nothing
'Cause you didn't
It's making my soul sing
And thought you were beautiful
I beat them at their own dirty game
Feels like, fire's almost out
Du hast hart trainiert und viel riskiert für Dich
Om vajrasattva samaya
Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow, this time
Singing save our simian souls
As cool as a sigh, as volatile as something you say
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me pressing
Under deep
You've been dead a long time but you refuse to accept that shit
And I believe we will be again
I'm going to take these broken wings
This feels like I've fallen in love
I have gone to the moon
Send my jam down the radio
Light from above the mountain
She's yours anyway
What are you doing hanging out with me
She's only one breath away
The next time I come by
I've got your voice on tape
Still missing you
Gonna keep on moving on up, oh gonna stand my ground
Or are you just letting it vanquish
I can fell my eyes fillin', the Lord is my witness
Up the ghosts of Saturday night
And the lava and the gas that we are,
You was the ChiTown version of Baby
I feel
Won't get to me
And I can't expect that kind of love from you
nouse ylös, liiku sun jaloillas
Mind the wind, my love
And feeling a little,
The darkness that has been
'Cause all I need is you, my Valentine
And disdain the winter showers
Let's not be sore, that's not right that is where you'll find me
You'll come around to see the other side of things
We're born into this world Never never know the reason why
I took the picture
I got my swagga back
And the sound I hold so dear
But now I can't afford to listen to a word they say
I'm downhill standing still at the bottom of Roy
The time has come
Where you are to go
Here in the dark I made for you
"Wait Don't let your dream just walk away"
Oh I could not keep a straight face
Oh Mary of silence
China town
Last night poor Dan had a nightmare it seems
That tastes and sparkles like wine
But every suit I tried is too big around the thighs,
And the old trunk was just illusion
Waiting around about to crack
I've never been one to hang my heart on a thread
And fly to a faraway land
Hot summer nights, midJuly
But you been hanging 'round
If you know my destination please,
The rivers from your eyes
They interview the people who are authorities
istun tässä jo monta tuntia jalat puutuu, jalat puutuu
But then she tried to kiss me
De ces amants là
As we gazed at the wall
In water's full of grace, 'cause only time will tell,
I'm feeling dizzy
Why don't I love you like I used to do
So strap on tight take this ride Ha
Open up your mind and it will sing to you
Your face is full and paved with lines
You don't have to cry yourself to sleep at night with wet pillows
Closer than anyone
When you're not around
They fade away and now you're here
We'll find some way
The truth is, we say not as we do
Where has my ambition gone
Watchin swinging bang and she bend another corner
The nightbirds start to sing their favorite song 
Still everybody gotta build for that, me I make mills off that
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
I don't think with you here it will be too much pain
And talk about nothing in particular
Well the songs you sung spiraled
But the flickering pages that trouble my sight
Tired of fake diamonds, fake silver, fake gold
Now all I think about is floating away
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
And go high like the mountain tops
Which not right actions can withstand x
The broken car parts in enemy desires
Someone will call, something will fall
So I've changed my plea to guilty
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death x
With no time to think
If this world makes you crazy
I could talk this over
Just a boy passing twenty
The river will keep this friend
I'm out on a beach, eating my heart
The lights on the road, are strange and unreal
Home home 
When her wings spread she heard their song
I think you rewrote my love song
And we try and we fall
It's hard to beat the system
I'll look at The Sun, and I'll look in The Mirror
And I spill beer in the grass
And grow a garden out of those
'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me
I won't give you up love, so fate can have its way
So many waves in the wind, I hope you find what you're looking for,
Quem sabe com ela eu teria achado
Someday, I'm sure I'll get the picture, stop waiting up
And call me baby, baby all the time
There are tales of good fortune that couldn't be planned
It's like a speeding train is coming,
Muddy river, high, eyelevel
So just focus on the light
Of that cigarette would it be so bad
Beneath the waves of trembling stars
I want the world to know
So I slowly slipped away
Say you'll come and set me free
What do you do when your career is buried
That look in your eyes the brush of your cheek
In the moonlight we both still like
I'm starting to realise
nur unser klangheimliches Elend
If we got it wrong it's cause the days have no numbers
You say, take your axe and fashion me a kind of swing
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
What I need is for you to follow my lead
And all it really needed was the proper point of view
Now I try not to tell lies
Seem to say we're the same
They come back like they're an option
In a world of love
nuottiavain sun korvas on lukossa
Should've thought of that one first
In the darkness I will meet my creators
It doesn't matter anymore
With a dayful of promises dead on her lips
Fortune presents gifts
'Cause everything you do and words you say
Well summerbreeze is blowin' through your window
Don't write my name on a stone
Or you'll never unwind
Was it me, yeah yeah
Most are shocked, some don't care
Dissolving falling down
But the sheep seem to shower off this office tower
On our way we will have hope
When I'm swimming in your ocean
Os deuses vendem quando dão
Yellow girls are running backwards
I thought we had a moment
The concrete broke your fall
Eu sempre quis fazer a minha parte
Gonna get on that airplane and wave bye bye bye bye bye bye
Found sorrow in my mind most times
"Black man ain't gonna run
I want to say I'm sorry for stuff I haven't done yet
How many songs will I try to write
Touching herself with me wide awake in the same room
Are you afraid, afraid of the truth
Please leave me your ghost
Children are unheld, I wish love was for sale
And I'm thinking what will then become of you, i
It's you and me now against this whole wide world
While the salt spray crusted on the window panes
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
The ocean makes my swelling heart feel small
bei diesem Seiltanz am Boden
Passerà questa pioggia sottile come passa il dolore
You long to see someday
And I've been living underground,
Não me deixe ficar triste
Or how the ghost of you clings 
Everyone I do right does me wrong
What a wonderful world that this angle can see
Remember this time, this room
They only tell you not to lie
I thought it would be nice just to visit my grave
But will all their peace accords
Though sweet as wine, as thick as blood
I'm not ready for you now, please don't hate me
For things I cannot control
I wanna be, I gotta be ,
Let your hard luck end and make it new
My head runs off,
Stands in the shade of despair
It's not that we're bad together
And let's leave this earth
Feel like my love life is finished
With eyes like Abe Lincoln
There is no middle ground
Be patient like a rainbow
J'ai été jusqu'à faire l'aumône
At every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
Throwin' up player wave to my partners on the block
And I knew
Tiny tiny vices
But I won't fade away
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
A million lines tried to reach me;
Catering to your disasters every need
Ich bin das Eigentum von meinem Eigentum
You make it hard for breathing
Rubs the back of his neck, the stress takes effect
Long as we can all stay together
Libérez les sons de ma voix
Candy says I'd like it where she is
was ouch der vverlde unmuoze dâ, 
There are wars to win for now leftover sinful days
Just let it be, if you wanna grow it all must die
My gal's got a headhache, her ankle is hurting too
When you did that to me, I knew somehow this had to be 
To be loved
Torched by the burning sand
And I just can't stop, cause
It was right on time, he was just an old friend
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
If I can help you, please, you've got to tell me how
The kind of love you know that I can
A kind of power, it can�t be reined in
It looks okay, yeah, but I've got my suspicions,
Got a mouth full of opinions and most are wrong
All feeding on the dream we made
And find the words we'll sing in time
My thoughts running over
It's sweet and it's free 
You come to me at midnight and say, 'It's dark in here' 
The only truth I know is you
Interesting just slightly
Life's ups and downs, they come and go
When TV says the world is crushing down around us
Despising the grin on the face of the boy
Rest your head
Där dansar Fredrik Åkare kind emot kind
Sunshine, come and help me sing
The floor is blacker than the sea
Next to walls that jut from the earth
Feels like, the time to start
I can't believe, how pathetic we can be
I'm just trying to make you see that
Just a taste for the truth
I cry everyday and so till time does heal every scar
It doesn't much matter why
Always looking for attention
Black Talons start flyin, when a nigga flip
Och Anders är alltid glad, alltid glad
All you gotta do is close your eyes and  and visualize
I ought to be on my way
Of rain that can change bows into arrows
Flock's chasing to find me alone
To feed your garden
So thank you, my brother,
So long have been sleeping violently
All alone I watch you watch her
And I woke up when I saw the sun
To me tonight
Du doftar så gott och du dansar så bra
It's not alright, no 
I need to hear You in the silence now
'Cause the nightmare is over
I'm going to get my baby,
Without love
All of a sudden, no time for waiting
Oh God, please make this last
From a sea of discontent
Now you know me, for your eyes only
It's way too late to think of
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one now
And may you need never to banish misfortune
If it's a thrill you're looking for
My home, my friends and you
From up in the sky I can't see your lies
I stood once where Hitler's feet had stood
Across the wards as we both dissolve
All you need is to look into my eyes
Still I keep in mind that snow is safe
It's the best thing that you ever had
And find something to love
Speeds across the sea 
And you could take a real bite
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
I see your eyes
This is my song to bring you back again
The lost cause kids are okay
That you let me see the world
Nur bis hier in geht der Weg,
Of the night
And the rugged wheel is turning another round
The last thought that you think today
Live together, live together
When I see you alone
Oh, love is so good
His bones are broken
I love you anyway 
I guess it's bittersweet poetry
Look what it's done so far
Music, the bass boomin' from the car parked in the street
Staring at an endless sky
And man, did I lose you
Burnt by the steam from a better life
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
Crippled in your arms
Fever I know in god I shouldn't trust
So I've come to decide that fate is telling me you will not go
And the song that I sing is of moonlight
This whole town is haunted
You've had a hard day
Perdido no tempo ou no espaço
Naked by the light
And afloat I'll stay
Just look into my eyes, they'll never lie to you
That you've got to sort through
I thought I'd never see
Slumber, not in my lifetime
And even if I was wrong, I know I don't deserve this
We never thought to keep it shaded
And I bet you're sweet and hard to get over
Hatte Stress ohne Ende, meine Frau die war schwanger
Let your mother's bible burn
Sugar, always
No longer easy on the eyes
My premonition hits hard as our start is apart
Love is peace when peace is fragile
I wouldn't change a single thing
You can have my heart
What time
No more crying, ooh ooh
And me, yeah, where the sky is so blue
I look in
Two palms, no sound 
So when I was out in the desert
The love that you have is still holding my soul
And there's no way we ever could
The streets are cruel, he tries to act cool, he goes to work with only his one tool
Everybody's on the same page
Wie du swingst und dich noch mal locker umdrehst
In paper chains and stars
The bohemians of Soho did pirouettes
Got a tattoo that said, 'together through life'
It's in the middle of England, right into your face
One mass is warm, while the other is cold
I love you love you first thing in the morning
And our hearts were singin'
Dass du mich liebst, weiß er nicht
No one listens when you want to be heard 
It's just a town like any other town
And I'm walkin' home with you
I don't know if I should drink or stay at home alone
I can live with all your downsides
A demanding physical need
I held your hand
Now it's such a long way home
My cylinder quiet, like tiptoes
High above the highway aisle
Their favorite time of the year
I said that's what you're asking, but you're gonna get more than you bargained for
I left him outside in the cold
The end of my affair with the west coast
In things like Heaven and in Jesus and the saints
To say any way but lightly
And things that matter too much
They come for women, weed and weather
Intend to live
But with you there at my side
I turn to you and say  awake is the new sleep, awake is the new sleep
And as you turn away, I'm lost, I mess up, as forced
And would you call it to his face
I want to make much of Your cross
You know you'll get yours yet
For a better life
It takes an egg to make a hen
I give thanks 'cause I've been blessed and I ain't one of them niggaz
Everything you've learned from us I learned
Prestame tu piel
Got that women, weed and weather
On your heart
And the rain on her back that continued to fall
And I scream at the fools
You got on the stars
Never let them tell you you can't go your way
"Donate now to my rightful cause"
Have to come out soon
But I saw the way he looked at you
But can your smile save our love
Ttrue words I said to myself
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
Wave goodbye I know that I'll believe if you spell it out for me
Sometimes ignorance
I love you more than I did when you were mine
And I claim I'm not excited with my life anymore
Rest your eyes
Wanna keep on moving on up and I'll stick around
These foolish things remind me of you
It's true I saw her today
Correndo atrás dos sonhos
If nothing's so different
In peking there is someone who
I miss you, think of you everyday
Regardless of time or weather
Oh tonight I will retire
For someone
I'd give myself to please you
Just how you make me feel
I look like a painter, behind all the grease
When there's nothing I have ever seen
A light heart
Hung on a firework
Let's see who gets down
And I will surely be alright
Gon' build that wall until it's done
Little by little you touch my heart, where they had touched it too
Don't turn her away,
Ooh ah You make it eaiser to be ooh ah
This is the last time
I know you're looking forward to them
And the distance between their years
In the privacy of our love
Haul away for home
When I slam doors 'cause I'm pissed at you
Soon they'll dismantle them 
And Harlem River swallow me
And then only fireworks will light the sky at night
Pass still
Back through time, I know
No voy a endurecer
All I need is what you give
One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
I wish I could stand up and turn around
The things that you will not
Within my eyes
And right now
I forget the lies
Don't have enough for the ride
And these days mercy cuts so deep
I could fly them through your veins
I sit alone contemplating
What it do I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
Watch the flames climb high into the night
I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock
And death by greed
But you can't help how bloodlines slip
Every night for a thousand more
And it looks like the end
I saved you hours of therapy
Your reflex gets in the way
He floats the cargo down the coast
Listening to the shore
Caught before they fall through drains
It will be forever
Could be the beginning of love
Sweet dogs, sweet rain, never come  I go
For the longest while
Is the metal in my head when I walk
Talking to a friend yesterday
Guess so, it's starting to, who knows
I know if I stay here in this night,
All fools say, "Oh my God"
And the banching stream runs still
Doch nur Schweigen in der Ferne
We'll go where it's always spring
When you look around I couldn't be found
Hurry back reember last time
die Spur hinter uns hält uns zusammen
I got to handshake
We scratched and hurt each OTHER'S growing pains
I didn't know it would be the last time
You know we'll be getting some getting jiggy just for fun
And her time was to come Called to her son 
Leave the world alone and later
I failed so many times
Sure that star can twinkle
So I started to get cold
But I couldn't do another year
Caught a bird and in a trap, had a lot to give back
You plucked out my eyes
The night seems the same
Nahnahnahnahnahnah I hope I see you on the other side
If your lover ever leaves you
If you notice that I'm falling behind
I've got no one to hold me, I've got no one to carry
Go now on your high feet
I spent so much time dreaming about Eleanor Bron
This world is turning too fast
Live fast and die young
Hey baby baby, hey baby baby baby 
Loneliness confounds
Does it matter much anyway
Oh would care would wait and live again
Armaggedon is flooding through the living room and
And some are reaching for reason to hate you
And people who talk too much
Of this new emotion
Is coming in and it's damp out and she's having cramps and she's so mad at me 'cause I didn't shave
Without a care, a care in the world
You rise and rise to the sun
There is a tree as old as me
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear
And she became the girl from yesterday 
If you can't sleep, I'll be there in your dreams
We were walking down the block when we thought the bomb went off
We gonna listen to some Teddy Pendergrass Pendergrass
That she passes by the price trying not to steal life
No pull, no gravity on the ground
About a girl and a boy
'Cause they made you from the light
Flieg jetzt los, immer weiter
Of the living people living their lives away
Among the trees, I pass the hours and fantasize
And you fools in the back with your heads in your hat, what when all your fields are rotten, your waves of grain, amber waves of grain
Didn't know you got yourself a new friend
And it takes a day to make you yawn, brother
We ended up nowhere
How wrong could anyone be
Och jag kan ångra det lilla jag säger
We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds
This is my home
Wait remind my life is mine so many travelers
Are fading to the distance
I once was sleeping
Do me a favor and don't bitch in your sleep
Is fakin' every deal that it makes
But we're all just part of some giant grand machine 
Your body may be gone, I'm gonna carry you in
For all the hurt that you feel,
I was falsely accused
And we'll say "Let's never leave"
I used to be afraid that I wouldn't find my love
I'd rather bleed from cuts of love
Here's my word, take my hand
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
We'll always be up late
It never did a thing for me
How my love it spins me 'round
sólo son sin albedrío
If I lose everything that I possess
This isn't righteous, it's a midlife crisis
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Shadows dream of light, let's slip on outside
I was workin' hard, but hardly workin'
Give me back my sadness
This is how we walk on the moon
Of memory
And when do you think it will all become clear
I don't know why, I was just looking for the sea
'Cause there are quiet truths in pain
To shine a light on your life
Nothing great, nothing good, nothing is as it should
Under the waves, falling away
Won't you come here and stay with me
'Cause I'm a reasonable guy,
Bad memories
My life, I'm sure of no one
Oh, grieving sky
Ten years, pecking at a seed
But it ain't that truth we chase
And death by boredom
You left some words saying now it would be good
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
Here I am, I'm stealin' you away from him
End the quest you're beyond compare
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
When those sad eyes start to close 
And not to say a thing tonight
You laugh and listen to my mind
Now that I can share it with someone
Spatial movements are butterflies
Meet me in the white light
Face in every cloud, makes me laugh out loud 
My hands 'round your throat 
Things move rapidly
That I clutched you in my arms
Of the love we vowed would never
In my lap, honey
I love you
'Cause I feel you, oh, I feel you near me
On the news at night, they talk about the abnormalities
Built upon the hate in man
Let's take a drive through the old town
It may feel so real inside
Feels like a strong bond, I know you feel it, too
I know I never noticed then
Flowers jake the sun afraid I'm blinkin' softly
The lonely man cries
Are living on a little rock with no place to go
Let the water creep over your face, I'll send it in waves
That I'd seen you walk away 
I feel like I'm losing my mind with no concept of time,
Look what I've become
But maybe the question mark helps
I get so shaky
Like the wave was the only love it ever saw
But if you're alone then, say my name, say my name
Take off those silver spurs and help me pass the time
Was playin' on the radio
This ship will still sail on
Been a million to one 
They wanted me here just to show you my face
She will be true, to the one in her life,
After that day
Proceeded to arrange your soul while I prayed on my knees
And empty out my heart
But there is none
The time has come to say goodnight
So try to leave somebody
Changed all the things that have made me 
In the arms of cobwebs
Lookin' back at the crash site
You won't matter anymore
I awoke from a total sleep
Vanity, dull roar die down
On the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
It's come back to me
You hold the seven keys to my soul
Straight from your heart into their sight
Then if my heart should somehow stop
Is it all right if I go
I prayed for you that day
Knowing that this was forever
I could just die, I might just die
I might call and I might need some help
So please, try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
Choking in clean underwear
Another fool would dig the broken car out from the snow,
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one
Wanted in the first place
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
I'll make it all up to you someday
Nur wieder wie im Wahn ein Luftschloß aufgebaut
They won't see the fire you have lit inside of me
Too stressed to eat, too tired to sleep, alien to all you meet
We must always keep dreaming
You are self professed, you snake
And I'll write up a calendar for our countdown
Tapping doors, but irritate
Oh, the cold wet wind blew over the heather
And so I drive
Watch it turning round and round
For everything that makes you weak
To bring understanding here today
Yes they matter write her quite a few
Just for the last time 
And all I want is down at the shore,
I keep talkin' all these crazy clumsy words
A river winding blue among the dunes and a marble bed
Myrkytän omani
You were free when I was taken
We'll have a few too many
Felt just like an ordinary day Just around the corner such a surprise,
Kanye, it's, it's Foxx, man
The last time forever
I never needed you to be there everyday
Is it ok if I don't make it
The sombre way
I can't remember you, remember us or anything
den tranc getrunken beide, sâ 
mikä ikinä tuliskin nii
Scared my love, you'll go
And how the water can flow like it's streaming out of fountains
They could not make up for distance
And the hateful memories
Even though there's no way out, we'll find one
Turn left at Carmen's Avenue 
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out
Pakko mennä aina kauemmas kuin minne mä nään
You can fall in love with me
God knows we'll never see her face again
Might cost a little more than money
City bird, maybe these hands that feed you need you
But I feel that you're still near
Pockets start where I always reach
Her perfume was eau de toilette
Wait for the day you come home
Became a time he remembers
You'll be all right
My soul, my soul cries for them
But she wakes like a woman
If there's nothing outside, above
Lying on your bed with your shoes on
Which one is yours or mine
Drive your car until you see
Un mister love mélangé à Castor Troy
And these are just thoughts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
Here to stay
So I'm going Island hopping again
You come home straight and you come home curly
Still I know it's gonna happen someday
Words don't come easily
They knew you fought but they never thought you'd fall
Rivers that run anywhere
I was the best man in a size too small
I can't wait to be alone with you
And showed me why she never took some time with a man
And the truth is I'm not alone
Running around the circles in the night
You're too good looking and mistooken
Though the cloudy sky
So many things happen while walking
Didn't I warn you good
Just hours before me
Feature the murders of lonely women
I'm talking about the first lady
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
It's okay, to stay here forever
That your eyes are like stars brightly beaming
I will be your man
Lähellä maa mustuu
But you can say, baby
Hier war zuviel weiß,
I'm trolling food court for girls 
Cuide bem do seu amor 
And summerbreeze is blowin' through your hair
When I'm kneeling at your feet
Bitch I'm saucin', I do this often, don't do no talkin'
One second in your memory is a miracle of lies
To sleep in my room
The dreamer has woken
It's well known that the cross is only a burden with pains and trials
And the phone never rings
Angels cheer, 'cause we're together
Kanske något illegalt eller så är han väldigt social
It's my whole life in words
To make you feel loved
Pick up the phone line
Locked behind these wicked thoughts
Candy told me nothing really matters anymore
It'll take you all around
When your eyes fill up with brine
Felt a pull I pulled away
Let it float away to sea
I ain't afraid to die, I ain't afraid to die
I hope I see you on the other side
Sinnlos gehe ich zu Grund
"There was a boy
You killer of mine
Lighten up, you say lighten up
And capture the deepest thoughts
It's just another day
At Waterloo we went our separate ways
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
There's never been bad, there has always been truth,
And for this something that you find
Especially when I have to watch other people kissing
And I could try to make you mine
I never knew just what it was
Brother, you will always be
And in the sky a star alone
We talked till the owners swept outside the bakery door
With your talk of four leaf clovers
And every skyline,
Leaves you standing poring over moments in life
From the start you set upon
I've seen enough to want to try and change things
Walking back towards your house
I'm not breathing only air
So many days in the wind, you keep on running round,
Everybody hides some scar
And Harlem River give me wings
In those missing times
Cause you can go out and meet some girl you can't defeat
You can follow me around
I forget the mallets from the lessons that I went to
It's as pure as fire
Hair swept out into the water,
So there's the corner that I sat on
Ooh ah You make it easier to be ooh ah
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us
But you always know just what you want
You are mine
There are pages of conflicts that nobody won
Well, she's told, "Hold your buttons and look at the sky
When all is said and done
Sleight of hand
Everything will come in time
And turns their faces
He's always wanted to write, that's all he's wanted in life
Feel your mind and body
I've been thinking for a while
You know that it all takes my breath away
Lift my hand off your thigh and say darlin'
That defines the meaning of their lives
Somebody told me
Everything else slowly fades away
Two hundred thousand miles
In views of the city
I want to weave a musical spell
Pathogenic lovers in a basement cell
Mä oon istunut tässä jo monta tuntia
I've taken the air
If you have any doubts of what my love is about
Come on away from me is it done
All the rage of watching mothers
We are all plunging straight towards our own decline
Travel at the speed of light thinking the same thought at the same time
And how they catch our every tone
Of what I'm feeling
A living hell for me
And run away
I still owe you
Ladera Heights
No love in a drought
I hope you find it
So I'd always find my way back
As you lie beside me
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Till I start going numb thinking
So, I'm up for the little white lies
Cause the podium's as high as the gallows are low
This innocent child
Well what was he sneaking to you 
Strayed above the highway aisle
Oh, with no one to blame
When you come around, everything else disappears, my ears disappear
And if you lost everything
Everything is exactly right
This boy, breezes in from the South Wells This boy, sees his days in the Middle East This boy, eased his way up the silver turns, but what is that, when this boy, he needs love, he needs love
'Cause I'm ready for the fall
Everytime I wan't more
Some new place I said, not this place I've been
When the train was delayed
It's like the last days of Rome
She's all right when everyone is wrong
I need a new heart
Light sleeper
The feelings of rain down on the plains all dried and cracked
I don't do 'em, I just feel 'em,
Every earthly breath, a lifeless testimony
Are ships in the night
Without me by your side
Feel from my feet
My mother told me just before she died,
If you look behind you, I will be there
I feel every second is a life time long
Molotovs
He feels the presence of the wind beside around him
Can we settle down, please
Look at where we are
If it's what you need
Burning the trees
I got yours and I love you
I remove with incision
I'd be the king if I could say to you
Dog star taught a dance
Ten thousand waves in the eastern sea
And it feels like it's tearing me up
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
When I finally get it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan
Where people walk without touching the ground
Please keep her a part of my life
We leave with no regrets  we will never forget
You can make it last
When I look in the mirror, you're the only thing I see,
Do our ways converge
'Cause I don't understand you and why you're after me
Immer wieder geht ein Regen nieder
Don't lose faith
Dreaming while awake
Humming melancholic lines
In a work light
The size of men around your house
But if you are, I am quite alright hiding today
New eyes, so I can see
I'm still waiting for a chance
We sing as the sky collapses
That seem to fall every next moment
Your heart will take you there 
Played by the gate at the foot of the garden
Dogs are barking as the kingdom fell
You can fall in love with me
Violence or loving my way
You're the funny little frog in my throat
The problem was you didn't know when to bow out gracefully
Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me
What honest words she can't afford to say
The trains won't ride beside us 
All beginnings and endings, 
I'm dumb but now I wanna mouth off about it
We'll take man's dirty deeds
She said, "I love you" and it suddenly clicked
I met her in a Kingstown bar
Sleepin' peace when day's done, that's what I mean
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true
You know there's no greater love
I just about managed to forget you when you appear in a dream
Rakennan sun sydämeesi taloa mä rakastan sua
And I heard the third one say
If the life I live comes unhappy or sad
Everything else can wait for you
What are you want to do
You're broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to Jacob
I would have ended it by now
How we'd love to fall more often
My baby came riding to meet me one time
Hand in hand
It sleeps in the day
In der dunklen Ecke hast du alle verführt
When it gets dark at night
Always
You're looking through the eyes of a child
And they need every man
Everything clean and shiny
Then all of a sudden I'm fine and everything's all right
There is no way to be free
Last of the pictures, catfish done hunting
Happiness is such a fickle thing
And I won't even let you home
Ne me le demande guère J�essayerais de ne plus te voir
It's nothing at all
It's setting the stars all on fire
Why keep searching
It's  in the morning in the sodium sky
And how it takes all the night
Your house, your house, your house I will explore
Let's just say that she never found out
This is taking forever 
Since I've been asking for
I am so tired of everything
It's only animal to run along the rocks
Your heart is way beyond capture, flitting like a fly catcher
Of people who will stop
True colors, true colors
Tellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
I guess my art is just lame and it's strange but still somehow I'm
I went cold
Don't ask me now to wash away the grime;
Are beautiful, beautiful like a rainbow
I'm not gonna look at you anymore, the same way
For foreign films and modern plays
Like a song
Perfect taste choice and meaning
Over and over the need needs food will human weakness
cómo me hizo perder, la vergüenza, mis años
But please remember me fondly
And finding something else to say,
Our hero finds his inner peace
With the world strung like a rosary
We find ourselves in love again
And please don't fall in love with someone new
Oh it's always the same
Seem like all I got
I wonder if you feel the same way too
Ought to be on my way right now
It becomes you, in a strange kind of way
Puede secarse mi alma,
Por ahí parece haber asomando un cuerpo
I, triumphant, stand off dead and tense
It comes in a bottle
Floating hearts
I do believe it's true
I wish I could have seen their faces when they heard the news
I've been chasing your room
They're raising your body from the ground
The sun goes down as the city lights
If I was back in primary
But I was happy to explain
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Are you the one the one I've been dreaming of
It's as it's always been
Fly to the side
Maybe it's time we went
I'll always be here for you
'Cause I hated when you walk outside that door
Is a full moon that's glowing
But now I fight the angels for her halo
Only the fishing part of fishing
I wanna be like everybody else
Since someone looked at me that way
Was here from the start
It's the one that makes you strong
Can I say that to you
Mrs Johnson never taught me those verbs 
To try to maake it work we did, we did
So you sighed and swept your broom
It all make sense
But nobody believes you; and now you live as a liar
Ground had arose and passed its knees
I love you in my way
Please do not drive me crazy, crazy
Hard times have helped me see
I can't explain or understand, I just love You
It feels all right
You were there for us and stood right by our sides
But love grows old, and white's so cold
You watch the city move and breathe and migrate
Now I've been worrying about your feelings, yeah, they were worth protecting
Each tear that flows from my eyes brings back memories of you to me
Down the sky at midnight
Rocking, rocking, rocking, yeah yeah yeah
I grew so old in that house I lived in
And I will love you so
Look much closer when they appear
That I don't thank god
That you're free to be any person
Leave the lights on
Left me stranded, and took away my pride
Some people been known to do it all their lives
Love keeps you warm
For just one second that was true
Star crossed lovers
Sheltered thoughts and fears
I don't doubt that everything is what you gave me
You're like a lover
More about the days when we were crazy in love
Only love, love, love
I'd like to keep you with me all your life
I smile and shake my head
Oh my body is lost on the pity of bosses,
Such an infamous freedom, such a militant peace
Oh, could you lead my lips to sigh
Wide world
She tries to help out everyone
Shaking in waiting for something more
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
The sweetest kiss she will give
I spread the bad news where I go
I'll never know what it's like to feel safe again
As life unfolds so does my faith
And smiled at the cat, who smiled back
It was the wrong guy
Lonely ain't lonely, someone calling at the door
Up among the clouds I see my face miles below
Many miles away from everything that I hold dear
I try to reach out but it's moving away
Do you want a golden ring
For when you need the same magic touch
Pick you up, keep you away from harm
Flowing blood
Does it make you feel good when they tell you what you want to hear
And I'm awalking the floor
And sunny skies
I'm restless from the silence in the air
I do not sleep
No longer afraid of the shit put in my face
The small, the large and the human mind
I hate to see you so down, oh baby
It breeds a world of anger
The time has come and they must go
Hey, I gotta get over you
All in all, it's nice to be out
To the heart of a golden man
She was coming around the hill
They've got me on the wrong route
Doing all that fun kid stuff
From drowning in a flood of tears
And you hide the dead while my friends head to die in your name
It did float my soul along for awhile
She wore her beauty like a cloak
As a magical child
From this power come the change
I wanna get up
Slow motion daylight
Stay awake with the sound of my voice
Well I'll never love you but I've got words to say
I'm a vessel between two places I've never been
Why don't you tell me what's wrong, baby 
She was more than this
And with that, she made her way
The way I loved the way you moved
I spied a pretty fair maid, she appeared like a queen,
Jungle growing anxious with the deep and primal
I turn and brush the birds from off my shoulders
Is a new world
My flat warming got started
Just a breakdown of the heart
Somewhere near the end of our lives
You wait with me, because you know
In the soothing peace of car alarms and cats in heat
Hot summer days, rock and roll
Something in the way she smiles for me
And its hard for you to start
You won't need a real job
Took your soul out into the night
To shine a warmth into eternity, this is an eternal decree,
Oh, it's childish and it's silly
I had a dream, a simple plot
Till you surrender
Trouble, more trouble can you get anymore
I wanna piece of the air when I breathe in
Not if you care for me
I dream there and sometimes I wake there
Give me your heart,
But, I still hung on, just hoping for, my love to come around
Go, love, if you're going
And all good things, they say, never last
That I believe in you
And did you ever think of yourself as a runaway
But I watched you going under
But I don't care, I long for more,
She said my days are unoriginal
You made me feel beautiful 'cause you believed I was
Anywhere's Amanda's dream
I'd surrender all of mine
What life would be what life would be
They say we're not meant to be
Waiting nothings goin' round
When there's no home to call your own
Good night
Can you hear the beat of my heart
So she drives by the station 
As my life just fades away
It was a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
If I stay right here, than forever with you
He's related to you
I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
It's not over till you start again
Set aside
Until it comes again, until it comes again
When all our time was fine
Everything is fine
She found her luck in wells and corner stores and jails
For  years going on the th
The hour is getting late"
And the smiles can last for days and days
Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
And rescue me from me and all that I believe
I'm just waiting for my love to come
You always take it further
And the dry Arizona faces,
Ok, it will all right, it will be just fine just fine
To rise above and beat it
Your friends that turn to liquid
But I enjoy myself; I got my friends around me
And those stars Those stars
'Cause then there's me, could I be the one
Alles wie es war,
At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral
Your voices aren't clear enough after all
You don't have to say a word, it's crystal clear 
Sleep to drink or drink to sleep
But it's midnight and I can't see at all 
Coming back from Paris on the train
I stand alone without beliefs
My eyes are red, 
When the mornin' sun appears, When the sun appears
To the mouth of a serpent
If I could have one more chance
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home and new desire
And love's a jewel while its first new
Had never yet been with a man
I won't have to come back crying
me llaman, me llaman
It felt so real but it was just a dream 
All the birds keeping singing
To stay within the shadows
The beauty in your eyes
But I see your true colors, shining through
And your children are reared by panic and fear
That first look
He beats the earth
Vaca, cadela, macaca, gazela
And make you quiver
To have loved and to lose it
There's a chapter on fathers, a chapter on sons
'Cause I was made for you
When you grow up, what kind of girl will you be
Life without reason
I feel the breeze
I wanna meet them tomorrow
Undresses and folds his arms
Num céu de estrelas multicoloridas
How that cricket talked all night,
And I am a ghost to everyone I know
A one night stand
Though my nights are lonely
Only breathing
Oh I do, I hope you're singing now
The butcher walks home
Baby all the time
And we both feel them now
All of us are going down so
One day I could breath
I'm falling into the temptation
It's not often easy, and not often kind
The way you say goodnight 
Not one of them thinks about the way I feel
Just when she'd said it, that's when she'd say it
Ah heaven
People and places and places and people
Because I got you too deep inside
They tell you from the borders to the waters of the gulf
Oh, you changed your mind
And on any other day I'd be soul destroyed
Adrift on your ocean floor
To be with somebody else
Can tell the difference right or wrong
Hit the continent running
With one little stone
Until you fall asleep then I will go
It's been, it's been such a long time
But we got to hold on
Still I can see the light
All these feelings won"
Passando por la
A symphony that gently leads you to sit and be still with me
Oh, won't let the bastards grind me down 
A symphony of runaways
You're gonna stand up
But you know, no one stays up for you
The alligator from getting up
When she's gone
When you and I were forever wild
My singing bird as you
Anything you ever need,
And I won't need convincing
Digging me up to fuel rockets and risk
When you seem further every day
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care
The earth is falling too
Someone staying and someone gone
My left hand, a part of me
Hondamendi haloa
Then you take away the starlight, ooh
Here just a while
Until the angels guided you to me
You look like you're alive
In the crazy world
I don't feel you anymore
From the desperate kingdom of love
Oh, I hope one day you do
You feel funny in this world
Gee, baby, hope you don't murder me
Can you hear it scream at the hurt that I knew
We'll hit that allnight diner
On rivers of ribbon and sailboats of song
I never loved you blindly 
That's all I get
All of my life I've been in hiding
Nun ich muss es leider brechen
Little boy from Paris to the States, check the facts
Ice in the rigging and howling wind
It takes time
And she said, "Shut your mouth
Cause nothing yet has blessed me yet from
In history, your bluest grace
Stepping into muddy water
Wake up, we're stealing cars
So I just stay at home, oh, just the saddest news,
Which makes it harder to embrace you
I love you say you love me
Fellas, hold on to your girl right now
Without the tears
No I won't forget we're everything I know
If there's a shadow in your life then there's sunshine
She's falling hard for me, I can see it in her eyes
I've been taught to hold back my tears and avoid them
Know my spirit will be standing by your side
It's the little things that we do that mean anything
Only a few things will we recall
Songbird was drinking from a table but songbird you just flew away
When all is said and done I'll still love you
You are the girl
Tangled up in sheets and love
It's for the greater good, 'cause I'd rather be great than good
Virá com ela que entrega 
Love ain't no way to share your time
So I hit the road and made my getaway
And there are red flowers in your spit when you enter my mouth under the bed, down on the floor
'Til the last fleeting beat
I'll remember long drives sitting in the back
I awake in the future,
I'll always run away
And we all have our own scars
To see you fly 
People are strange
Without fear you seek more
The frost in my soul is so cold
I've got it going on X
Hey makes it alright
I never know what I've done
Wipe her tears away
Into the river we will wade
Lesson lost again
There was never anything there in the first place
And you find everything there but the news
And in your grass I remember him
Tied up in twine with the dead and the dying 
They are coming to get us now
With that blood coming down his chest
Oh, desire can cause heart attacks
And with outstretched arms
Well, we sound so good together
You would rather that I wasn't here 
For my love
They fall short for the most part
For anyone like us
Drive your car up to the pole
For more than just a moment of truth between the lies told
They shine for you
And all the fear that keeps me silent
Your limbs will grow strong, your body light
From the ledge that we've climbed
Mother earth take the pain away
And I don't really care if you are straight or gay
Yeah, I knew my time had come
Cosa importa se sono caduto se sono lontano
Why it is you're still here
Got a darkskinned friend look like Michael Jackson
To build an island between me and you
Turn from the fear of the storms that might be
Everybody's born to be different
I do lá 's tú gan buairt
This is the noise of our blood
Forge something new
He was always there to help her
You've been sad for a while
I never knew, I never knew
I am innocent in her dark eyes 
Und mit der Freundin Lust
One day I woke to see her leave
Und die Gabe von der Freude
I'll get through this if I hold on
Sticking our thumbs in the air
Traveling lightly in your neighbor's yard
It's my one wish, I won't forget this
I should leave you while they're dry
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand 
And I don't need convincing
Now I know there is a world beyond
And Death blows promises away
In the deep dark sea 
I heard the train, but not for certain
Could you breathe inside your wellknown plastic bag
Didn't I warn you not to
We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain
Ein Blaulicht stoppt den Verkehr
Your heart is worn and the seams are torn
Take care, please, take care
On the way to the heaven's light
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Yet I can never sleep here
I want deep space
For the end is a mystery no one can read
We were giving up ties and everyone knew it too
Do you not cast a shadow
Raised in Liverpool by the sea
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants
Catchin' feelins is a no,
There's never been a time like this
And all of those things we used to do
I don't wanna fall in though
And I got for myself, yep, it's been a few
I wish you everything
Early in the morning to come later for a party
Do they know who we are
That you bought at the grocery store today 
Everything I feel for you, is everything I want to stay with you
People and places, people in different towns
That I'm the one who has got your back 
I bet you wanted to be over that stone wall
Like a dragonfly
In life
When those sad eyes close
I'm going to stay with this
It longs for me, and someday we
Turn around and make a stop
I'm happy you're beside me
My hands are tied and I can't find my feet
Depending on a prayer
Harder than diamonds, we cut up the sky
L�amore va veloce e tu stai indietro
But none of them as wild as I've discovered in Columbus
I'd write this song on the way
And you always feel so hollow
By the view
And she bites through necks like a Ginsu
Don't let me go outside tonight
But tonight it never comes
This is over as soon as this fire burns through
Here comes the shrimp boat for
I know I waste my time
'Cause I know that it pains if he's gone every time he move over on the shoulder you crying
Personne à l'horizon
I've always tried to find
She's my butterfly She's my butterfly
Te dire les mots les plus tendres
I'd love just once to see you
Help but wonder
We got the money, we got the money, we got the money
Too young for the worst of my mind
Pictures of people that I'd like to meet, oh meet
We have something in common 
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
Don't close the door
My body aches for you, and shakes for you
I love your hair like that
I lit my purest candle close to my
And if you were with me tonight
Once again someone cries
And I forget, I forget, the movie song
This one's hollow
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
And I am ashamed
Reminding me of what is real
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing
Used to knock me out  harder than the rest
And make me stay, here with you
Well it still might kill me 
The ladies all want sweet perfume
Dearest constellation
Everyday my life's so abundant
dass da was Grosses naht
And watched the sunshine
Around the street where I grew up
She spoke of her love returning in time
As a black dog down in the basement
A mon intelligence ou pas
But he was playing on his violin
You crashed your car right into me
She is shaking out static anonymity sha la la la, temporarily
How light can play and form a ring
It's ringing harder than the bells do
Hollowing souls
A killer is a cold blooded one
Deep in the night for her
See the nightbird softly fly
We'll face the winds
The good times, they aren't only in the past
His picture worn and weathered
Oh oh oh yes they do, they do, believe me
Look for ways that I can tell you
And I hate it when you see me in this way
You shouldn't come around here, singing up at people like that"
Restraint restraint
Now everyone is here
It's like the glory days, it's like a fortune sold
Bright eyes, burning like fire
He closes his weary eyes upon the day
If I was wrong or right
And showing such fear at being found unawares
Modern cocktail drinkers
Caught a glance in your eyes
No time to choose
A time to live a place to go
Some say there's a Jesus
I'm the one to forget
The nights are endless things
And give you my love with sweet surrender
But the good ones always complain
You get the feeling
I'm never alone won't you please be near
This is the sign of our times
I whipped you off and felt so awkwardly alive
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
When it fact you were the one long ago
Lying on the grass
With any kind of sense
Thieves will always say
Even as my demons leave
I've seen the future and the end is near
The girl I described, she's as real as the wind
Monday night
Selling your reason will not bring you through
And tell me how do you feel
The world keeps turnin'
My breath is soft, your hands are unlocked
Hold me in your arms
Thought I heard the voice of mommy
Hawaiian sunset peeping from the sea
This is not my landscape now
Could come from someone new
Don't go looking for him now
A sun in your hands from the middle life
Ill drink tea sometimes when its cold
It's  straight down, I can't stop my knees
I'd, I'd like to paint this picture for you
It takes a night to make it dawn
To steal away, the time is right
Anywhere the wind blows
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl
A hundred miles an hour on a brand new road
Afraid of what I feel
The end of the time, they're the end of the line
Bringing fear and reign of terror
Sweetness comes and goes and I'm always here to stay
Do you hear the silence I was far too late
If someone came to love her
All my life I stumble
Shine down through the rain Down through the rain
You would think that we've danced around each other long enough to know
You misread the sign
To these hands with revolver
Whatever you are
And how my thoughts they let me down
Desperate clouds
Makes you want to get down crawl like a beggar
You don't know how to play the game
Wawawawawawanna comprehend
Ole pelottava kuin kevään liekki
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
You didn't love the boy too much
Mais mon corps s'ennuie
And my mind on you
I'm the man who won
Just keep on trying actually what she really said was
Emotional air raids exhaust in my heart
There's still time
OhDid you want me to change
She goes down on her knees and prays 
Reminding us how far we've come
Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
Do as the beautiful once did,
Prodigal son, clever, better than ever, back
A promise of a new year
To view the fair fields, and the valleys in bloom;
Quand, alanguie, elle frémit et soupire
I will try and dry my eyes
Tell me, if we sleep together
What kept your world spinning
I have learned this from my mother
The right way
I'm gonna build somebody else
Inside your porcelain fists, your palms begin to crack 
When will I dare to press rewind and start all over
When I lose for the last time
Are you changing, are you changing, are you changing
Just look what you've done
She's not the only one, remember that
But life's just one of the games we play
What keeps you from moving, are you afraid to be loved
It rained for days a blaze of Hail and stones
Said we'd soon be together
I want to show you the stars
My lips and
All alone in this great big mall 
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
That you won't censor anything
I feel you
Look at me run
Some Minnie Ripperton will definitely set this party off right
So put some passion in the play, because we all go anyway
In a simple border song 
So they can in turn reach up and kiss the sky
To share forever the unrest
Who needs sleep when we've got love
It's all right, that's all the same
I shed tears writin' this song, homeboy, that was real talk, man
And it's too late to get on
Maybe he will be my friend
You know I believe in how You know I believe
Or to concern yourself with the investments of
With one or two I get used to the room
My baby freaked when she peeked at that legged blob with a beak
I will tell you how the sun rose high,
I'm not cruel and you're not evil and we're not like all those stupid people
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
Ma se ti svegli e hai ancora paura ridammi la mano
Before they've come to grief
Oh, don't cry for me,
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here
The leaves are falling
Now her ghost wheels her barrow through streets broad and narrow
I bet she's down there having fun
And we laughed all night when they said
Roter Sand und zwei Patronen
With the waves crashing down on me
I was taking a leap, I was playing for keeps with you
Who's gonna numb my pain
Hey kid, rock and roll
And the grayest days the predictions told
She saw my silver spurs and said let pass some time
It's got a Heart in Your Pain
Baby my heart and soul
To live a lie, it really got me all excited
Voices leaking from a sad café
Finally made it home
Never had so much, was afraid to keep
I was never young
Strange speech dirty human elements to question
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
And he won't be back again
Is it just me or is it dark in here
And you're still here
With tears in our eyes
One day closer to death
Trying to stay calm
Wake me up 'cause I'm dreaming 
Picture of you that's still there
Summer days it never ends
My name is raincheck, on a golden autumn day
She was a wreck, but so was he
It's cold when you remove the nails
Take two steps back from all of this
And ordering an coffee that I wouldn't ever drink
Always not suiting their needs at this time
Little acorn becomes the mighty oak
You got me, you got me, baby
I was lonely
Give you second chances easily
And leave the door ajar
Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Oh, in its arms safe from the storms
Lets just be honest and admit we can't go on
You say, lately I've been bothered by my friends
She be grabbin', callin' me Biggie like Shyne home
That this navy blue bird was me
She stares as they fade out of view
When I see her face
I wonder how I'll sleep
Everyone should hear
What are you made of
You try your hardest to rewind the tapes
Feel you inside of me
I only did what I had to
Don't you care Don't you know about Love
Come on baby
Instead you get absence
'Cause you make my heart feel like it's summer
You may hear
Call me raincheck, I won't fade away, I won't fade away
I know I'll still feel the same, yeah
Was taken away, deliverance came
Hey baby, baby light that ass on fire 
To get over this heartbreak
I'd like to ride my bicycle with you
Lost without a way
We sat listening patiently, the sky was near
They mean nothing to you
Patiently the fawn awaits the day the rain's gone
I can't figure out why I feel so ashamed
I still miss you so
And if I catch myself crying
We are like wild geese in Summer
So hush now, my babe, please don't cry 
Both our joys and our pain
So just reach inside your heart and pack your bags
It stays late to clean up my mess
And smoke away the night
Burning the light of our nights
Got to crush my fantasies of how this life is supposed to be
I climbed a cloud
Coulours strong  it's been a long, long time
Lay on the wind and lie my side with you
I will give anything, anytime
That was another day
But now you're giving advice
And I could sleep with you tonight
Think I'm goin' home
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
So I'm off on the road
So you know how much I need you
Comes to a dead stop
I'm getting nervous, na, na, na, na, na, na
Is it just me or are you fed up
And young men never die
There's no words for this, I see
Susanne, don't you break down and cry
Et quand ma langue se délie
Don't be shy, umm when it hurts to say
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know the priority order me
Melodies, melodies
I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me
I hurry to the next stop
Angel's wings carried him to me
Baby, they know just know what to say, the trying to break us away from one another, but maybe their right for a change
It meets me, unwilling at the floor
And go your own way
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Chasing fireflies
Tú me hiciste ver el cielo aún más profundo 
Calling Intel station light
And all you need is what you see
Und alle anderen, die sich familie nennen
Scrape my mind with your hand
Everywhere we went just looked the same to me
Things go up things go down
Though I wouldn't mention
É como procurar no mato estrela do mar
Lit by candlelight and chandelier
You made me feel like a harbour
When you smiled and slowed
Oh, what do you need 
When you say your prayers tonight if you make amends
Our lives are buried in snow
The fate I'm facing everyday
It looked like heaven but the colours seemed to change
Procession moves on, the shouting is over
Surrender till I must obey
Too big to really understand 
But I still think of you
The days are getting shorter
Maybe a day 
If you walk out the door
Love me 'cause I'm fresh and clean and so tighty
I need therapy, they say
I've got nothing left to lose, my dear
'Cause I'm so used to living underneath the surface
Now this Hennessey, is gonna' be the death of me
I give you crazy mad props, because I know I should
I caught your smile
Jeder bei Lars sagt ein Witz
Still here
And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world
I guess it's best we say goodnight
I slept through the falling of the leaves 
But you don't know how real it feels
For ever their fair poems flourish may
I'm taking my time, taking it all in
Maybe I'll write this out or maybe I'll leave this down
Please make no mistake I'll be there too
Just gets lost sometimes in his chemicals
An ending to this fear
And your breath's hot and gross, but I kiss you like a lover
And when the sun dies
And for good I cry
My love oh my dear
Something in the way she moves me
The water's clear
Lock down inside
When shall I see the sea
If you knew now what you knew then
Take care not to hurt yourself
That hurts our feelings Hurts our feelings when you say we're not rappers
With the disgust that you pretend when I walk on by
It's just like a train
This prelife crisis, is killing me
It breathes within me and all that I am
I move forward with my hopes
On the radio, do you have to go
And Jamie picks fights but the weekend's short lived
Except for that day
Fallen in love
It takes the one to have the other
Everything you need to see
Never die, never die, never die
And tomorrow take it away, oh no
You've come to save my life again
Schlaflos, was hab ich nur gemacht
Take care
I'm drunk right now baby but I've got to be
But it's the truth so you might as well hear it
Yes fate is so unkind
And my best friend
It used to be it was all I want, my only care
Have you ever had the feeling
Without reading the text, know what comes next
It was great until those old magazines
I thought I could recognize the sign
Where the sun don't shine
It was filled, now broken up
For pride is anything but rare 
And think for a moment
All the things that you loathe
Picket fence, the windows stained
My love, do you know
For a job in the fruit trees
Grave attention is still focused
Lilac wine is sweet and heady
I�m a man on a mission and I�m all about her
Groovy love child
No dreams will come true
Oh it looks like Romeo has found 
Could be the biggest mistake that a man can make;
All a mirage gone bad oh
I never said I loved you quite enough
And you hate the teenage dad on his estate
From the dream come the vision
Do you wanna turn back the pages
Will I ever bare that soul
And after they suck all your soul, well, that's when they'll disappear
Could take the life of one so precious
If you won't change your mind
I was scared to call your mother
Just for a while, I'd seen you smile
So find love, for to night for all nights to come
Well if it doesn't it's not love
Down the street from Calumet, a school for the Stones
I love this power that's crushed so easily
The kitchen floor
Sunrays and Saturdays
Beyond where we should have gone
Because I stand where I stand
Will you remind where we've been
Two, is better than one
Nobody callin' on the phone
To give her peace peace peace
I should fret if the worst looks like the best
Until there is no one to ask me
I'll show you how it feels to be to blame like me
Every time you messed with my head nanana
The way that it is in my mind
Like a memory it falls 
Sometimes I forget sometimes I don't think
Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you
When you discussed your love for lust, just make sure you visit here first, Cali
We dream of a ship that sails away
Ah, I have swum those raging seas
We sure didn't see no man in that fog
Packin' my things
A rage that knows no right or wrong
All the things you did and you said nanana
The train is leaving
Never be alone
Let the bird sing
Even when you lie
I'm under your curse, oh, oh
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
By all these people worrying about me
'Cause the words are dead,
Her sweet incantations lost in infamy
But something wasn't there
Happy to see it says nothing about us 
I've burned all paths that lead to peace
The games of
Of the stillness of time
How many ways am I killing 'em Shit, right around a billion
Use your sword, use your voice
So put your faith in a late night show
Keep these feelings, no one knows
We have to prove that our love is real over and over again
There'd be no reason to think twice
Just look into my eyes, they'll never lie
It's time for you to be with someone like me
You are a vessel of light
Have I become a tiresome bore
I was so young then
Harlem River talk to me
Well I'd change for good
Someone else you'd rather phone 
I was glad it wasn't us, yeah I was proud
And I feel like I've been working overtime, overtime
When there is nothing
You're not gone
Search through the darkest waters
Still remember feeling nervous
You and I in a shameless state
I can't seem to find my way
But I know a girl twice as hard
See you walking, see you talking
Is sustained tenderly
Who waits for the tide and the town to get high
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain
Isolated in my own world
Das ist das Schicksal von dir und mir
I'm just chasing me my time
When it's time to let go
Sings a slow slow song
Que tu comprendras
The most fragile of things
Can't get you off or out of my
And the rainfall
And yet you never change your ways
But don't say there is no way
It's tying you up while you're fadin'
In my hand a tangled thread
In the enlighttened night
Listening to a sound
I know it sounds lame but it's so true
I know you played it a  times before
My heart, still beats, for you
From being another loser helpless at her side
Beside her I care to linger even though it's not safe
The bright and beautiful parade
And loving you is the one thing that I need right now
Phillip always said about the wheelswithinwheels
I just wanted you to want me to stay
I'll see you back tonight where painters
"Leave me alone," I wept to the Hobo;
For the one that you love
It may not last forever
In my life in my life
You mother me
I nasze szczęście zasuszone
And you can make it last forever
Made me feel so good inside
They see him, want him to please them, want him to play them, but they don't even pay him
I've got all I need spirit, hope and joe
But you make it too hard
Away, gone so soon
So I'll take the lie
No, I don't fade away, I don't fade away, I don't fade away
You could never be a face in the crowd
That one day ill find a way
No family, no kids
Will anyone get close to me
Why we up  AM on the phone
Well Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen
Why must you shed such tender tears
December won't you come
You've come a long way, you're selfassured and dressed in funny clothes
And we were bound to the city life
So what are you gonna do with them all
Whoa, I struggle to breathe to breathe
When the night air comes to me
With a calm fear
If you let it all go, it'll fall apart
You must leave I understand
And I can't get off this spin
It may be the faded photograph, but I know you care, don't hide
If you love her let her go"
I couldn't think of what to say, I had no ready reply
That old blanket of sorrow
From up in the sky they're just people
You don't even know my name
His name and his surname, in letters of gold
Been a fish in the sea 
Go ahead
You talk in your sleep
And lose the one you love
Satisfaction is my mission and a bed is all we need
With open arms
But this is for HollandDozierHolland"
y a remplazar palabras por miradas 
Though you've found a new love,
An' up the hills yeah boys let's strike for the hills
You go to loud places
I could sing you your favourite song 
One dark day the trees began a trumpet sound,
And the spirit of life remains inside, inside
Really 'cause that girl that you want
I'm under your curse now, but I call it compromise
Always left standing
You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye
Take my hand and I will mellow
Where I go to sleep alone
Lonely, lonely hours without that
Don't forget about her,
Same old house just the family's changed
Just send your heart beat, I'll go
Where is the best man All arise us all in peace
Why doesn't he come home
But you're story tends to change when you look in my eyes
Despegaste del cemento mis zapatos 
Gave me life under calico skies
'Cause love is around the corner
Let's get it over with
But I'm trying to get her back
Says I�m alright
Give me no dreams of what the future brings
So now they lie there breast to breast and toe to toe
That another sings Each story unfolds 
The time when we counted every black car passing
Or is it the rain
für diesen einen Moment
Is every bit worth it, I can't let you down anymore
'Cause there's still time to change your mind 
They can disappoint you if you see through their perfect smiles
Safer than it was
And that you're always late
I'll drink some beer as to find my way
'Cause it's such a night
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Recovering days are heavy hands upon your breasts
Orange, orange, orange in the mouth again, straighten
The sea was calm
The dry Arizona faces
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
Building new rulers
Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Well, the river is deep and the river is wide
We can drive until daybreak and then I'll rest
The morning
And when they don't go our way we
Dear love, come what may
How the fairy tale begins
And the moon is so full
Time seems to bring us together again
When you're around
Olhos de águas vindas
And your sweet clean clothes would go stiff on the line
Do you pray in the night
The siren sings a lonely song
My foot in one the plug
That she brushed her heavy hair
And even though she tried she feels the same
Tell my family and friends how much I love them all as well
A comic relief that makes room for my decision
"Goodbye house, forever"
You don't need to tell me
I understand I'm just a fan
I play the ones from yesterday
Is it safer never to love
Pretending life is sweet
And then letting love grow
que los años son sabios
And I'm turning from all the lights tonight
Watch the time
Just like the way that you ran to wine
But we are going home
Without hunger and homelessness
But anyway bird
'Round and 'round till it breaks and
I wish I was in a mood to die
I don't mind spending everyday
High on amphetamines
Stack up the chairs, roll up the rug
But in order ta do that you gotta believe in me yeah
I hear people singin'
Someone made you
Frantically, I run for my life
That we should start off with a drink
My heart is in economy
Nor the one to make you come
I'm seeing hoes sex in the studio bathroom
And now, there's nothing left to hide
I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow
Don't go looking for him lady yeah
So haul away 
Just leave the light on
I waited on the steps for you and I hid in the bushes whenever a car pull into the parking lot
On that night from the balcony
The lighthouse's burned
I look to my Eskimo friend
His tears have turned to poppies
Because I still exist in spite of you
And she was ancient like the Greeks
Some bed of nails I have given you
A place where every time you breathe a wish comes true
Well baby, there you stand
And make the natural flow
Is the last beat heard
He broke his own heart as I watched as he tried to reassemble it
There's a love that transcends
I'd have jumped from my trees
I was sifting through the piles
Bad times always seemed so sweet
Maybe it's all right
But I won't let it change me, not if I can
We can go until daybreak and then we'll rest
Ever talk, decide out
Heroes often get shot
Find a quiet place and have a good laugh
Somewhere along the way
All for this child of mine
Christmas time is here
Living in the shadows of a man I've never seen
Und schon wieder lieg ich wach 
Don't back down, concentrate on seeing
Lay yourself in my bed again 
Weights down so that you could move forwards
To like the movies that we watch to pretend it wasn't winter
Gently, children
As I step in vain
Even when you are dreaming
I'm right again, I'm Chinatown
And I was just a virgin, a baby
Sleep tight tiger sweet dreams till tomorrow
Into the wilderness
No new chapters
She said her name was a secret
In a corner of a darkened cell, and his pain meant nothing to me
Whenever I get down
Falls apart, cascading down
Buzzards fly above the car
With Him we shall be forever blessed
I'm getting bored, I need, need, need, need now, now some kicks
I just made myself look bad
Sometimes we don't ask for what we need
I'll change my quills to break the will
I brush away
So we say go
I always knew that you deserved much more than me
quand le soleil rouge reviendra
All time fell
Hey, maybe should we ask it could our friends be worthier
Fell in love, whole loaf love
But what when all your fields are rotten, your waves of grain, amber waves of grain When your days are done, I hope you've had fun with your game
Cymbals crashed, the lights went blue
When you look, you look like red roses
With roots that reached out for the sea
And it won't leave me alone
Are the things that make you panic
Thru life shun
I sold you a lie
But that was then and she is now, I once was lost with her I'm found, on this early April morning
Talking to the walls again
I dance for you
Von ihm wurde mir viel erzählt als ich klein war
Get back
Now say the word and I'll lay it at your feet
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Mark my home and draw some lines that match
But don't forget, enjoy the ride
Next she found a man to treasure
Maybe to forget you
When the circus came to town
In a green light
and we know how endangered we do
Thank heavens what a fine situation
No one waits
Something I have learned
But what's man without his wealth
Too many teardrops yeah
Don't stop thinking
And I still like you, the best man
With broken teeth and busted head 
His body's warm
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring on back
We are obsessed
Is losing the one thing that's holding you dear
Knowing well it means goodbye
una más que este amor
You know I never was a jealous type
When the fireworks in me are all gone
These flowers are coming up wild
Were dreams that never lived,
Following the river of death downstream
But I feel your heartbeat
And no horizon can sleep
On way back home wonders meeting all
And the spirit of life is the will to carry on
The tourists stare at tourist stops
Iscariot, you fool
I told y'all, here they come now, you see them 
Build a little stronger castle in the air
To catch your tears
For your memory
They tell their lies and something dies
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Can't turn around
Growing love but like water 
When I open my mouth, I'm so brutally honest
The carnival is over
Screaming and sounds of the shovel burying him to fade
'Cause we won't leave this place any worse than when we came
Perfect beauty laid before me
You drank all the water and you pissed yourself dry
Red and black, 'bout my bread, man
And I'll be there just to see the sun
And maybe
A heart gets caught inside ones thoughts
Time to throw us down, medicine's side effects
Go on and fall apart
Instead of rewind
So I swam a little closer
What do you care
Joni help me, I think I'm falling
She was going with a cinematographer
Now I'm left here with those dreams you tossed away
My attends to you
All these tears are no longer mine nanana
Naw it's just me again, cryin' in the rain
Zoramena
You had a way of making it come alive
Great waves of progress shall wet the air
You watch the moon and hope the damn thing crumbles
Oh, beautiful world, to me
I see the sun rising
Heartbeat's at a steady pace, I'll let the rhythm show me the way
And we roll in every summer like it's shameful to be underneath
And you could tell that I was nervous so you held my hand
With you not here, the streets I roam
Droplets glittering home
I've got this one fresh second, one fresh minute, one fresh hour of my day
And all I want is your love
And now my eyes
Talking to someone, staring 
We thought the sun would keep our love alive
And I thought, And I thought
And the gentleman is leading her towards the door
And I've got another thought I'll keep to myself
Tearing down all the walls and love, the chaos
My weapons left by the bedside, I
Together we were known as good friends
And now I stole the moon
You sit up on your perch for the rest of the night
The match was struck and I was fire
Little one, how long I've waited here
I've been skipping like a stone
If you want me to be blind, I will stay here
Can we keep it down till its back round till it comes
You will fall in love with the very first man you meet"
Take these broken wings
From all around the world for the Women, weed and weather
Why did God fail
Locked together
I know I'll see you forever
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
She pours you a drink, the table starts to sink
And I've had a good time, have you had a good time
Common and Gil ScottHeron
It was not a real body part
All I do is keep the beat, the bad company
I'm sure that we will meet again but only time will tell
The way you moved
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop I love the thangs she do
Don't disturb this love of mine 
We play the blues with the curtains drawn
Each time I turn a corner
You do not look back at where you came from
I never needed your corrections
And your heart's weighed down like gold
'Cause I love you baby, that's no lie
Twenty times again
We can deja vu backwards, baby, make it seem like a trip
That I want those things you could never allow
The way you'd play for me at your show
Know what it mean to be on the scene and in the audience "Ali", beamin', yo
I'd like it more if I dance, yeah, sure
I'm taking my time
I'll show you how it feels to be, blame like me,
Went to where the people were on a Saturday night
Only tears
We'll talk of what we haven't done
And we fall through fate,
Light that ass on fire 
It's all right, it's ok, because the night is just another day
Baby I believe in miracles because I'm baby I'm forever yours, yours
London, did you have to take my child away
So until tomorrow, sleep Hawaii sleep
We'll play kissy kissy and have a baby and figure out,
Night falls am I dreaming
Crying about his past,
Take me from the loneliest
On days like these
I won't be fooled just like
And I can get on with mine
Oh god, I'd give my life for you
Goldplated tears of a rapper
They can fill a cup or two and still disturb the peace
As I walk up a street
GOLLY gee, what have you done to me
I can't see right through your lies
And is this my final chance of getting you
Believe me 
My arms will provide
Ahhhaahaahahhhaawhoohoooh
Like the grownups did when I was a kid
Pretend there's casters rolling on your feet
And I would stop to think of what to do
Your true colors, true colors
Sometimes I get so tired,
Baby, don't you know that it is understood
You can make it last forever
I wake up in the morning and I wonder
For you to stick around
Than to risk your heart
With its glass eyes a blue formica halo
But hard to get release
If you say the word, we will beat those birds
Don't let them see you cry
When morning comes once more, I have the loneliness you left me
Wrap around me
For the cute ones
From the thought of you
The sun is setting
I'll wait for you tonight
And they're swimming around again, again
It's passion pulls the pain
Oh, beautiful son, smiling light, good morning son, sunshine
All of the while I never knew
It's icy blue
Something right
You flower through my nails and skin
I'll be flicking stones at your window
Thanks for the song Mr Knight
They're gonna back up
Please singin' this tune
They are the trees
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
Ships coming home
As the ground raced beneath them thirty thousand feet down 
All that face, makes me wanna party
'Cause I fall and I break just as easy as an egg
Close one there
There's gonna be trouble 
que a pesar de que dicen
And all the ways I got to know
And I'm only halfway sober
And if you say that you don't care,
Never to come out
Kitty asked me to read her stars
Your place is in the sky, how can I show you
The only way from here is down
Disregarding the fact your running's been done for a while
All the voices keep torturing you head
You must be the one
Many with the notion that to share is to lose
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
We'll do this again some day
And look out the window with you
Everyday you feel a little curse
I know the shape of things to come
To cause this reclusive silence
I lift my head up and I face you
That I was born in North Carolina
Whispering this in his days
A little talent but a lot would do
A deadly end
Bringing tears to my eyes
Living on Sycamore street
Our treachery is love, dear
But now you're lit up by the city
And all the cold shoulders that the slightest draft lets in
Cleave the dry stone to a promise
Winter comes and snow
In stranger's hands
You can bring meaning to what I do
At least give me a reason to let go
And I can feel
Where the trout and salmon play
I don't mind the shadows
That nothing else exists
Goodnight Georgie, goodnight queen
I only want to be a relief
Please believe I'm never too far
She is shaking out static anonymity sha la la la, sha la la la 
And I will give to you summer wine
It's time to say goodbye
And I'll bleed for your lips
The day is coming
Of a million more just waiting to become
Tender lovin' arms
We're just people living
Pick up the beat 'n' stop hogging the feast
So we both can pretend
Voit mennä, en pelkää ollenkaan
I dream of you and
Far and wide, sweet and simple Jehovah knows that I've been sinful
Hey, baby, tell your daddy,
To my brother Big Pun
Sun shines bright
I think we've got
If I could change my life
Snares for my dreams drifting onto oblivion
I'm like a frightened horse
Oh, my God, we don't got a penny left
When I look up from my pillow, I dream you are there with me
And I believe him
Be a believer, believe everything
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Mil acasos me levam a perder
Mojique smells the wind that comes from far away
And I'm only halfway sober, and it's not getting me any closer
"The days are getting longer so I better get stronger fast"
The youthful boy below
But your coat is big and I am warm
While she's still around
And Jesus loves him
Looking after number one
The people that smiled and cheated
One more bad break could bring a fall
And all the way, you loaded all your dolls and toys into the car,
I was hiding in the light
So until I truly believe
Oh Sophie, will you be my good friend
You aren't
Don't stay on account of me
My heart is aching for love
What do you want me to say now baby,
I was wandering through the streets of the city
I found your photograph in a cardboard box in a magazine
Point de héros ni prince charmant
Where we could ride the tides
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
Winding dying inside sucking outside
When we kiss
The things that hold us back
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute
Stop pushing Stop shoving Stop straining
Past the eyes of those who care
Patience, time comes, she says
I'm crawling back again
When you told me to take you walkin' down the street
So do something
You step to the door of the club and see that you ain't gettin' in
Like I did, you know
Memories, they fall apart, whenever you're inside my head
You need good timin'
Do I inch closer every day
Once I had a man and he was right for me
Instrumental
Can't do a thing to stop me Dreaming
Ships in the night,
Can this be love
Ich spür' die Kraft,
It's all I'd need
We'll play our air guitars
Yeah, yeah, yeah, kill him now, now
Yes we know that all good things come to an end
Your hoping the sun won't rise
He was a picture of Jesus
Wash away into the rain
Older brothers and late night bars
The wind began to howl
Like the leaves
And the business was doing great
Sing to you, love is what I bring to you
If it wasn't for the cinema
If I'd been a dreamer, I would float away and not care
Keep your eyes closed
Like an atmosphere around me,
Got all the words to keep on hoping,
If I may 
A young girl, unchained
The hallow bright
We'll dance like flames for there's no gravity,
You'll always be in my orbit
We could smoke 'til the sun goes down
And time was held 
You'll stand proud, face upheld
All have been wept for husbands, brothers, grandsons,
To make me strong
Poison seeps into
All I wanted was to impress you
Would you still look in my eyes
All I see scares me
Und der Fall ohne Netz
When death creaps in to play it's part
Honestly over you
You get the privilege of being with me
Just like a stone
And maybe all those secret times
She's gone to the movies now and she,
This is not the first time
There's no need to be sorry for yourself
Scrawled on the pavement
Like looking at the deep night sky
I try to stay drunk so nobody knows
You know I believe in how
And said the trapeze act was wonderful
Thought you had broke your own back
A selfish life
When everything was still
Life's a game made for everyone
You look in my mind
And there's nothing to believe we haven't already forgotten
Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the wits
The feds watch me, Icey, they can't stop me
Well, that final day will come, it comes to everyone
Don't be alone, Abigail, belle of Kilronan
I think I'm going back, I think I'll go back
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
You left Glasgow and your shadow
Taking hold of our senses
To see what I've done
I know we'll make it
On a horse made of clouds, you will scatter the sands
No need to fear
To be like an evergrowing forest
Ist die Angst, es wieder zu verlier'n
Just don't leave me stranded in your arms
Stop trying to change me
I need a drive up san francisco bay
So amplify this little one
I'll ask that you find someone to help
Live like you're dying and never stop trying
And I've figured out with all that's said and done
Your skin crawls up an octave, your teeth have lost their gleam 
Perdido num planeta abandonado
Shore to shore, got some land between
We've turned it off in the night 
Only you remind me
I know you fooled me a million times
Oh, when you came back from the scene, it's true, you brought a melody
Time, is like a dream,
And pick up on one and leave the other behind
No, nothing has changed
They look just like me and a lot like everybody
Skapaður í mynd manns í líki karls og
Kind woman, nothing more
Say the word
Sleep in silence, reshape, another way
I'd fall for you
If you're not around that's too bad
Hell has no reason to smile
So bright on cinder gray and spray paint
And we stood where no one has stood 
I'll never know the safety of your arms again
Dance, dance, dance, and go crazy
And have the pleasure of saying what you mean
I've become blind
Red hair and blue eyes
Always looking for ways to love you
Been a scratch on the surface 
If I did it y'all could do it
Before I pass out I need your ghost to tell me this bloodless voice
You push me away
Butt into that underwear  yeah 
You know they say it's better
Running out of time
He stands by the doors of the Rex all night
I simply remember my favorite things,
The swamps and the prairie dogs, the Joshua trees
In Volkswagen vans with full running boards dragging great anchors
I will dance till the bitter end
But there aren't any here
To see the empty road at happy hour
You're not calling anyone
He was alone
Time like a river
My memory stirred
Show some understanding for the lonely fool
For Twilight has come
Oh my mother, she betrayed us, but my father loved and bathed us 
Now I've grown so much colder
I see numb empty faces
Maybe Friday I can
Then you pulled away
I am a dreamer and when I wake
And I know what you'd say, you'd say
Why are you crying
Better run back where you're from and join the mass
Beneath The Tree of heaven
To light everyone's day
For the sun to rot
When he had the heart to ask her
I will die if I don't wake up
I want to play you a tune that leaves you marooned and troubled
Come and fight your corner
I don't know why you think you got a hold on me
The wind turns traitor cold
I know we'll make it through
And I'm thinking about the way things were
And there is no one to break the fall
The sadness that comes in the night times will fade away
I am the masked rider, give me some grace
But the head's to the wall and I'm lonely
There's a very big man
My brother dreaming of a new land
There is no real reason to accept the way things have changed
And I can tell someday I'm gonna say the truth
Pero olvidaste una final instrucción
Why this is the wrong way out
A sense of it starts breaking up, and its lies
Otherwise you're only living for it
I wash the dishes and I rinsed up the sink
Or hum at least I have heard one
Do you dream of me
If all the words I ever wrote
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Then an encounter with a voice that caressed me
And move along instead of talk
If you need to take some time
Wrong move and you're not too cool, wrong move and you're not too cool
Looks like I've been the sole nobody
When you grow up, what kind of boy will you be
Even if only for one weekend
For that woman with the tattooed hands
One of these days I'll make some money
I wouldn't cheat you, honey
This summer held no words
Someday your bird is gonna fly
That nothing in this world
She'd take a shine to me
The summer is over
It'd be nice to go out drinking with you
I can't get any younger
Jonka jälkeen ei jää enää mitään puuttumaan
Deep in the cell of my heart
But I've come home
The life of the party
I'm here, all alone
A kiss is contagious
Har bestämt att stå helt utanför det där som jag blir ledsen av
Can't go back
Leave the light on
A long time ago I left my home
A part of me
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Help is on the way
Don't feel bad for me
There is a better world
So, how would it feel
People walkin' on top of the sea
Oh, all our love fell down to Earth
Fuck my everyday
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I had a friend I loved
We will never forget
She's talking to her agent
Now you know I'd hate to come over obsessive,
And while I wrestle with demons angels and appetites
Than live without any scars
And if you could step inside me you'd feel what hatred brings
Healing comes so painfully
Someone to rely on as
Y descubrí lo que significa una rosa 
Jackie é uma menina tão bonita que enjoa
Falling around me
When I'm far gone 
When I'm feeling like this, I got nothing to lose
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you
I was happier then with no mindset
All of my friends are strangers
It's your last year
I get get so full and I wish it never
In the dark changing place
Being in love don't mean you're free
The right way to go about this
Baby, that's life
A million voices scream in my head
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
There are snakes out in the night
And the same Berkeline recliner
And away he gone light
I used to think time, was on my side
I'm a lonesome kind of guy
I never thought it would go
We make it to twentyone, one, one, one, whoa
You've got a devastating point of view
Stuff regarding all my friends
We were giving up time
I stepped, I left and I don't regret leaving
Like the dream of you I had
I've thrown away my nights,
Hurts inside, no scars to show
Down in silence to the ground 
And the Hollywood sign,
And I don't know if I can do this alone
Hold me in your arms tonight; Hold me in your arms
Keep her awake, Give me a fright,
Where's your man
But, we all welcome change
Your meloncholy song
We'll melt away before we land,
So I offer myself and I'll just give until there's nothing else
Tiny move
Still I wish that I could see like everybody can Like everybody can
If you're looking for
Too far away
Keep breathing my angel, if you go down I go down with you, keep breathing, just keep breathing
That always bring you down
And I'm just so cold I want to cry
You wouldn't get it
And when the phone rang only once she took a dreadful fright
I have to keep you and Paris on my mind
 reparti
You could go anywhere anytime and find someone
In search of destination
And the ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in
We'll make it out of here
Where you end, where I begin
Cold tiles beneath your knees, 
But I still wanna please you
Wonder if she's gonna stay
All these pages are burning
As a young boy daddy used to tell me stories
You're seeing it right over London
If I belong to somewhere, it's to your arms, Kery Kery oh
It's in my body language, read me
Angry sun burn down
Little did we know how the time would fly
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know
This house is cold and empty
We'll stick together forever
When you tell me that she stayed out, all alone
We laughed the happy afternoon away
I was young, I was surviving the times
No, I'm not that kind of whore but I am a little Lord
Of someone who is still true at heart
So it shines when you finally come home
A perfume latin lovers' scent
When the time is right 
That has come between me and you
We're at the ground floor
I can be the air you drink,
Drive around and get my blood flowin'
I spend so much time
Hon dansar och blundar så nära intill,
All alone once again
Till the rays of gold and honey cover you
Who can she turn to when the chance of coincidence is slim
Moody It's got me x 
They'll play it on the radio all week long
Judy will be suffering tonight
And something in your eyes
For there are many here who hunger
Say my name, say my name
And it seemed like overnight
Days go by, nothing's getting clearer
Catching colds and missing trains
Spend a lifetime, spend a lifetime
Now I got to wait on my girl
I stared 
und es zusammen zu flicken
Oh, you gotta get out and get back to me
Beneath the silver moon
Breaks my heart
So long ago, mean and my friend we were friendly
And watch them float away at the same time
Curve's the words, spin's the verbs
As we relive the best times of our lives
And maybe to have learned this time
Late that night, we checked into the Bellevue
Now we lie beneath the sky
That you need no one to guide you
Swallow to die again
You can point fingers all you want
If you will come all the way down with me
If you wanna ride, you can come out and see me
Is ask for things
Her mother is frowning at something she missed
Followin' deadend signs into the sores
You ain't never seen a nigga ago to jail and sleep till day 
Aw, the winds gonna blow
It's a feeling
Why to stay
We could be together saying nothing
I think we could laugh just enough to not die in pain
Of the old apple tree
You'll come around to see the other side of things
Turn to clouds
But I love the sound
kommen zurück
Words don't come easily
A torn shirt and a long dead cause 
To be there by your side and keep you warm when you are cold
My car keys
'Cause I can't be the one you wanted me to be
To give them time to let them breathe
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
When nobody else is around
For fifteen minutes and change
und nach unten zu fliegen
And would our flame still burn so bright
Get a new place out in the hills
And introduce to every soul a drink made of tears
Once I was your sweetheart,
My love's as fair 
So then we were floating up, we were floating like particles into the night
As long as I'm not aware of change
Will this horizontal line
And you haven't told me anything at all
And find a way to grieve you
Awoke the dreams still sleeping in my bones
Maybe we should just stop here
There were people around with the need to get down for good
Are your eyes just singing the blues
From this cloudy sky
And I never knew you from the sun
You're not biting, you're barking 
With anyone of all the young dudes
Don't cry, my love, don't cry no more
Placed in my wall
The night
The snake in the basement found
It's a loved one
Si solo te pudiera encontrar
Believe me, you do
I love this power
Looked into my eyes, said, you're my fix for life but now
If there were no tears
I say if the futures been drawn out then nobody's living
And there's lights up in the north
The tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
I'm off to the war
Couldn't make it up as we go along
I can watch the sky turning grey
It is so clear I realize and now at last I have my eyes
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Please Lord, don't look the other way
This place I see, just doesn't look familiar
I was honest when I told you
Winds on the coast tonight
There is no doubt in your eyes,
Into a stranger's eyes
When I thought that I was strong
And you know I was just a kid
Above the sun next to us
Smoking paper to the crimson flashing bars
Like wild game
But today you blow my mind
And the smiles can last for days and
The saddest thing I've ever seen
When's it gonna end
About the life you never had
You could be the one to help me help myself
Say stop, made up
Because I never even told you
The window was open but he was gone
And the morning temper runs
When I get home, I turn off the alarm
So I want you to close your eyes
Oh that drink went down smoothly, just like the one before the last you had
So put up your fists and I'll put up mine
That you're goin' with another guy
If you start then see it through
I see the trouble in your way
Don't come around no more
That a brief taste of love is as sweet as any
This angelic child
The picture is clear
Or the kindness in the smile
Nothing can be changed
The screen light's a hidden dim
Common
On the fire a while
I would pick red, yellow & blue
Who gave who the right
And I've guessed what of me you need
Lonely hearts, troubled minds
A teenage spaceship
That's the way it goes some days
Dad, your boy is about to fall
I'm in love with you
Drive on, drive on
A dragonfly is seeing it's helped
You may see 
BABY GIRL don't cry
I never needed pain, I never needed strain
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me
Since you've been loved
My heart is darker than these oceans
Snowwhite ferocity
Would you still stand by my side
I wish I was somebody else
Some will try a trick, but you just look them in the eyes
Got one good leg 'cause the other went south
Then there's me, just love me for fun
Cracks and sailors fast and await the sun to show
With open eyes so we could see
Forget about your sorrows
I have none, I cannot live with
And so be the morning
With what they say and what they do
Let the wind blow
Everyday trying to make up for the one before
Hoping to hold a handful of sunshine
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old
We started out so brand new darling
The carrier was then refilled with ships arriving in perfect time
Will carve a thousand leaves
Sunny skies weeps in the evening
In their life, he'll be playing the part of
'Til we die this war we've achieved has allowed us to win
You've told me, slowly confessed your fears
There are secrets, there are secrets, there are secrets
Water may stop warmth, this do not forget
Homebird sing
Got dirt on your face
I didn't really know what to call you, you didn't know me at all
The hits of sunshine, the hits of goldmine
Cold as a windchill
They have faces
I've been avoiding commitment
The juice pouring well over
How can you love me then just leave me behind
There are very many places
Haul away from here 
As your eyes roared with light
With her indigo eyes
Tore up my picture from it's frame,
Collect all your things 'cause it's home time
You better mean what you say
I'll see your face in every cloud 
Du bist das schönste auf der Welt
I get high on you baby
Ricevo il tuo contrordine speciale
And they wonder why you're so angry
Oh, don't stop, you've got to shake your waist
Far worthier lines in silence of thy state
That you would come back home when I call
If the stars say that you can not love me
'Cause I will be gone
Where the stifling heat overpowers the air conditioning
You're like a star that dies
A girl arose that had red mournful lips
I can remember the little things that always made you smile
It's wonderful, no it's wonderful with you 
If I could now I'd freeze time
When you tell me that I'm the last one
It's passed the evil line today
When the knight waits in the laurels
I think that I may want a beer
Sitting clad you're feeling wild to blame
I watch the coloured animals across the floor
Man, he left me blue
Draped in water seduced to immerse
Say you're falling apart
But your heart was always unraveling 
Now I say either way
When we're far away
You haven't beat me yet
Oh when you came back from the scene it's true, you brought a melody
He never got nothing, in death even less
Heading deeper down
Dead of the night, oh, we'll be peaceful
The world
I can'r believe the mess I've caused
He's in the sand
Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it"
Daily art was dropping lines
Sometimes that's all I need
That didn't end in tears
Perhaps my friends will see fit then to judge me
Anywhere's Amanda's dream
Dressing in silence for nothing to lose
de otros que no son yo
Salome dancing on my wall
There's no need to be so uptight, straighten
Why don't you come here and stay with me
This king among men
One more awful feeling
And mine they spy out cautiously
Make way for my girl
You've a reason and so have I, it's true
No water views but so close to the sea
Brutal beatings and name callings
Sweet talk, back clap  oh baby
No instances from time to time
Pelted on the second stair
Oohoohooh, oohoohoohoohooh
I'll hear this song that breaks my heart
Since you went away
With hair down to here, and plenty of money
You won't survive just because you're idle
Right after I'm gone
Then watch your fear just turn into relief
The attention I need is much more serious
Didn't I say it slowly
But I won't bow or take the world as you would hand it down
I feel music in your eyes
The fabulous freaks are leaving town
Chances are you've travelled too far
I miss my lovely mother
She's all right, let's me waste another song
And takes away the sense of hearing it all
Why can't I be the simply blue sky
Quiet nights and desperate love
zusammen allein
At the bar with his name on the side
The newspapers call me the state of the art
Mean Mr Mustard says he's bored
The wind changed, the first day that you came through
Peaceful nights, strangers at the door,
How many times on this merrygoround
In this broken world around you
All this hurt runs down to my fears
Things lost just lighten up your load
She says it to the dark "Don't go"
Always had a choice but I cannot be mislead like that
I know, you got alot of special things to do, with me I'm through, I know, its all right
Ti do questa notizia in conclusione
Peace in your soul
'Cause there is no time to lose
You tell me it's blue, I'm a believer
Now it's buried under sadness and guilt
Giving up on his dream to be all about his kids
Feel like things will turn out right
Shut your mouth and button your lip
And you may transcend the bad news"
That break the strongest of trees
I don't need to spin the story 
You're like Bambi on ice
As tracer fire scars the sky
And when love comes acalling
Don't hold back, my dance devotion
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine
To set light to me surprising day,
Don't turn me away
Hear the lonesome whippoorwill
Ain't that the way it always goes
I don't need you to show me
That it didn't have to be a long drive
Vaca, cadela, macaca, gazela
I got a worried and a jealous mind
Every time I try to say hello
Its all right, Its all right
But still you look down on the teenage dad on
I don't care what you're into, I'll put
Maybe this wind blowing in just came from the ocean
Mo ghaol a nochd air bhar a chuain 
I cut myself on barbed wire
I think I'll go for a ride 
Your thoughts are colder than a stone
Our hands aren't tied now
Not coming back
When we were crazy in love
When I pulled it down, it settled on the ground
Did the boys all tease you
The story with no ending
In my skin
I'm a traveler  with one last mile my journey is complete
fand es wieder zu uns zurück
I might as well stand in front of a bullet
Hey little bird  hey little bird
I was never gonna let you
If you could hear me you'd do something
From this shore a stone
You can sin or spend the night all alone
When I got scared you were by my side
Blood on my hands
I stood close enough to hear you say,
I can feel that it's real
But heaven knows I know
Should you forget
Of all the parts of life that she made
I think of her tonight
Langsam mehren sich die Tage
Lifting to the air the floating world,
Move How I move
I slowly open my eyes
The love I hold is older than the sky we lay under
It's terrific hate you day after day more
They got fooled
Have fun you happy people
You are all in my dreams
Her eyes were reflections of eyes
Didn't know what to say
There is a son who
And yet the game
Be loved in return to the end of your days
And you find yourself with no one left to lose
As everything falls on me
On a blade of grass
True love in your heart
I told you that I love you
Wipe the sleep from your eyes
All my moments made of stone
I've kissed your lips and held your head
Poor boy
We work late and I pretend that I don't notice when you're next to me
That this is the thing you do to me
This wasted time on you has left me shaking in waiting
Tears in my eyes,
My, my, my how the brave men do die
Amy, please don't go
I've fallen quite hard over over you
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Why does she fly alone
Don't worry 'bout a thing
And the rain wash the pain
Doing our best, no need to hurry
It's all just a game
All of my life I was in hiding
The pressure to keep it real
No momento em que eu queria ver 
Keep watching over Durin's sons
Don't give the game away
| Di care Di care
It is so pure I can arrive without the fear of seeing my eyes
Open up your mind
los rayos, los árboles son
Far away, so far
My life gets brighter by the day
I'm so excited its knocking down your door
To England where my heart lies
Pela janela aberta
And then leave me alone
I try to believe in anyone look at the state I'm in
For a thousand reasons that I know
She said " I can't believe I've found
But we climbed them so that we could be free
All the lights look green
And You are the Savior and
I'm not gonna wait for you tonight
When the moon takes shape and I dose off, on your shoulders
And now he'll go home to his wife for tea
Dear unlock the door
No sign of a friend of mine
To keep it in the hot lane, I don't care about no scenery
Well if you're not married, say your lover's name
Going back to Paris on the train
Never make an exception 
There's something in your eyes I see
Give them sunshine tomorrow
Growing colder
This time yea yea yea
And if there's demons
My love, wherever you are
I'm on my knees can you see me now
Smile, please smile
Ella lo lleva a pasear y él va dando las gracias
Maybe it's time
Et landskap som våkner
Yeah see this jus st period but we got alot more ta learn throughout tha night
My head is numb, 
Loving you makes the whole world change
And some endure
On the dark side of town
With a good lovin' smile that's yours until the end
diz tranc ist iuwer beider tôt
Never wore Sunday shoes
Show me the way
And nobody's laughing anymore
Oh, in your arms safe from the storms
What day
"Don't go," she says, but he's sleeping
The ground beneath you
Toasted cob, mustard where we were going I bent, reached
Sleep in my bed, there's a design
Maybe I'll write this out or maybe I still look down
When it all comes down to a sunrise on the East side
As I take it all in the altitude has an effect on my skin
So I turn myself back to you
I'd slip my hand
Slept on the bad side of town
Keep your face near the earth and your heart beat high
I'm running
On anything these days
God bless my family's keen gaze,
And I drop my knees with all this beauty here
The wrong arms
y te llevaste el amor
Only I'm having trouble you see, because he's old and dying
Can we keep afloat until its back round until it comes again
See many men it will take to survice
And You won't need to stay, but you might lose your strength
A heavenly breeze, kiss in the trees
With no air to sing
I keep one in my wallet
Don't pull your eyes off the ground 
So I woke up my brother lying next to me
And the song I was writing is left undone
C'mon now, people, c'mon and slide with me
The target was your heart in the beginning
With an umbrella full of holes overtop my head and
They make me look so clever
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home
Until now, I knew this of myself
Goes street to street to street
And the view is much nicer from the sky
I would throw in flowers and branches
Tomorrow will come
Man my code name, they called me chef boy r 
You can trust and love again
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart
Who's gonna make you fall in love
Is, "It's all lovely, baby"
Not afraid to fall
And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
Set our hearts ablaze,
Inside his basement
I promise to send word
That it wasn't really wasted time
Someone to guide me
Look a little closer there's no tears in her eyes
Shape my face how you want to
Just shine, shine, shine
Put your hands around my neck
NASA knows, how the pheromones, cascade
We pretend not to care for another
shteyt nisht, brider, lesht dos fayer
So if you trust what's in your heart
She's never going away
He's in love and hypnotized
And just push them aside
You're acting like a child
I light the light
We pretend not to look at the change,
och jag hoppas
They look like they gonna fight
How'd I reach this point on my own
Jesus the Mexican boy, wearing a long desert trip on his tie
Lay down your arms 
And I'm gonna stay here, indefinitely
I felt the rise and fall of your chest
The way you're juvenile
You'll never find nobody better than me
I pulled the ends out for the tie that binds
Then I got up and did it again
When there's no water to wash the burning sun from your eyes,
And I'll be there when the mourning comes
Jennifer dates a man in a sixties cover band
You're not the type they can capture, you flit like a fly catcher
You'd ought to try to live your life on earth
And we agreed that it had been a long one
Boy you wish you hadn't dialed before you wrung
Time taking time
How such a girl could dig a hole so deep
Won't you tell your dad to get off my back
She had been here a thousand times before
When you banged out the last beat on your drum
In den Bergen liegt ein Tal
Nothing so mundane 
Always needs to be mentioned
New order and Morissey
You're my guy,
Inevitable lie song
But these aren't so rigid
And please remember me as in the dream
To take your pain away
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Makin' you cry
Whose face is known in the territory
You never ever leave my mind
I don't know what I'm like but everybody says
The price has been paid with a thousand loose shoes
Waiting on my angel to come
Moving like the sunlight in the alleyways
And without a sound, without a sound
Suoneni suruillesi
Oh, just place me in a box
Now and forever
And as we opened up the door,
And it tears down my guise
Now she lies in a plush, velvet bed
I'm alright
And if you're still sore
And pour it loose through your garden
And I honestly never thought love
Because oh because
As they ask you, "Are you who you say you are"
But as you go your own way
Nothing's as it seems, you can be redeemed
It was the final thing to do
Show me a smile and
My heart feels like love
But when the booze ran out my silence left her ring hand feeling cold, cold
There are only a few things
But you snuggled to me on the ground in the winter
I only need you to be friends with me
Holding her small daughter in her arms
Come the night you're only what I want
Reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel off into parts unknown
When friends were around
Last night I heard you whisper
The sun sets in your eyes
Ghosts stand waiting in the dark
The wires all get tangled
Win me back, win me back"
And I'll tell you one thing that you should never do
With no despair
Waiting for the moment to kill me inside
If you search it out it'll make you strong
Every colour you are
Are we still nowhere
So he sits back at his desk
And my mountain's steep
That I never, never meant to break your heart
And I don't go looking for my sins you know
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Like the sand upon the shore
But driving west now, half past five
And will I ever take his name
And I'm home
The color of lights and our lives become as you
I could fly you away with me
To warm you bones in the northern snow
I thought of myself beside you
There's no way out, no way out
Oh, sweet Mary of silence
The end of an era
Watching the queens of the street
One day to the next for now it serves me very well
The water's coming round again, maybe you'll be gone by then
Just when you were calling her love that day
I come back too you
You could hold moonlight in your hands
In fronof the fading sun
But if Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
Give me your night,
Killed by an angel
And my eye on the street
But still I guess I salute you
Canyons mighty walls
A mutual friend's parents left town for a week
And hums in soft sweet undertones
ir siechen Tristanden
Fever I know you've come to take my love
You just need somebody to hold on, baby
Erwarten sie hier jenen Tag
And that makes no sense
And it's a rare seed
But the feeling does come back to you
Hey, boy, don't you get it
Another man down if you let them know
You carry me along with your load
allt det jag säger dej 
Shut down in a modern town
When wished on the morning star
Es regnet und wieder eine Nacht
Moments no one else can know
And if ya gotta go
I won't give up chasing love, son
Away away
Always trying
Someone like you around"
Sailing through the city streets
I want to make you feel beautiful
Just care what you do
I hung around there wasting my time
To beat the ambient harm
We'd lie and rest
I know you've been away, and it can break you down
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
Catch your breath
What a sound, straight through my spine bounced off of me
Everything's permitted, nothing's really true
Love one's daughter
Happy to see it says nothing about us
And knock the wind from one last urge
As close as I get to love
But it couldn't be any other way
Now some of us are weak
And I'll tell the world
We need to unplug the dams
'Cause I must remember to forget you
Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone
Pra viver só de amor
Inside out every chance I get to
Come dream with me
Hakai to souzou ga it's a regular rat race, yeah
It's a new dawn
Lino, yellow formica we didn't know
Of the way that I thought that we'd end up
My funny Valentine
And I'll come back to you
Nothing ever goes as planned, so don't take anything for granted
That never was
Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
But I forgot what we felt like
The midnight train is awinding low
There may always be
Do you know where she's gone
There's not a thing that I would change
And maybe someday we will find
Cold wind blowing
Of his doorknobs and so he thought up a brandnew trick
What is my life about
The vodka stops to quench my thirst
And her memories filled her with light
My heart was blinded by you
With sticks and glue until she breathes
I'd like to meet a human who makes it all seem clear
If anything, they feel sorry for you
Come home late,
Although it feels just like the end
Only simple truths
'Cause I know I won't ever see your eyes
So I walked into your eyes without a raincoat on 
Reach the light inside
Oh when it rained and it rained
These days I don't hear you talk so loud
You're in my heart
Because your daddy's so alone
I'm talking and talking
She said, "i don't mind
Stars will shine on you
Lives in my town
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
>From the bar to the car park
Than to say it
And I heard that you moved on
We slide down, deeper down
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear
Is she looking for
The music's true
And I'm gonna stay here indefinitely
She drinks her frappuccio from a glass and not a cup
From the corners of my room
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled too
Never failing to fight at your side
To the dream,
When I first got here
So they may have a chance
Your life is so complicated
This is something that I can feel deep in my soul, oh, oh
If I stay, well then your tears will set you free
Tell me how you close the door,
And with our song
All boastful lies, no great surprise what shit comes out of my drunken head
Sweet child of mine
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
But beyond where we should have gone
Carrying your heavy old home
And it stung my eyes, but I was too stubborn to blink and
Can't get a grip, all alone in a big white house
Why ask if you don't care
The roadside attendant nervously jokes as the angel's tires strokes his precious pavement
As to my only one
For all the world can see
When I say sometimes I'd want you dead
We've opened the door,
Super brain never scared of nothing
This time
But I know the way I feel today is out of sight
Those special things
And at the end
I don't care what you say
If you know how much it matters
I've never seen a night so long
Cracking his knuckles and back of his neck
To peg my leg and to buy my eye
Heaven sent only shells
I'm standing strong
Yellow, for the sun which shines my way
No mountain can see
Dreaming dreams and drooling on my bed
Siren fools no one but still she will sing
And all the storms you've been chasin'
No one could ever wait for you
Users always say
We are the unwritten scrolls
Somewhere distant and it's all far away
My boy MC Serch nevertheless
I built my boat from bamboo but it sunk
And I've lost my words
They don't mean anything to me
This is the sound of our days
You don't even know how to say goodbye
In the garden of love I saw
Were you on my side
Just beautiful lies
Well life, it is good, no matter how far you sink
Under a moment your eyes turned blue
Candy says she wonders why we try
You could kill a life with words
Yeah I've fallen in love and I hope that you want me
I wanted to say
For just a little death
And no one ever said it would be that easy without you
Lets drink to the memories that we shared
Feel the city inside you
I find myself alone when each day is through
And I was pretending that I was in a Galaxie  video 
Clearminded and blind
I am drunk again
Let me please know, oh oh oh
He never wanted nothing, I remember
As we are to the world but I guess you would know that
Just like the way you lost your guns
They claiming that they love me
To your heart was the only part
That was never for me to say and say
The tears will help to keep your need at bay
in deine Arme zu fallen
God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
She bared all her teeth and she moaned
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
So that's why I won't wake you where you lie
Find our ways to, find our way
One lie short of true
Don't you know I love you more than life itself
And we collapse on a road
I can see that I have kept you in the dark
But not now, maybe later
The snow came falling now
In the body of a violin
Simply 'cause our hair is long
I don't know what more I can say
I can give you, baby, what you can't get from him
You've got such a pretty smile
You're a dipper, a slider, carthorse provider
One time on the stereo
At the end of the street
All my head is full with lines
That you'll gather round when I am lowered into the ground
But as long as the veins in our arm still stand up
And it all meant something
When the fireworks in me are all wrong
Sleep tight tiger  sweet dreams till tomorrow
Somedays have no beginning
In a world, full of people
I want to come too
con mensajes de deseo
If you get lost I'm here to guide you
All of this will end
You smothered me in images of death
Wind sounds angry
And waved byebye as you slipped out of view
I just opened up my window
Gonna keep on moving on up to the higher ground
Wedding bells were just alarms
You need that buzz to come alive
You keep me wishing in the dark
Then everyone would know
True love is a fairy tale
That's the common and pleasing
Alltid förberedd för storm
It's a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
There can be only one like it
And help me realize that I won't live forever
Clareira luminosa nessa escuridão
Cause you know I believe in you
The biggest thickest ever sky
Love, I hope we can be
Everything, ain't rocket science
You fill your bedroom up with trophies
And you say that I don't have this down
But I still hung on, just hoping for my love to come around
She's got a brand new set of reasons why she can't let it go
We talk of the future
For I'll wed no man, so you must be refused;
My only source of light
And you'll be there when we are through
The shape of your elusive arms
I'm crying out for more
And hardly ever left my home
From hate to love
I had to think awhile
When all I want to do is stay inside 
If I don't do it, you know somebody else will
Oh my one, I'm so happy
You'll be hiding behind the moon
There's something I'm trying to say
Erase this world
Somewhere down the road, you're gonna find a place
You're only in your way
Can't seem to get it of the ground
The link between profound and pain
Of those hours
Swan pond, please set me free
I hope that I'll fall asleep
Like a baby, stillborn
I never wanted anything so much
I shuffle forward and then back
Und hinter Dir, da wartet keiner
Think I'll leave today, I cover it all this way
I am nothing
How scared we are tonight
y fue por ti que escribí más de cien canciones 
Nothing seems real
Every little way
O tera di care | E divano tera care
Now if I've learned anything in my years my years
I pray that the Lord my soul will take but
I'll be happy to go to the stars with you
It haunts me in my waking dream
I want to move to Kansas City
Yo, It's a white thing
Or just something we're both dreaming of
Now anything you ask me for is yours
He gets the all highlights
You toss them aside, small and damn near unbreakable
You are mine, and our stars are there before us
Someone stopped for a pickup driving one of those cars
So fall in love
And by the design they shalt not kill
And I always settle for the silhouettes
Now if all my golden moments
Did you ever have to make up your mind
Knowing that my thoughts will never leave this room
It seems ill spend my whole life
I see your stars begin to shine
And know your name
Make you believe
So I look to my Eskimo friend
They told a tale of bad goodbyes
Number nine with my head on the bar
muss sich wundervoll anhören
Show me your spot and shawty I'll show you mine I'll show you mine
Would you be my friend forever
And should I fall from grace here with you
Of its pieces on the floor
We shall be one
It's only saying goodbye
Change our name before we even took a chance
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
But it's taking forever 
The sun is out but happiness
I'm ballin', money jumpin'
Of fair grounds that shut down as you ride away
I've been walking around all day waiting
The ceiling or a roof truck, come out and steal our thunder
And I should go home for now
Keepin' the cool from coming out, yeah
But this one's slit above the knee
You know I need this now
On my way to Ireland
Sometimes, 
They say I have done
Can I just say I don't fear the light,
I think we'll be alright, I think we will survive,
Emptiness surrounds me
Love can kill people, can't it 
But you already know that because you used to dine with me
I'll prove my love
And we're fighting for words now concrete girl
It's never going to end
I swam around with the bodies in motion
A holiday in Rhode Island
To put this into words
And always love the smiling one
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
And though you say you're with me I know that it's not so 
The grass is screaming long
Children, bring your kite lines to come and summon the wind
I don't fade away, I don't fade away, unless I want to 
Controlled by just my hand
With a different house and a different name
We will raise our voices for you
And it coming down sideways,
One step at a time
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
The drying wind
I'll never get it right
Just another day
What a life we chose
The way I've come to ignore we keep colliding faces
I'd ask for the sun to never rise
Life moves on
To give all the things that you've given to me back
You are my friend
On the wall behind St Peter's
Till you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up
All he was trying to do was get away
You got to be my little man
And I sing you a song in the moonlight
They only tell you not to cry
Take a long walk out of the hindsight start anew
Through the words of heartache to the end
Maybe I fear my mirror
Steady myself for the kiss
Your card the sun
I can't run forever
So we can let the moment stay
And the weight of the breath
But all this time, I been chasin' down a lie
But her boyfriend did the shootin', judge gave a light sentence
The world is just illusion trying to change you
And I see your true colors, shining through
It was a mean to get away from this accident
But when he goes to bed
I'll always keep this secret
Would waste it, don't waste it
Oh if you find yourself amongst the lonely ones
Mojique thinks of days before Americans came
And all my earthly cares might fade away
When there's memories to be made
When this world makes you crazy
And every moment controlling me, I love the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
The place they ended Kennedy
Come on, kiss me
Why suffer back in the game
I go kicking all around
Lay down on hard and ancient stone
Suppressed by all my childish fears
The hours change so fast
I live in America with a pair of Payless shoes
It's taken mine
She said, "I'm tired of being homeless, restless"
You got to leave it alone"
Does that mean we dreamt the same dream
I want to cast some light onto her world
I have a little house*
A little run down
No reason or rhyme, by chance or design
SmithDaugherty
A dream that I could call my own
Even you are falling
Run away, run away
A room in the shadow of a funnylooking man
You changed your mind, you changed your mind
When I fall
Now he's just a mean old bastard 
I'm looking for a saw to cut the chains in half and all I want is
Over sea
And I can't deny the way that I'm feeling feeling
That college town
We could have danced all night
Now I can see the old wood hillside
For for when you need remindin'
But you've gone somewhere deeper
No I don't need you to save me
I love you four, that's more then I can afford
Search for shooting stars in the night
The stars for what they are
He calls so late tonight, it is  am
I don't like how it feels when I think of him
As we floated around in space
And I have loved you beautifully"
Before we die
We are together tonight
And as your senses dull
What in the world has come over you
Well she looks at the doors and turns
Your love is here today
When all becomes all alone
I can live with all the stupid things you do
And I won't come down for anyone
I didn't know there's only you
You gave us someplace to go
If you let it all go, it'll fall 
So warm
Found out the hard way that was powder that they were tootin'
Won't let the bastards grind me down
You're the one I like best, you retain my interest
Everything will be alright
The saints and angels all agree
Your voice calling in
And the early dawn cracks out a carpet of diamonds
Lonesome brothers
Each day is valentine's day
Don't know this place
Shine your light
There isn't anything that you can say
Your eyes aren't deceiving
Same hair, revolution, unisex, evolution
I used to dream about saving the world
But to send Your own Son
I see the light in me, searching for many years
I give you like they're falling out of me
It was dumb to hold so tight
I'm falling apart with every beat of my heart
Happiness the goddess lover
If you think you're sinking, you probably are
LA fever, made me feel alright
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Just give right in, don't try to fight
When I'm riding home at night now
Grey conquers eyes
Wave goodbye, I know that I'll believe if you spell it out for me
I can't forget
'Cause I didn't believe what I've been hearing
And I'll be your memories
It's not over  not over my friends
The closer you get, the better I feel
I did it for you
The sunset cloaks
These things are dear to me, they seem to bring you so near to me 
If I can feel you in the wind
& although I am leader of this country
I'd say" go to bed, world"
This is a warning
Hard fought for some spare time
Vejo a face luminosa do amor
Please don't be upset my darling please don't get upset
They're the ones who'll hate you
Ooh, there's a grey ocean
And sailed back to the bay
Take your time don't go running away from this
The coldest hands you've ever held
I'd like to dedicate this song to anyone who done ever lost somebody
A palavra que destrói o amor 
Look at all these people
Each time you get hurt, I don't want you to change
The towel is on the floor
Sound as if my parents had a fight,
To put the fire in her voice
And all that famous harmony of leaves,
To love
I'm a pulse wave
Now that's ok, let them stop and stare
Of the times when our hopes die
We've been talking all summer
Whatever the season I'll be around your block
There's plenty of time left tonight,
Nothing so silly 
We're still clicking like bubble wrap
And our hearts nearly stopped at the sound
Some old hotel room in Memphis
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
A strange kind of love
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you
I feel it to the bone
This life be true, don't bow your head to no one and no matter what you do
I need it more than I need myself
Isn't it time we danced the night away
I'm hoping that you'll fall in love again
But I couldn't see the light, no I couldn't see the light
Sometimes it snows in April
We'll follow the raindrops
Pay my respect to drummy as he keep time
Laugh or cry
To keep the dream alive
But suspected I would end up back here
And a clock on the wall
Oh way more than this
And even if somehow they could have shown you the place you wanted
So cold were the days when I listened to you
It was words that really stung
Maybe she should just pretend
And then from somewhere deep inside you
And sways for you
Hiding all the pieces of my broken heart
Still dancing on my own
Grown up, want onlychild attention
After all, it's always you
I'm feeling shyer
Hearts will make it easy
And I'll sing a melody
I'm alright, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright, baby, I'm alright
Crack in the hands of a stranger
I wasn't waiting
When twilight gleam is in her eyes
And they're swimming around
Bobby stands behind me, feels my pulse
Ven juntito a mí tu lengüita he de acariciar
I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils
That's when my heart would stop
How my thoughts they spin me 'round
An ancient feeling love
And a face in a glass
And now the future's wired
He's fallin' for another, found a new lover
It works for you but please 
And there's no sign of another
He kissed her head
When I get back to the city
I had turned to stone with fear,
But nothing's alright
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so look at me and listen to me because,
When all your fears rain down
That the flesh had long since left just as the people left their homes,
A walk through the fire
I surprised myself as my mouth started speaking
And we're swimming around now
I am in love with you
This morning feels like yesterday,
My eyes, my eyes
So your mouth tastes like sunshine, baby, but your eyes are all cool buried in my arms
She wants to get through to you,
Hiding out in the subway system
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
I want, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue
I just fall out of line
I want to wait until we die
Take another picture off the wall
'Cause baby I wouldn't pay no mind
You think you know what brings me down
Wore a cotton gown that blazed the night untold
And I ought to be on my way right now
Is buried down deep with the rest
And you're lookin' down the sights
Nothing won't fit under there
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
We make it worse when we don't bleed
We went beyond where we should have gone
Can you love the one that God does
I am afraid of so many things
Because before too long you'll be a memory
And never quite alone
So just cry your tears yeah
And every day is just the same
For glass lay everywhere
Täällä ilman sua ei oo mitään, ei ilman sua ei oo mitään
There's a new star, in the night sky
Said please don't follow me
And say what's on your mind
I hope we can find a way of seeing it all
You teach me how to love
Radiation from a single mind
Is this what you wanted in life
I just got to see
I squandered my cash to pay the rent
Curse you, when it's our turn, so come now wash your face
This heart of mine, you're gonna own
'Til we die we'll never be broken, we won't be denied
That's all fine for you to say, but I'm too shy to even speak
Did you understand I can't help it
To the arms of my lover
We could kill a life with words
They say we stand for nothing
If you see me, I move slow
And all the little things you do
Water's getting harder to tread
To show who's wrong from right
Darling I feel you under my body
Why do I love you
But still at least we never feel empty
In a night without day, on a road without end darling,
And please remember me at Halloween
Can't do a thing to stop me Dream, baby
To slip my mind by mistake
En un solo momento un' eternidad
Stinger night gale
Take me home
I love you one, a two, a three shoobeedoo
Less than two eyes
In some lonely little town
It's so beautiful to me, but it's nothing that I need
He's dying to get away
Likewise in your eyes that find me here
Waiting by the mailbox, by the train 
In a changing time
She comes apart in the avalanche
Didn't go to work just went to bed
What can't you spare
Like words in a letter sent
Of course I said I couldn't and of course we knew that's wrong
Someone come and take me away
I remember the good times when you loved me so
Why not smile
Lots of other worlds exist
Smile someday, smile, kid
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
Sometimes we talk all night long, we don't shut up
We're all just part of someone's elaborate plan 
And the arguments are disputed after school,
Say hello to all the apples on the ground
There's a window on earth
I was sleeeeeeahhhh
For her to open her eyes
Wind a spire survey the hours I'm secrets, secrets
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
And all your pain just turns into relief
It was written that I would love you
Her eyes were made from pieces of the moon
My neighbors are slowly glowing maroon
Take me under, undertaker
But my head won't function properly
No one can see inside of me
Hey, let me live in the sky
Order anything you see
I pray that we will stay the best of friends
Wearing all your panic inside out
If I don't make it out
Where the rivers wind through the villages
Je voudrais tellement t'empêcher
Or if you want to find somebody else that's better
They never tell you you don't need to be ashamed
And the next day
Tapping on my roof and walls
And there's no use in burning out this flame"
Everything in heaven and earth is almost right
Till the feathers all come out
And be at your door in a matter of seconds 
Arid mouth so hard to speak
It is on its way
I thought, did someone let go, or did they lose it
Thinking in our heads 
Hope for me, I hope for you,
For once in your life just let go
I do believe
I'm dyin' in the shadows of this man I've never seen
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
Fragile like a sea horse
Till my time expires
Lost in a dream
E aquele sentimento de amor eterno
Out on the freeway
When I touch you there's words on your body
They said they hadn't heard anything from you
I used to let you wear all of my clothes
I get tangled in the dark
Will you just laugh and tell me that I've got it wrong
Is it your heart
And if you need me
Proves it with his eyes closed
Let's say you found a gun;
But life is fine
And I try but it's always the same
They look so high
Take you far away
Cleaning the dream and it always makes me cry, oh my
Where tears are invisible
Do I drink my rivers, drag my feet, and drown in my dreams
And let you see my eyes
The colored birds above their running
You do two things and then they both gonna suffer
Every day is just the same
Standing alone
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
Put it away, and take care of your heart
When we're older and the memories fade
When I'm far from home
I want you back and forth
Don't you dare look out your window
Burned our faces round
'Til we die our war is the pressure, we need to unite
It's terrific how the day after day hurts
So the hinges on your windows would rust and colour
If you're far away, if you can't see my face
I told you we was gonna get more acquainted
A woman's heart is filled with passion,
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
You've gone away
I run, run, run, run, run,
Versuch sie zu umarmen
Deep in another dream
If God lent his voice to me to speak
You said it was a flash of green
I faced a star, my heart and hands
Suddenly everything has changed
I had such a night
You stop and I'm in over drive
And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world
I can't breathe, nigga
If you're all done like you said you'd be
Som ser på deg fra skyggen
Whenever I go, you stay with me,
Distant fathers, fallen warriors
When I'm left alone to my vices
But you were still swept back to me
Our lives must change
And my momma swore that she would never let herself forget
Your evening eyes, the rain outside, the way I know
We build our private rooms divine
Storm warning, feels like a heavy rain
A single furtive reason
May your soul's waters never wane
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue skies
My name is raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
They kill their lives every day
Yeah heaven is the whole of the heart
And you're really a million years old
And let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
I never trust my feelings
Amplified by the distance
You're always gettin' curious and leavin' town
There's still a path I haven't wandered
Life's too short and I feel small
"If you were here lovely Nancy I'd be willing to die"
I still have a flame gun
So tell me, how do you feel
You probably thought I had more upstairs
At least you'd have something changing you
I just need a little more time with you
Oh, the little magic that his solo brings
Wouldn't you say you were lonely
And everything's good
'Cause I can feel that it is
See the fool I'll be
Even the warriors are always great at night
Pretend life and his wishes
Wide world of sorrow
I can't leave you see back home my house is falling down
But I've lost my way
Bittersweet taste of a time and another place before
There used to be nothing in common, there used to be nothing to share
Come take me high above our time
Just shake our heads
Let go of worry and doubt and relax
That's taking place
But where's the sense in that
Have you heard it breathe
The joining of the tin man
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Are you ready, boy, for that ride
She didn't give a fuck
And kiss your face just so you know
Only love, only love
And my burden to bear is a love I can't carry anymore
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling, anything, I by that ocean
And who needs please when we've got guns
City bird, haven't you heard
I kept the photograph upon the dash
Vou me perder entre as estrelas
A world of permanent tears
Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden
I choke on the smoke as I look around the room
I'm gonna try to live my life on earth
Thoughts unsung, and songs unheard
I'm done
Once I had a man, sweet as he could be
I wouldn't make you stay
Your delay means eternal leave
Angry and runin', and not cool
I wonder if you have the same dreams too
Ooh I go home
For a while
Yeah some feelings just never go
Take the road that leads you home
Look at what you're seeing today, 
And you say that I'm weak, so show me the proof
While the angels of love protect us
This sounds a bit like goodbye
Wishing for life, gripping the light
Breathing as my body dies to get by
I call my friends and say, "Let's go into town,"
No reason or rhyme, no presence of mind
Tiger in the sea
J'ai tellement changé
Help me forget tomorrow,
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
Don't call me on the phone
Hasn't anybody told you
There's no money back guarantee on future happiness
And that's when I'll feel the sun creeping up on me
I saw three shrimps in the water
Spin the bottle steal the kiss
Luon rannanmitan valkeaa vaahtoa
On the daylight of the strings
All comes to an end
And You are the thunder and
And a cowboy tried to lasso me
The road I walked home in the rain
Keep him close to you so he'll come back to me
J'espère que vous viendrez me sécher
Discovery my certain death
You were there and I was was with you
Other Voice garbled I just wanted to call to say hi, and um, I think I might bring Marissa and Tracy up to Topeka garbled
Just trying to look right
Will I know if I stay here tomorrow
She's crazy as anyone can be,
But I let the sandcastles kill my mind
Stumble through the years, I'll make it heaven, make it hell
When I walked out in the sun
I'll be with you till we grow old
I won't fall behind
I've got your words in me
Shame on you, baby
Now, something meets boy, and something meets girl
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it from me
Burned our faces red
Steer me back to my life
Knowing that for someone you're an angel sent to save
I'm waiting for something
But if the silence takes you
He never did amount to much He Never did try hard enough
Ship to shore
And there's no more war,
So won't you hold me, touch me, and make me your woman tonight
Where they go noone knows
Trusting desire, starting to learn
I'll buy a magazine searching for your face
As if they were caught or something mmmmmm
You know they all have a lot to learn
And we'll pretend
I'm swimming round in circles
And you got yourself a new friend
Sashita no hana you 
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel
ist das Zeichen entfernt
Turning and dreaming and scared
Skip the hills and cut yourself up on runaways
I met you through a common friend
But I still miss you
And we'll release this town from the people
Offen für alles wie der Wind,
I'd give you my hand if you'd reach out and grab it,
She reassured me with an unfamilliar line
Just because you feel, hollow inside it's real
dass da was Grosses war
Pinpointing facts
A little closer than before
Make up for all their messes, I could listen to you all day
I wanna be in the rockin'est city
Hiding pain
Your ties run deep
But if I had one wish fulfilled tonight
Oh, don't cry
I cannot be your everything
That's all I need, that's all I need
The supermarket, Christmas time 
We were kicking around
Yeah right now we're gonna slow the whole dancefloor down
Confusion, all this is for the gods
When our mouths are filled with uninvited tongues of others
You're the one who took me home
It's taking place
Drinking alphabetically because the beauty's gone all sore
She sees the beauty in things we all miss
Of gold and silver tears
I don't have tears anymore
Das hat die Welt noch nicht gesehen
They're as close as family
You cannot spell it out there are no words 
A long abandoned fruit
Girl are we going down, I don't know,
Like when the houselights are dimming
One day, you come around to see the other side of things
Nibbling on the moon
I was afraid how it could hurt to leave the safety of above
We'll find our way together
Whose love is this 
I will wait for you as long as I have life
All the people you press against
And the wall won't come down
If I could catch my singing bird 
The view won't let you down
One with the shadows, the die has been cast
Our future no clearer
Play the song without the hook in the third line
And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
The life endeavor
We were swimming on the night before three days
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
I don't want anyone
A place you can't see, can't see
And it goes fast, you think of the past 
You fell in love I fell in line
She is lovesick and ever so strong
That's the way the game's structured, for real niggas to suffer
But everywhere I looked all over the city
There's always something getting through
How can you be so impartial
In the games
You're a mirror with two faces
Where will I end
Some words are just unspoken
And the sound of passing trains
Now the pigeons gather 'round my feeding hand
I loved your hair like that
Saying nothing, that's enough for me
No I never meant to break your heart
And I'm still fact, she's fiction
And everything I've been thinking of
But from him I never want to part
It's closing time, it's closing
When it's dark bring in light so you can see
And the moon begins to sing 
My true love did breathe 
Filigree of time remaining
The TV is your window pane
Come, come
"I will never again deliver bad news"
Emotion less war 
Up, up, baby There's blood on the sidewalks of this town
I'm coming home
You'll ask me to pray for rain
Caught in the undertow
It's Christmastime
Sure there must be good things left to say
I stand ashamed
Beyond my dying day
Please Mr Lostman
It's my hidden hope that you are still among them
There is part of me that's always true
You may have or hold a child
No more lies
The door of my motel room
Like shards of glass
Warm is the sun
Cracks like pavement
You are the roots that sleep beneath my feet 
Things we still believe in
Crinklycut chips, bendy fork a vague sense of direction swang open
"She'll always take you for granted"
We can live a life that's never satisfied
I can feel your heart inside of mine
The straight line
Dyed my hair with your sunny streets
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down
My man could be anyone
You pick the storm or you pick the shore
Right now it may not seem like spring at all
He can't see his way out
And then you get distracted by her older sister
Just more bloodletting and misery and tears
Went down that Georgia line
That they're gonna throw it back to you
I was shopping for a wetsuit to scuba dive,
If it wasn't for you, don't know what I'd do
But something's changed and I don't know why
Someone will fix things if you let your face dry
It's happening, the sky is shattering,
Are beautiful, ooh like a rainbow
Walked over to the window
But still we want it, oh
I'm injoy as the morning spirals open
And I wanted you to want me to stay
You live your life like a loaded gun
Eight days a week, singer's disease
The spark in my eyes is gone, somehow
Or lose faith in my dreams
And who could feel sorry for a drunkard like this
What goes in my mind, its contagious
And now the woods are burning
Stop hiding behind the door
But I hit her head and she finished her walking
What else could she feel
It happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in
If these are your prayers,
es ist geblieben nur dünner
And everything's fine
And we stayed in our Calvins
And in that perfect moment
Waiting for things that never came
Talk to me face to face
And what can I say
I just have to say, you look so goddamn good
Es regnet, begossen wird die Welt
Des Nachts kam die Liebe als Ärztin
Darling tell me what's on your mind
Just like mine
Maybe then I used to dream of someone to love
Bleibt zurück in der Vergangenheit
She gives awards to some
The sun is going down
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
On the back of a rock
Ah You, you got a beautiful reason
It's never how you feel
There could be a world
I kiss you and the sun goes down 
Some days I feel the same
Of faulty manufacturing
And he was my only joy, 
I just can't seem to get around
And as I fly away
Damn nice guy, damn nice guy
I seem to see everything you do
Loving you in the morning is a warning
Have to tell you that I love you so much these days, it's true
Watch me fall apart
And I'm missing what was pissing up the wall that I forgot
But don't you tell nobody else
It's just two of us here, or maybe just a few more
Tell me love
Our families are so far away
What are we gonna do
And they've just gotta hear it
niin kauan et sun korvat soi x
Where as a young girl I used to play a scene
And words between your head and mine
You know this ain't nothing new 
I got a heart that burns with a fever
Get your Tbone
Search through the darkest waters but
As you float upon the sparkling sands
You look outside, HATE in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
Now the ink runs to your heart
Lift me up into that privileged point of view
Strained in darkness
Speak to me with your sweet voice
Goodbye my lover
It's true, what goes around comes back, you know
To take the bitter pill
Was like a kiss upon the lips,
She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek
'Cause love is so good
Fingertips are all I have
After telling her swallowing stories
I've been cursing my god for the lack of the sun
Kept my faith from the day that you left
Strangers find the eyes, just the same
A hundred thousand words
Almost anytime
So you're in Nashville on the phone
For your eyes only
You've come a long way from the runnynosed and scruffy kid I knew
Sporting a black eye
They stretch before you come inside
But you can still be free
Goin' away
Yeah leave this city behind you
I sing a new lament
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow
Any other way
Lunch box collector loves
I was standing on the edge
Complacent
To be the stars
Consider that the terrible silence
And I ain't talking trash neither, ey
In Deinen Augen, seh ich das was mir wohl fehlt
Mein Bruder für den mein Vater nie da war
Hollow talking and hollow girl,
Am I a burden to someone
Should be precious, understand
Mine inside of it
And I can count five times off the top off my head where I sucked it in
On breezy nights like these on nights like these
In the darkest of places he gets his thrills
And you think that she must be the one
Cover your teeth, I love you
The crew of crows fly the skulls and bones
This maudlin career has come to an end
A joke when it's funny, well
Put a torch to his home
And I'm going home
I rolled a number last night and walked in my sleep
Energy spent trying to believe you're not worth it
It feels like I'm knockin' on the heaven's door
His eyes trouble more than one woman
With some James Dean in his eyes
But I know somebody who can, Twista
Glance in your eyes
Inspiration is what you are to me
Never to come to your rescue
I've never stopped trying
There's a place
It just takes time
Trey has a window into their relationship
Until it rains
The mood subsides
'Fuck the valley' fudge, my hate, my love
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice
A photo from father's aunt
I'll hang on, to the hope
Please don't let me down this time
And the howling so loud that it alone drowns out the inside of me
So I sent my wages to my home
Oh, I know it's hard but you stay with me, oh, you got a memory
No there's nothing wrong, you're learning to be strong
Only when my hands went numb 
Me with your mobile phone
Nothing
She was all of this
So I think I'd rather just go on to hell
And I'll take my clothes off, and it will be shameless
Or is it a dream
He will disappoint you if you see through his perfect smile
You gave me the kiss of my life
Deliver me, loving and caring
Find my way inside
I won't betray your trust because I'm
You set the break and set the tone
Party in the sky
How come it's always dark when you're around
I don't fade away, I don't fade away, unless I choose
Yeah, he said it was a one night stand
The fiends are just fiendin
And hum the dial tone
Then we'll have peace until we die
Too many people just can't get kissed
Oh please Lord deliver me
In the attic of my parents house
Chirping birds
My heart cries out
I'm sending this out to those
We slip underwater
Or overdosed in a star hotel
I sing as a seagull should
There are many in your life
Shine a light on my life
I guess I could waste all my time and my money
Sea foam like rainbowcoloured clouds
Smiling on the outside to cover the pain
My army of lovers
With all my words
I surrender my hands beyond my head
Brokenhearted jubilee
And you mix that wit' a little bad advice
I'll never really learn how to love you
Let me carry you beside
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind
Come out shining true all around you
Would you like to sing my song
Didn't seem so bad until I knew
Leave me when you cry
And tears like dreams can be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well Whatcha know about the Isley Brothers
There is nothing left you can say, just get me get me
We lost our place
Will you run away
What you really believe
I do things I never should do
I heard from someone you're still pretty
Maybe I'll write this up or maybe I'll leave this down
Words mean more at night
And your arms, are making little circles
I hope there's forgiveness
Well you know I'd never say it out loud
You can never reach the heighst and avoid the hurt yeah
I don't want you but I need you
Prides himself on being a man of the world
I could be home by now
Like the fire needs the air
Remember that one night on the town
I'm a backstabber lady
Thinkin' 'bout the days, oh
I hope you find the love that's true
And we're glaring like warriors
And I don't recognize anyone from the dialaview
I am a breeze in the still August air
You've stolen my heart it's true
I'm coming, please
You ever wonder what we could have been
It helps to know that you are listening
And I'm investigating other ways out
As if to see the light
Sixteen candles burn in her mind
And I believe we were friends
I recall, a time when I knew it all
I could call it many names
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
I've been walking around all day laughing
I want to learn the secret my way
Please believe me when I say
We did everything we could do
Child of mine
I'll wait for it to come down
They say that I'm not dead
As if the mayor had offered me the key
I know it wasn't meant to be
That he couldn't find a door in the morning
See me wave good, bye forever
And I'm thinking about the way things are
You once knew 
'Cause it's hard to say what you've got
The city blocks can't hold you
Snares for my hopes snares for my thoughts
But if you gotta go
Keep it coming around
I fell asleep on your cobweb
Bringt mir der Tod ewiges Leben
How I will protect, and how each day matters
Everytime
Once upon a summertime, if you recall
Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
I wanna be the one who can make you proud
Il mondo va veloce e tu vai indietro
Friends can break your heart too, and
You have been the one for me
If you think you're falling, you probably will
Dreaming comes so easily
From her mother's eye 
This woman's got some goats
It's in your stare and at your core
I wrote your name on a tree along with the days
I dream at night ha of goin' home someday
Please carry me
You've got your own homegrown philosophy
"The boys are here with me"
Flowers for the ones you loved
For shame on you
Mm, when I was quiet
Doch das Einzige was ich dabei empfinde
Tied up and changed
Meus mihi, suus cuique carus
Go catch the light in every cell
You're gonna be swept off your feet
Next thing you know
You're here just a while
And here we are in Heaven
Everything
Future in my eyes, bright
I take it back you're panicking
Guess you got my line
But you spun me around and you loved me instead
'Cause nothing,
Lay yourself in my bed again
Young lover's stand in the showroom
Ridin' something candy coated, crawling like a caterpillar
And I hear your name
How not to fear
Sometimes crazy people
Say you've kept some fire aside,
Ore di care deum deo | Ore care deum
For those tiny blunders made in yesteryear
Find a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
Yes there's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over you
Will go downtown in his car
Hope it's everything that you thought it would be
Do you want to be a friend of mine
I didn't stop to think
Oh baby you give me butterflies
I know you can't believe
An angel was sent for keeping all troubles away
Sometimes we let go of what we need
Don't you know it isn't right
And when I die
Making each day a new celebration
My darling, I need you
And it's so hard this thing I got to do
What's done is done because
Judy's staring at the sun
Fast asleep
Replace these veins
But the only thing I found was a desert
What is in this wine
Make it a rendezvous
I like to come back now and then
There's nothing new to think that hasn't been thought of before
I would do anything
A cloak before the moon
More than ten years to ignore, what they here for
In a place, in a time of our own, yeah yeah
Flooded the skies
Do you want to be a friend of
To tell you how to feel,
It's the happy things
I undressed you with my eyes I have
Should you ever fall, I'm gon' be around
You say you can't hold it together much longer
We went to his house and did some speed
And he called up down one night
I tore the dreams from my head and tossed them in the flames
I found it all but I lost my soul
I feel sick all day long
All the memories will never fade away
All summer and after fall
Of course it's long gone down, you're still hanging around
Where' we headed now
You can get just what you want
Inside his eyes
And wrestle down our souls if they would speak
Perdida num planeta abandonado
I'm with some white girls and they lovin' the coca
To learn how to dance
I know it's gonna take some time
Someday we'll all meet
'Cause two of a kind
Love is the best feeling I ever had
Why can't we just sit back and feel the love between us now
Faire une liste de trucs qui vont bien
Pakko saada aina se mitä en yleensä saa
In our hearts and in our soul
The crazy days, city lights
The many kisses on my chin
I see all those boys again
Never a time again
I lean back and let my eyes just go
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance
My memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you
Thank you, forever,
But everbody's watchin' TV
Please try harder while you can
I got a picture on the mantle piece
Look at the houses
Warped door, embassy no  ashtray we would conceal ourselves in the missing light till darkness fell I awoke, ran downstairs
I welcomed him
I'll find my own way out
I should mind if they say it can't be true
A blanket between my boney knees
And I'm thinking about the needle
Like you're still right here
I dream of all day long 
I'll make it right
And drift away in a dream
A Woman's Heart
What flies, what flies symbolize
An' all you knew
I don't even understand it
Just the way we are I guess you've seen it now
All my life there should have been
On a moonlit street
Me and Candice waking up to a heat wave
I was selfdeluded, confident and blind
When it all comes
This ain't a place to be making friends they all got agendas
That is what they call our life
Distance just makes my heart grow for you
As say that we tried
A party at all
The last song say feel afraid
Let us revisit the past
We exchanged words
Maybe I'll write this up or maybe I still look down
Empathy and sympathy are sisters,
America my way of life
Yeah everyone knows
The sun seeps through the window to see if we're still dead 
America got a thing for this gangsta' shit, they love me
And with a onetwo throw me over the bayside bridge
For a light I think I see
Like you should be loved
I wanna get lost
And 'Someone Save Temptation'
Close your eyes, wonder
Ask someone who knew me
Around the world be be ay be be ay
But it's better than sleeping by the wasteside of today
They start off cells that haven't been touched before
And life on the road,
We listened to passengers stamping old songs
I'll get the gun
Sweet suburban sky, gonna miss you if you burn
It makes me cry
It's your truth
Now if you catch my eye and you find that it runs down your leg
All he feels is emptiness from the inside
When you cut that dude with just a little mania
Feels like I'm fade away
Bleibt zurück mit ihrer Freundin
And a place to hang my head, and convince myself there is no difference
False starts that draw the shine of rage
And fell through the skies
I can hear your voice ring in the air
And if I stay lucky then my tongue will stay tied
It holds quite a lot of interest with your face down on it
You get away from me
I hope you find what you're looking for 
Floating in the vacuum with no purpose, not a one 
She's the one who made you wild
We were free to be everything we dreamed
Karenna kimi wa 
la falta de agua No le han echado asiduamente
People thought my windows
When I cry
About love
ich bin der Sklave von dem, was ich versklavt
Words are spoken
Just tell me this is not the end
And waiting in the waves
And I know in the cold light
And every city was a gift,
Whoever you think is watching you dance
I would buy you anything
Fitting on past me in the lake below
I took to the desert with your harshest words and they saved me
Who cares about me anyway
Ain't it funny child
I know it's been a while
Mojique waits for news in a quiet place
Didn't taste right
Kingdoms and lilac wine
Show me love, love, love
There's a song on the air
The dance reminds me of a life that we once knew
So maybe we should pretend we're who we want to be
I said goodbye to the river
Makes me want to give him my body
Down in silence to the ground
Not a single one will believe
Like the king of the eyesores
Why does every cent gotta be a bet
To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn
Fast when it comes to the gas
As we spend the last night on Maudlin Street
Trains across the plains
All of my lies
There is no side to choose
Father, father
Trough the door
That you will be blue
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you yeah
Puttin' on that smile again
He talked a lot about loneliness
I will hate this, but I'll still want you
C'mon
Who it was she never found in me
I wanna be an astronaut and get high
Before you came around
And how nobody wants honesty when looking at a perfect frame
And all we knew we cared
I had the boarthick wall and all that, endure pitfalls and all that, fallin'
Danger, in every corner
Maybe I want to, maybe I need to
And everybody was feeling fine
We will play on till the end
And he never speaks his heart
El perro está contento Ya no oigo el lamento
She was all in white at the foot of my bed
Suddenly everything's ruined 
A family is relying on a millie to survive
And how today it sets me down
That love is not around
Oh, there's the day, oh what a shame
You can be redeemed boys, you can be redeemed
 te regarder
Arrest your fall
Like a burgular running out on an alarm
As he dreams of a waitress with Maxwell House eyes
I'd rather believe in love
In this Sahara of sorrow
You'd laugh and run away
Always puttin' yourself last
All of us are going down and
You didn't have the decency to change those sheets
I'm crying tears of a rapper
Boys are staring and they wait for dances
O tera mi care | E divano tera care
They taught you how to feel, but you just feel numb
And I sold them all for gold
Don't stay too long, I need to hear those words you use to tell me
You are the laughing stock
Some day it will just fill you
A whole lotta give and not enough take
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is goodlookin'
And the girls they are pretty
And from the shelter of my mind
The words, they seem to roll as one
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Such a little thing, anyway
His dream is my dream, my dream is his dream
My time is the right time,
Come my liege just roll him over
Shined with everything we were living for
We fell in love I knew it had to end
I'm in my little house
Let the journey allure you to stay
We're all wondering where you are
Even though this woman tries
In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
If you want to hold your own hand going up that cliff
You want summer and I'm a Winterheart
And when blondes and beautiful are multiple
Don't looking for him lady yeah
So I'll file away all my dreams
The sky doesn't clarify
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah
I promise we'll reflect it right back at you
Out on the ocean
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
Who told you you could get on this stage
I search for something to compare you to
Mama, take these guns away from here
And you're more than I can say
Of finding a place where they're
Sometimes you don't come home at all
When it raises its head and it threatens to stay
A hollow people bound by a lack
The stewardess came back and checked on my drink 
If we don't wake up soon all we ever knew will be gone
It'd be nice to go out drinking with you
We'd all stick around if we'd all stick around
But the words just come and I write them as soon as I see them
The things I've imagined do would really quite astound you
Preachers always say
And she will be loved 
'Cause you're the fire, you're the one
Together making life
You know we've got to find a way
Cry like a child though these years make me older
My whole life too
'Cause awake is the new sleep, awake is the new sleep
Just give me, give one more chance
From a mountain of frights
Each time I'm away
So I smiled on my Nancy, 'twas I broke your heart,
There's a reason no one knows her name
Who visit me from time to time
Hey girl if you can't recall 
If we sleep together
To get to where it's at
So much more than my heart can hold,
This is the day to pay for all her pain
Oh, it rips through the sky
Look forever to remind
'Cause I'm just a stone
You wrap your curve of delight
I hope you know you'll always be
Oh please machine, let's keep this terminal clean 
I'm still living with my mom and my dad
I'm so lonesome I could cry
So take my hand your treading water 
And softly I'd kiss you and weep
Trouble ahead, but there's just no going back
You and I, we could live in peace like this, in peace like this
Did you see your broken wings just flying by
Take these guns from the street, Lord
One moment there
Along the way
The wind that cracks the leaves
Followed the trail to the wild flowers
mit Freunden die bald sterben
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Children aren't afraid to love
Encounters with police, with my hands in the air
Of imagination and too much looking back
So much to rescue so much you just can't understand
But when you step up I feel so nervous I could die
You did not choose to be this way
I'm walking away from you tonight
I've been going out of my mind
Tu eres mi amor
Do you believe that the sky is falling
I hear the drizzle of the rain
And finally now, believing
So make the best, make the best of what's given you
All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
With the new you
Different people I've found
Lies that cover up the sound
So one of these nights and about twelve o'clock
From high hopes to the ground
I don't have any words to put into your song
Do you want me caring less
We send our deepest sense to climb
Comes alive, comes alive
And though my face is smiling I'm really feeling low
And all I want to do is go home with you
Above the line of the tress,
A decorated splatter brightens the room
That there's nothing here for me
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Forgotten days are heavy hands upon my chest
And I, shiver like a child
Next time I'll try
'Cause the bad kind don't even know
And I remember there's a life 
Just a song we shared, I'll hear
Then you moved away
Because I prefer her that way
Waiting in the silence; if you won't spill your heart
I know it's gonna happen someday
And I can still see your face
You're not alone, you're not alone
A couple kids just wearing out our jeans, running
For you around
Flying Fairies
You gotta live and learn
Millions without faces, without hope and without homes
One that broke apart
Forgive me if I admit that I'd love to love you
Cold from the flame turns away
Baby, I'll be falling
I could never come to understand all the powers I had of my own
Home is filled with pain and it
Around my smile
Little things just seem to undermine her confidence in him
Until your candle burned my skin
And there's something in the flash of your arms
Slowing down the everybody get along
And you can't make it right
Would you remember me ooh
The finger of blame is pointing at me,
I got out my camera and was laughing
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
And we've danced these shoes to pieces 
And the voices are laughing
She keeps me from my sleep
From nights we don't remember
An essential child
I wish that we could face
Take a look around, sun has gone down
They love my sauce
Down by the seashore
And all my bright tomorrows belong to you
I wanna feel that way again
Yeah, yeah
You stood and let it crush you, and now we can't go back
Tension rising higher it's coming through my window
And we wouldn't mind getting lost 
But I sit and wait for you I'll wait tonight
Who has dragged you away Who's that carrying the rope
If I didn't know you, I'd rather not know
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
To the grave, to the streets, or to the jail cell
And this time we spent together
So I'll stand by all the things that I get wrong
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Never gonna stop stop, stop, stop
So we wait for morning
And this is like I have always dreamed
It's a new day
Under ice there's a world moving slow
And I'm thinking two, is better than one
And the hours go by like minutes
I am drowning in a river of my tears
You're laying waste to Halloween
And we can talk it out in the rain
I need your patience and guidance
Play me first as long as we open up our eyes
A little run down,
Back in the light
And all my senses' honesty they belong to you
A second skin
No life have I, no liberty
Hear the sounds of life grow late 
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for
Falling free into love's ocean
Essential child
And let your thoughts drain
Had blotted out man's image and his cry
What ever happened to the young man's heart
Tomorrow's coming and yesterday's gone
My desire deeply harnessed in your spine
Unfettered beast inside
To have one and one make two
Dreamed to discover a new space
It was swift, it was just another way of a miracle, but no one, nothing at all, will go for the kill
Forget about the bad times
You want to follow me tonight
I'm in love now
Go away fly away go away
So the morning light can shine on you
My love, I treasure you
Someone's gonna bring me around
And I shouldn't come by, I know
A bullet in our breath
Everything You are
Oh love, you were a sickly child
She ran until her feet refused to hold
I used to be your getaway
So tonight I sit and wait 
But I'll remember to love you
But you can't hold your man
Livin' every fantasy and ghetto girl dreams
It takes me home
A heaven of abandoned stars
All of the while I never knew
Don't want to make a rapper cry then watch what you say
The farthest thing from perfect
The joke is that we thought we were shooting a dog
Sometimes sitting still is better than to try
Weather shades drawn, either side a storm rages on
And all of the bad feelings have disappeared
Of life in The District
And that I'd climb through your window
But that's no way to live a life like yours
And then to have someone like you
But eye to eye
Asskissing, mercymissing, faithless friend
For so were her father and mother before
Surrounded by things
And put the shadows
I can clearly see your face in the crowd
And I can feel you in every single bone
Men jag behöver dig kom hit och rör om
Trocou o carro
Can't think of one
Know all of the things that make you who you are
So try to sleep with a smile
Elvis tales from Mr Woodward
I hear voices, and then the whisper comes
Now I'm suddenly aware
Warm embraces when I replace the one you had in mind
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy
And all I can say is you saved me Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
She said my pasta was delicious, bit repititious
After all, you're my wonderwall
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you run away
And the world is yours
I have searched for you
I feel it getting colder
I need to change I need to change
Well my place is inside of you
porque aun no sé cómo vivir sin tu amor 
I'll be here when you come back
They fire red warning flares
Changed my mind so much I can't even trust it
Dark pink scars
Your lips pressed to my neck
That's all I need to say
Roll away
I don't care what they think
Here I can almost live and forget you
All of the demons
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Such a long, long time
But I know one day I'll find a new light
Look up in the sky
Today I said goodbye
What's the point of this armor
That's the one thing that makes us the same
Auch wenn uns das tief verletzt
And hallelujah to the one in our bones
I can feel my death at the end of my life,
Face the morning rain
Are you just sticking with it now because it's all you've got
You were meant for amazing things
Scenes of my life
And I know when I'm older the only running gonna come
My mind or my heart
And I don't listen to a word you say
I know if I stay in and hide,
When everything fell from out your hands
He's running out of time
So take my hand
Before the song's begun
A single weed gets respect
And we are made for each other
Take your time 
Her senses explosion
I hear your voice so clear
Can you say goodbye, without ever leaving
Oh, I could write a song about the way you say goodnight
From here for good tonight
I lived a lifetime, a lifetime with you
Fat, ugly chicks in New York on the radio, saying I'm gay
I hope you never leave my side
And they're handing down my sentence now
That won't stop this drinking
Outlaw man
Sometimes I think
When I look at you
Of losing your heart
And they love each other so
Hold me in your arms tonight; Oh, now, hold me Just hold me in your arms, baby
Always scheming
What is it that has my mind so hypnotized
Once it goes away
If I call on very soul on the land, on the moon
Another hum drum grey day
One day I will be
Continue frontin, like it's nothin' while you live in denial
How in the world can I wish for this
And last time I knew
But you are not here next to me
All the shadows say
We are survivors in the night
Puede secarse mi alma;
The time of the final call
Onto soft green pastures, shopping malls, or bed
Which way they fly
The name behind the shame
Good times around the corner
There is always one addiction
I get the space in between
And came up when she started with zero
Where my days are strips of highway
You don't give that soul, no no no
I had nothing to lose but time
I've been asking for you
I can't tell where the journey will end
Son why don't you come down
Her wing beat is humming loud, is humming loud
Everybody wants to know which way to go
But I refuse to falter in what I believe or lose faith in my dreams
I've been cycling in circles 'round your empty streets
And I've not seen the night
Double feature, you will survive last forever so rest your eyes
When your faith in life is gone,
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
While all the women came and went
When all the boys are older
Without children to grow
Give give give until there's nothing else
If only I could find the words to say,
Around the world around the world
You're double rainbows
I need the rules but not the regulations
They ain't proud colors but they're true
I need your words of wisdom
Tell me how I love you wins
Goodbye my friend
Ill broke on the road 
& we'll rent a car & we'll drive upstate
I confess I've overdressed the mess I've made of my life
Repeated lightning strikes
Doing right
I don't know where we are headed for
'Til there was nothing left
Till the windows break
'Cause this  Side Where they say Shorty rhyme
Stare keep sweet and quite insane
A girl with permanent tears
You know we'll be getting some getting jiggy just for fun
Left behind everything I knew
They made it far too easy to believe
And someday I can't breathe
Where all of our precious dreams remain
But it's myself I need to blame
Not today
The feeling was there
All the fear and all the cares of the world
The way the others do
Easier to be ooh ah
We dance into the rising sun
Oh brotherman is it that you'll slow down
And they laughed at you as you packed all of your things
But sometimes a mountain can sing
Forget about the time
With all your friends she's gonna meet there she goes
The floor
When you start to fade
Life spans  years have gone
Because narcotics grow better than books
I'll always be there for you
Just wait, please wait
Some small reward
She's got shine at the surface and coal below
Pushed you aside when you entered
One day this world will be returning to this prime
No more ribbons on their door
So wipe the tears from your eyes
Everyone's hiding their tears
While looking me directly in my eyes
Who's tryin' to see in the dark, oh
Outside, under, a road
I mean madness, sickness, sadness, swaggerless back in the day
Oh and lay your flame across my fire
But you know you'd have to stay
You bring me
Well they talk of your past, yeah they said it wouldn't last
She closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
Get somebody to come, come on to you, then
And no more tears will I cry
He took her hand
When they turned all their bones, changed to stone
Dave, w "wide wide" being sung during second line by Jian and Mike
Do you notice me at all
No time to lose
A headstone on the wharf
Where it all began with all those dreams we dared
To change her life
That wallow all through life
All your sweet talking, raining over me
I felt your fall, your winter snows
Bring back the days when we were crazy in love
Ore di care deum deo | Ore care deu
There are objects of affection
Die Zeit verging, meine Gedanken wurden klarer
No drinks, no drugs, no cigarettes
Into the brave new world
Travel light, don't think twice
My love, my love, my careful love
And drive to find the show,
Spatial movement which seems to you,
Cheques are always passing through
There are others that are strapless
I know, I know, I know, I know what you'd say here
It makes you feel old,
Like way down in Pollyanna where the race runs wild
I see your face on every corner of every street
The hunter is asleep
Beyond the silver moon
Something that you find, when we unite
Backhand, role reversal
His inflatable passengers of one, two, or three
And as I breathe it in
My skin is cut, my hands are knives
You want to be by yourself and all alone
Fiery rain and Ruby's cooling sun
And the oceans shall rise and slap of the shores of mountain sides
And I understand for that you had to go
And if the sun seems grey no light
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Or is it just a waste of time
You did it so, uh, crudely, now
Lead off the big front line
Hey, I wanna crawl out of my skin
Up on the horse was a weak, foolish child
Oh the ultimate late night
We started out as lonely hearts
No other love could stem the tide
If the sky is burning
I've watched you sleeping for a while
Fall asleep in her arms
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
Décoller de mon traversin
Everyone had gone to bed
She makes her movements mysteriously
I glitrende solskin
Mother earth
Pretend that you don't care
Gets colder day by day, I miss you
If I'd been a phoenix, raise us up through embers and fly
About years that passed
But then you call me on the phone to tell me goodnight
Can't do a thing to stop me now Dreaming
Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the moon
Running from the underground
A vein that's open for the day
The glorious age of Camelot, when Guinevere was Queen
Boys of melody
I live here on my knees as I 
So we raided their liquor stash and walked down to the riverside
Go about our lives
Our only choice was to swallow pride
This wreck's got a home and a whole lot of hope
Something kept an eye on us,
Give me a warning
I never get used to this
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Polar zirkuluko amoranteak lez
The women knock upon my door in odd and even numbers
He was my chief comrade back in farmed Waterloo
The people behind us staring
One last long sigh gone
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
Move your arm in your watch To another time on the block
I can't get her out of my mind
I won't answer my phone
My hands clench the squeegee, my secular rosary
Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze
Living like a mobile spinning off its line
Der ist unendlich viel mehr wert,
I gave up married women 'cause I heard it was a sin
Blowing away all of your cares
I am not what I was
But 'til that morning, there ain't nothing can harm you
I stand on the beach
So don't look at me this way
This waterboy's wasted
Tired eyes for these 
If you need it then I want you to
We're not running out of time
Nonstop July
The kids are waiting, they've been shedding tears
How low no one would know
This kind of thing gets me down 
So fast the day go past
It turns the world around
One step away
But here on these shores
The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
Strange the way you seem
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Don't you remind me of someone
Send it in a letter
Van Liedjes die niet bestaan
You'll never be alone
Nobody can hurt me
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
Roses so red our hearts were busted open
I look around me and feel you are ever so close to me
So in truth I saved you
A worthless struggle to step back
Don't look back
I think it's winter now 'cause it's already dark
For someone with answers
For the time of day
Look at where we are 
The women will kill you for sport
I want to make much of Your love
I don't believe in
Resonating your mask or feud
She falls over
'Cause those other men are practice
Oh I clear a space in his fathers land
I never thought I'd find
Everybody hopes and waits
It was the fear of God that led me to you
What is dark like a birthmark
Father has gone
And you really didn't know
And I made them right, I made them right
See there once was a boy
I thought I'd found my place
Water falling from the sky, the sun that's breaking fills my eye, and it came without a warning now
And then I can come down to the harbour
When I drive around the bend
I mean, do you ever just get turned on
Oh you should stay in your home, in your home, in your home
So carefree
All our dirty clothes that hadn't gone into the wash
And I ain't buying on the street
You've been going out of way to agree
Haven't you noticed there is someone outside
Life is nothing but a shadow
Wanna keep on moving on up, got to stand my ground
I always hoped you'd be showin,
When you're afraid to hit the ground
And all of this fills my aching head
But now we're fresh out of heroes; now we've run dry on hope
You can't find a way to get out
It's a little one sided
I son you
Show me your colors
I wanna be the grass underneath your feet
See my scars spell out your name and, you're paralyzing me nanana
My mind in the gutter
And all I can say is you saved me 
Vor dem, was du liebst
Center the morning light when the world's so bright and high
You never cared
We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me
I can be the friend you want,
We'd ride our bikes
Oa, oa amor vida boa
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
I feel overwhelmed and still your here
They keep saying I'll survive
And in turn, we'll all fall apart with everything
Guess I'll take my chances
The otherworldly manifestations
I meant you're outta line
And everyone is beautiful
I've got two tickets left, won't you please stay with me
Send away for a perfect world
Always yours
I do not trust my senses to remember your name
I wish I could go so far away
And how do they love what they fail to deceive
So many people forgot who you were
And watch it all fall right into place
And he brings to you what he sings to you
No need to worry
River runs and takes the boats away
Burned out roman candle, calling cards
Is it so easy to pretend
Let me drink in the sea
It didn't make sense how she could commence
We're coming down to land tonight
Your love, is my sanity
There isn't anything that you can do
Across the hills in the pop art blue
I got none today, expecting none tomorrow, and tomorrow after that release the strings of nashville, and watch the songs expire
Suddenly everything's ruined
Come and lay down your heart on me
Take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
The hum of the motor gave way to
Death; portrayed by Busta Rhymes + sounds of a shovel digging + a heartbeat
Living under changing weather
SO like Nino when New Jack, I holla "cancel that bitch"
From the dialaview
He'd send the pretty ones to me
Take me back to the home
I am an outlaw, I was born an outlaw's son
There's still time 
Instead you vanished into thin air
Apples or dates on marble floors
I can't pull myself back from
It's too soon for me to forget
You've so long to get it
I want to make much of You, Jesus
Too much time spent
You've gotta help me out
And the only light to guide us
I wouldn't stop 'til I broke your heart
I got to stand here two more hours till I 
That say I love you
Flowing love but like water 
And feelings of aggression are the absence of the love drug in
Remember she is just as scared as you
Don't you turn your back on me
Go ahead and burn it down
When things become too warm make them a little wet
And we swore we'd be best friends
Floating on a sea of superiority doesn't suit you
But I know that I love you through the hole in the sky
Everyone's a stranger
I always liked rock and roll, it kinda moves me
Faith is difficult and murder them all
This love's mine yea yea yea
Though I feel it sinking further every time
'Cause I'm your baby still
I'm fast asleep now
Can't do a thing to stop me
Oh, look
Like silver screen photograph
Away
And if there's something wrong with this
To every song that brought you back
And anyway
This shit is hard
En hljóðið var ekki gott
For lookin' at you straight in the eyes
Would you be an outlaw for my love
Remember this in your heart
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
Who's starving you still
Still running 'round
Where all things make work of coming back
How do you start it over
You see the shape of things to come
'Cause they change your perfect dream
Pack up, let's fly away
He's at his bitter end
And here I am still minin' gold
Full of love and new desire
Spelling Jesus won't you please us 'cause you seem a damn nice guy
I just want to run and hide
God said to no one to do what he did
Anyway, what you gonna do about it
You're always sure, you're always right
I wanna travel the world but I, I just can't do it alone
That makes you treat me this way
You know nothing about me, I know nothing about you
But they saved lives so many times
Must have been blood on my hands
I'd sing to you just one more time
Nothing compares to what you can bring
It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
For one to hold and for want you
You want to love your life from a prison
As I surrender
Sick since six, seen 'em revolve around a small town
Break break me until I write your favorite song
Halfway to the bottom
Beside you I see myself
No, you don't owe them anything
And move
And just when you think she's that one in the world
The reflection in the mirror in your hand
And the music carries on 
But the strain was too much
It's so far, it's so far far away
When you're alone
Nothing left to fight
Now I walk for miles
See backback thenthen, if you had a car
Rookies around us, aren't you glad you found us
With the radio and the late show
Since the night he left
And seven years I will wait for him 
No one came for a long time,
Force it up from the root of pain
But I'm cold as, the wind blows
Polished up warm bullets hanging static in the air,
Are my sins, are they forgiven
I'm breathing,
There's no need for denial
Listen, we are
You left your black gloves on my table
What has yet to come
While I sit and wait for everything that I can find
Looking out at endless snow
When we're together the fire burns bright
The eyes take on a certain gaze
I used to take your breath away
Hope you're safe and sound, not alone now
Read both your sign and mine
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
I notice this vaguely
No four leaf clover
Few emotions are shown
With ain't nobody really try to find out what she feelin'
It was a strange reaction
You're the king of the game that you played
Als wollten sie entfliehen
So let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
You trouble me when I try to sleep
Under the wide, wide ocean's tide
To sleep and always be still
Rings on the water caressing your hair
Flying around
And did what others knew
Going to play with your heart
Can't believe the mess I've caused
I waited in the rain
Comfort in the night
I want to write a simple song that's so frequently sung
You're still
So when your bones are broke and you're all alone
The end of the street
I said I'm a bird in your hand so take me as I am
Quem avista a ilha do amor
Are you lonely
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I have to do this journey one more time
To fall into loving so deep
I wanna be the shops on your high street
The answer's somewhere deep in it, I'm sorry that you're feeling it
And you made me feel like a fortress
When you walk, you move like Moses
When all is said and done will you love me x
But I won't compete with you every day
Know 'bout all your hurt and fears
I know you love me most
And I wish I could leave my bones and my skin
And it will glimmer like starlight
But you're neither friend nor foe though I
White lined and tarred
If I could see you I'd take off your clothes,
Mindless bureaucracy fails, hindering government aid
Feel the future hanging In the air
I know I know you won't be mine,
I want to feel crazy in love
They lie with you when you're asleep
Retrieve the past like a prayer, bringing it back into the light
Innocent child
Our faces painted white by midnight
Why couldn't I have found a way to say
Harder now with higher speed
Along with those eyes
I won't say a word,
Lost one and all
But you know that I still love you
There's no goin' home
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
'Cause I don't need you now 
But it can't stay
Head on my shoulder, there's nothing left to say
So I'll cry and people will stop and stare
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
What d'you say
I want to be there tonight
Bid your farewell
It's your life
So I'm going island hopping again
You caused me to leave my home
Coming back to you 
Yah, She's my butterfly
I'd waste it all on you
Let's aim high, girl
Out of my way, Berlin to LA
Is make you happy
A child in a train, tristessa departs
Unrelated sounds
With the sea in our ears
And you're bending my ear
Everybody's walking over you
They won't believe me
He likes to take girls to the park
Then June came, sun shone
And oh tonight I will retire
To loving arms of my savior
Got strangled on the way
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
So we play our games
I can't do everything, but I'll do anything for you
It's something that's neverending,
I can't believe the state I'm in
Wake me up if I'm sleeping 
Didn't she promise us stars
Were you unawares
I guess he's better off than he was before,
By the time you come around
I want you to pick up the phone
It's still a war down there
A morning, so clean so pure
Hard times, let me be
Keep me safe within this room
Where time moves too slow day after day
For a little romance and company,
We all feel the need for wonder
Good times around the corner, good times around the corner
The end is closing in
We could leave this town
It was just the last straw in her hard busy day
In the powers of the earth, we wait until it rips and rips 
Now I see the termites crawling into me
Now now the winter glows
Every perfect piercing line
The moment they got me to try
It's true, so girl that's why I'm asking you, can we
To wrap my harms around 
I've got a hundred million dollar friends
You will walk away the freest man
Älä käsilläsi  Not with your hands
But every journey just leads me so far away
Die Stärksten der Stadt ergeben sich
A woman's heart is yours forever,
But I'll keep on dreaming
This close, yeah
My way home, my way home
You are too kind, much too kind
Spend the day with my angels at the beach
How I will protect and how each day matters to me
Nothing but blue skies from now on
Seeing the future
Sailing through the stars at night 'til our world is gone
Where true love never has to end
Her baby skin, her old black dress
Girl show me heart
But after each time I'm still glowin'
So come on now, come on now, child
I hope that you're lonely
How I move, how I move, how I move
Blood falls from your vision
Both a beginning and an end 
I come in peace
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
Got a new sleeping bag
So why don't we just walk along the shoreline with our silent song
And there's money on the table
Sure makes us weird falling down
No matter how hopeless
On the hour in which I die
Empty winds scrape on the soul
The hurt and pain
It's something that is out of our hands
It's easy to get scared oh
Barefoot servants, too
Everybody knows
You, you were the joy in my life
I knew you better 
Yeah we were running and how we were running
We are seeing the same thing
He got it fixed and he
Gonna love you down and show you the world the world
Can you still remember
Because if we're lucky we might see the end of the world completely
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Gathered to a redbud tree
I'm warming up
Well I could find somebody new
Far away from the Moorlough Shore
No, I'm not that kind of whore
And I failed to see your love
Beckon for the sweet, soft, summer breeze
How my dreams they spin me 'round
There's no one way to see
Din midja är smal och barmen är trind
Until the nextime with six hits of sunshine
Givers always say
If I find my name's no good
Solitude sails on a wave of forgiveness
Surrender to the tune that's flown
Tears will fade away
Not to do but ride it out
Painted us kissing in blue
A look in your eyes as they met mine
With his baby
When our day is done, we shall be one
See how my hands shake, I was raised on it like a drug
The things you'd like more of from me
It still feels like the first time
I know the answer, it's four in the morning
Julie Christie, the rumors are true
Or how your heart is wired
The world grows older every day
You count the stars reflecting in the windows
What's your name
Her morning elegance she wears
For our long and falling face,
Keep changing your mind
Holding my breath on the way home
I've never stopped feeling like family is much more than blood
C'est mon éthique, elle est plus stricte que les loubavitch
Skies stare
When you're smoking in tenfold in the morning
Gade kijan n'ape cheche demen
Really need to say, oh
It's the first time I see summer on the Westhill
Got no place to sleep it at
They come here alone and they leave in twos
Waitin at the stoplights with nowhere to go
And once again our love is real
And I have oh so many friends who talk you up like your someone new
Coming up for air
Zu der du immer wieder rennst
I don't need anyone else
Thought I'd never dare
All we want to do is have a good time
All the bedroom lights go out
'Cause you're drowning in wine
The lights that come in and out of my life,
There is no one to pull you under
Losing their sons
I don't love and I don't talk
You give and you take and take what you got
You're here just a while
Each and every day, true player way
Everything in no time at all
Step out of that life, it's nowhere near your time
To try and move
The time has come to return to Earth
Now, for a time,
And that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic
Summer's day
And I'm not the only one
Despite my fears
Call me raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
Everything ponders in the night
Now death is in my yard
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you
In this garden full of good
And for the freeway maintainers who assist our escape
Gathered up inside his mind
And the feeling I forget
Everybody wanna visit for Women, weed and weather
I can't get no relief
Those names engraved always
I would protect you from everything
And it's safer to be inside
Or mine on the back of the trolley
Zwei Stunden später, ich hört das Telefon
On the back of the bus
And things I thought I'd never do, baby, ooh baby
Forget this dusty neighborhood
And yet I feel you, looking my way
Hearing songs wishing I was able, stable
Starring out at the stars, you feel helpless and so small
Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard
Whose mother comes and she sees her and she smiles 
How can we ask for a blanket and a habitat
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
And when it's time to take them to the slaughterhouse
It's like I'm fade away
If we rewind and start again,
It's time to let go
This world may crumble into the ocean,
Six o'clock in the morning wipe the sleep from my eyes yeah
Or the weight of the seven seas
Remember where we started out
No more crying, don't shun your light, keep shining
Oh Pancho we're headin' towards our end
Another day goes on by
Love come quickly
All with the same thing to say
From a careless word that I said
I'll be at your place in ten
I said "that's fine, I was done trying to be good"
This damn machine, this damn machine, this broken head doesn't work 
River's bottom dark and blue
Why tear it all apart
My body's young
I'm in love again
And I wanted in your storm so bad
Mundo paparazzi mi amore chicka ferdy parasol
Please stay
Shine a little light
I'm the manchild
las cosas sólo son
I know you had to leave me standing
Each day ends quicker
Well not really, but anyway 
Blue eyes and wandering lips
I think I'm gettin' lost for a while
Looking at the snow and trees that grow
When I woke back up on the subway
Saints will tremble and cry for pain
With blankets made of leaves from palm trees
Do you think you can find it, yeah better than you had it better than you had it
Bleecker Street
You're looking through
But I swear by this song
WELL I guess it doesn't matter any more
His value declined when he offered his name
Sigues continuando, subiendo, continuando
Ain't gaining no ground
It feels small but I won't get sad about it
And all the special things I'd like to eat
Where no one cares
That leaves you unwell and thinking of me everyday
A tragic heartbroken human being
He was just an old friend
Try'd to picture it going dow_wow_n
To find someone who
That was Magical Max
Rain, it wets muddy roads
Remind me who I am inside
We could ride the tides
Anywhere alone
I pretend to think about my health and what's true
Waiting for the birds to come 
It's time for you to be with somebody outside
In the city only for a while 
A climbing moon upon an empty sky,
One more time to take the test to make it real
Voice 
You are the freest man
On the sea
E desaprendeu
And what if I told you I was still in love with this
Summer's blowing cold
Oh, but if I don't do it, you know somebody else will
There's no one around
He's somewhere across the border,
Through the window you looked much sweeter
Since the wreck, I know more what you need
Have come my way
Even the streets are falling
I'm biting my tongue
Wondering why
And if I knew where to begin
To let you know I'm still alive
When the song is over
But I never got to grieve you
You and me have the cherished love
Like babies want God's love
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
Pressed up on the wall
From town to town to town
Cause' I can see for miles 
You overexert the little you have left to save face
Drank in the people, then came up for air
All so battered and brought to the ground
Daylight comes and I want to go home
M'y tenir, essayer au moins
I'll never be your love for sure
Drifting round and round 
"Everybody used to think of him as
I have jettisoned
There's dirt on the sidewalk
You know I never ever believed in love, I believed one day you were gonna come along
The pressure you know I feel
Standing at your door
That ball of fire
Now is there any way back home
I'll stare into the strobe light flicker
Why it hurts worse than it did first hurt
Where it was going
Here is nothing left for me
To touch your hand
Trumpet sound
A breath of soot into her lungs
And I'm just sitting watching hoping the boys will call for me
Nights dreams come true
Of the world from your shoulders
Oh sweet Mary
His voice is heavy and deep
I'ma be the one to take her back see girl
I hate that I love you
Near there I spent my youthful days 
With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
You need a soul to find you out
I can't go back the way I came
The comfort of fireflies
Why is the Earth moving 'round the sun 
And beauty never dies
And she'll feel the burn
And save this room
Brother, if you're feeling low
Always run away
When you open your mouth, your teeth are beautifully polished
I already know nothing
'Cause my night is young
I stand where I stand
You wanted love to find you but you found it first
Another humdrum grey day
I've had you so many times 
'CAUSE I've done everything and I'm sick of tryin'
On beaches clean of sand and shell
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
I wanna make this plain
But do I really have a choice 
Here at the top of a mountain
All the little lights
I am smitten and
I'll hold you and touch you, and make you my woman,
What I know is what you know is right
Don't you call anybody else baby x
And from worrying 'bout this wasted time
From the dialaview
She's only one life away
Through the pain
When you said I'm lost, but there's still time
You came you saw you sawed her brain
I'll become what your first class said 
I'd go skating to the other side
Star crossed lovers, we do what we want to
The glistening sea runs through your hands
But I'm happy this time  
Blasted in appearance and a composite of fearful minutes
The moon is a magnet
Whispers, captured lies
One more night one more train
There's anthrax in the envelope I opened in my dream
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
But on and on from the moment I wake, to the moment I sleep 
'Cause you don't love me any more
Everyone a suitor I could miss
'Cause change can be a beautiful thing
Let the pain burn away from our heart
I bring you, and I sing you
To walk the world again
Anger steaming up your glasses, you've been holding parties all your life
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
For you were once a child of innocence
Thank you for the hours
I'm a fool for that shake in your thighs
The voices say that I should stay
The Robin's song in Winter
Everything inside of me that I won't let you see
Precious pain
All we are we'll never be
You may never see him again 
Do you know where I am right now
So be strong my little man
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for
We were as one
Don't you feel like going home
Watching the lake turn the sky into bluegreen smoke 
Leaving the central state from shallow ground
You're just like poison in my veins killing me inside
wie wir schweigend durch die Strassen gehen
With a bag full of bones
You don't have to be alone
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when
Your head tonight
Some words are best unspoken
Did you even listen when they told you to change your name
With your down and perfect heart
And what you do to me is unlike anything
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isaac, his rims still movin' so I bump a little Spinners
Seu nome é Jaqueline Misty, yeahoh
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care, if you care
When you are down
'Cause I didn't want to stay, I didn't want to stay"
Strawberry dreams and the dustfilled beams
There when the rain came and settled on your skin
And as we say so long
Come on, friend
I've never heard you cry I've never seen you whine
I wanna be the rock underneath your ground
You're the smile on my face
Gon' build that wall up to the sky
We'd rather it lit itself on fire,
'Cause they realize that my time is finally coming
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
There's always somebody to watch over me
It's okay, we're all going to end up dead and gone
She's only one step away
The weather would be so dreadful
Or perhaps he is gone with some other lover, 
I found a dream that I could speak to,
And then I knew
And it's depressing that I can't forget the tune the organist played
Put you back in and
Must I still be learning
I'mma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right
I remember you like yesterday
Cause once its gone it's just something you ain't never gonna find
All my angels made of words
When you could just stop and let go
And strike without warning
Hold the thought
Nice and easy
That I focus on the flaws of man's offcenter tenfold
We should be living like we lived that summer
Ice, Ice dripping, cold sweat
Oh yeah, take it back to the old school, let's go
Wandering over the hills unseen
Bless the day he came to be
Squeeze my eyes so tight 
Ohhh, and I'm on my way to believing
As they die alone
Hell, you know we keep talking but there's no mistaking it
Images fade but the town won't let them go
I fell in love with her longing
Any other fool would be out on the roadway,
We were about to discover what that noise was all about
And I didn't care for you
Great big place
Ride on, ride on
Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side
She was a maniac
Crooked minds
How can I love you when we're so far apart
All the stupid things we've done
Well let's go home
But it won't stop me losing
When vitality is far gone
And you can't wait to get away
Got the silver duct tape on my tray eight handle
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
This is getting old
Opened it slowly and started to read
I know you've got a lot of special things to do with me I'm through, I know, it's all right, sing along
For they don't have trees to hang upon
To my conflicted goddess
He gathers them into his palm and then he sings "Another day"
I don't try to move along
Just look over your shoulder I'll be there
Now too late I guess the real world I find
For the rain to gather
We're the lovestruck ones
I play you're song just to hear you say that
Elle a mal et tu ne reviendras pas
I feel like I'm alive
I don't care what you do 
You keep on taking your chances
Books that last a year
But I couldn't get it right, I couldn't get it right
The sun never shines
Run away from the setting sun
Visions of better times
When I say 
You were still there
This time around
It was Dallas to the library
Hidden in ice for a century
I never ever thought it otherwise
I guess I'll try again tomorrow
Backwards rolling sliding
The first thing that meets the eye
Yes, I lie crying on the ground
And if we do than I hope that it's you waiting there to meet me
Good goodnight
He saw no tears in her eyes
I've finally discovered tonight 
This day is getting older in fading light, it's beautiful
Unaware of yourself
A cold sound rustled in the trees
But in a way he gonna stay 
*Translation Let it be your will that my words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart come before you, God my rock my redeemer
Maybe I'll change
You don't know what the sound is darlin'
Everybody's been wondering where you been
Oh I could sail the world
Always not to exaggerated fights
'Cause I saw the end, before we'd begun
Her arms red and injured
I need to know when I have gone too far
I remember it was that Wednesday
There's only one way this can go 
Always seems to return that 
It's given us this wonderful wanderlust
I've fallen for your eyes
And in your bones it is so cold and sick
Am I something you despise
You make it look so good
It's a long story
I'll need you close to sing
Your head will swell
Young men that learned to do everything spiteful
Ate their complimentary shrimp cocktail
Set me free on a gentle breeze
Can't blame you dove, when the blame is mine
'Cause tomorrow, you just don't know
letras que dan placer
Everything's gonna be alright 
Weeks at a time 
But I don't mind,
Other side of the window
They'd just be misunderstood
Anyone can make it two
And we live another day
Sweet little kitten on the porch sleeps in the sun
The light is fading 
Starting to live the lies we tell ourselves
Some days her shape in the doorway
I could run forever, dear
Circling down to the grass on the ground,
Lying in my bed 
I can't stop acting my age
I dig down deep when I say I love you
Of silences keeping me awake
And you can try to search around
So I've one last thing to tell you now before I have to go
You will be in my soul you'll be in my soul, in my soul
Someday I know I'll keep myself
In blue There's changes that never stray
Bury everything you own
Time for me to accept defeat with my extra time
Driedout earth comes to life again to life again
Maybe it's time, maybe it's me
You pushed me so hard, that I feel so insane
She�s got her life living in her heart
You've opened my eyes
She in the coupe, she in the Neon 'cause she on the BS before we can start
I'm not crying
You never listen to anyone
To the place you are from
Some blood stains on your shoes
To use a word like "love"
Like I get the poetry in motion
I'm hot, I'm hell bound with these flows,
I have heard the songbird pipe his note 
And it was too late then to run and hide
Second chances are slipping off the cliffs of this defeat
Cause there was a shift in the paradigm
Breaks the scene and the colors run off
Your coming home but before you do
I promise one day I'll come back to you
Time now to spread your wings
And as you flashed your backstage pass
So don't rely on the starry skies
Like a lonely vegetable
I realize I've been unfair to you
He gives me kisses
Make the devil feel surprised
A seemingly Spanish dancer hands and heel
How many others have you drowned
You are the one who came to stay
With me all the time
You ain't got nothing but bad, bad luck
Face the morning sun
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals
Well, she offered you this to do as you pleased
My memory dies
My face is framed by the blanket of night
Who wouldn't sing for love
Ist jeder Club die Manege
He's my sun, he makes me shine
To come around again
In the morning when we're through
Virginia moon
I won't give up my love so that fate can have its way
I need a knack for keepin' out of trouble
If I would believe I don't need
As I'll be their friend"
Something inside you never knew
There are things I will not do
From the vision come the people
I rarely ever hold a job, I never finish my work
When she tells lies
The only thing I want to believe
And don't it feel all right, and don't it feel so nice
For the rest of my life
Sweet music in my ears
She winks and grins and 'Merry Christmas, friend' 
Knowing that you'll always be
You are gone
Linked like dog to man
Well put your foot down my brother
Can you believe It's much better
And it takes a road to go nowhere
I wished your love away
Then run after make castles in the snow
And there's a hope
You've found a new guy
We were grateful for they both did their best,
I wanna feel that love with you
And let your mind go
I'm sorry if I smothered you
Because truth this time is an ugly child,
Yeah, staying around here late at night
But, we all pump the same red blood into our veins
And like a lovesick lenanshee
Return the words, the looks
O verite um calis oteru | Careum deum calis potere
Nothing is so easy
Cold wet floor
And too many moonlight kisses
Now boy, just use your charm,
It's the sound of my tears falling
Where I saw "I love you" all over the place
And keep my arms open wide
Je t'ai montré mon arrièretrain
They get close in each other's strings
I know it's going away
You're now a part of me
Spend my love, heart broke
And two times two is chicken,
Now in a hurry, running up urgent
We nibble and jest about things that drain and the taste of lust and
Adeus, adeus ,adeus meu grande amor
But in the morning after the night I fall in love with the light
What I need is to get away
It's not here to stay
And spending weekends on the beach
I've looked in the attic, the cellar and hall
And beautifully she sank as up river was the bank
Is there something I didn't grasp
Has made the lovers blind
Are your thoughts results of static cling Go your own way
That's why I know you are the one x
And when I needed a friend you were always there to lift me up
A star stands still above while Brooklyn blurs below
I must return to my body
Tonight, the magic has begun,
Then please don't pick me up
And nobody knows the trouble we're in
So come on up
The wayward days are gone
I'm your lover
See her walking down the street there she goes
Pass it like you just don't care
Lost my heart in its recipe
And the naked bone of an echo says
But I hear it loud when you fall in the deep and I'll always find you
And you tell me, you tell me not to cry
Is there anything I can do, baby
I can't relate to my predicament
I love her
You come home late and you come home early
They've got the lights down now
You will come back home when I call
And I knew somehow when you looked up and over me
He crawls like a rat inside her spine
Your mouth should be working for me
Take a look around now, yeah
Remember the words of my life
But you know I would never waste those words
Our hands are in the branches
Never tells how it feels
It was just mean't to be
So crawl inside my head with me,
Tired of walking on my feet
Every mile for ten thousand miles
I'm face to face with my insides
Avoir l'air d'aller plutôt bien
Between now and those days
The last bus I missed to Maudlin Street
It's common knowledge that you've been dead for a while
'Cause it's the final thing to do, now
I'm racing time for you
You warned us If you came back and we still on the corners,
As a wish and he's all mine
De ställer för många frågor och jag, jag bidrar inte med nån
The apple falls
What did I see
Remember the song that played
His mind around geography
Oh, but now is not the time to face his shame
He said my name
And if there's a taste in this life more inviting
To search and roam around
Yeah yeah
All your sisters wanna fly
She said, "I love that Irish lad, 
Oh, let me be the one to come alone
Sky bends, the moon's dress' slung low, slung low
So I guess it's all good cause it kept me alive
Don't run with me
And I'll do my best to make it better
Aš lieku be ginklo
And where are the stars
Cobblestone and dusty feet
Lookin' for some hope
Waiting on the world to change
You are like a flower
Let me remind you
Paperclips, melody
With your smile
I know there's someone
Il faut oublier
You know I feel the same
Perché domani sarà un giorno lungo e senza parole
Are you thinking similar things
But you're staying overnight,
The wave that crashes
Maybe I didn't realize
When it came time to dance
And I hope that it would be less tougher
Rolling out of the blue like a storm,
Ich glaube fest, dass Du's alleine schaffst
She danced like ninetytwo hundred songs back to back
cuando llegaba a mi el amor de mi vida,
Sing me to sleep
You know I'm afraid, gettin' my act on
Because that's all you've got
"I love you"
That help you out of your shell"
On Maudlin Street
All of the drugs, she takes at night,
It's you and me up against this whole wide world
Of whatever room I can
Gone gone gone in a dying meadow
Before the heavens crack open
I'm feeling rage of a hurricane
And everyone is blonde
Then you can kiss me and say that it's too soon
No one around
The people are pickles for sure
In the last strings of sunlight, a Brigitte Bardot
The automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
Fake a smile
If I made you blue, I've had heartaches too
Cheap lovers make expensive wives
Of the white collar kind but just as ferocious
I've heard them calling my name
Slows your mind mind mind
We waltzed down a moonlit boulevard
Just come inside where it's okay
But a time will come when these numbers have all ended
You've lost the wisdom deep inside
I'll try to dream of you
Everything I've learned I have forgotten
That shines brightly
I wanna hear the humming of the sun
And I don't know if it's the cold intentionslide
Stay there soft and blue
And kisses 
And the melody's so plain
Look around, wonder why
Forgive me, I've created a monster
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
So what am I gonna do with my time
There were a million stars at North Point,
Watching all the memories fade
We'll open our eyes
I've sold all my gold
But I how I miss your voice
Drinking the man in the box
 a bravé l'espace
Now he looks around his place and anyways,
She'll disappear before the night ends
Weaving tapestries over your eyes to prepare the landscapes for disaster
I'd like to bring a little light
You dance like you've got
I really didn't care if the journey took all day
It's  , someone calls your name
Under your dresser
I'm listening carefully
There's so many things that I can do
And then if you continue you will end up in Virginia
This is where I build my home
I was wrong, I will cry, I will love you to the day I die
Will you wait for me All I wonder
That his whole life just changed
And there's no place to lay the blame
You say I'm not sorry that
You live your life like a page
I can't breathe
My heart's like lead, 
For something you ain't never gonna find
You had movement out of my sight
With hopes of better days to come
Pray to God that I live in the sky
Cross your fingers and dream on
Lest I might go away 
I promise I'll reflect it right back at you
Karma payment plan
You can talk to angels
Don't you see 'Fuck the valley' fudge, it's my hate, my love
Kickin' the door,
Does the pain outweigh the blessing
Lately I can't be happy for no one
One thing is constant that I'll BE HERE for you
Ma dove è finito il tuo amore
And everything's bitter like sweet things should be
Oil and water, lust and sympathy
Still you got something to say
I'll track you on the radio, and
Looking back to all those moments that we shared
I find I'm on your street, dear
rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
And fills up with light
Everyone's a writer
Send our spirits soaring
Keep your eyes open wide and beware of the sharks,
You're nothing
Throne of needles
All the time of finding ways to make things fall in line
And you dream about tomorrow
Show me your colors, show me your rainbow
And it goes fast, you think of the past 
How you ever gonna pick up the pieces
In the sweetness of the dawn
I fly the cross of the blue factory flame
Looking at your mermaid friend
Now my empty arms are of no use
In a playground I would chase you
And keep your arms open wide
You know how this shit goes
For news that you weren't getting better
Beginning to wind down
Your sound is sweet, the mosquito sweep 
And may we all be brave
I wanna thank y'all for coming to see the preacher's son tonight thank you
Forgetting ain't easy
I'll be waiting outside till you're ready to go
All the cracks you see can be repaired
Listen to the rain fallin' day by day
But you can't stand and wait on a miracle
Can't you see, there's a part of me that's brand new
Theories fly about
There's a song beneath the earth
Out of time and out of tune
For now it's home
When you'll be willing to sell, your body for one precious taste, then all is left to waste
They're searching for the stars they couldn't find
I'm ready for a ride
We see your heartbeat in a cup of tea
I am the sun in the flame
Makes me round, D sound, push it down, move it around
Go off to school and don't come back
I know that I am like the rain
She holds a key to the room down there
Your mother is drunk as all
Two riders were approaching
Follow the mountains
As a girl can be 
To satisfy you is my mission and a bed is all we need
And I love the lies you've told to me
The price that we pay
You looked so grand wearing wings
You're my silent angel
So why am I ten feet under and upside down
Dad is the moonlight
Tell all my friends
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Mean Mr Mustard says don't be
She said, "Your beard is woven of heartache
And months on end go by, in a single week
I seen more places than I can name
Shadows scatter without a fire
Deride me not, thought I seem petulant
You're overcome, but NASA is on your side
Are you dreaming me
Gleam and resonate just like the gates
Imagine if the life that you thought you shared wasn't really there
Oh I'm so scared
Intersection city coming
Gonna go out walking in the morning light
Hey little bird  hey little bird
Almost blue
Keep the nightmares out,
Throw open your purse until you're crying for mercy
And I will get lost into your eyes
I slipped away last night
What's more than subtle in these lines
Men du skriver ord som mord i handen
Almost doing things we used to do
If you set yourself up to fall down
Lost boy
I'm gonna sex educate you, sex educate you and make you fall in love sex educate you
Her clock is stuck on late, got a first name basis at Eleven
Of things left unsaid
Softly sway, or have you lost your way
Be my island
Climbing until they find the rooftop don't stop until the icepicks
I want to leave them tomorrow
And watch the water as it rose
Beat me in the kitchen, and I'll beat you in the hall
And I hear my name
The birds have no heads when you come around
Bite down deep breaths
Of growing old with someone
Spouting heavy moonlight
Everything I feel is here
How could you be so Dr Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
For lovin' what was you
The closer you get, better I feel
That I've always been the one who must go
Reminding me I still had life
"Follow your heart", he said 
And their colors create my mood
I've been walkin' around tryin' to figure out
There's still a coat 
Tomorrow we'll be watching a sad sea and star bound, sailing the wind
That you were leaving, absolutely, since the very first day we met
She shakes her face so fiercely that all her features go
Cause lately you seem less sure of this thing
I just want to say "Hi"
I can't get insured for the state I'm in
I'd like to meet a space man, who's got it going on
So allow me indulge your mind with these words
We say no, no no no
Oh how we'd fly until we hit the ground
I will never know the names
Let the moon glow
Now it's time to move on
Like a shroud, it covers Bleecker Street
I still have a couple more years
I spend my days beneath a perspex dome
I dreamt that you were by my side
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
To make them go away
I know I got issues
I want to touch you but there's history
And make our hearts as perfect as new
A full grown man
I just lay there like a rock
And her brand new gear
I slept inside the piano till the rain was gone
You ain't got time to settle down
Waking to these sounds again
Like all your loved ones played the best part of their role
And wonder why you fade
Yeah, I'll make a wish for you
Don't try to wake me in the morning
But I'll tell you anyway, about the girl who came to stay
Our eyes are in the branches
Don't be a toy on the back of a magazine, don't, don't be a toy, on the back of a magazine, there's a caricature no one reads
Like my brother, the wren and I
If you take all the sugar you will end up in the sulphur
Fell with a silence
If a gentle rivulet of flame
For several years now
I heard about your story through the years
Beat until they die
Are we on our side
Baby crying kept us up all night
Say my name
Yes, we gotta be seen to be playing the game
We haunt living dreams
John, you gotta get out and get back to me
And takes the depth away
I wanna get lost with you
You're still here in my heart
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to keep her dreaming
No understanding
I touch the face of my own age
Wanting love can make one do,
We are heading down
It's a place that's not so far
'Cause I need to
Play the song without the rhyme scheme
In Baltimore, the freezing cold, 
We spoke of dreams that came to us
And I won't betray the things that I hide
The hell I've a lot to pay
Kaster du ingen skygge
Talks to nothing falls apart
Our life begins
In the mildness of the spring
Forget about the coffee
Oh, truly I do love you
And all I've said was just instead of
And everything will be fine
Revel in the songs that he sings
To search through books and records
We'd fall asleep by the big blue sea
It's affection always,
Void of all the anger and the fear
It was a dream I had
And I've been driftin' on this wave so long
Don't know if I want you to understand me
die am Friedhof standen am Ende eines Lebens
Let us have some relief now
To have a better life
I wonder why she's making all that noise,
To stay inside with me
I need to touch each stone
Come ride with me on a wave that's tidal
And this is me it's my life
It's hard to believe ooh ah
With accusing fingers
We're not safe from the veil of the night
And a warm wet smell
He was black sheep and mischief and loved for his craft
The closer you get, better you see
With this medicine I get from my, my closer friends
En ehkä tiedä mitä tehdä
es ist nur der Wind,
The hazy window
Would someone take these guns away from here
Peace in your head
But I need a hand to hold on to
A love song, my darling
And you know just how I feel
My evil twin would lie and steal
'Cause I don't think I can keep this monster in
I stand at your gate
I'm doing everything
You're by my side, but are you still with me
You walked away, I felt so heavy at the start of every day
It's a free fall
You sit on the bed
That we might be alone,
And the boat is full and you can't get in
Come morning light
I want to write a song about our love
Until I'm back where I belong 
And late afternoon settles over the land
If your scared just think of me
We carved the days from the hours
You can only hold a little in your hands
Oh, the song would
Whatever happened to those lights we found
Sing a song of love to me
Get robbed and that's the part where my pistol ain't no help
From up in the sky you are kind you are wise
The moon is gone behind the clouds
The way you'd play with me like a child
Listen here, some things are meant to be
My home on the streets
You didn't lose your job to
Which do importune thee,
I've yet to break a sweat, I'll make your past regret
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
In your letter you didn't say that
No new friends, no no no
Feels like a day, still you make my heart ache
Maybe I'll forget it easily
One wild wakes through gates so sleep
Who's talking to tigers from his cafeteria tray
Hey love I am at the point of no restraint
That true romance can't be achieved these days
It's all I need and I jump over
That the fire in your heart is out
Under the waves, I know who I am
si vuorte ze handen
She took until the colors faded
There's too many
Hey, hey, little fighter girl
He always was a son of a bitch
From which true love might grow
And I may leave in time you'll see
It's so beautiful to me, it's everything I see
Slumped over like a dead man
Well, define my love, that lives within you
Sweet dreams and moonbeams
To sing you a happy tune, tomorrow
'Cause he can never love you the way that I could if you were mine
He wonders where he's at
Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Either way
Keep moving way up high
And I find peace when I'm confused
And I replied I don't think so at all
Darlin' please don't
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
Come back gimme light, come on darling shine
Last breath last scream
I could not lie
Away from me
Without you I move at random
I feel I must protect
I want your love, I still need your love Too late you changed your mind
I think I'm going back to California
And we fall asleep, under leaves of a couple of them nearby tress
We may get tossed tonight
und es zusammen zu ficken
When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf
And they can try hard to make me feel that I 
When you find yourself still living in the past
He's underneath the window, she's singing, "Hey la, my boyfriend's back
Well it's time to be wise
Into my sheltered home
Oa oa me leva pra ela
'Cause you're the one I love
Break your back to feed it
Where is the dream for which I paid dearly
I say if the futures been drawn out there's no point in living
It was born to be beastly
We got the money, we got money, we got the money now
I can't believe what's happening now
Childhood was I happy then
It's playing with my heart
I remember when you held my hand
Tear it all apart
Chikazuku owari ni 
None of it mattered
Live outside the law boys doing what to do
Even though I'm far away
They can try but they can't take that away from me
Just because
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors
To seek a further or former design
Then he'll visit your seven seas
Alone in the mirror, you look at yourself and you smile
You say that the day
Cut the baby in two
By the wonder of it all
Don't you hear any voices crying
This I'm always prone to do
For the times I feel lost
One day our generation
Standing over heads
So I can forget it easily
och hon viskar till mej
Maybe I, maybe I
In them juicy fruit jeans bumpin s
I can't pull my self back from you
I'm only safe when i'm dreaming
Going out to colour them mountains
But the moment passes as the sun moves on
The reason why is hidden in our eyes
It's all right, it's OK, because the night is just another day
Sag deinem Sohn ,dass du ihn liebst  x
All my lovely life I been waitin, hot heels anticipatin
Long after I'm gone
I'm on your side
Before we've sailed all the seas
Just call me up, because you know I'll be there
I trust that I will get what I've been hoping, waiting for
Cores, colagens, sons, emoção
I've seen the world, lit it up
See what it's like in hell
They pervert the words of god and man
And I won't go away
To see these eyes
There's nothing left, there's nothing new, there's nothing
But to hold him and say
We met the end too soon
About all the clues they got
He said it was a one night stand
I loved about you
But I couldn't look down, but I couldn't look down
True, it's all in my dreams
Giving you everything she's not giving
Dream of morning's golden light
Technicolor boys, transistor radios
I gotta really try
So I took what's mine by eternal right
And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin' me and still will be in love with me
When I walk around here drunk every night
Casper the suspicious ghost
No, they can't take this precious love I'll always have inside me
Now he's just a mean old bastard
Guarding it from anything and anyone whose harming it
I can pray everyday
Now my feet don't touch the ground 
That was my first crush; I bought my first mic
You can have the rest, you snake
Over land over sea
Oh the last night on Maudlin Street
You were flashing white light
And I could have done so many things, baby
And I won't tell the lie"
Take me, take me, home Take, take, take, take
I saw the sky break
Long distance drunk, oh yeah, oh yeah
Thinking of you and the love I got
Is it desire that I want
And then I don't feel so bad
And in the arms of a stranger 
The water moved around me
I had a dream
And it's my life
Outside the circus gathering
She brought the sunshine right in
Calling their manchild as the trouble did flow
Their dreams with falling colors
Noticing the days hurrying by
So don't give me the world today
They let him in by a backway
Nothing else matters at all
'Cause the city ain't kind
If I caused you pain, I know I'm to blame
Bela como a luz da lua
And if you start to fall, we will be there
Another day
Setting the pace of our stride
The clocks on the wall
Hope to rest upon
It would cause such surprise, it would make all of their minds electric
So we keep our voices low
Garbage in a can sticks together
Oh beautiful world of mine
Silently I fall asleep
Bits and pieces of love for you, so sweet and simple yet
Ooh feel this city define you
Fighting back with all my might
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
I'd get no blame 
Come to Drive them away
Open up till midnight
I set my chin a little higher, hope a little longer
Most are intrigued, some don't care when you come around
You should go home
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie
Thought again, of driving by, the place we meet
But at least we're not the ones carrying
This makes me wanna spin
Egal wohin man reist
You got to seek till you find
But what's to say
The sun was so hot I froze myself
You fell in love with a broken heart 
Your pointless life will end
And I would come home forever
The world is yours, the world is yours
The secrets that we keep say them in our sleep
But sometimes horizons can close their eyes
Come and let me feel it in your eyes
You'd feel my medicine's side effect 
My fingers so cold
C'est la vie quotidienne, ça se passe sous ta fenêtre, sur ta planète
They fell like sand
Grazie a te ho una barca da scrivere ho un treno da perdere
Somehow I got to get up and get over you
You are the one who forgets
But I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright
Ah, Bret Could you please move over to your right
Whatever it is you think you are,
Makes you die
The sun will shine again
Because maybe
She's the only thing you've ever seen
And I, I I don't say that you're right, no no
And the war drags on
A kitchen sink and a rocking chair
That you're on my mind
When darling you were mine, all mine
On the shores of sorrow where the waves of hope crash in
You rent a oneroom city here,
Every time she comes, she cries
So in love
Because I've always felt lost in the crowd
Backed by drums and drones
He feels the time is surely now or never more
doch wir kommen nicht voran
I want a girl who laughs for no one else
Loving you is the best thing and the worst thing in my life
And mark a place in time for every chance you took
And let the current carry us to the beginning where
Ich bin besessen von dem, was ich besitze
In a rush to see the death of the sun
I'm gunning down romance
Red silver suns in your belly
If I could share what's on my mind
And I'll wait for it to come,
Her lush eyes show surprise
You've made your mind up
Or how it was supposed to end
I hope I see you on the other side, I hope I see you on the other side
This is the price of our lies 
You know I lied, but if it makes you glad
We'll make it last forever There's something in your eyes I see
Spring appears bent and unaware
And set this whole place under water
In a purple room
Overwhelming, the bed I've tried to make so perfectly
I can depend on you to send me to any destination
Once I had a friend
Hey, tonight is your night yeah When you close your eyes,
Some say its in the stars
Peel the cover from the city
You're just throwin' it all away
Crash into merchant shores
Shake my arms, shake my head
People died and people risen everywhere
And the guns they grew louder as they made dust out of bones
I was down and calling for a place to hide
A lighter heart A lighter load
There'd be no tear to wipe from your eye
Tell the Lord, they all I got, so please don't take them from me
And they pretend that they don't see
Prayed I'd meet someone like you someday
All that shit
Masked as care
Ich leck das Salz von deiner Haut
My name is raincheck, and I don't fade away, I don't fade away
We've opened our eyes,
Our moments were chosen
Es regnet und wieder nichts getan
But nothing could be further from the truth, my love
Forgetting your existence
If there were no words
If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
And your hair smells of smoke
You'll see the ones that lost their minds into their hole
She was no , it was cold, it was blue
It was like she was a bootleg
Face the world with pain inside
Oh so much sorrow,
Forgotten and
And I think you need it too
I hope I make it through the day
I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you
There's another who looks from behind your eyes
We have to continue to dream
I feel alright, I found a place that fits tight
And I didn't know I was lost
She wants to say;
Spend your days here
But please remember me, my misery
Honk your horn, put down your windows, push yer button
Now I can see the light circle around your reflection
All the plans and moves that we made
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man
This road with my eyes closed 
Oa oa amor vida boa
"There must be some way out of here"
Yes, you gotta be seen to be playing the game
Sewn to the sky
Then you gave your heart to me
Trembling noises that come to soon
I would like to think our paths are straight
Is your heart singing out of tune
It'll leave you with nothin' to say
The way you make a mess
Getting wood for the fire
Lord grant me patience, I am burning up inside
I've watched the dreamers find their legs
My thoughts at the wrong time
You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
Of an ever older me 
I don't expect anything
Le  mai Il signait un deal, tu lui dis oui, mais
The one that I loved, used to laugh when I cried
And tunnel through earth
But you still won't understand
That "it's all we need"
For the first time in his life
Just drive for the light
Es gibt nichts, was Dich am Boden hält bei mir
Of time
Say it again Lovely So lovely to do it again
It is mine alone
Mmm, we may not know the reason why
And I am one for you
Do you think that I can't feel
And if I stay Lucky then my tongue will stay tied
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's and not one speck will remain
Some future in my eyes, bright
Here, in a world of my own
I'll love all of the hurt away
You want what's mine but you don't deserve it
Oh yeah
Loving the state that I'm in
You led my dream to the horizon,
And lay my head on your shoulder
This romance is fading
To my people in the streets
But my heart stops in a panic
Here's a place I've been before
And I'll be outside, waiting for you 
Maybe it's all right,
Forever will be the shortest time
Tonight is alive with the promise of a streetfight
Than to drown in your love and not feel your rain
A faultline rips right open
You don't see how our life was supposed to be
What's done is done to me
I knew not to start
And as I told her this story, in anguish she flew,
I'm biting my tongue
I truly understand Please, don't cry now
You press the memory, you press the memory to your heart
Notice a beautiful fire
To be perfectly candid 
Oh it makes me cry in bed"
And this sickening sky
To leave us dark with regret
Cannot understand her methods
And something is happening
There is no one left for me
I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you
Forget everything you ever learned 
E a manhã semeará outros grãos
Run, you can run, you can run
I feel cold
Oh, you changed you mind, oh, you changed your mind, you changed your mind
Ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
Or has it all been done now
Without your armor to fend off the world
Nonobody knows,
He used to say so strong unafraid to die
My options right when I walk in, jump all them Jordans
A million pieces
Many times over for everyone I know
I left her fifteen years behind
Remember love how it was the same
You called me out from the dark, and brought me into the light
"There are many here among us
In his homemade, fan blade, oneman submarine ride
It's given us, given us this wonderful wanderlust
Taking one day at a time
Sometimes x 
Come now, make your move
Restless Spirits depart
She sits late at night by the light of a candle
Call out your name
There's a love between us still but something's changed and I don't know why
Our hearts too exposed, the air too thin
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
All of the while, all of the while
I don't even need to fight 
It's even more a part of your life now that you can't touch it
Lovely Lovely, lovely
When I reach those hills, boys
'Cause I will love you for the rest of my life
And wearing her heart on her sleeve
See what I'm really looking at 
That I've been dreaming of
So take me under the floorboards; I would love to feel like wood
Painters look to sea, the colors burn out
With limp arms I can feel most of you
I get it, I get it
But as the morning rose
As it makes its home upon my face
Won't you say my name
So tell your lie to me
Sangue e algodão
Kotoba hitotsu iidasenai 
Desnuda o mineral
Into a pair of car
I get so hungry and I wish it never
Why I never walked away
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
It's not that she wasn't attractive, she was beautiful
Life is nothing but a shadow
I've dreamed of you
Just after midnight
Our father who art in heaven
Of my heart
Can't trust just anyone
All alone and bitter
Up with the fire baby Up with the fire baby
And it's funny how time
I'm just waiting in the cold, wet snow
Maybe two is better than one
You're turning into something you are not
But she'll always be the girl from yesterday 
I'll just sit for a while and sing looli, lailay
I'll find my best friend
And to my daddy that passed away
But instead we waited our whole life and I know that it's real
But it's hard to live alone
And I took his heart
I'm quite alright hiding today
Here we are in the orchestra
It's not the love and I quest the why
My eyes only see to your heart
She's got everything I need; pharmacy keys
gestapelt wie in Kartons lebt man modern 
Gone away
Gave me a card with a lady naked on the back
Emptiness fills time
Say, "Baby, I love you"
Stay for a while
Ever turns out right
And my sex life has all been plagiarized
And you said it would be funny
The streets were made for horse and cart
Lies a garden full of evil
In the mind of a madman
Are you waiting like a paranoid little boy
But I must admit it got the best of me
For the sea like navy men 
Stainless steel between the fingers, straighten
And it's crazy, like no one can save me this time
Darling kings Of the highway We will be
At the Teahouse on the Tracks
Submission for a ladder rung
My night been spent
And pedaled off alone
Business and governments just, watch as the innocent fade
You're gonna wanna have a comfortable chair
Some men call me sinner, Lord
Tell me where was you last year
Maybe someday
What makes me so badly bent
They are searching for the temple of the holy
And I hope I'll be ready when my life
The young people of the day saying, 
The morning comes
Of the loneliness I hide
Who have always been there in hard times
Well, we'll just throw it away
A beautiful angel materialised Time stood still, face to face I'm
And changed your married name
Because that heaviness will steal away your breath
Of feelings not easily made without need
You were there and I was was with you
I didn't mean it, I couldn't know
Everything you need
Just as long as you're out there bringing it in
And rounding out will come
And the morning when I first saw you
Left my family
That the order's alphabetical
The tip of the moon
You came into my life
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;
But when it comes between my sights I'll let the damage show
Fill my life with pleasure There's something in your eyes I see
'Cause Pancho were headin' towards our end
We could get lost
I tried to climb my felon home
Free from all the stress and take within my arms
There's nothing we couldn't do
All right, my brother
We gonna listen to Donny Hathaway
And the view from here is something to see
And he was only skin and bones
I'll be on your street
I tend to be
We used to get around
A shimmer in the midnight
Hoping that my voice could get it right
It meant the world to me
Oh, and when love comes acalling
Sideways rain
Tennessee morning leaves you paralyzed
Traded in for a brand new life
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more
The moon is a light bulb breaking
Where no one sees nothing
I never needed you to question what I spent
Fell from the sky, heaven replied
Estrela do oriente nesses mares do sul
I'm trying hard to forget everything I thought I knew
Will we take to come undone
If I lose track of it, help me find my way back
I take your hand
And we need to unplug these dams
Seem so unkind
Walk on the water to me
With Him we shall be forever blessed
'Cause when you're done with this world
But oh no, no I see them falling
In the corner of your eye
Let you have more than mine
The way that Tupac, Biggie,  and Jigga got it
Hear you me my friends
You ain't got one word to say
Coming round to you late at night
Put a snake on my neck and a bird on my arm
I wish I knew you
Not knowing the truth
Lifeless testimony 
The pressure will make you feel
Was befriended and was a friend 
No one's gonna reach me here
And the ceiling fan still cuts a lazy circle
I just had no idea that this would be lasting for just one single moment
All that's wrong and all that's right
Living with the price of a world of sorrow
But pass the haze, I see your pretty face
But now it is, and what to say
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
Southern trees bear strange fruit
Plus he had his family out, let's say she the eyewitness
We are at war
Something he was not looking for
Sometimes I grow so cold, my breath is an arctic wind
My soul feels so old
For the very first time
Don't pull the bag over my head 
I would give anything, anytime
A reckless night, he hears me breathe
J'espère que vous pouvez me réparer
And I hope that you don't run from me
Moved silently along the rain swept boulevard
For my ride over to your house each night
Elle a mal et toi, tu ne reviendras pas
I feel sure that they will
You know what words of love
So close your eyes
Reflecting from the glasses of passive of every page
C'mon, try
To reach the other side
I want to get there but it's just out of sight
All her children's fears
Farewell to the foggy hill
I made wine from the lilac tree
I need you
There are only pieces, pieces
Angelic child
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
I see the fire, I see the end 
Your hair with their seals
Felt the stretch of skin on bone 
O come in, come through the door,
It shines forever
You are no angel
I wish I was with you
We can hop a train to Mexico
I've looked in the chest where I thought it should be
In a little box or a little book to be understood
Window, hoping it would catch the eye
Known for that homegrown where I come from
Without a thought, without saying no
Down into the river's darkness 
You no longer keep me grounded
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Down through the years 
But there's so much time 
But it was only the start
And some people have pretty looks
One more chance before I see those innocent eyes 
Kick it but it won't go away
Someday those tears are gonna spill
Were people like us
Meet them falling through my hair
Mare undarum, Io vela
Can you tend the soil inside her
Aquele tempo que você sonhou 
And once in a while
It's easy to see right through your fingers and hide
Humans running for cover
It feels like we are falling awake
Make up a newborn colour
And my sister with her braids
I'm winding down
From the pain come the dream
If so much of me lies in your eyes
"One day I'll be as tall
It wasn't open
What have I done to my paradise
Oh, winter for sure
You know these words 
Oh, I'm faint with fear
Always diggin' up some information
Breaking into pieces
You once had a heart like a child
All those girls you love,
A crashing sky, a roaring screen
The cannonballs fly 'round my head
I know there comes a time
I was a teenage spaceship
I throw off my coat to feel this January air
Watch me fall apart
Baby, can't you see if there is such a thing
Sugar horse, lives inside
Gotta couple of merchants that I gotta meet
How can you ask about tomorrow;
Cities full of people burn and scream and shoutin' loud
When you're keeping everything inside you
Oh in your eyes there's a sadness enough to kill the both of us
Young and just doing my own thing
Baby got 'em up open all over town
When you go you are gone for good
This is our favorite song This is our favorite song
Whoop somebody ass, taking my boot out
There is Emmanuel of mothers 
At me looking at you
Let me love you
'Cause the words are dead
Look for the girl with the broken smile
People can do the most amazing of things
Everybody clings to their own fear
Talking about reaction, yeah yeah yeah
When words got me down you keep me,
Und die Sehnsucht weicht der Zeit
Ne peut rien changer
Divide the dream into the flesh
The reflections of a thousand tangled views
And may leave those memories you've gotta let them go
I believe in the way that you've touched me somehow
That years from now
It's right behind me
But things are good, I've got a lot of followers of my faith
So try to be somebody
I feel like I'm weightless
For you I've waited all these years
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
Pilgrim saints, lonely widows
Her features look just like my disguise
And this deep secret that hasn't come out yet
It's only the start
Will open your eyes, I've never known trust like the nine
y hasta perdoné tus equivocaciones 
And heaven
From where we come
Reading the future that lay in my hands
Something about the rain, it sends memories through my vains
My senses reeled
Lets start living life before we die
And they'd bring him here to me
And I bring to you, lover, when I sing to you
It's ok to cry
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
I only wanted love from you
Cracks in the hands of a stranger
Your pretty face and electric soul
He's listenin' in the fast gaze, I don't care now to see the way
Under twilight blue, starts to mesmerise
You're the kind of person that I've always wanted to be with
But I am never beaten, broken, not defeated
You are the maid for me
But still we love somehow, oh
Nothing will happen and soon you'll be back with me
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
Settle up you're calling up the pain
La señora lo lleva a todas partes con ella
Well I watched your black tied family
Sunlight beams in your hair 
Lives in your soul
I cried as if my tears
How I miss your heart
It's so cold
So for one moment in time, you'd find that you're mine
And you will find, the day when they put your soul on sale
Irrigation in a swimming hole, nationwide loved the movie
And I'm standing on ice when I say
The world on a screen 
Sometimes you'll have to do
May one day return to walk through those fields again
Yeah one day soon I'll take that drive out
I need, need, need, need, need, need, need some kicks
And people hang, on your every word
Let you fall for every empty word I say
His value declined
When life itself is making you old
Don't need prophets or preachers
And our love is a setting sun
And we'll care for making it right
Hollow moons illuminate
Don't you call anybody else baby,
Now your skin is just peeling wallpaper
Stuck between channels my thoughts all quit
Plant a seed I'm in need of a break from the fire drill
I've seen headlights passing by
But don't forget, it's just a ride
But heartache and misery
Faces change, the names they are familiar
My heart is frozen underneath
I choose to love you and never lose
To tighten the rope so that you never will forget
Weather the storm, drain running rampant, just stamp it
I will gladly carry your cross for you
Rain washed out its glow, heart beat steady leads me down below
I'm found on this early April morning
Give a damn what he done, it's my motherfuckin' fault
Where the world's ugliest boy
Let's all pray for rain Let's all pray for rain
And two lives that stoop to notice mine
And our hearts rest against the flesh
Then hold on, hold on the to the ones you love
If Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
You've got a choice, it's the toro or the toreador
The door opens into your eyes
I close my eyes and I can see His dream
Tethered with tears in their eyes
Við tölum saman á ný
"If you love her let her go
Oh, but still we want it, oh
Even though dead skin like stone makes me ugly
But You are the strength I hold onto now
Don't get me wrong, I know you've got your life in place
No, oh, there's no movement
Your face in a dream returns
You could move to a past time from the radio
Because my destination's wrong 
He was a friend mistreated, now he's dead so say you're sorry to him
Don't take, don't take, don't break my cut and paste art
It's not a sign of weakness when you're searching
I'd long for a new beginning
In love with a broken heart 
Vessels of the sea
Could I be the one
Yeah, I'm living up here where the air is thin
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
There's too many of you crying
Unless that someone was someone free like me
Everyone can see my youth
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
No words could explain, no actions determine
In search of home and heart
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
So you see you can't arrest me
The day is always so bright
Oh How could you be so heartless
I've got a symbol in my driveway
No lifelong friend
Maybe when our story's over
Something in your eyes
Fills the alleys where men sleep
Somewhere in the wasteland of your head
With thy alldimming hand,
Got woken up by birds and bees,
Of all the things I've meant, but never meant to say
The concrete girl
Mr Nothing's got a lot
In my dreams
And as he lay dying, I heard his last cry
The skies are blue, it must be tears,
A moonlight serenade
You can begin to be yourself once I am gone
I pray to God your soul to keep
And the fat man failed to get us passes
You'd ought to try to live your life on Earth
Need I say
I'm one of those
Nurse asked me what my name might be
She's something of a slut
Really all I felt was falsely strong
Each road that I walk down
I don't want anything else
Who feel that life is but a joke
So, farewell to my friend
Ist das Leben ein Traum,
I don't know why I spend my time
The mantles cracked
Heavy sunlight 
It takes some silence to make sound
Wherever you are
You told me of crashing cars
One of these days
I will keep him warm
The leaves were paths of skeletons
I feel I've lost my individuality
Cars in the distance, a bicycle bell
So life's a joke
Kind of curly hair, eyes so soft and true
A junkie's song, a dancer's knees
Though I'm drunk again
But he could see over his shoulder
Wonders if he's really lost his one joy
Today
In the mirror staring back at me
Dich wieder an Liebe, die du kennst,
That I've always been the one told to flee
And so our sun is sinking low
Searching for the stars they couldn't find
And nothing's ok
Or put all the pieces together again
Or a lover who never said goodbye
Play it girl
I've got a tight grip on reality
Fake a heart attack, you gotta get back to me
Fall x That I'm ready for the fall
And send it to somebody who's pretending to care
Farthest ends of me
Falls below my heavy breathing
All the blue blood is flowing
A kind of delight
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,
But I never felt so lonely
Caught away in clouds
They come out waiting, and I just get on and go
This love's mine
January days and their scarecrow trees
Baby, they know just what to say
The caged bird sings
E un invito all'Hotel Supramonnte dove ho visto la neve
And I am ready for you, baby, I am ready for you now
To get one last look at my baby
When we met, I felt my life begin,
Bleeding thoughts
Or maybe as sure as
"If I may make so bold"
I believe in miricles baby I'm forever yours
Laugh at every line
Like the violence in dreamdead eyes
White Iverson
I can fly
On closing doors
I guess that don't matter now
I'm on way home
I see you shivering from the cold
So I must try teaching you the wrong from right
And I can barely make a sound
But it's myself I need to blame, if you don't know
Your name used to taste so sweet
It's just you and me now honey
Every night
She waits for a new
Somebody touched me and whispered in my ear
And I went back to you
I turned them all away
I like the way you work it
Share your spoken wealth
Hanging clouds over me
'Cause there, there's a light in me
And you waste more perfect time than you tend to give
And I'm sellin 'em for  a pop god damn it
Smoking vines like cigarettes
Why do we justify these foolish who are burning
A flower unfolding behind the mirror of your eyes
But no one is coming with me
Ooh leave this city behind you
It comes to this
And debate what's truly permanent
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl
Are you needing,
You can run out of money
In a democracy of dunces with a parasite's kiss
Too bad that that's all I need
Oh, I wish you knew the deal, gotta learn from far away
Away from her, alone she'll die
Don't let them make you into something you ain't
The stars they used to drain
Ooh ooh
No broken hearts
I thought I'd be singing a different tune by now
Just to stop the alligator from getting up
I'm thoroughly wasted
Up comes the wind that makes them run for cover
Now you lay alone 
And there will be no sound
There is no such place, so perhaps we have a reason
I thought about them too much, allowed them to touch
Tell 'em niggas, man, y'all trippin' with no maps
Start off with just a spark and suddenly the room's ablaze with new ideas and sunny days
And scented lotions
I left reality early due to the lack of love, reason
Everybody knows that it really doesn't matter at all
Oh, the memories come astreamin',
And the women tug their hair
I may be gone but never out of reach
The sight that holds my eyes
Patiently you waited for a courting boy's embrace,
From way back when we were just friends
Just to find the warm bed of our lover
I only say that word for you
Free waters
Paws his inside Pea coat pocket for a welcome twentyfive cents
And I love my lonely father
I said baby
Then in the night, the sorrowing sigh
True words that I should know well
You make my day
Excuse me while I disappear
In this concrete world around you
Just think of what you'll get when you're past this
Why was I, why was I peeking
You will be rewarded if you do your very best
It's ' o' clock in the morning"
Falling down, all way down to oh, oh, love
Late on shallow evenings while their enemies slept
Oh there's values and costs in the wondering if you should
Moving in shadow
We'll make it last forever
They're looking at me, all the people to see
And then I will fill the ocean back up with my tears
And the tears come streaming down
Got broken hearts
Feel like crying
Stories I've heard like a man on the moon
You make me so hot
Dry your eyes
Nut to my dismay, it left without a trace
And I stare out this dirty window Stare out this dirty window
Pray that we make it to twentyone, one, one, one, whoa, whoa
How many years since you found yourself
You're feeling down because your head is hurting,
Gone I'll be gone
Well I know that my tomorrow's gonna be alright
Caution tape around my heart
Feel it fresh and new
High average, ball on these bastards, it makes me happy
It takes some work to make it work
I'm on my knees in the corner
Did they forget the light inside your eyes
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
So is it all right if I go
If love could've lasted forever I'd still hear her say darlin'
Down beside a river frozen brown
Till a little color comes into your face
A little time, a little time
I don't want to see you as the next in line
Won't you come and let me whisper in your ear
Bless you with love for the road that you go
Or I may be imperfectly formed in this contradiction
gehts oder gehts
Cargo trains rolling by
Where all people live in peace
Oh, father time
It's the fairies' revenge they say
Against my lips
I'm caught in the flow of things
The snow coming like a breath
Oh it always, comes back to this
Believes in me
You can't believe them
And I can't let go of your hand
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
His hallelujah child
And if you could step inside me
Will you fade away x
Now turn around and don't be sad
That make me cry
Cold ice snowing
And if the atom bomb should end us both
Which way to go
I wonder if, it looks the same inside
She was a wreck, but he loved her
Then it's over like none of it ever was real
'Cause this is the first song but definitely not the song
I feel strings without the black 'n' blues
I'm a hopeless romantic
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
Moody It's got me x 
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do Drive slow, homie
me dice que todo se ha marchitado
You cannot choose her love, oh no
And our bed and the dress that you wore
Businessmen, they drink my wine
A cherry moon a night of fun
With your voice in my head
Dean lives in London, does the music business thing
Makes him wasted
When you live in a memory
You're from the past
So we convince ourselves that we're better off gone
They want diamonds to wear
But don't you run too far away
Been holding mine but I'm just fine
Any way you stretch it
But the btch next door complained
I'm just a hazy girl
Into the sun hurl them
Something we will never see
But now I've found a way to end in my salvation
There's so much I would give ya, baby
A wind in the shadow, a whale song
I'm caught in the flow of sound
Pin my arm to the wall
Set up the day
And the sky was aflare when he came up for air
Undead audio, yes we'll be singing someday
Welcome to the lonesome world of Abel
Spiritual mothers
Don't you remind me 
Freude und Leid das ganze Jahr
To the sound of water moving
How many boys have you drowned
I'll stay inside and find a pitch that sounds right
And I will pray and then I'll cry
A sober straight face gets you out of your clothes
Ordering in all friends and lovers
Let me hold your hands
You got to let me out of here
You can read my mind, I don't have to explain why it
To live the life you choose
River's bottom dark and blue,
Mimi lives in Hamburg, that fishy harbour breeze
Und wir kennen die Stellen,
We are lost in the folds of one another's topcoats
Please talk to me, don't close the door
'Cause I've been left up in love before,
What have you done
Begging please give me some more
Everyone's at it
It was my perfect day
I'd spend a lifetime with you
uno debió perder la vergüenza hace tanto
And throw a storm of burnt flakes,
Ich mach die Augen zu, sonst ist alles zu spät
Everybody says
Putting all the clothes you washed away 
I couldn't tell right from wrong; where is this all coming from
I promise I'll wait awhile
Why does my heart go on beating
In this broken place
I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you
I'm alright only in your arms, darling
But it's so cold
You make it look so easy
Et, là, je fais le tour du monde
Feel different one morning
I never thought it would come
Spring at hand
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
There's an old flame still burns in my heart
Forgot to know how to grow
There is nothing outside our love
You don't know what you're talking about"
And there's nothing I could do without you here
When I sleep with that picture of
I was flying into Chicago at night 
If it takes all summer long
Aber was ist mit denen, die keiner kennt Wer erinnert sich an die Jener dort, ging er freiwillig auf die andere Seite War er müde Konnte er die Realität nicht mehr ertragen Vielleicht folgte er seiner Liebsten Und da, ein Kind Niemand kennt es, weiß seinen Namen Es war offensichtlich nicht gewollt Es wird nicht vermisst Es ging nicht freiwillig ins Wasser Dazu war es noch viel zu klein Auch der da, man schnitt ihm die Kehle durch, bevor man ihn in den Fluss warf Aber wo Manch einer von denen kam von weit her Man weiß nicht, wie lange er im Wasser lag Die Strömung ist stark und möglicherweise trieb er kilometerweit, ohne dass man ihn bemerkte Warum vermisst sie niemand
Und irgendwo in Holland
The ties are not undone
How could I have let you get away
On cartoons and in aeroplanes
Every step is
Shiver while you breathe in,
Or did it break you in
And I could make you understand
In times like this, we cannot say we have not been warned
In your castle all your candles drip on the pavement,
Tell me something 'bout a lonely night
Hanging there behind the trees,
See her in the arms of Paul
There's already been a flood of my tears
I'm getting sick of everything
And I'm bound for Louisiana, my own true love for to see
And everybody she knew was gonna get the twist
She made it rain
Oh, but then things changed
Gone gone gone in the deep slumber
While I find a way
I'm on fire, I'm full of love and new desire
Storm warning, he made it pretty plain
As the wind chilled my bones
Running like a river white hot with desire
Raking over the embers and what I come across
Crashing against my delirious thoughts where humanity's waiting alone
Be wilder
And what will I know when I look up to the skies
Canceling the faces that we knew
Try to push it back
Right after You're gone
Sucaru vaktra mandalam sukarna ratna kundalam
Så minns att jag står bakom dig
We can't help to watch this whole thing crash together
'Cause all the things you thought were safe, ooh now they're gone
The inside out on the open
I gathered the twine as it trailed from behind 
If we leave tonight then we leave it all behind
Faxing a paper displaying his name
The walltowalltowalltowall
As I breathe
It's so cold, under this demon's wing
Hey little one, think about our time
But something keeps me hanging on
It's such a night, such a night
Come back home
We stare across the oceans waves
The things I do just make me laugh and make me wanna drink
Now maybe I was high but it felt so right
From moments and regrets and charity laced with a lie
And there's a blessing in every moment, every mile
We always somehow managed to keep a straight line I awoke, the dog
I thought you had took all you had to take
Stood here watching my own death
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
'Cause all my life is wrapped up in today
Say hello to feelings that I detest
Through the city streets
Every kiss is a goodbye
Friends not lovers
Take the sound from my head
Dry eyes in the pouring rain, well
Has the thought of leaving ever left you
Quand la bouche engendre un mort
And I'd have danced
And though you say you're with me I know that it's not so
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Put you in a daze with Maze, fulfilling her with every temptation, slow jam, and havin' deep sex
What are we doing
Go down that road
I did it well
You wouldn't want to go home
I feel a dark cloud coming over
I won't let you squeeze right through
He took a homemade, fan blade, oneman submarine ride
You know that I love you
Sag deiner Schwester,dass du sie liebst
Lie and sleep
She passed by and said goodbye to him
I hear your voice and it quiets my mind
She's better off staying asleep
'Cause the truth is you're not alone
And have no fear
No, staring at his picture I realized
The city is a million miles away
All the good things that I've done
I told her to drive over in yo' new whip, bring some friends you cool with
Because you have nothing
When the motion fails for the very first time
No one else, yeah
Shuffle shuffle shuffle shuffle your feet without looking down
Ain't jealous of, now, now, the way you're living
Or maybe that's the reason that it hurt me so
This ghost lay in a ditch on Thursday
There's a design to what I did and said
Don't fall down my concrete girl
By something that's simple and easy and true
Well, I heard your voice in everything
And in your dreams, I'll touch your cheek
When I just wanted to stay
Can't do a thing to stop me now Oho
I was here from the start
Some days have no end
Small Instrumental Break
All the things you love
Another shot of something, warm to numb the pain
And she had something to say
But the feeling will come back again again
To cradle back into slow motion 'cause it's all moving too fast
No no, it's a negotiable term
Your hands protect your eyes
Closer and closer 
To never move, to never chase
Amanda said, "It's time to go"
This pain is just too real
I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do
Under the wintery moon
Saw me just come up with anger
I don't get it
We got the money, we got money, we got the money
You held your face
And all your words are misunderstood
Your table and your skin
I've seen it hide away
All I want is your love
When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
Imagine if the friend that you thought you knew wasn't really true
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Will you just tell me please what the fuck is going on
In that when you look you make lists
Doesn't seem like anything you're saying or doing or doing
For the days gone by
When people say you're dead
I'm here to lay you to rest once and for all coughing
One thing you must know
She falls apart in the avalanche
In your hands
Everything I think I need here on the ground
It's not that we don't care
Is it love
Never goes away
And It takes some fears to make you trust
With your ladylike ways
Have to say, your home's where you make it
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks
And that was then and she is now, I once was lost with her
Your sister and me will keep your place clean
And as I watch the drops of rain
In situations it can be so bright
For that plane ride 
And ask that you stop
It's slowly fading away
That you should go on and kiss it, just a little bit Just a little bit
The sky became mad with stars
You're the one who loved my tired bones
Found a brand new family
If we don't take it on we won't get far
But do it now before tomorrow comes 
To make you smile
We're running out of gas
I know I may be wishing
No senses
Me and all my friends
And we'll take stucco dust and wet drywall sludge
She opened up and laid it all right there
Could but compose man's image and his cry
I'll make it right
Give me your night
When the sky is burning
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win
Ain't it funny how you only ever seem to want what you can't have
'Cause you don't need me now 
Is something I'm trying to find
I miss you more than I loved you
One second denied is a miracle of love
Take all we are allowed
And forget who we really are and where we really be
Of all the love that comes apart
Sometimes a heart can break and make its own relief
Rest in peace
Don't run away
She is shaking out static anonymity
Truly I do love you
Off in the distance the marble dome
Know your own name
I've got a girlfriend
He was her long, bright future
Reading the signs that just seep out
And you're talking about things
I look up to the sky,
While the world wakes up early
I can love
What have I done to you
Then we'll be up in heaven's ground
The darkness that softened the angles
One more time
Rock and roll is here to stay
Anything they want to you
You see I don't want to be hurt by love again
Keep on telling me that time is no enemy
Put out your hand
Why don't you come here and stay with me
No, no, not today
In the white light now
May you bring love and may you bring happiness
City sky reflects the silver street below,
A seed of hope
When you look that serious
I'll break down if you come around
I switch off the lights and imagine that waitress outlined in the bed
If you don't know or care you'll be all right
And braking in snow and killing more
Trouble sure as trouble sees it
Under the nails of a workin' man
'Cause I get so shaky
I think I hear the whisper of my own best friend
Hard to make me feel that I don't matter at all
Stamp your feet 'cause life's unfair
First you'll check with the stars
So let me down softly this time, and
Or a lover
Don't you know baby I'm a leading man
Close your eyes and forget your name
Down one to all the hopes and cares
But I'll always miss
Stuff was started, things had ends
And all the miracles of love
Look at the state I'm in
Like something's gone
The only thing it did was it made me wise
Do you know it, do you feel it, do you know it
There's forces that run so deep
And you've already got me coming undone
In this devil town
Oh I pray that we'll go back
The wise man knows
You carried me onto the fields
And you can wave goodbye to the frozen man
Because this boy is now a man,
Hallelujah's in the night
By the cold
Then he told me that I was Apollo 
There was no one else this time"
zuo der kemenâten în
Warm you like the sunshine
Lo, the light limned low
I often slip and then I lean toward three W's in life
Stunning when you sleep
Yeah, this time I'll just have to
But the way that they're doing it, it don't seem like that to me
But love is no dream
For a closer, more detailed picture
From the right to the wrong settle, settle
Some men say there ain't
Wins a broken heart
The world of two
A desert around me
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I look straight in the boardroom, a modern Pharaoh's tomb
But it always, comes back to this
Lead different lives
And I can't keep my hands from shaking,
I had a bonafide downside frown with the swagga not around in my life
Now I feed the birds Day after day
But that's to risky for a man like me
Soften when I hear you say
And fake a smile
And tumble into any open arms
They swirl in and around one another, creating the beginnings of the storm
I found a dream that I could speak to
And we laughed with the new air
Doesn't she know he's had such a busy day
Je l'ai revue le lendemain avec des fleurs à la main
It's all right because I know my own way back home from here
He's holding all the cards
You're wet around the edge
Mom, your baby's on his way
Always feeling you
The sky goes on forever in a symphony of song
There would be nobody if we all stayed all alone
In your window
I'm not a child I know, we're not going steady
I grieve in silence
I like the way that they reflect my thoughts
When all those shadows almost killed your light
All these things we were searchin' 
O carire di care tera me | O carire di care tera me di care
So I left your side and followed my own voice now
She want's you to say,
And you will be pleased to know
And you're dancing, and you're looking kinda crazy
I still know you, the best man
And tames you to feed from my hand
Room for many, room for few
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
�Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me"
And kisses
I gaze beyond the raindrenched streets
Is there something I'm not
It's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful world to you
Entre o céu e o firmamento
We're still waiting
Slowin' down I'm gettin' tired
Don't need your help
Every little time
But you are the never ending sleep that I love to treat
I feel a dark cloud coming over me
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Gave up all that fashion jazz and says that with a smile
And this is the truth, and the truth I declare,
And I hope
You threw away my shoe
Candle of life lights the blights and bruises
Days, you gotta run,
I'll be recruited by someone
Your fit of insanity makes me sad
You carried my heart in the night
Upon waking the facial expression deigns a satiable exchange
Let's get goin' once again
Of love
We'll be singing some day
Komm her, lass mich das Feuer sein
Ships in the night
Please in me, make me well,
I'm gonna put something in you
Oh the loneliness
So I find the time to write
When you were mine
And from her headboard, perched so high
We dodged all the moving cars,
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
Like a trashcan fire in a prison cell
To flatten the skyline and begin again
Practice everything you preach you nun,
A tender love as warm as May
And butterflies that long to tear away
It would be the most beautiful thing that they ever had seen
Truth and lies
Storms broken gentle winds just like
Asleep in dreams so deep
Seeking someone
I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore
I breathe the neon
That we know we need
Rainy days, cold nights to remember
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sorrows are easy to hide in states of mind
Now I'm too gone to fight
Everything merges with the night
The whole world will be talking
My silver spurs were gone my head felt twice its size
Whose fallen for you
That you can't see the sky
I can't see the sun, but I sense its glow
And kiss you when you start your day
Whenever I'm empty, you make me feel whole
You don't know how to ease my pain, you don't know
Wasting time on someone
Here's a little story to bring a tear to your eye,
Someone looking for or finding some
So he bit his tongue
All the women discussing what love is like, ooh you know the way I mean
 pour me demander ma main
And your progony's brave, their tract house waiting, preplucked and prepaved
Turning into something I can't cope
I'll bail you out again, I've got the readies
When you alight, mein Lieber
When we were all friends
To bring them home again
Waiting on a brand new day
And "I love you"
Always shine bright down on me
E cada segundo, cada momento, cada instante 
The man needs a maid
As they passed, their huge bulks disappearing into a thin line
I know the feeling of alone
The sound of water makes her dream
The day I break your heart
And I said, "Please don't lie to me, Mary"
My special one
Never would stop growing
From fear and only fear
Rolling out of the blue like a storm
Why don't you say what you mean
All the way down with me
Yeah you might have it all but you'll still want more
Locked up change deep inside
How I wish that I could be like any other man
I wish you would hang up and turn around
Put that radio down
Floating Counting clouds They're slowly fading
Do you feel a change coming on,
And the world is yours, the world is yours
And noone knows if they've done more here
With a silver ring that will hug you tight,
Is the time before each new word
To form imaginary lines
And hoped she'd understand
Right from the start
And all the while it's free as air
doch auch sie zerfällt irgendwann
But I don't care
Indigo is his own, Blue always knew this
Won't stand a chance
Take another sip my love and see what you will see
The shelter I've sought from the storm
You marry because it's expected of you
That's the thought of a single day, without your head in my hand
Down a Dewar's laugh out loud 
Air goes cool and hurrying on my way
The world has changed
You're making me dance
You've got a way to keep me on your side
I Don't care
E minha mente voa                    x
You'll bring that blessing
She looks at the rain as it pours
The remains of my wasted youth
And keep his undercover secret tight
In a way I couldn't predict
And we're making our weather with a lone lifeboat
während ich versuche zu stehen
For the women, weed and weather
We can play it nice and cool and keep the pressure off
If I stay, well than your tears will set you free
Everybody gets a little scared like this sometimes
Winter bells in dark and silent dreams 
And I wonder where, your god was then
Deep in the fire
If not tomorrow surely one day soon
I'm a traveller  with one last mile my journey is complete
Ko morehi no shita de 
Of your smile, your easy laughter
When we are together you make me feel like my mind is free and my dreams are reachable
That love walks through
All remains are in safe keeping
And I tell you all the wrong things
Qui rend fou
It's Christmastime
When I am done
Little heart
Entre dos almas enamoradas sólo hay
I'll change my whole perspective
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Why are you worried about the dirt
Another mile of silence while I'm
I struggle, I struggle to breathe repeated
After a winter, of getting dull and blue like a tory
Virá, pois ela estava ali
Our love is strong, with you there is no wrong
She was so beautiful to watch drifting out into oblivion
From me standin' in the trap with Curran and Sir Cap
You always have too much to prove
With some scrapes on my arms and a mouthful of hell
I believe you when you say that you love me;
Yeah we'll sing it someday
Backbeat, the word was on the street
And it seems like it's always so hard
The earth is our mother
Alright, that's good
So maybe I'm doing something right
Since you fall from every throne
I gave my soul
Wir beerdigen unsere Vergangenheit mit Pomp in großen Mausoleen mit pathetischen Zeremonien Lobpreisende Grabreden, tränendurchweichte Seidentücher, Blumenmeere und ein Leichenschmaus Nach gar nicht allzu langer Zeit ist uns die Grabpflege zu mühsam Der Gang zum Friedhof zu anstrengend Haben wir nicht die nötige Ruhe um das Unkraut zu zupfen Und gegen eine recht ordentliche Summe lassen wir die Gräber unserer Verstorbenen vom Friedhofswärter pflegen Er wird das Laub entfernen und die kleinen Lichter täglich neu entzünden Unser Gewissen ist beruhigt und wir können uns zurücklehnen
Maybe I'll head out for a movie
With this heart I will sing to you,
But I refuse to falter in what I believe
We were a dream, unrealistic
I lit my fire, saw my coach I'm full of love
Maybe then I held your hand and kissed you
The accidents of birth can make it hard to speak one's mind
'Cause I know one day you'll see
 toutes les filles qu'on rencontre dans le train
Can you love the one that God does
Move, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue
Is when I fall in love with you
As the scene unfolded, truth got moved away
Are we lost in a world
It's sneaking around out there
I never come around 
Making what is to come clear
Even the season's change
Nou pa men'm gen couraj
Ooh ooh I'm just like you
They are coming to get us now
And turn and close my door
With two fingers and a rock glass,
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
They babble commonly
Right out of the blue
Lights out, which way to turn
Now tell me what's wrong, I never meant to hurt you, no baby, ooh
It was you all the time
All this darkness cannot hurt us
And your word is yet done inbreed us all till we're all the same
From my seat I see the fields move by
bin allem hörig, was mir gehört
The birds and the bees
Time won't heal a broken hearted me
And I'm all out of light
Don't pretend that it's okay
That's what I'm saying
I am wasted, losing time
With you no longer here to hold my hand
We're snowdrops falling through the night
That the morning is near
I knew you'd find that note someday 
Hey little one, think about a time
Let's start living life 
They drop me in this fairground abnormal
Draw the bath and remind me to eat
Now here I am down in Kingstown again
'Cause it's been a long time
All of them one to one hundred
Sheer disobedience
Like an eagle doin' your hunting from the sky
Oh, the preacher's amen
Talking about attraction, yeah yeah yeah
The best thing you have had has gone away
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
You can stare up at the sky
If I was a simple man,
Brother you were so right
Once upon a summertime just like today
When at the closing of the day
He swings in the sun
Corroding by the sea
But never stop to realize
To what you was supposed to be
Ja yö on kylmä, valoton
But you should know this girl
Não há ressentimento 
You wouldn't want to go to Amity Gardens again
The world has surrendered
Whenever I'm alone
And all my tomorrows belong to you
Knock, knock, knockin' on the heaven's door
And I'm looking from a distance 
It's a wild hope
You reach inside and tear out all your cables
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
There's a breeze
Calling from far away
There are colors in the air when I fall to the ground
Four minute warning
Turn your radio on
Oh how we'd fly
The shadow grows without ever slowing down
Try not to dream and dream tonight
To feel so much tenderness
'Cause I steal hearts and souls
And the fates weren't on our side
I fly away from these evil voices
Old Gideon's Bible in the nightstand drawer saying, "Go on, open up"
I've never written a love song
Find somebody who cares
So count it on your fingers if we got it wrong
You'd fall so deep
All the wounds that money causes
Part of you boy
There's a whole world outside your window pane
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
For me to pretend that I'm somebody else
Don't be afraid should things happen to change
And some people live their life
In the parking lot as the teachers bend the rules
We come so close
Talking on the phone and watching "Cribs"
This is when I start to lose
Why does God cause things like tornadoes and train wrecks
Arrival, new arrival
Out to the fair though I welched on a  bet
Strappy shoes don't match the Thursday drunks
Join your arms across our nations
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
In strange ideas, we live apart
In these times of doing what you're told
And she has to walk straight home
You know what our boundaries are
Over the ocean to see you 
Because she knows deep in her heart 
y, verán, los espiarán, y todo es tan humano
You see the light
And sometimes find their problems seem like a day's work
And luck won't save them tonight
Und das Tal von Rückkehr tönt
Magical child
Tu eres mi amor de verdad
Only uncool will travel on gravel ground
With his sword, with his robe, 
Baby, can I hold you tonight
Will you catch me, make it alright, 'cause I'm standing, on the edge now, see your face and 
Waiting in the checkout line 
May I say I loved you more
You can just buy one
Nice and white
With you kneeling beside me holding me
And you're back out on the street
I took a river and the river was long and goes on
Und halt nie wieder an trag mich
You and I'll be safe and sound
Then Hawaii like millions of times before
I didn't get turned on, I just got turned
But I'd change for good
If you push me down I will try not to care about what might me under there
Just to write one simple song
You can just make out a lonely figure there
I'm here soaked right to the core
And I hope that you remember me
Feel everything
Tearing life crops asunder
I don't get paid enough to run 
With the methadone
I'm still young, but I know my days are numbered
Like a coverlet in the summer's air
By myself I am singing their song
And her voice it decays and before it does she goes
And friendship dwelled in western true
Pure inside enough to see
But it seems so far look in the stars
A woman's heart is filled with lust,
Sooner or later
As the howling and the fighting dies away
'Cause the love you used to feel is still in there, inside
Now the lord is master
Two sides, simple as that
When all the figures sound retreat the soft skin starts to shrivel
I'm all out of hope
It was a dark and clouded night
I'm gon' take off tonight
I'm right here
This feeling is not sadness, this feeling is not joy
We say anytime, anywhere, just show your teeth and strike the fear
Strange that I'm a human being
While I was in between
Just hit the ground running, I know
I'd have danced like the queen of the eyesores
I can't sleep in this bed anymore
It could raise these bones again
We get lost sometimes
Still got sand in my sweaters
Lie me in your quiet ground
The wind will fail
You never thought you'd be alone
My cousin died over some yay and I miss him
Everybody wants to be cool
Keep dodging lights
Who lives in your house today
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness;
She reminded me of a winter's morning
Can it be we've run out of time
Like a pretender
I still say hi to you
Well more like a bum, sort of, a musical bum
On fire
Well guilt is wasteful, pride is childish
Il y a ceux qui nous caressent
To keep my eyes open wide
His body always kept,
Turned off the lights and then you
Sag deinem Bruder,dass du ihn liebst
Your true colors, true colors, true colors
Anyway I think leave days 
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
A Storm Swept into town
They've given you a reason to fight
No one else take my place
When you remember the times the two us lay here
You're a lonely soul
Blasting white noise in the convenience store parking lot
When I was a sandy blue
Won't you come down to my arms
I found an old rock in the dry dirt outside
Oh, look what I'm holding here in my fire
I'mma soar even as the shell fall
Something has gone wrong
That burned out halo hangs right above his head
We all know that storm is coming
Leaving broken down pieces
Love is your dream
Acrylic paints, acoustic guitar strings, a new bicycle seat
Run, run away
If I couldn't have you, I'd rather be alone
And this ain't no time for actin'
It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
Used to be, was a part of me felt like hidin, but now it comes through
People say that I should
Look into your mind
You look so wonderful in your dress
Let the hours pass all running by so fast but now
Somehow, I smothered rainbows
Your crashing waves came, took you away
How could you be so heartless
I laugh and pretend
With body's jerking, but still I'm working
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
I was waiting, we were just waiting for it
You'd better beware ah
But it's nice to make some love that I can finally feel
The tears and embraces
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
Mon céans, mon céans, mon céans
Now these thoughts are haunting me
'Cept for the Pope, maybe, in Rome
How someone who had been so close could be so far away 
Yeah the words are dead
You're not waiting here for anyone
It's you or none, my damaged one
Turned back to front
The roses are frightened to bloom
'Cause I believe in silence, our hearts speak the same word, the same word
Of faulty manufacturing
Mr Nothing is late
And nobody ever knows when you go
But to turn back now we've come too far, so
Can a lie never burn so bright
When you had it made, it was all good
With your new life your new lover you've found
Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
Still I need your guidance
And the pieces broke and the people wanted more
So soft in his ways
Whatcha doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing &
The boys would laugh and tease about my black feet
Flights of grace, and future falls
Oh how sweet a girl like you can be
I've got points of icicles
But I just got to know
If I stay right here than forever with you
Es war immer schon da
And I am a breeze in the still August air
, leagues away catch up to you on the same day
If I'd been a loner, I would save myself, stay unaware
And it's okay to read in the dark
The gates to heaven here on earth will open up again
It doesn't stop at night
Could be the biggest mistake that a man can make,
Over that first floor, over that old hotel room
All that really matters now to me is that I could set you free
I can't take the pain
Put on your Sunday best and fake a smile
I get in so tired
Says I don't need you physically around
Take my hand, I will follow
And my heart held in your hands
And if one sentence is true
But when the wind starts to shift
You know my father, the bartender
When I'm far away
Feeling a bit stronger
To make it through each day you tried
Only someone running would run right into me
Nothing but closed down bars, no one helps you when you fall
I love you like I do in the noon
I alone am returned to tell thee
How come
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Your whisper's what I'm needing
Now I see that my world has only begun
Back then there was no way of knowing
The sky is still clearing
Like a bird on the wire
I flip a coin, there's more sides than two
You wrote "Charlie and Mary for forever"
And next week I'll forget probably
I am welcome
Looking to find me a home
And the nightbird sells her pleasures
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
I was born in 
Sometimes you may feel you're the only one
Throwin' out the lifeline
All the world is falling, falling 
Our hair is in the garden
Maybe the morning is too soon
As you blink she is gone
You were always there to walk me home
Through times like these
You stole what was left of the sky
I don't want you to change;
God only knows the torment writ large upon my heart
If there is a horizontal line
My angel, my angel, my angel
Go write a message in the sand
You didn't choose to commit, but you're committed
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
So you know that when they shine
I will lay my head
All that you ask for comes for free
Suspects a thing but I wish I didn't do
For a better life
Wearing wool sunglasses in the afternoon
Call me baby, baby all the time
As long as she's got to have it
Don't be scared
And pain gets hard, but now you're here and I don't feel a thing
Van enlazadas, acariciadas y no hay más
Who you are and where you're going
Light blue longing
In your eyes I see a darkness that torments you
Where nothing photographs well
Something you're afraid to show 
Now I'm bordering bored
Oh honey now girl, we can solve them
It's never gonna leave it unless you start
As dead as yesterday
To come home
She lied and said it was her birthday
Of everything you are, everything we are
Cause somethings are better kept
I'm in your shadow again
I'm falling
I bet you ain't never seen a shorty so fly
No more trying, oh oh yeah
The evenings fall, they'll drag me out the hall
Another kiss that you knew I meant 
Quem sabe com ela eu teria as tardes
And landed back home in a garden of green
Closing my eyes to feel the warmth come back
Oh she said, "Shut your mouth
How dare they distrust
Go ahead and say it
I'm trying to break this memory
And dragging back home under her control
Everything, not a thought of you
The plan of a city was all that you saw 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Freedom can be freezing, take a picture from the pretty side
'Fore ya bathe in the light
I'll hold each day
Beautiful, tragedy of who I was
Where to stand
All winter, slept around until my heart fell a sleep
Tire scraps on the federal roads look like crash landed crows
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
Those days of fear are gone
From those who are late
He says he lives above me
You know why yesterday was a lie
Girl I wanna show you all around the world
For all your time, playful crime in rain
Only place she ever went to lose herself,
He nicknamed me KRock so they would leave me alone
But you and I, you and I, you and I know the reason why
Can you appreciate the wind
Sunshine made my bare feet burn upon the road
I wanna ride with her
You had your chance, but you never called me
I want them back
If you could just make up your mind
We can do it We'll get through it
It wasn't really sad the way they said goodbye 
Island life is living from a cup of broken queens
Bring just your fire
And I'm thinking ooh I can't live without you
Will you say to me,
Some say I am to blame
You can lose your fear you can change your life
Still tomorrow comes, I'm still standing on my own two feet
No, I can just feel you
But now you've got nowhere to run
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
Wave a white flag, put away the pistol
Siehe Wanderer Die Sonne fällt sanft durch die dichten Laubblätter der alten Bäume Die Donau rauscht im Hintergrund Der Blick auf ihre dunklen Wasser ist durch eine Staumauer und Büsche verborgen Sie hat sie einst alle angespült, die Verlorenen, die Vergessenen, die Ignorierten, die Verzweifelten, die Unbekannten Nimm dir einen Moment Zeit Setz dich zu mir auf die knarrende Holzbank, die ein paar gute Menschen einst hierhin stellten als sie all denen einen Platz für die letzte Ruhe gaben Lass uns erinnern Lass uns gemeinsam gedenken derer, die hier vergraben sind Sieh all die schlichten Kreuze, die einfachen Grabsteine Fällt dir etwas auf 
I seen a thug cry
And now she's here on someone else's arm
But I feel a change coming on
And there's the star I used to wish on
I'm not sitting up here on some throne
No drink, no drugs, no cigarettes, no loose women because I'm weak
I soon was finding out
I don't fuck with no hand me downs, see if you fuck then it's after me
I'm feelin' that shame 
Because you're right where you should be
We figure out the past through photographs
To the ground
Somehow, some way
Riding with them boys and girls and we're high
Just wait for it to come
It was my decision
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
I wanna live today
And when you cast away and you feel like home,
I'm just the hope
You can't know unless you feel it
I am livin' out the life of a poet
She will buckle to the sound
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
I'm getting mesmerized
I'm hiding away from the sun
And watch with me from the shore
How many times will I sleep by your side
Crypts and Bloods, Latin peace
And another gets away with a thousand crimes
It's easier but I might still be pretending
Or to land
On the day of her arrival
Mietit miten lopettaa
A royal bed a lovers' nest
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail
Judy's fantasy has come
To let you grow into the person that I know, that I know you can be
The sun began to shine
Step away then from the edge
Oh yeah, you came here with my best friend Jim
I guess I'll go chase some memories
Faith be true, you know the way
Time it does not matter
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Why do the stars glow above
And he walked away from my fleeting house
You're a fashion tip, a living museum
No one to hear a sound
Brought to her those days
Speaking in Spanish making the rounds
On angels' wings
We go on together
You're trapped inside
And you waited on the rain
Girl, if it's done right
Pictures are pasted on shop windows and walls
I confess this heavy heart, has me on my knees
In every part
The music that comes from when playing with precision
Or just visiting friends
explicação Parece inaceitável a
I still see you
We'll make it out together
Away from traffic and smiles of tire
On the crossroad to the devil, I'll dwel and I'll count my years
Yeah I'll give give give until there's nothing else
It's just a feeling
I Cannot feel a single thing,
But grace is an acquaintance of mine
They're painting my wound
I'm just gonna write where you are on my shirt
That means no time to waste
We both realized it was way too late
And we'd lie in the garden and watch the weeds grow
You sank into yourself and I got lost somewhere in between
My fever's getting high
Can't stand and wait on a miracle
Honey 
You as yours, me as mine, to before we were us
And now your eyes they look at me
And sleep tonight
Beside your graveside
Linda toda, toda linda ela
And springtime starts but then it stops
And the sound of your voice
las praderas, los desastres
Feel like I'm blowing the glow of the sun
Your famous last words, thought they'd never be erased
I know that you are
Attracts me like no other lover
It all unfolds before your eyes
The eye that always watches us
Never could apologize 'cause you died, that's why they say that
Yes I will 'cause
My eyesight's fading, my hearing's dim
Now I hear your widow crying
Cómo olvidar tu sonrisa
You don't need to say it
Watch the dancing shadows run away
I understand that you've been wounded
It's time to go
From the soul I sold like a whore
To take her place
You're still beside me
Cover your neighbor, we'll be all right
You would still have my heart until the end of time
And when the wind does blow against the grain
But no one feels like you
Gibt es was, das dich bewegt,
And watch the waves from its wake
That mean she'll fuck till the morning, time and I got time
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall, will you catch me
You looked like a princess the night we met
I seem to miss the missing part
To stand at the bus stop
Should things fall apart
From where she came it's hard to say
No one's watching me
Is just in our brains
Our bodies are exploding
I've tried to teach you well son all of everything I knew of how to live
I've seen with my own two eyes
Inside the mountains
I don't leave the past behind
Where bodies are indecent
Please take me under with you
Though you're far away
The one who inspires, the one we admire
And now all this time
Isn't it time
Is where the life has left your eyes
Would you like to learn to love me best of all
Dangerous plastic words
No one can hurt you now
And your sheepskinlined coat is eluding me still
There's no getting off
You sound asleep, but I feel pain,
Inside of someone else's place
That you're always thinking of me
Late at night your footsteps
Goodnight Georgie, goodnight Grace
If you will come
How long must this day go on 
And I got a little fear in my soul
Now you're gone, I feel alone
Oh, but you didn't have to laugh that way
Your lullaby for all the times
I never knew it all 
I'll write I'll rerecord these times,
Head against a window
I got nothing I could leave
I loved my breaktime education
The pressure will make you feel
Of when we had just started things
The alligator form getting up
He sends cheap thrills, to pay expensive bills
Now I'm right here and I'm right now
These crooked legs, these twisted arms, these tired feet lost their worth 
But even though we miss our friends
And then we understood at last
And I never wanna go back again
These are the bulletproof  carat gold tears  of a rapper
But mother, mother, some will never know;
And I'm on my way to believing
When all the numbers swim together and all the shadows settle
Oh, I want your love
Look at the blue skies gone gray
My old heart
Here comes the rain
Lying on the bathroom floor
Black Chuckas, black skullies, leather PellePelle
All the barbershops and funeral homes were open
Lucid dreams
Don't wait your life away
And we no longer fear the voices of the brave or bold
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
Und ich habe keine Angst zu fallen
Doesn't happen quite as bad and the burnings dry skin
About Woman taking in all she can
But in the end,
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
Tires rattle heavy walls the tides tonight
The desperate kingdom of love
I am alone I am dreaming of the sea
And we do things do things over and over and over again
Divine is your mother
And may no man's weight
The closer you are, more I see
Hoping that I step on out
None but him and Jimmy could know
I'm taking her home with me, all dressed in white
And I ain't never been a buster, always stood on my feet
Dreaming of the day when he can do the same thing
Gone gone gone black widow
As ondas vão e vem
You don't have to stay awake to talk to me when you know nothing to say
sua namorada, pois fiquei
His days are long
But in my dreams I couldn't love you more
And it'll buy you a place on the lowery side
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Just remind me
Grounded by this ignorance
Brother of mine, we'll be singing someday
It's all I need
So far away and so alone 
I'm digging like a miner North and South Carolina
Clearly I hear your voice
But not looking for what I lack
Take me, take me, home Home, home, home
Or is it just for today
I take Spit over Raymo shit, I'm a vandal
He does not look back
Summertime, and the living is easy
Then you fell to your knees and proceeded to cry
But I know that his dad was a drunk
I don't need to look
Somewhere fear has no place
Found love, last summer it faded away
That I'm filling in the empty spaces
I'd like to stay in love with you
But I know I'm getting old
My love for you was strong enough you should've known
Five thousand miles I'm away from you
Meu amor
In the night, in the night
Don't count on anything
When you wake up you'll be in such pain
Sotto karada ni nagareru 
You say I gotta find my place
These blackened memories 
When love becomes sacrificing
I see clearly what you are, what you are
Burdened bands gain strong hands
Streets are uneven
But the shadow it grows
All he carries is his pride, he has nothing to his name
Darling believe
Let's spend the night together
A finger's touch upon my lips
And if you should look back
I'm an owl with tired eyes
And now I couldn't lead you home
When you were my girl
Teardrops of acid rain
Sun is in your vision, possibilities emerge from the dark
Was a turning point  so many things there to learn
Around the holy kingdom
Though we may be miles apart
Tears of pain and salt
You son of a bitch
Calling me a fool, saying that I've effed up everything
Hold you tight, words have a new sound
'Cause the past comes back again
If the sun is to set
People, places
You're my picture on the wall,
The stars keep this fire from burning out
Has the end occurred
That beat outside my window
And paid with a folk song
Colonel Sanders' fingers
I used to make you laugh about anything
Unbutton minds yet unbeknown
о Jameson, Guiness и Connemara
Our able bodies and able minds
I know your brothers and your sister and your mother too
With ten, wide, safe, stairs
To wet your tongue with the salty sea
Get somebody to come on to you
Might help to carry Jacob Marley's chain
Whenever I get lonely
I took their wrong and I took their lies
If you have any thoughts
When we're together we stand so tall
To join the other flotsam with the ripped up queens and knaves
I am my soul's belief
The forests had a rock in it
But I believe there's power here, just not that I can find
I don't answer the phone
We'd be wasted
There are no men  I'm the last in the chain
I feel like a cartoon brick wall
I've changed my plea
Chance is all you need
Princes kept their view
Looking for the summer
In the light they both looked the same
And his wife told his kids he was crazy
I'm sleepwalking
Slow motion light
To lay on his bed
Let the water seduce you to immerse
Who are these old old people
And if you're wondering why
He won't be coming back this time,
You are still the rage, a rock
Down in the fire the angels are singing
That's the place where we used to play
No pressure
When it's your time
The photographs of just the landscapes where we've been
I'll catch you every time you
That shattered feeling
Sometimes I cannot forgive
From the deep silence of my mind
And just a little bit of rain
The young man is weak now in a lover's disguise
Where is your sense of indignation
Where are we going
I won't forget
All the truth that I needed
We had this dream
Softly stolen under blanket skies
Is anyone alive
That's why I love you
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
My hope is that we'll meet again
Or did we just not grow together
If this is to end in fire then we shall all burn together
Friendship strong and true
Uncertainty, I could be bathing under artificial light
And I've been drinkin' all these tears so long
I'd give my last breath before I do
When thunder rolls through my life
Like I wish I could forget you
No one betrayed here but the memories lie
I've clawed it back again
The Dowmaker's ghost
I've made my bed, now I'm lying in it
Well I sound alone here on my way home, again when no one is there waiting
With a big old hallelujah carved into my chest
If you were faced with Him in all His glory
There is a grove, there is a plot
Here began all my dreams
The trouble with you and me
And then there's morning
Digging in caves to find the treasures of the land
Yeah just lights up in the north
To take your pretty neck and see which way it bends
Whenever you walk by, 'cause I still love you
Alone in your dreams
Should I be on your mind
Bathed in breeze
As the sweet babies crawl away
Yeah, you're still a long way from home
The warning signs have all been bright and garish
Well I bled words onto a page for you
I must stay with you
Every hour in the day you will hear me say
To marry the wave with the tide
Falling in love with the prettiest sound 
Cry like a baby
We're fighting for our lives
I admit it
The excess disease
When one heart enjoins
Until my day my day is done
You should be in bed but you're here instead
Over the ocean
So go, love, if you're going
I got yours and no others
And you can tell the world what you want them to hear
So, he drove me home in the van
I'd pay to visit you on rainy sundays
And they glisten with your tears
I hear you say
She'd be white gold
If you want you can stay
When will you share your winter nights
But don't discount their winter winds
desde el fondo puedo ver que depende del cristal
In my mind a knot was gathering
I can't pull myself back from you
Pushing flame scorched limos to the oil rig tonight,
Whereever I go, your shadow follows me
It ended with a twist of fate
There's a breeze in the air
As we remember to hold the faith
What you started
The magic of that summer in love
Thought of her walking, turned back around
Think tonight I'll give him the benefit of the doubt
Like an old friend I've known forever
Farewell to Sinclaire's castle grand
To relax and unwind
You can walk right out into the world and capture and kill god
You are the prettiest thing
And the smoke smelled like my past
But my heart is frozen and the ice is far too thin
I feel like I've known you forever, baby
Yeah the truth is you're not alone
Turn the headlights on full
Between the next road and your last road
I get the feeling
Cannot hear what you're saying
I fell in love and I needed a road map
But if your eyes are wide
And water was running through both of your hands
In this honesty
Do they really make me look that clever as I fall to the earth
And, yeah, some mad tattoos
Just to see them fall into the lake
Broken pieces without glue
Vou sair p'rá ver o céu
Or said, or how you stood that day
No need to stay
Actually in the drifting white snow
I ain't never seen a light like that before
Do your thing and sing the world is yours
Quem sabe com ela 
And no one, yeah, no one could ever wait for you
I have been wasting my time
Head across the street where VACANCY is burning in neon still
Sometimes I'm crazy but I guess you know
I got more TVs in here than where I live
She stirs the bog wood fire
Oh, you have a roommate Jemaine, don't bring them home
I wasn't alone
So I give up, waiting for someone waiting 
And the spirit of life remains in light
Out on the street
To hand in his heart and take his last vacation
It is not because I don't feel it in my heart
Melt like snowflakes in the sun
The prison walls are crashing down as winter dies without a sound, on this early April Morning
Show me the beauty in all you see
Our world is only what we're told
I know that I've got a sordid past
Through the eyes of a child
You'll be part of me
What do you wanna do now baby
I trust my love, I trust myself, I trust the love of someone else
It's a morning yearning
I am breathing,
Every dream that I dream
Listen to me what I have to say,
And if I should taste fire
My heart is laughing
Has triggered unfamiliar restlessness
He bites his fingernails
Ain't we all a little needy
I played Ready for the World, she was ready for some action
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
But I do not fear the future
With your face painted on to your friends,
A chilly wind is still blowing
Killing time that I left behind
And there the advertisement
I've lived alone
And I can't wait to be alone with you
The closer you are, the more I see
See their faces in the mirror
I will miss you, distance aside
I can carry on fine
Bored with life
While loudspeakers play soft music
In the halflight
You're the only one
So take my hand, I will follow
You know blow job need an application, eating pussy make appetite
'Cause he is stopping you
I'll apologize to the ones I love,
You get what you deserve
How could we be so right 
Flieg jetzt los, bis hintern' Horizont
Nice and slow
Just take my soul
als wären sie verliebt
Everyday you look a little worse
I wonder what you dream, when you dream,
Ja, jag sträcker mig så långt det går
Oh, nice
The best friend I had in Tremell, I lost that
Acting their parody of love
But I say Yo sit
So you walk around like you don't know me
This pressure ain't for everybody
Summer thunder on moonbright days
And all the pieces cheered as tidings spread abroad
Just tell me what you need me to know
And still my heart has wings 
Out of you, but NASA is on your side
Baby you know that I love you
And she taught him how to fly
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
I hate what these lies have come to mean 
Hiding himself away
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
The air is thick and foggy
She's got no reservations
Alone I stand alone I fall
There ain't no stopping now
That I will be carrying
That liquid guilt is on my lips
It's shimmer still beams clear and bright
But you already know that because you used to ride with me
There is a mother
So please tell me they're like the rain
Been here time before, and it wasn't real
If you feeling like you can�t believe
Take off your shoes, hang up your wings
And in the haze I see a hand to hold
The sacrifice is never knowing
On a night like this
Do que julgam o nosso próprio entendimento
I don't want to start
You can run out of pity
Time to step lightly
I rubbed your back when you were sleeping
Would you change me if I could
Defiantly real, there's nothing fake
Here I cease to run
Something in the way she moves Whoa, in the way she moves
I wonder could they tell, how did they know
That my friends is where I wish I was
Hold on, hold on to the ones you love
Or night,
Digging deeper in my mind
As the sun sets on another day
Ideas unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness
The storms made the pavement steam like a kettle
Whose day is this
Oh Sophie, will you be here in the end
Like poison it succumbs her
I can't make shape or form
Of love, love of love
But afternoons they never come
Through one thousand lives
Healers always say
We're leaving things unsaid
Do you notice I can't focus
Want the price but not the raise
Over land
Some people say God is long dead
Neither will admit we both just wanna say
Sends the keys to the lock of the chain
It's alright
And in my own time I am losing fast
Because it brings me back you
I hope to find it in the end
Open the window
Please tell them that I loved them more than they will ever know
Only hope I got the message to you
Be warm and kind hearted
Read in the news
Into a lovers arms
Your choice of words and all the fantasies
That one day you're gonna regret it
I'm not equipped to play this game
I'm sick, there's not a thing I wanna do about it
Who took a homemade, fan blade, oneman submarine ride
To single out the ones
I'm on the right track, yeah I'm onto a winner
What I feel for you right now baby I can show you how
One heartbeat in your body is a miracle of love
Whenever I turn, you are gone from me
Her hard parts I'm cradling
So I'll drive away with all my things
I' d hold you in my arms
He says he's wrestled with that blanket
I have a love for you that nothing hides
Hey, I can't make it go away
Gold teeth and a curse for this town
Way back when
And in your head where it dwells
Your toughest smile
It's alright
With people changing all their minds; it's crazy
Either side left or right
It makes you look so alive
And hiding in the strangest pathway
It may've been the first of mistakes
You were the lonely one
To get back to the feeling of when we were fifteen
As we sit here and drink a beer and do nothing in particular
You light me from within
May it always surround you
How can we ask for the brightest cities every night midnight 
Look me over it's just a surface wound
Because I've got these magical seeds and the trees are still growing
in diesen schmutzigen Sekunden
I know I'll make it
Put that cigarette out
We are the crack that was mended
One last long sigh gone
I'm a good man with a good heart
There's a reaction, yeah yeah yeah
Unpredictable like the sun
I watched you hold the son in your arms while he bled to death
But it's your image burnt into my mind
Or a place so similar that I wouldn't be able to tell the difference
I'll just remember the wind, and the snow
Shut your eyes, there are bluer skies
Know every part home 
Falling, falling 
Ma dove, dov'è il tuo amore
Jaded, her mind in a daze
Wayward and highstrung
You've done nothing wrong
Say put your faith in me
Could you picture Russell needing a check, man
Please don't lie
Towards you
And the king is a hand
Would never take their place
Than a woman who loves a man
Crashing down was my biggest mistake
Some wouldn't even bother and then you came around
Picket lines and picket signs
But why, she didn't know
Play with words when we cannot sing, this bouble feature means everything
They say I'm too kind and sentimental like you could catch affection
This world is just illusion, always trying to change you
Hiding the more unholy things I do
And all I would reach is this mirror
Take me on a ride inside your heart tonight
She taught us to embrace the light
True words
In the city where we still reside 
As they break their back
But this time I'll just have to
Give me a reason
'Cause I don't know if I can do this alone
From behind the counter he thought you whispered you want more
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Somebody's bed will never be warm again,
Running wild, running blind
'Cause when you're left with nothing, there's nothing left to lose
But don't look at me this way in the broad light of day
That I wanna stay here indefinitely
How could I ever take you home
Bebí en las fuentes del placer
We'll make it out of hereoh yeah
Of a darker world that no one should know
You jut into the air
Yeah well come on check it
Up all night 
The smell of anything
When it feels right and it's wrong
Didn't I tell you about the dream I had last night
Wheels on fire
Holdin' on to something when 
I'm lost for words that won't mean a thing
That chills her darling to the bone 
It can't be done
Another light means another minute 
Wish someone done me wrong 
Got your earrings in my pocket till I see you again
So when the dice came out at the bar downtown
It was dumb, I had no sense of your size
And everything, everything will be fine
And it feels like it's tearing you up
I could live in a different place
Behind your eyes
A place to be a love to give
I've seen the paths that your eyes wander down
Didn't know, didn't know, didn't know,
I dreamed that I saw my girl Susanne
When I arrive it's gone
So I look in your direction
Today was gonna be the day
Your baby's gone, and you're all alone
Longing for the warmth of childhood
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the situation
Silent angel
There is nothing outside, above
Feel it all come true, come true
I've got you a brand new weapon l
His words shine bright like the sun
It's just a ride, it's just a ride
This nightmare seems so real
White light on a black sky is a miracle from above
And everyday I wore your face,
It's a long way to go
So unbend
A vial of hope and a vial of pain
There's an eclipse in your eye
Nichts ist wie es war,
Say All I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head"
You know where she's gone
Come baby let's drown
Look straight in the mirror, watch it come clearer
So thank you for the hours
I only wanted things to go right
No one else can please me
Please ocean cloud
I kill a magical child
Your family in suits and ties
Breathe my love, get high
Realized what you gotta do
Holding on and still waiting for that windfall
Doggy, and I ain't talking bout my pitbull neither
'Cause your love
All of us are falling
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
It's popular with the disco dancers
I'd like to remind
So I stretch out my back and travel a long,
When you placed your bets upon the bittersweet
You make it look so easy, baby
And take your heart and make you mind
The earth looked like it was lit from within 
And if I happen to fall
Waiting in my room and I lock the door
Said I'm rocking you, yeah yeah yeah
Gold it flew into my eye
All alone and twisted
Ob die Winde Botschaft bringen
I was a teenage smog
Just close your eyes and ignore
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
And you won't matter anymore
We're on both ends of the fight
Jag skulle byta plats med vem som helst på sekunden, om jag kunde
Nothing left at all
When the earth folded on itself
Turn into winter lights
But now I feel, baby
And I'm staring down the barrel of a  
Oh it's getting easier but time will show
The light will fill our eyes like cats
But in his heart, he knows the hardest thing about it is
And if the stars should fall from the sky
Oh, a light flickers on
With no command
It's happening, yeah, it's happening,
Laisse le vent prendre soin de tout
'Cause you're still a long way from home
To the beautiful women that you are
It's just a movie 'bout a movie to old to die"
For the tree to drop
So I'm gonna get upcleansed
Mojique holds a package in his quivering hands
"Say All I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head
Every time I'd cry you would wipe my eyes
Freedom, to prisoner, to freedom
Imagine I would feel
We stopped beside a little flower stall
To make sense of the signs
Think of all the people we could meet
If you can't sleep at all
Orange in the streetlight
dir in die Augen zu sehen
And I remember my face when you stopped 
I just can't forget you,
You know I love you, though I can hardly say
For someone like you to remain on side
And I remember warmth, I could have sworn
And I will have a game on the coconut shy
And one turns into four
Would like to believe that someday,
Of the one who is sweeping
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
And everybody can see I'm no good
The burning sun
I'll Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times
Inside your own illusion
I want to be where love is real
Your love is king
Try to find the other side of you
And you're a cold one 
The winds of fury will lead to paths of glory
Is knowing when to let go of her hand
Go games and adult education
Oh, God, well, look at you now
Melting snow
Don't want to be first in line
Refugee hands from a gin war
From the freeway
Even in your arms I know
I'll never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit outta you
The movement comes in slow
From the stars in the sky to the ocean floor the world is yours
And I can tell someday that I'm gonna say the truth
Now look
I got my dark green trenchcoat on
And when I look in the mirror I feel dead, I feel cold
in meinem Leben dir gefallen
If we can't stop taking
If he isn't in by ten she'll call up her best friend
But that's just not the way now
But a part of me still falls to the floor
And even though we stopped worrying,
By many a ruined year
Send me them seeds I'll grow 'em what they need
Here comes Jane, you know she's sporting a chain
Two things
Who can never be alone
They glow unbearably bright
No solid ground to walk on
I've boarded up all the doors
Things they should know but the things that they don't
It's neither heaven nor space, it's just high
Essa menina tá dizendo, sim eu sei
Know that I'm just wasting time
Or one more nail in this relationship make it
With nothing but disaster
Next words that were spoken to me
That there's something that she knows and could teach you
And she takes her pills, And she tells her lies,
Pictures blurred in her head
Right now and right here
You've never seen me and you don't know my face
'Cause I believe in silence, our hearts speak the same word
But now the longer that I hang around 
How come I can walk for miles, and still just love You
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
I got yours
Ooh what more can I say
I'll remember who you are 
To stand
If you just give me some time I can open up your mind
The cartoon trees up to the sky
Your hand on my shoulder
Heaven surrounding you
My heart is a flower
Let's do it serpentine, I don't mind
Now bugging because the label had just dropped Def Jam
My sister awake
No one
Oh, my friends
And I believe it was you
Wondering if where I've been is worth
I know everything will be all right
If the stars say that you couldn't love me,
The wind comes softly blowing
And all I want is all you need
If I come home
Mother's in the garden inviting everyone
I will lose my heart in the sand 
I feel your heartbeat
But alas they are not now mine
And it's gotta be here
She was nobody's nothing
Yours baby I'm yours
Sits there rockin' slowly on a chair
See everything
This gnarled, weird face
Do you know where your heart is
What gets said's not what's heard
I saw a navy blue bird
So come closer baby
To wake you is all we got
Do you remember the days
I feel I'm not alone
My needings only fleeting
Hold me when I cry
Like night's intrusion
Hang it up now or never, oh yeah
From present and past
Mommy stumbled 'Later, kids, you'll understand'
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
You're living in the same circumstances
Where gravity don't bring you down
But you had me and I loved it
Ins Dunkel 'rausgeschickt verfusselt sich die Zeit
Then we'll work until we die
Is worse than something
Make me well, make me well
I started to dance, remember
But the air's so thin and you're still polluting it
Are you back in my life to stay
Are you saying things have changed my ways again
Would it make it any better
While I squeezed you like a tree trunk
The darkness of your kiss
I'm the scarecrow in disguise
I can't defend
Says, "Girlie girlie, you're at your best you're at your best when you're sober"
Can you tell me about everything I long to understand
And some are realists
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your fear that got me to move
And your breath smelled like honey in the frosty air wake
nach der Zukunft fragen
So I won't say
You to feel Mine to feel
And then wnen it comes on top
Away under the moon
Everyone has their obsession
Now when I see you, it's so bittersweet
And you know me, in my s and my gold teeth
I'm an old man, you're probably not interested I see
And I don't want to die
Cut through the country, speed through the dark
And oh it ain't the same, when you're falling out of feeling and you're
Waiting for the big fall
I'm gonna tell you I love you one more time
Will sleep secure, right free from injury
What hides inside me
Yeah I've been feeling everything
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
I keep having nightmares, and I'm scared to go to sleep
I listen to the music, the music will take me home
Sentimental jamboree
The way you're busting out of that wifebeater
When laughing is gone my way
If you ever get famous,
With your friends and all your jokes
But I swear you wouldn't be so lonely
You can say no to being a night looker, boy hooker, rent boy, bro, hoe
Don't run away now
Lost in these rooms
A million dreams have passed her
And maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
They come and they go 
Go away like you always do your entire life
Things won't get better that way
When the flame turns blue
I guess I'm the girl you thought
Something tells me I'm not meant to  I told you I don't mind
These things deceive
Silver wings in a fiery sky
You never know what might be under the snow
The thunder makes her contemplate
Look across now honey the horizon,
Are you still there
A tragic ending
Darkness deep and vast
Did you know that I loved you or were you not aware
In your fire and in your flood
No greed, no desire
Lost loves unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness
I remember you walking away
Generally we are alone in lonely worlds
And remember though love is strange
Let fear charge the gates
But nothing happens
Don't back down, nothing can be changed
Always keep dreaming
You know you've got to
And some song about Memphis
But we said 'Hey, ther must be an easier way to make breakfast'
He's working away on displacement
New lovers taking our place
Vaan niin että tunnen sinut  But so that I feel you
I ought to be on my way right now
And watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
Should you eat one of the ripest ones, you can fly
Let the grass grow
Then wake up your windows and watch
Hmmm, 'cause I wanna hear you
It's been broken but it's nobody's fault
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky
On what to do when your career is buried
So long next time
And I shall not walk alone
And I've been needing to tell you
That you picked up on the way
Where do you go when no one cares
I risked it all against the sea
With all of these memories
It wasn't clever
The sunlight heal the core of your body
Soon she's down the stairs
Running 'round doing people in
And change them 
True colors, true colors, true colors are shining through
We are crooked souls trying to stay up straight,
So I go home to my
They're much stronger than I thought
If you go my way you won't go wrong
Along a beam of light
It don't matter anyhow
On a Saturday night
We drank dandelion wine and we reminisced
I'm just the kind of seafaring guy
A song that I had only sang to just a few
Los cuadernos de don Rigoberto, Vargas Llosa
Hello, if you're there, pick up the phone
Far out at sea
This Rubbermaid's had better days
My brother had a daughter
And space enough to thrive
Stand and move and walk across the water
It's so cold around me
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
I feel so sad
A bloodred moon is
Ohoh, no you didn't care to see the light of day
I can't believe what's happening
Liars and fools, sons and failures
Down on my knees where I met You
Put up the house and bet the odds if it's coming from me
Like a cat dragged in from the rain
Your love is real
A Night all alone
"There's a love that's always meant to be"
I had a plan, was all made up
Oh, stop, you've got to shake the waist
You store it up, unleash it, then you piece it together
We raise a glass to kindness
Someone has brought me a new straight costume in an asylum
And our love is an antique song
And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view
You wear it well treating me like someone you don't know
And fearful hate that's steming out
She was talking with a syllable lisp
The new age now
Tender eyes from sleeping
Burning rhythms and posting lies
The open road is calling and begging for us
'Cause everyone is a fucking pro
They'll have you coughing up your colors
He's balancing a diamond
Let's not fight, that's not nice that is where you'll find me
You wait for summer
This life owes nobody happiness
Here is the rainbow I've been praying for
I will love you for the rest of my life
Just the smell of the summer can make me fall in love
One of these days I'll give up
So maybe you're all in love
Try to make you see that you're
The buses are kneeling
So vast that you could lose your way in it
Summerbreeze is blowin' through your hair
He won't have due this falling ride
I already caused, apparently normal
Don't let me forget
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
You know that I got a little something I should say
Put your hands on my back
As this world goes slowly by World goes slowly by
Was ich beherrsche, das raubt mir die Beherrschung
I was as proud as any girl could be
I just think that maybe
Head on my shoulder, I'll pour myself a glass
Waited for so many lonely years
Most of the killers never get famous
Go ahead and put it down
Op mijn nattedromenwang
There's good and evil in each individual fire
I'm now on a road holding out my thumb
It takes two floors to make a story
Strangers together, your hand in mind
Jesus the Mexican boy gave me a ride on the back of his bike
How we fought and we talked through the night
It was a cold and angry sky above
By his heart and his head
Easy dreamer
Take away their sorrows
No one told me
Just like a wave on the ocean
I want to make much of Your mercy
Some years ago
From where she came it's hard to stay
Are calling me home
Pray to live a million years
For someone like you to remain so sure
I don't eat well, I don't sleep well
The girl you once knew
I mean after all the things we got into
One day a light will shine
I wanna be where the sun meets the sky
It makes you think, it makes you sane
And my blood is burning
It's a oneroom city, yeah, it's a oneroom city here
When it all fall into places
Don't always need to do it by yourself
So we can sing you to sleep
I need that money like the ring I never won, I won
And today the people dress the way that they please
And that first breaking light becomes his enemy
Red eye flights help the stars out
So don't get tangled up
I don't know, If I'm right, I'm right
Oh I will do right by you
Disagree on the sidelines
That disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other
I'm coming home to Arizona
Feelin' that's from way back
Clareando a aduana
The early mornin' final edition's on the stands
The water is wide
Zen brain throw away your crushes
A smile, if you dare
And say you've locked some fire away,
I love you 
Break your day for pay and ration
Nobody's sunny all the time
You said I was late
Guided by a beating heart
But I'll try again tomorrow
But you're prepared everyday to make the same mistakes
Under the waves, deep in the drift
And prayed that maybe
They said she was the pretty one 
When noone stays to wait
Try to bring me down
And I was making you a wish,
A life without you
When I crossover into the light
Love is something you have to cherish
Echoed in a crowded square
When it's falling rain on the ground
When you're in love, my how they fly
Todas as cores que fugiram junto com você
I've seen the hand that rushes in 
And it's lights out for catholic computers
Hang on to your wallet, hang on to your rings
Me basta tu mirada para comprender
In the end you've got a friend for lifetime mhmh
Lo and behold he was standing under the welcome sign
And the words are new
I am hopeless
Buttercups and the fishing flies
Lie, smile, don't say no
Tell me if a lover know a blessing in this curse
I'm glad you came around today
That Died the time we said goodnight
So I'm calling for one last time, to say I love you
It is perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Couldn't stop myself if I tried
Du siehst sie kommen
She set my schoolhouse on fire
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
The clouded mind
Well I had myself a dream the other night
When I feel the morning grass I let down my guard
Pour some liquor for those who passed away
As the devil spoke we spilled out on the floor
That IIIIII wanna be your man
There'll be someone new everynight 
Our own decline
Found my brother's badge
Well it sucks to be honest
All this time,
Virá ou ela me espera
And she breaks my heart, and breaks her word,
Sacrificing many for the
Because when we're drinking we can never be filled
Olas y olas me llaman al mar
What was yesterday will reform today to retrieve lost life
I'll always wake up so confused
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin' get mine,
The hollow ring is only last year's echo 
The same way that I always do
Give your life
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
To get my message through
Because you love me way too much for you to ever leave
She remembered desires
With only a hope to make
One fine day you'll sing
When time keeps crawling by
Feels like the world has passed away
Everything's all right
I wait in the shadows
Oh and the waves are going out
Works the web like no other, gotta put him on the map
And I still see her in the crowd with diamonds in her ears
In a dark and eerie corner of my mind
If I stay right here and forever with you
When you are near, I feel so far away from the person I am
Despite I talk about it, I ain't makin' fun of them niggaz
Well here I am writing you a love song Holding back those years,
Oh, if you ever come at me I will hurt you
Back into that falling night
Yo, do you see that lil' bop in my step
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
Like how she feel, you know, you know what she told me
I'm a fool for you love
Shot up the whole 'partments, and still ain't brought back
Let's never say goodbye
It's time to show new eyes their home
So now it limps and counts the hours
It's how the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach,
I know I'm in love
Bring you back to the bar Get you out of the cold
Send away for a priceless gift
You may tire of me as our December sun is setting
All my friends,
I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
Kom vi minns, minns tillbaka
I served him right
We are the season's new collection
He called me baby
Well I can't be sure where I'm headed after death
"Turn into stone," I knelt to the Hobo;
We decided to get hurt
Says the sign in the shop window
There's a love between us still
I stuck around I played the hand I was dealt
And how my dreams they let me down
All good things are defined by the kiss
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
We'll discreetly share a cab home when the evening ends
From the palms on your hands
You make it easy ooh ah
And there's not a soul around
You turn to rocks and omen
To make much of You
As good it was, then the magic hour seemed to be fading
So remember all your days the world is yours and all the world contains
Tyhjä paikka aina sille mitä en ikinä saa
If my time is tabled and my clock is on time
I feel my time my time has come
Came to my town
You broke the locks, I grabbed on to you
And the headlights, and the headlines
Compassion for mine
Cause your daddy's all alone
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
As it was
Might be something you miss
And you made life more real
Diamonds, brilliant
You're probably thinking that I'm getting mad at you
Waft yourself to regions of stars and light
I carry it, your body,
Now the rain comes down the windows and it,
You are here with me
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
Before I knew how much it cost to play it safe
People get shattered in many ways
Like things we trust for if we must, we must burn them
On the flashlight and the cold fortune
There'll never be anything new
There on the cricket's singing stone
One two, one two
We sing ourselves to sleep
Prendre l'air, parler à quelqu'un
Let's figure out how to make this forever
Fell asleep under a tree,
What will you do when the drink is all gone
When I was three, and free to explore
That I'm breathing
There are very many ways
Oh, when you came back from the scene it's true, you brought a melody
That you didn't follow your dreams
All hands up, salute the Empire State
J'suis restée prostrée dans le noir
Then I'd run over to your house
And her eyes grew wider than they'd ever been
And by all that I've done wrong
I thought that you were wise, but you were otherwise
And the thought of us together
You left your dark horse in the stable
Long gone
This is just one day unseen
Is all that you can't say
Oh you look so pretty
Until the next time
Show me all your manly mystery
And I wasn't sure of you
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
And they say, it's such a funny story,
They tried to help but they didn't see you crawl
In the daylight 
You give me something to hold on to
Mutta silti onnellinen
 hindsight, but how did they know then
I said I was over you but I'm lying
I will sing out melodies
I come to rescue you
And Papa shake my hand
Until it comes again
The shadow come closer and it forces to stay
'Cause I never get it unless I'm fed it
And a bunch of fools drown in shame
All I wonder
Where are we going, nah
There's no place to hide
The way the sea reflects the sun
Drive in cab nor paint the church
L'inviter, manger plus ou moins
And your ghost will have to leave
Que le dice "Ven para acá, come una fruta y ve a nadar"
I feel it, I feel it
Isn't something that keeping a cool head can beat
For the promenade dance
With the falling rain came the scent of our times
Its wings broken so like wisdom
And who needs keys when we've got clubs
We spend the whole days all
Words that aren't enough
Reminds me of you
And I can love you till you drown
Rehabilitate some and just hide the rest,
She won't stay for long
I'll prove my love if you would let me
'Cause I didn't believe what I'd been hearing
Close your eyes, precious
You'd swear they never knew you sold your soul to the
All my life
And the feeling isn't even my time
Lights another cigarette
My heart was wrapped in clover
You say I don't deserve emotions
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
And I hope you know there never was
I'm sorry for the way I let go
On the news at night, they talk about the disappearances
And I'll be guilty for the rest of my life
Young William O'Riley, appeared in my view
Like everyone else
But I crave the light that he brings
And up until now I have swore to myself that I'm content with loneliness
And that lazy eye won't budg
Living in a home in the heart of the country
Tonight I saw her again
But we ended up pulling in around the same time keeps passin' me by
And I don't want you gone
I done been in situations when I had to cope with all three, you know what I'm sayin'
I feel it touching me,
Before too long you'll be a memory
Deep in my heart, I will remember you
And they are gone, they are gone, they are gone
It's here his love is swollen in
I'm so far away
You will know, cause it ain't hard to tell
For the women, weed and weather
How low one would not need to know
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say 
Why everyone says that I look happier
Take this feeble mind
What is missing inside me
A million miles, still no headway
Let's just turn the whole damn thing upside down 
It's colder in your bones,
And over here they need wool
We are the addicts
You come home big when you're feeling small
Left you diseased
And there's the star I used to wish on Star I used to wish on
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Feel the pulse beneath the skin
Blending in with cardboard skies
And that was where the Stones played once
We're alone again
Because when I am drinking I am out of control
The infirmary man may count me dead
Down On my knees where I met you
Picture yourself riding under the freeway
You're honest
Not an hour from her home town
But still haven't burnt any old
If you've got eyes
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
Wir lieben das Leben und sind dafür bereit
Away from my lips and the fork of my tonuge
Kings of the highway, we will be
Inside the mountain
A monkey and a man, a marching band
I don't think Santa's coming this year
The way that I am
So cold  feel your ears burn
Oh and the waves are coming in
Cannot help to save your soul
Sometimes I see myself in you
Each time I have that dream of you
Everything is still, do you think we will
An endless sigh I cannot hear
You doin' shit and front to prove to people you mean somethin'
Ride on, ride on now
Pave their way through the darkest night
Puis j'ai rencontré une jeune nana dans le train
I sacrificed myself
Come on love, love, love
Well honey that's ok
Under the wide, wide ocean
Just say you'll wait you'll wait for me
Don't they know it's the end of the world
That this love could be
He left home to find his own, now all he had is gone
The maid needs a maid
Because you're acclaim
Just give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
They look at you
The soul of the life I once had
I don't know which way I'm going
This is how my day begins
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
There's a calm under the waves so I choose to sink
And the sun is going down
Brightness fills empty space
We looked, so we found
So take my hand lets plan never to look back
And you make it worth this ride to me
And on the street he'd surely die
Filled leisure time with my inventions
And fly back out
Now where is peace and what is fair
Even when you bend to give me
Intoxicate the night
It takes a hole to make a mountain
Et toi tu ne reviendras pas
Você quis partir, e agora estou sozinho
I would've gotten much more
It's future, here's to you
Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it, down baby
'Cause my bones were made in the womb
And love is crushed like clay
Some sense of reality
When all the hard times outweigh the good
I share along the way
This was the centre of the world for me once
We give up our rest, and the best of us though
Vor dem, was da kommt,
I know that you are only one dream away
If I told a lie, if I made you cry
Of better things to come
It's  AM, she moves a little closer to you
But you can't fly unless you let your let yourself fall
I lit my fire blew my conch, nobody comes
It's so lonely through the day
I'll always be with you don't forget
Longing for a night time to bring back my youth
When everything comes apart
Cause your love is real
If it reads like a puzzle, a wandering maze
They say Spain is pretty though I've never been
Where will they go, when the jet planes can't fly
Saw you in a crowded bar, pale with hungry eyes
Springtime and turnoil
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
Look around
So stay where you are
Blinking and blind in the light
Und seh die Zukunft weit und breit 
Oh my darling, shall we dance
That's my story
A juggling of vices
Every day is the day that you save me
And the sheep are all lost in the harbour
They took you away in a police car
The lines are sinking in
Anything you want girl, we can do
She knows a good thing now
Except for Your name
Something up your sleeve
Will never see the shame
How softly, the springtime breezes sing
I can love you desperately, though your love ain't guaranteed
From the faces
In der Gedanken kreisen
An' all you love 
I hold the thought
It's closing time
You are mine
And you can still be free
A world of hate and a world of dreams
Or I'll still be standing more than likely
As we moved out of the farmlands, into the grid 
The breath to forms your words
Could that have been back in the sweet summer of 
I still dream of you
I was never one to solve whatever has gone wrong
Loneliness astounds me
And you walked away from your drink
Under your skin, wherever you go
And I still owe you
They look up without realizing that they're standing right there in the palm of your hand
Sinking self so sweet
So don't be hasty in your judgment
Oublier ces heures
 Lowered it's doors
Constant questions from the start
Did you feel your elbows tied up side by side
Though I've a faint belief in everything
Got us started up again
A long time
Strange and lovely facts for us
The homemade weapons you're fashioning
I've got to find some resistance
Lover, can you hear me breathing
For the first time I tried to really try
All of the reasons why
In our garden of love we grew
Get used to the feeling
I open my eyes in horror
And still we keep hoping
Light will fill our eyes like cats
Weathered forever
It just forces me to look at myself
Every other little time
Junto a ti creo que aumenté más de tres kilos 
If you can work some magic, we can double our paychecks, so make the s look right
Not for good or bad just not forgotten
You feel creepy like a worm
Where neither star nor moon would shine
Wave goodbye 'cause I know I'll believe if you spell it out for me
All I wanted was for you to believe in me
Weary and wasted
Keep haunting the bus with fees of favors gone
Isn't it time we get ready again
Blue skies
I was younger once and I created a lie
Jag kan offra allt jag har för ingenting
I know you had no choice
Of everything I wanted when you came along
I'm on your side 
You've left your ghost until tomorrow
'Cause we never turn out the way we thought we would
'Cause I'm midway down the midway
Iça, iça âncora vela
I got to bag it up
Quietly from the ground
If only for the last time
Too much and I fall
She's walking away, she's walking away
And while I wrestle with demons and appetites
It keeps the days alive and makes the hours fly
But five or six bring you out to the car
Hello, welcome to dialaview
I struggle to breathe
The dragon fly, and lions dance
Clear skies ahead and the dark day is done
She haunts the roads
She's my butterfly
Walking towards a light
The years will help to keep your need at bay
But there's a ghost in my heart
When I met her she was standing by a door
It's all that I'm tryin' to say 
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like this
And you're the evening star
I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow, of tomorrow
I guess it's only right
Why this now girl
Everything's in a permanent
I know that you are liquid, for I'm the governess of alone
As the sun dropped off the page
I didn't realize my strength
I'm manchild man
All that you ask for comes from dreams
Comfortable and warm
I wrote a song that I wish for you to hear
And learn to fly away
Of the absinthe minded
I walk barefoot where the water drowns the sand
I never understood how you should feel
And my heart cries out for a little bit o' love
The lovers, the dreamers and me
Ooh oohooh, oohooh ooh ooh
This ocean of youth
You come anytime you want, yeah
The bridge disappears, the deer hunt is in the frigid air
Father time
But life is not tv
Come on home
You need a dream to drown you out
Of the living people walking up and down the graves
You're right,
Everything that everyone says turns me on
Lennart Nilsson, shut off those lights
They say we're all created equal,
Now you just say, "Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him"
Comes into your face
Care about
Because the myth is not supposed to retire
Oh, beautiful son, smiling light, good morning son
Oh brother of mine 
Dismayed and fazed and maybe I assay the prize
Like lace among the rocks
Looking for a way that we can never find
That all the way from here to Mexico
Voice 
I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs
And at home, he's a leader, a father
To lose a little life with every breath
With my sunglasses they can't 
Or uncommon hearts
But once in a while
'Cause you're still here to heal what's wrong
Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
Just rewind, it's all in your mind
What I wanted to tell you, man
Something to save
Those simple words, those lover's sighs
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Tonight, our hearts will beat as one,
Has stolen one egg
Hör, die Vögel singen ein Lied
Can't accept what you did
Always watch them with bright eyes
The tunnel's now a flower bed
We can share the air pollution
Looking ahead with anticipation
We'll get through it
Let your unloved parts get loved
Morning seems so far away
Take my hand and I will mellow,
I no longer see the rings of rain
Never in a fore and only son
There is no other way
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow
Oh you say life's so unfair
Close my eyes and kick the chair to the floor
Somewhere around here
Floating right out of your hands
And the ring around the moon
All right, my man,
And deliverance has many faces
No I won't stay here no longer
So lets forgive and let this lie
Way down yonder in the old corn field
Vier Uhr zehn liegt sie am Eis
Hawk flying, is fooling his folly
Shine a light on me
O verite um calis potere | Careum deum calis potere
Deeper, deeper, deeper relax
I can't get back to where I used to be
But though you're still with me
To spend my youthful days 
Wish I learned to love you more
And the moon is a horny old drunkard
The closer you get
Moments went by when we kissed
He told us how he liked to feel it when it came out
And throws it all away
My skirt floating up around my waist
Do you feel what I feel inside
You're the one and only girl for me hehe
And all I've ever seen will be forgotten
Won't you come light the way and wash this away
By one who really loves you
Like beautiful clouds
I woke up between dawn and night,
My spine is made of iron, my heart pumps out old red paint
My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head
That you really didn't want me staying 
Y'see I always wanted one of those cars
A nervous Juliet 
But you're already underground
Don't you know that I did the things I could
My eyes look distant like you never really knew me
The stars are all, aligned
In the light of a golden calf
With a calm, calm, calm, calm fear
That I haven't seen for days
Just wanna warm my bones
Stop BITCH See you in the afterlife nigga Wait HELP
To take me back to another time
Thought you'd make me feel it
Black radio, they won't play though
Away, under the Moon
So if you dreamt of me, too
So in the end it all depends on whether you'll find
Tell me one thing I should know of your situation
Hold together all these melodies
You can put away your tool, Jemaine
Or make myself heard
Inside this room, time will stand still
Antarctica, my only living relative
I can feel your breath on my neck my love,
And that one little thing well it's driving you mad
In my life the piano sings
I will take this road much further
Our laws are fading,
And perhaps it's common fears
Watching landscape roll out 
In my head, in my heart, in my soul
May you always be
For the first time now tonight
I'll ask if I can walk you home
We've been around forever
Where the linen waves like bleached silk
Start a sick cult on mysterious islands
When he looked at you
A single bloom piercing the snowdrift
And if you saw with my eyes
You wont know me till you need me
I know after a million times you get sick of all my lines,
Stars still shine stars still shine
When I think how it would feel to finally hold your hand
It's a harmless moon
When you just can't sleep
And today, I leave you
This invisible city
You had such good ways
But all I do is fake a smile
Big dreams of elegance
Tell me, baby
And I will give to you my summer wine
You tell me that she stayed out, all alone
Now I know I can't tie your hands
There was this book I read and loved
You know, this real shit, feel this
Ay, I wanna live in the sky
There's a mirror to have a check
And tell me I'm the one you heart needs
Hold my head inside your hands
But their values could be old news
And I know this place that's near here
Did I sell my soul for this feeling
And these song words have led her to nowhere
I swore I'd be careful not to
Aus einer Welt, die scheinbar nicht verstummt
About to rain down tonight
And posters take the walls away
And we drive by fields
Of course I love you 
Your name here 
I'll say a prayer for your heart,
It's just what Judy needs a moment of release
I felt all fear and sorrow
I've been wanting to do anything for a long time
So what I am dreaming of
An eternal resting place
I'm scared and I'm alone
Bodies growing colder with the distance now
Don't you go and, let the world weigh you down
A radio in tune with the sky
I just want to say I'm so sorry 
And angels with their gray handshakes
Yes it always
Sometimes I'll hear when she's sleeping
Rush to the ground
Commas, commas in my head, man
I ain't even know what a record advance was
And Harlem River I can't breathe
I woke from a dream last night
Way down underneath
Ja diese Stadt hat nichts
I just hope that I have
And I built a home
But there's comin' home
And another day passes like a dream
I don't wanna spoil your night
From the palms of your hands
Everybody needs a place to rest
Entre o céu e o firmamento 
Walk right up to the microphone
I lay down beside him
Scarf goes out behind
Brother that I love you
Only one thing I need, all I need
When words got me down, you keep me up
I think I'll drift across the ocean now
It's tying you up while you're fadin' into your lie
On a world
When you vanish in the air
But you've made pain into something I could touch
Even though there's no one who is closer to my heart
I used to fly 
You're breaking, you're wasting me
enardecida, me congelaba y me iba
Come, go, break your bones
O come in, come in,
No longer ill at ease with the crazy people
I'm off to my home away from home
You don't see how your lies is affectin' me
That's the sound of our love dying
I know your tears wish me well
I kind of know what I want
I honestly won't give you an apology
I've been waiting an hour and the bus hasn't come
I thought I would know when the planets had aligned
Kiss the back of my neck
What are you afraid of
She took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime
Blinding lights began to set fire to our minds
It's a love you'd kill for
With your hair piled up high I will never forget
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
Storm clouds gathering beside me
Your getaway, your dream, I was everything you needed
Como se guiam os cometas
Something in the way she moves Oh, you know I need her all the time
Man it's gonna break my heart
Where winged feet will soar
I always liked being alone
Talking about their homes
You look like her smell like her
Waiting to phone me
Intending to outsmart, but I end up in refrain
Songbird's singing in an old dead tree
I said, "Please don't lie
If we don't wake up soon all we ever knew will be gone
You ready for the world girl, baby come on go with me, I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
All us people
Spider, Spider, crawl on the lake, guilty and poison free
Weakly mind, weakly
Put me on the top of the world
I dream of dreaming dreams of her
It's not over not over my friends
Over a night
I breathe the body deep
And it burns straight through but the devil don't mind
With your mocking bird hair
Away from the ears that
Were you ever called "homo" 'cause at school you took drama
But when I look in the mirror
And if one of us makes it big
That old angel may allow
Has your small amount of success gone to your head yet
Just send your heart beat, I'll go to the blue ocean floor
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
But you came at just the right time
They talk to mine behind close doors
When she said I waited all my life
To the natural truth
Respect when I'm good and love me when I'm in trouble
I wondered if the waves
It'll go around with anyone
Noone special
I heard your boys
The world is waiting to die
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
That said love would end
All your childhood crutches
Just takes a face
All these thoughts that fill my head
But I saw a man cry once
And been through my fair share of pain
It's something that I'm supposed to be
The more I drink the more I wander off
When all the world is green
If you would shine your love down here
I care about you baby, baby
That's the way it should always be
The role that he chose, the role in his home
There is no special way
I'm the last one
Dig up a bone
Whenever you're around
¿quién le va a dar una mano
They couldn't believe that shit about you
We're ready for a new age of innocence
Hanging on the washing line
I know you've read, so many books
There's no one in town I know
Down the streets I walked with you
Little girl
Speaks to a silent room
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
Like the last one
Minä kaipaan eskimoystävääni  I miss my eskimo friend
You can fly away with me
Mad intervals of mind residuals
The way you want me to
Uh darling there's me no, no use in pretending
And we may not know the reason why
I promise one day I'll be coming around
Et moi j'accoursMais comment te dire
The call your life's been issuing you
Never drew the line
But I think I must have seen a ghost
And all I seem to feel is
And his wife, he lost his life strugglin' over a gun
And if you ever come at me I will hurt you
And in those hours nobody knows our ends or beginnings
Love, everything's confused harmlessly untrue
Er wollte ein Haus bauen mit einem Zimmer für mich
You knocked on the door
If the words make their way from your mouth,
Maybe it's nothing, maybe I just need time on my own
Insult everyone that we know
Don't change a hair for me
Frightened by my feelings
And I'd whisper that I love you
And now we are through
Where the wind sings by the river
For a moment I can tell I've got you
Behind her was a vision, a painful apparition
There's something in your eyes I see;
No non rivederti più
When did we learn to speak without works
Ghosts in the air that we breath
And I trust that you love me too
And make no mistake, my friend
Would you catch me, if I fall
Warding off all evil signs
About this old coffee shop I love so much
In the tips of my fingers, in the skin on my face
You don't need a thought to look good
And all of the voices surrounding us here
I've got it going X
And I can't believe I'm nothin'
And like the doors
You smiled, and then the spell was cast
'Cause we ain't gonna lie to you
Wasting hours
Id spend the day with my angels at the beach
Their kingdom come
You bring new meaning to my life now
Are you who you say that you are
My nightmare is over
Time to sing love rhymes
Without crying
The American dream can be found here if you keep your mouth closed
Oh that we could always see
As for the clouds
When my life divides
Neighbour's always smiling with the baby on her knee
Fifteen years is almost done
Saw your picture on accident
When travelling around the world
Would leave you alone
I need to focus on the girls we gettin' currently
It breeds a world of pain
When you can't make it alone
We watched as the heat seared through our skin
Kaleidoscope and candle eyes
But that day ain't yet come
Any two can turn to one
I might smash up all the windows
I think about the girl all the time
With your kind of hesitation
We saw them lying on the kitchen floor
Generally we are alone, alone
Than to raise your voice
A specimen like you I would love to obtain
With Him so many prayers rest
While I lay, I dream we're better
I am here and I will be forever and ever
Left for you, no one else
But I don't have time to solve this
Trying to feel
Du point de vue le plus essentiel
I've come a long way to just fold back into line
As you curse and peel and pose in tears
I'm needing you there
You saved me from melting, baby
Move me to the rhythm of your heartbeat
When every things so uncertain
And I wish you Sunrays and Saturdays
Reunited for all of our lives
Because one day out there we will all be
Gasoline a burning spiral
Mas você não faz mais parte
Cause my mouth just won't work right today,
A strange kind of feeling
Just like before when I was a child
With a face full of mixed ability
You hang on but you're falling through
I've looked in the studio, study and all
When the sun is up, 
It sure feels funny but if it's so
To locate the area in which you wish to observe
Angel eyes
But I think it's you in my room
Then you beat the love right out of me
Pushes me away
Got to remember, morals and principles, reppin your name proper
It is so clear I realize and here at last I have my eyes
There's no argument
Of a lady, with no heart, playing stupid little games
Lovers will come
Sung with a chorus of tones
And I don't believe that anybody
What do I care
I lay amongst the clouds
Will you be there to carry home
Worked things out
Living next door to challenge
All we wanted for our love
We proceed in stained bed sheets
And I'll sing you to sleep and I'll sing you tomorrow
But you'll regret the day
I thought I might get one more chance
Keep the straight line
I like you more when you don't make a sound
In such disbelief I thought I was asleep when I met you
I know you're said them a  times before
At the time we thought we should
I close my eyes, you reappear
In the future I will read at night
Life owes nobody hapiness
Please don't say a word
By a hand tightening 'round your neck
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
This ain't no summer fling
Lets run away from here for good
To fall into thy chops Let others pray
You look through me just like a ghost
In the darkened corridor
It will pass in time
We dance a borrowed chick while hiding from the fine
She's underage and so very very brave
There's no one to make me realize
These are diamond tears of a rapper
What a day I have had
I get thinking I'm wasting the night away
And all are drinking from our hearts
But come back, come back in from the cold
Excusez moi my angel eyes ain't here
I sang the words I meant
Cut out all the parts that held your stain
Inside
You will be the one screaming out
Det springer råttor bakom ridån på hans estrad
You know how this shit go
On this day
Barefoot at night on the road, fireworks blooming above in the sky
To believe in yourself
I know that I lost my soul
And I simply needed space, space for me to be
Odoru shinigami all around and around me
I'll have a spring in my step
It's easily the most boring part of your week
And I dreamt of a shelter
But it all seems to function
Something left to do
I wanna sing you a love song
Greening fields and windy mines
Papa, tu ne reviendras pas
Gonna try to get caught up in a momentary lapse oh repeat several times
Can't believe or understand 
Now the deed is done
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Wander along together by the edge of the river
To speak the words
The graveyard's in the backyard
For the White King to move
I raised the sunshine
In the shadow, under the trees
Jenny pledged Kappa and she started PreLaw
And if anyone ever wondered why you did it
But night reveals what daytime hides
In the tower above the earth, 
If you do, the world will kick your ass
But we knew you were afraid
Shadow rises and you are here
I wanna be rich, and I want lots of money
Toddler screams over power the infant death rattle
Now your car's been towed
Inside a sheet of flame
They say that it's okay, but I say don't breathe in
Here, broken and cold, with great remorse
There's nowhere she could sit besides the bed,
You say you feel a chill in the season
But your mind plays tricks with distance
City streets passing by
You gotta quiet them, quiet them
The glass hidden motion 
Have the people went to the high hill
And I will come
Back and forth, back and forth"
jeder wurde für den anderen so durchsichtig
East side to the west side
Until the sun comes up
Here to face the fortune and the bile 
Would mean your life was over
Was is it everything you hoped it would be
Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
I hear you talking a lot of similarities
But I miss the blues, I'll miss the greens
What various paths are followed
Watching the day lie down instead
I'll breathe again
At the failing of the day she heard her father always say
You had light in your hands and your eyes closed
Still a baby in your hands
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
There's a chapter on God that I don't understand
You neglect your wings like you don't need them
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Is curling up and die
Angry words that were spoken when I should have wept
Or if you want to settle down and plant roses at my feet
Why everything is the same as it was
If you get my name wrong I won't get pissed off cause
Every night for a while
Humming a sad forgotten song
This is just a nightmare
I'll meet the pavements down the line somehow
Who they'll kiss before they get home
 quoi bon mentir Si tu peux me dire au revoir
 Generally we are alone
The faster you drive, the less you can feel
Until she's had her way with you
Still here in my heart
'Cause I know how it feels to be
But caught in my mind there's a way to get out 
It's gonna be a cold day
Yo, I been up the creek without a paddle, now I'm back on the saddle,
I want to feel it, if just to know it's true
Step outside yourself
And I'll be outside, waiting for you
Bad luck you've got in my ring
'Cause you're praying way too much
Täällä ilman sua ei oo mitään
There's a light in the room as you appear
Too many programs open at once
Thinkin' that life has passed them by
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
With my heart in my hand
Somewhere around here there are witches
Maybe it's about the time
Who will cast the first stone
You got no place to hide
The sidewalks are dirty
As I'm all by myself tonight not again not again
Around, around, around
I'm going to stay right here
She's happy with the way she looks, she's happy with her gender
To bring my eyes open wide
Still it's uncomfortably near
How dare you turn on me now
I hope I'll never change
But love is no big deal
Did I sell my soul for that feeling
Fearing he wouldn't approve, we made a lie that was feeble at best
I feel it
Little green men do okay
You know you robbed me of my sight, and light is what I fear 
Love in this life
And I will bear my soul in time
She was wise, full of magic and life
Gone underground
Oh Lord, why did you forsake me
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
This is what I know of shame forever
Water, so much water is under the bridge
While she's still around,
And if it ain't positive vibrations, baby, than it'll have to go
You blame for your despair
Now, I see winter's dawn
We pried open my window
I'm going to reach on up over that fear
Walking away is the hardest thing to do, but I must leave
Did you hurt your hand again last night when you fell in the snow
I always knew you in your mothers arms
There's an inner peace I own 
I'd hold you in my arms
Colour she light a reason to stay
Can you love the lily of the field
She goes by the name
Were always hard to find
Sugar, we can come alive inside your dreams tonight
It was so fresh, it was so clean
Then at midnight I
I wonder what to make of Heaven
They took it to the heart and left for the moon
Likewise, the low pressure area slides down the sides
And when I lie on top of you, I'm afraid
It all went for a good time and a song come on
Even though that night you flipped on us
Like a poor man's Boltanski
And it's the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
I held on tight and closed my eyes
They'll rock your world
Oh, was it all right, or was it okay
You did it so, uh, cheap like
Writing songs I can't believe
I'm walking down the freezing street
The road I walked home in the rain Walked home in the rain
Kill yourself to never ever stop
Ay, man, I'd like to dedicate this song to my cousin Toot
Smiling faces try to understand
He'll have to walk home tonight
I will put them all back in time
Auf diesem blauen Planten
Someday we will foresee obstacles
Than before, someone else
It doesn't matter where
We see the world through identical lenses
When he kissed me I lost everything
If the clouds move in
The drowsy islands slumber one by one
Identifies needs and feeds our desires
We don't ever have to make a sound
Baby is back on top again
You're riding alone in the back of a steamer
Not that you're the one
Write another song about how I wanted to
That I've built up in my mind
A steady bold one 
Och Jonas ska hitta en mening i nån indisk by
I was about mine, fantasize housebuying
Like sap rising or honey or tar
And the town cryer's cryin' there with nickels in his hands
From the ground
Still I go to the deepest grave, 
Don't throw away my broken telescopes
And drop down far away from it all
You made it to the dark, now you're gone
I will get burned each and every night
Run, you better run,
I'm so in love, so in love
I took a river and felt so slight so hold on
Shiver while you're breathe in,
And for a moment you feel like you're alive
The rap world like, what's all this commotion
He's in love with tragedy, in love with tragedy
You say darlin'
That you chase around
Something of a sad one
Inside out, upside down
I learned I no longer believe in surprised in surprise
But I'm alright
Is it ok if I don't come around
I will catch you if you fall
If you don't look away I won't look away
Like every night since our roads have crossed 
Come sound system make the rhythm climb
Thinking of a way to get you to stay 
But it's something I've been meaning to say to you
You feel the love I have yet to find
Every other little day
Damnit, this Cat's on a rap song
I long for solitude and peace within me
There's a golden key unlocks all the doors
Because you took it all away and, you're paralyzing me
Flies to your flame
The closing of the doors 
I think I'm close but I stand so far
Makes me feel I'm not alone
Long way down
With a loveyou line
I went riding all around
Ain't got no place to be
Out in the moonlit sky
The stars are aglow,
To every little action, yeah yeah yeah
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal
Wiping my floor, wiping my floor, yeah
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
I want your love, I need your love Too late you changed your mind
When I fall in love
This is your anthem for tonight,
When's the last time you baked me a pie
Watch her smoking cigarettes in the street
No, no, you just loved the boy too well
Made a terrible beauty
All the weapons of war we despise
Your heart was pure like youth and all it's charms
All of the moments you didn't notice;
Offer me a love so deep
So if your thinking I don't care as much
They can say anything they want to say 
It feels like
I climbed this hill watching so still
I watch the window and listen for the sound of cars
Gostar de quem gosta de mim
I would sure love believing,
Sweet Mary of silence
Don't know what I'm doing this time around
Didn't know I was lost
Involved in making plans for my soul
Love is ended before it's begun
Cages and alarms
Where a man only lives to die
Open this shit nigga
Go up the top floor
If this was my last day
I'll be with you even though we're apart
Ob die Welt sich ewig dreht
Now all of them feel sympathy
Now I stole the moon
We were down at dead man's hill
'Cause you'r egonna be housebound there
I've loved without loss, I've put down my cross
And I can't extract the pain you're going through
And everything you love in life
No days were the same
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be well, well, well, well Yes it will, oh, yes it will
Gonna keep on moving on up, I got to stand my ground
The kids all holler carols 'cross the water
I still know you
Now we'll make a life
But the noontime makes me tired
So sing your life
Floating over the ocean blue
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee
Arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,
Anytime she goes away, Anytime she goes away
Shaking hands shake their heads
Drop a feather in the water
That although  years had past
Or how a broken heart can mend
White wash lies
Don't remember the look on his face, but I remember
Laten we samen
She's doesn't deserve to be in a place like this
It won't matter now
Once told, never burn out, it's best to fade away
In twilight she's a constant blur
And as you move on, remember me
Frozen, the ground refused to die
Until tonight
Can you feel my heart in the palm of your hand 
Tillbaka till sitt flickrum, hem till mor
Now you're too tired to care
Turning the tide of our lives
Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you
If your gonna play with fire, then you're gonna get burnt
Heavy rains made it hard to load
But we'll learn just what things are like outside our heads
So you don't talk
Ou será que foi dela o que eu já amei
It's getting late
Because you're real
Christmas night, it clutched the light
We will disturb you, to make you talk again
The cold coming through the walls
Then good luck came aknocking at my door
No need to breakdown
And the empty space
Who's fallen for you
Chewy chop nobody knew where we were a letter dropped to the floor
If you're searching the lines for a point, well you've probably missed it
Listening to the sound
As he came up out of the night
And see how empty your life will be without me
Well I don't mind I don't mind How could I mind
They can bend it all they want
We'd never get it back
Eu disse funk lá no Morro da Mangueira
Here I go, look at me run
One more chance to gaze into those innocent eyes 
From what's broken inside
You stole my passion, burned my everything
A painting of a city on a hotel wall
Haunted by ghosts the evil force of mystery
Kid, please try harder while you can
Someone to love me
And when the sun runs out
Sitting up you're counting up your names
Love the light and yellow shadow girls
Listen to the sound of silence feel the freedom of peace
Send them home
And cross sidewalks with an earful of white noise
In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel 
An RCA 'cause I need the parts
I'll keep a smile 'til my last breath
Why make up a lie
My hands are shaking,
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Oh, isn't it time
Only I don't know how they got out, dear
Hold my hand through the thick and thin
I close my eyes and feel the stress
Won't you come back to my heart
Get a clean slate and maybe we can buy a thrill
I've got this one fresh second, one fresh minute, one fresh hour of my day 
Give You all of my cares
They never tell you truth is subjective
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
You go to new places
Pictures on the mirrors
I wonder if my seed will find purchase in your soil
Last on my list  and then I quit  to kiss your lips and weep
It falls flat and it makes you crazy
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
He's nude as the news, nude as the news
There's no room in this town
So many days in the wind, let them roll on by
And visits us in sleep
That I get what it's about
Baby, baby all the time
Then the room turns bright
Destiny turned her face
Oh, no, you didn't have to laugh that way
This ain't the way you wanna live
Since you've been around
Wait for one more sunrise
Cease fire
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown
Waking and dreaming
Thinkin' that life has left them dry
I work all day and I wanna fight
And if we died right now
I was just so happy in your boxers and your tshirt
I don't wanna die
It's a perfect night
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so you will listen when I say baby
You're making it worse now every time you criticize
I was beautiful with all my lights
Hell, no reason, go on and scream
My love
And though I hate this, I'll still want you,
It's mine
And as for the clouds
Tell me what you are thinking and guide me
Used paperbacked living bible
And I will show you a lover,
I feel it by degrees
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
He's happy so leave him alone
I remember who you are
By the time you turn around
You are the lonely one
Give my life until it all runs out
It may be tonight
All III want is your love
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 's and I do it well, well, well, well
If I spoke your name
Trying to be your friend
Suspicious corpse without a face
Have you seen that moonfaced kid
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer 
And we're standing on top of our hopes and fears
Shell made out of gold
Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
We get by, we'll get by
I love the way you smile
Can't even tell me what of me you need
That you've got so far
Still don't know if you're near or far
I drove it right on down the street
What is truth
The fog was getting closer
That's how I know you are the one
With a burning wish to fly away
Of love and dreams to share
Got that new song on repeat, oh oh
I'm going from strange to stranger every year
Swept back to me
These are the ones
This broken place
Shake your head
She leaves her work and quits her job
A madeup story to fit the pictureperfect world
And you gave sense to my life too
It used to be lonely in numbers, impossibly weak on my feet
They've got 'em buried deep
As rockets flower overhead
A  domiciles fixes de Brest à Budapest
Says it gets old real quick
Pou'n ka we demen
I've been told I will be there in time
Every night in motion together apart
Give me back your glance, give me back romance
And tried hard to capture his breath
Haze garden pure strain highway
Mit unter , mitunter glücklich
If it fades away, come back another day
All of the firefighters put out my fires
Yeah, the summer count can come
Is longer than it looks from where we stand
Lies in the hands that set me
I don't care about clever, I don't care about funny
One step down
Beyond the moon
What's on your mind yeah Darling what are you thinking
We're all misunderstood
It's only father feathers
I can see right through myself, crystal clear
I'm running late
Madison Avenue's claim to fame in a trainer bra with eyes like rain
And it chills to the bone
When the dam breaks down and the city is covered in water
As scenery to his dreams for sale
Wipe your tears from your sweet face
In fagend weeks before I left for school
And we've finished all our songs
The band is playing our song again
I just run run run
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Memai ni dakare all around and around me
We'd forgotten one another
Surrender and be witness
Run along beside me
Raise your voice and close your eyes
Far past these roads there is a place
Down, to reconsider, I'll stay if you can make a promise though
If you need it I want you to
Until the girls all take their clothes off
I wish I could say what words won't amount to,
Is for their mothers and their daughters
I will make it all up to thee
I know that baby we would disagree constitly on the basic things we did, we did
And the people breathe so easily
And the lives that you hold in the palm of your hand
May your days be golden
And she say, muhfucka, yo mama's a bitch
Harmony, boys, is what we believe in
This essential child
Don't you mind, don't you mind
Our gun was still smoking
And it's changing the view
Well I held you with our undry eyes
Or turn away
But I missed those hills with the windy pines
And I always will love you Marie
That things are reminding me of you
Hear my song and please bring him to me
There's only one way
I'll wait with you a while
Where will I go when my broken body dies
With the poker face
Everything you hold can come
This fool you love somehow is here with you
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I know more about this man
May we never fall back to ground
You just merely got it all wrong
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
Don't just let life pass Don't let it pass you by
We started with a promise built on highs
Program director on the radio won't play my record until the caller tell him so
You know our love is stronger than pride oh
But the alcohol didn't let her understand
And give in to the man
Don't leave me stranded in your arms
I lay still in the fire
Leaving them in silence
My memory's a broken machine
He slaloms round beer cans in his escape
Where the bars are filled with people
Headed for Oklahoma, I was ridin' night and day
It is pinching the flame
All the money I owe to my friends
And compared your Jesus to a thief
My great love
And I can guess how I want to be loved
Far too many of you dying
I got a light bulb full of anger
So we can go away to a happy day
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Feeling mountains rising out of makebelieve seas, creating typhoons
When the sun shines down the hills the winds blow
Did you hear me laughing in your head, when I saw you stuck in a rut again
But time will show
So we forgot to fall apart that day
And they're gonna make a Death Star,
Beware of the need for help
I've searched the world
I'ma plan to make it, a prisoner of the state
About a boy
I wish you were around
There's still a place I wanta be
I can shine even in the darkness
Sleep all day, it's fine
And if I could believe what I want to believe
The show is rolling before my eyes
I never knew this is the way it goes
You're mumbling words with a lazy tongue
In my room with the curtains drawn
Unwanted, late September when you are eager to find
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
Refrain
I went to LA the next day
No I never meant to cause you pain
You've got me all tied up to the whipping tree
It was you who said 
And look at what we've got
You keep leading me all the way home
And sometimes wish your room
The ice is tinkling like a wind chime
Are the things that distinguish him as an adult
This one time I flip, call the radio
I walk away
I feel, I feel so scared
Are you late It's always hate, troubles in your mind
Not coming home
I heard you on the radio, I couldn't help but smile 
Oh I still remember when you
But only in here I get to see you again
Of mountains strong
Mit dem Mofa nach England,
And after it was over
Dizem que não sirvo pra gostar de ninguém
They come to me
Down, to revisit the dearest of my kinfolk
Still won't leave you alone
Oh, there's the night, oh what a shame
und wir können spüren wie sie die Form verlieren
It's tearing the very heart of me
While I change the wings
Half wishing you could start again
Echoes start as a cross in you,
Hey, where the hell are you, you don't call me back, John
Gefðu hugsun þína
If there's a scream inside of you just let it go
Perché domani sarà un giorno incerto di nuvole e sole
With ash in your mouth
No requests and no orders
That he'll be back someday 
Got a woman at home
Trains and winter rains
And did you ever notice
Scared of a world outside
My mother doesn't love you
The past is gone
The snow fell hard from five to five
The one who loved my tired bones
Hiljaiseen käytävään odotan sun askelia
I don't mind
Don't forget the tune
Baby be careful, what's fixed as one breaks in two
But keep at least from now till then
But never a lie
How long 'til I don't feel
It's starting to envelope
Sell it all, tell 'em hell is nothing but a cell wall
Wir sind die Clowns
And you cared
But I really do believe that
At six in the morning the ice in the tree thaws into the millpond returns to the deep I caress where my lover once lay by my side before I turned inwards and forced her to fly we try to connect with the people outside they pass through our slumber like trains in the night I caress where my lover once lay by my side before I turned inwards and forced her to fly after the cold night the raindrops that froze melt into the thin air like the footsteps of ghosts I caress where my lover once lay by my side before I turned inwards and forced her to fly for she could not know me for I know not myself and without understanding love isn't enough
Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war,
I wouldn't have it any other way
No one's gonna bring me down
Bullseye hung on your soul
'Cause I believe we fly
Cleverly concealing primal urges often felt but rarely seen
I just need you to know me
O love, O love, O careless love
Let the fire take the fire
We're all goin' places
Turning to fall, I owed all my life
Always dangerous, she got me down on my knees
I think I see you standing outside
Boy the way home will fade and be so hard to find,
It was way better than sex, now, now
Keep your self onside ny son and the world is yours
You kept it together today 
Down we fall
When you dove drunk with sleep in your eyes
But we are nothing
You give me a reason to face every day
When their game made it so oh look alike, look alike
Should I be afraid of this face that I see
Take an inside look on the outside
It rained because I took the dust of
You broke your back to make it okay
I know low and I know fear
I remember how you freed your hair
I've met your ghost, yes, he's proposed
Picture me in a boat on the sea
We say Goodbye
My summer wine is really made from all these things
When all else in you turns and runs
The only thing is that I didn't
Every day breaks, bitter river was a flood
You feel that way too
Who let you eat in my face
How long have I been in this storm
You don't have to say a word, it's crystal clear
That shines brightly, yes 
When I drink my rivers, drag my feet, and drown in my dreams
When no one cares but you
When you're around, better I feel
Fly girl shouts to keep it down 
I could wait with you by the water
And no matter what I do yeah
With everything moving away too fast
Is it's so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
Something I never would have known
Made of cinder block
And sweet babies cry for the cool taste of milking
I'll put the shadows
Only living
And love was breaking your heart
It's like she's been away for years
Scenes of summer skies
You must follow your heart
I'm two steps away from falling
I won't call you cause of your new friend
That no one wants to hear
Yeah, I couldn't believe my ear
For the moment to come
Gonna be the beauty of County Galway
Your looks are laughable
There are no saviors in technology just quick fixes
If I could just draw a line under this stupid way of life
I let the dance of nature inspire me
Y aprendí a quitarle al tiempo los segundos 
The littlest things that take me there
Where the words jump off my pen and into your pages
Goodnight my brother
Well, they'll never believe it 
So you're proud to be a good one
Dig deeper
Think of all the places we could be
I used to know this woman who had the most beautiful tattoos
No strumming of strings and no stamping of feet
I miss you in my front seat
I don't wanna see your face at my door
Prendre un thé, et puis prendre un bain
Well, it's got to be strong to touch my heart
Imagine the wind in your hair
How I love you so
Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it
"You could be waiting your whole life
And I'm swept away by the wind
I've got half a mind to close my eyes and let the string go, sailing the wind
Spills on a tablecloth
You will allow a low light
Jump off the end
I asked a tedious guy if he'd tell me your name
Back back back in the dark of your mind
Oh look but there I go again,
wo uns niemand sucht, wo uns niemand sucht
I need a little more time with you, oh
But a free ride on
Please believe me
And wooden shell 
Would I dare to be alone
Mother, mother
Hennessey and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Like you've had a hard day
That's a thought I could not bear
And I know my mind is gone
Drinkin' tea in bed, watching DVDs
I think of you and everything's okay
Tell me that you love me
I think separation is OK, you're no star to guide me anyway
mysteries, music, birth,
I thought I would know what to do when the time came
We watch for bonfires in the sky
Sailing to the sun
How did you know
I don't need anyone else
Whatever road to take
Means that everything I touch breaks
I would'nt blame you if you turned away
She says it's an opportunity I don't want to miss
They forgot about me
Can't change my mind
Every mouth that you press against
And throw them in the air
You have a lovely singing voice
I never thought that time could get so far 
Bread and red wine
Would you feel the same
One of my best friends from back in the day
The social strain is watching you out with all your friends
It's lame because it fell above the needs of this
Härjar ute mitt i natten, vad han gör det vete katten
Go right at the first stoplight 
To drive it away 
The houses at night
It takes a thought to make a word
Like me, she feels uncomfortable in the clothing of her ancestors
I'd also like to dedicate this to my homeboy JRue
I know how you feel
For each one of 'em I've hurt and every time I've been burned
A kinda sense for these things,
To show me you were on my side,
Just keep scratching our eyes out
Yeah, I'm alright, I'm alright, baby, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright
I wanna be the gold underneath the stream
Spectacular girl
You may think I might be crazy
C'mon baby let's go
Die Geschichte war
To fight the feeling
But I have work to carry so to speak
I thought I felt your shape but I was wrong
And I can feel all the nerves in the tips of my teeth
Do not forget the light that doesn't make you crawl
If I can close my eyes without a fear
I took a river and it wouldn't let go
Caixa, bumbo e sexo
This is no terror ground
And who needs peace when we've gone above
One more dollar and I'm going home
To ease my troubled mind
Oohoohooh, oohoohooh
If you conjure up a fear
hat sich einen Dame vielleicht gewundert
As I'll have to already child
You give me direction, you show me the way
A tinkling piano in the next apartment 
Around the world my army of lovers
Laten we samen niet bestaan
Your shoulders and
Stop trying to change me
And I guess you might be right
Perhaps a stranger she could love
Let's down our drinks and say goodnight
How we stayed awake all night long
My heart remais
We're in a natural spring
A wire away from touching
As if the city speed
So lay back, and let me massage you, everywhere now
I was selfdeluded
They say heaven was in tune, your point of view,
When he offered his name
O senso, o ritmo habitual
She was a tangle of questions
In the ribbon of her mantle, there I did behold,
If I was gone if this was my last day on earth earth earth earth
But I've a feeling you won't look at me that way
Somewhere so far away
It all just seems like yesterday Seems like yesterday
Check to see who's around first
'Cause your presence still lingers here
Ooh ooh ooh, oohooh
I know you didn't bring me out here to drown
I was wrong, I didn't know anything at all
I stand, and I wait
Never will you hear them asking why
They're swept away
They saved my life
Well this is something else, who would comprehend
I try not to seem too depressed these days
Set themselves between the blades of grass,
I fell asleep on the table with your picture in hand
Somebody tell her  sshhh
I miss the days when we were crazy in love
Won't you let me see the world
You ain't the star you were, fuckin' the same hoes no more
The world is yours
Straightbacked chairs this is where we started each night you made me do it
Nothing's changed
No, I never wasted my time 
You didn't know how to dance
We got to hold on
Through your eyes I swallow flowers
Yonghwasoge yonin dulchorom gobaek haryogo
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall,
Remember what you started with
The way you drive honey scares the hell out of me
Fills you with light
Awake all night worried for
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
Now we see everything that's going wrong
If there's a glipse of it
There are women with no meaning to their names when we say them
With my tongue I touch your mind
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
No house to hide inside,
It was custom built for all niggaz like you lid closes
You and me created something special
Chase floating fish through space and time
The sound is the best I have heard for a million years
Backbeat the word is on the street
Were the only thing could guide her gold
Set free this soul of mine
Through the night we swim
Like I miss the ocean when I go to sleep; 
Bin ich der ich war,
And I'll dream a better dream for you
We're getting dead and it's the right way
And, now, for a time,
My tongue is scaling the north face of the neck
You have lost yourself in dreaming
Amongst us animals and freaks
You know we keep talking but it's so frustrating
This country's starved, it's void of feeling
It's gonna pass in time
In the other night
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
With a wink of your eye,
In previous lives, we were frozen sticks
Such spirit through the year
Did you understand I don't have a choice
Deep breaths
Never alone
Your mouth is watering as you imagine
I was made to keep your body warm
When it speaks, you know you will hear my name
Nobody compliments the meal
I get so nervous I'm feeling sick
Thinkin' I've been fienin' for a taste of this shit
You can trust and love again
And enemies and friends
I've got to say that it is kind of funny 
I'm looking at the telephone
I forget how to begin it
Shuddering in myself myself
When the dog bites,
Not to say today
Like 'We'll meet again' and 'Fuck the man'
Soaked in the sound that rose from the ground
Though you took her for a fool
Than me, trust me your eyes will be ok it will be all right
All these kids have gone astray
This voluntary state of apart
Sleeping by the Spanish steps tonight
Remember I breathe, I breathe
And run with me
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
But I thought you might
Colors fade in the night sky
'Cause I know I won't ever see those eyes
I forgot everything I knew
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel
Once more I can't breathe
How you held me tight, each and every night
 AM and someone calls you on the telephone
No one got raped here but the pain's still inside
I need you, you want me
But tonight we feel like stars
OK, I'm a bit intoxicated, but really I just graduated
Summon
Dust has settled over everything
People comment around us
Jag saknar dig mindre och mindre 
In the heart of the country
And all I can say is you saved me
Light that has given way
I'm dating ancient ghosts
I done set it aside
A life that's not meant to be
This boy I know lives in a bell jar
And a world at the window
I haven't felt like this in so many moons
Was brauchen wir zur Erinnerung Einen marmornen Engel Eine Steinplatte, auf der die Taten verzeichnet sind Eine pharaonengleiche Pyramide Ein schlichtes Blumengebinde Ein Splitter im Herzen Ein Gedicht
Don't cry 
The signs were around
Today we will sell our uniform
Under the covers you'll be
She tells me things that were not her fault
Rushing toward a face I can't divine as yet
Did you ever read the words
All dressed up like you're in some kind of rage
'Til we die
I try to smile but I can't remember
They hammered the soil, asking for answers in green
If you can't change your mind
How could anyone tell them that some things are not what they seem
So I did him in
The radiator sprung a leak
Carnelian stars and the bars down below
I knew the years would move quickly,
Nobody else above you
There are sentences served in a prison I built out of lies
Counting the passing hours
You know I miss her and think about her all night long
There's been a long honeymoon
Said not to go right now
Don't make a think about the bad kind
And I don't fear death
I desire the simple things
Get somebody to, ah, come come on to you
Could ever feel as unaligned
Stood in the rain to feel the part
Just get out and do your best
We go blind when the stakes are high
I found out I'm not the man
Don't like to feel out of control
Deep in my heart, that's where the knot comes loose
Your love for me turned cold
And with empty stomachs and hungry eyes
You whisper signs
"I hated everyone" said the sun
But my sentimental melody 
Downtown
I told you what I feel most
It's the season of the witch, it's the season of the spin
"Thank you because you loved me and so, ami
Are the details in the fabric Hold your own, know your name
We'll start with that new future superstore and steal all their
Were the only three people who ever really lived in Las Vegas
Born without a family
But you and I know the reason why
I've never taken the fall for deceit
'Cause lady and I, we could not stop
It may seem a little hollow
Looks like everybody knows
Your heart was made of steel
It was just right time
Blossoms in her lover's arms once more
Spent a year on the road
It was darker than English moss, green like the soft frills of a peacock's plume
I've been alone all along
So you take a little something
Your burdens couldn't win or lose a thing
That lit my life
You're sweet as green apples
It's in my skin
And burn them good, real friends they would be understanding if
And stop this motion from slowing
So many worlds inside her eyes
That wasn't how he liked to have his teeth pulled out
Trade this hard heart for tears
You make me want to cry
Well, sometimes it's just easier to let yourself drown 
The waves are bigger than normal
Coming back to you
Spoken Frankie, where ever you are, I love you
In his eyes
I never find the words to let you know
Everything has to end, you'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
para poder verte a horas no adecuadas 
I will find something more
Never no more to ever call your name
And all the senses rise against this
Happy it was you I'm photographing
Concrete girl
'Cause the baby isn't old enought to speak
You say that you're still not free
So call up, call up I wanna hear the performance
Her rhinestonestudded moniker says, "Irene"
"No reason to get excited"
There we were heaven sent
With bitter bile and heartless fun
We will find you a sweet wife
Make it feel alright
Only love can be both heaven and hell
We could spend a lifetime
Preserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day
Still we're deep in each other's hearts 
I cut myself on barbed wire, getting wood for the fire
And find the romance
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Homewards, he dealed with scarecrows
But I never look back Never look back
E volta e meia Eu entro com meu carro pela contramão
Because there's nothing to mend
Getting closer
I remember cats on fire
When the chill creeps in your blood,
I'm talking Juice Crew, not what the word define
Muted whisper of the things you feel
Take him down, all his way
In this world of wisdom
A man of your success
And you're right here by my side
Some pity me, yeah
Tu mente lla no sabe a donde ir
I don't know where it's gone
Dirt under my shoe from the old at heart
Life was full and fruitful
And the newsboy yell
Undead audio, yes we'll be singing today
And I feel homeless
Stay till the morning and the world just might get by
Into a time of your design
And all your shirts and jeans and things
It's all over your face
To my brothers that's on the corner
I'm gone, you're still there
I know I may be dreaming
Naked, the Judas in me fell by the tracks but he lifted me high
You were once my friend
I look high, I look low
If the world is cold, but the sun shines the same
And you're always on my mind
And your tongue's still shaking
I'll cross this hopeless line
I was strong
So come on in, take me on
As you rapturously commanded
But I can't get over how the sun looks on your face
We took the walk alone
It may seem
Well one of them is mine
So come and rescue me
I�m gonna get there, I�m telling you sir
Such a beautiful view with a long way to fall
Maybe I'm still hurting
Killing swans with twentyone guns
Has shaped her to what she is today
You fed me with lies
Give me shelter or show me heart
Ten times a day ten times a day
Sleeping together in the lion's den
I drove my car on June th
We'll never change
I waited for you but I never told you where I was
Under fluorescent lights
My ṗremonition of the world comes to me
I love the way you stalk
I am wasting without you
She's always shining
und wir kennen die Gegenstände
And then you know you better make up your mind
And abandoned, shy
Your sea of doubt become your own belief
What is in this air
The one I miss forever
I'm walking on the salty air
We'd make ashes of our clothes
Feel closer now
A moonfaced girl with eyes downturned
Can you love the lily of the field
Call in the reinforcements
And laid the foundation for this handful of rhymes well I have left the frustration behind my eyes
I built a wall inside out of a lie
I won't deny the pain
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I nod or I shake your hand
Voice of Regina Spektor Jenny, um, I don't know if that's you, because that didn't sound like you, but you know, it's a funny world where machines could replace people Whoever that was, tell Jenny that Regina called her And PS I can't believe what he did
Pacing deserted roads to find
What the hell babe,
It's time to be with somebody else
I'm ashamed, and I need for you to know
Some, three W's only for a three day run, bitch
It could all end tonight
And take me through another night
Sunshine, won't you be my mother
Some surrogate brother I wanted to be
This is the youths actually saying to themself, 
In the middle of a wrong, dark road
I stand corrected, how well you read
This your song to sing All of our debts 
With never time to say
Beauty never dies
Said even though I know that the gangsters move in silence
No, I cannot steal a pair of jeans off a clothesline for you
What flies, what flies symbolize,
There's nothing left to say
You give me fire, you give me fire
Ich sagte ab, denn ich war auf Wohnungssuche
Swept back
I just want you to believe
I would not have come home this year
We'd spend out days travelin'
'Cause the record bin's been replaced
And then I hear the voices call
Officer
When you and I could still be friends
Swimming to the surface like a
While you got the energy
That's what you told your mother, didn't you
Each step is moving, it's moving me up
That's no way to treat an enemy
When you come round my love, I'll be gone, finally done
What lives underneath
Thought love had passed me by
You know, I was talkin' to this girl
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
We stay until morning, and promise to fight for our fates
Focus on the light
Things will shortly get completely out of hand
You look around each corner
She acts just like a nurse with all the other guys
Besides every time I see you
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching
And though you play alone, you never get lonely, you never get bored
She sang the blues
I mean something to you
The one with "I do"
There was a man in our time 
And remember what your mother said
Mom'll find me by the river
Putting on jackets way too thin
And hold the earth in place
Back to what you really believe
That you get what it's about
And I believe in the secrets you're keeping
There might be rain, but not for certain
And in my pearl and diamond shoes
Break it, 'cause honestly the lie "I try tirelessly" is cowardice
Makin' you feel blue
Bend to squares five to six times
But home never meant very much to us anyway
So we don't know anything
I've looked everywhere, Mr Forbes
The old man used to do a lot of things
Restaurant talk of pick your teeth
We didn't lose, we didn't win
Terry Callier
And showed me how to love unselfishly
But it takes you years to know what love is
The water's edge is all I have
Your day fell apart
The bridge looked so high
A smile, if you dare ooh
Laten we samen 
And I had no place else to go
The murdered thing
I'll remember who you are
Across a clear blue sky
Dead water lies
Never will it show, sweet child of mine
From a friend
I've wandered 'round isles
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
Crankin' up the tunes
She deserves all she gets
The master races, the chosen people
We are surrounded by all of these lies
This relationship, it even got me back to drinkin'
But the sadness in your eyes won't go away
Know you like I know my garden
Keeping out of trouble, never learning nothing
Wouldn't even care but now you're here to see
Waiting on the final word
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I believe in the way that you move
E minha mente voa                       x
Makes me want to give you my heart ooh
Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the sea
Mm, hey little bird  hey little bird
Bye Bye baby, so long next time
She was like Shakespeare's Juliet
It's just hard sometimes, it's so hard sometimes
At night
Standing underneath the night
Can't look below me, or something will throw me
I should do whatever will make you feel secure
He'll play a Beatles tune
You've got to get through and lift the roof off your soul
They're the ones who'll spit at you
Like the moth flies to the light 
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lyin' though
While I'm layin' back and smoking on my cannabis
We'd be better off alone
Beat like a rug, ashed out and clubbed
And dances with your little woman body
Now it's dead on the dancefloor
And I knew too well
Who were born under calico skies
A hurricane occurs when high pressure and low pressure masses of air
What the ocean gives the sky will take
Pushed him far away
Bend the words to make it right
Looking through the junkyard of your heart
With the memory of another day
Yeah you done me wrong
Got a nice BM that he drives all over town
Like "I love you", "I love you"
To say goodbye to life on earth
Is calling out your name
I nearly died from hospitality
I said angel of mercy I'm alive or am I dead
I'm begging you please, oh please don't leave here
You're so far away
When she was seven years old she saw a man get shot, but
All that I am, yeah
You could get yourself in trouble
Since I met you my basement has started to bleed
, years beside myself
Cause someday we may have to part
But you always will be the only one
Med grabbar som han kallar bröder
Better call the undertaker,
And says "Better go home son, and make up your mind"
You can't hold him back
Really I be on bended knee really id be on bended knee
And gun lead to mothers
Ooh, would you please lay your body next to mine, ah yeah
He'll soon be at your side
Trust me and don't keep that on the inside
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
There's no time to sink
You don't make it easy
And a gold world for me
The lameness of an unborn child
And further away from my home
My worth is the look in your eyes
All alone and bad
There was a dead mouse in your arms
And as her body lay there she decided to stay there
I see you on the street in company
Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And I sometimes save the day
And solemnly swear when there's love in the air
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
Hair is falling to the ground 
Loving you, is the world that's strange,
Stitch it up and pray the kid recover nicely
Like a crooked tree
From the bruise of her lips
Thin pixelations
September, keeping kite time together we summon the wind
Waving its arm as the wind blows by
Then I drew your eyes very blue
And the breeze takes us deeper and further into the heart of a moment that is gone
The voice might be one and the same
No fear that I'll be fading out alone
I can see all obstacles in my way
This is taking you away from me
But I've got myself to protect
In the drive onto me
With rap dudes, thinking wow she moved me
But in the end
I heard people die while they're trying to find them
Blinded by the cold
Like a holy rolling stone
Not a hand, not a finger
I lost my mind, I lost my life
That have lived a thousand years
So come over
He fell in love with his best friend
But I saw man cry once, down on his knees
Miles away from my heart
I got jacked in a really bad way
So when you were mine
Let's take a walk down your old street
And all I have to do today
Does it say, "Pick out your cloud"
You were like an angel
And until I'm with you, I'll carry on
Close to fulfilment
You might as well smile,
I'd switch us around and
I never really knew how to move you
And we are leaving some things unsaid
Nothing lasting within inside
Things are never twice the same anyway
On what a pair we'd make
But don't take her out of my life
Take your time and back up a little bit
Raindrops wash it from the walk
Like my love
Then why do you always cry
They taught us how to feel, but we just feel numb
Oh I'm gonna take it all away, baby
He calls the wind to guide him on his mission
My girl's got a big mouth, with which she blabbers a lot
Well, open up your heart and let this fool rush in
I don't want to make a movement
He's so far away
I'm too scared to breathe; I might do something wrong
Around the fire, here we go
And the cabin was filled with an unearthly glow 
The whole world round
But something keeps me hanging on something keeps me hanging on
I hold you in like a deep breath
On the fallen snow
I don't get
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
And bitter sometimes
I hoped to be singing to someone new by now
And when you're dreaming
Take all the red paint, take all the white
Disneyworld to Yellowknife
I hear the sound of water flowing down the stream
Her leaves reaching for my head
So lately you've been hiding  it was somewhere in the news
"Baby come on home", daddy needs baby
Reconsider what could be done
These golden eyes
There's a boom echoes in my heart
Sleep in silence, reshape, today
But in the end it's still so lonely
She remembered the beauty
Till I moved so far away
Don't you remind me of someone 
Go to waste in
Then we turned on CNN, watched the towers fall again
All you have to do is move your body
The ache I feel inside
Fly away on your silver wings
We died just before him
Is making any sense
Oh please, just a little more time with you
Heard a gruesome story
I want them to stay
So the natural thought
That you are slowly killing me
So I ate Minithins to stay awake
So many days
Wise in the ways of the heart
Shut in behind your young girl's face 
This day
Pancho to me our friendship means more
The sadness that comes in the mornings will be washed away
Pounding brain
It's affection always
And I love you with a love so tender
We'll be together in time
Swims through your eyes
For all men to be one
He takes his chance with what he's got
And overspilling my runneth cup
And the swans are all huddled together
It's so funny
I dream at night ha
We can't hide the end
River runnin' free, you know how I feel
Tearing my utopian fiction apart as it happens to just pass along
There's still luck that you can find
Long long way to the top
I'm not sure I belong here anyway
Oh sister, I am stumbling again
You know how much I'mma make it work You know her trust livin' in her purse
As cool as a sigh, as murderous as something you say
Beating a path down the alleyway
And his modest home
I could see your heart, through your eyes
Der doch dem Meer den Regen bringt
So that we could make much of You
No matter how many mile away you are
Once again I am left out of breath
It makes me worry
That includes myself man
Perhaps your soldier lad is lost 
Captain of my feelings
My heart stops running
Secretly this feels right to me
My heart is weak
On the crossroad to the devil, I'll dwell and I'll count my years
Until the tyrants are dead and the patriots are swallowed whole
His song's too blue to fly
And don't it feel all right, and don't it feel so nice
I pretended that somehow you'd really stay
And I missed my stop it was  blocks back
And do that sweet, sweet thing
It is something that's inside of you and me 
What's happenin', man
And they wonder why you're frustrated
I want your love
It's like running around the evasive ground
And love without a dream it will not survive
I can be questioning my thoughts
Who spends the facts of his life like small change on strangers
Sign of the time, you won't even call it a crime
und wir erkennen das perfekte Glück
Is forever over now
Oh, my love
Generally we are a lonely people
And now I'm left with nothing
At the end of this burning world
The world is awake
Late in the night
It brings me back to my childhood
Id crack the ground as your struggle for sound leaps
Ah but you did slip 
The setting sun is never feared
In my dream you're playing with buckets of sand
Chains are rattling in the attic again
Multicoloured, barely reputable
Frozen under you
Like a moth on love's bright light
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
They're lined up at the window, peer down into limbo
I want to live where soul meets body
Your inevitable love song
"Baby come home"
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell
Swimming Watching concrete eat the ocean
And you're keeping her up at night
By the season
We're feeling more apart
But darkness descends once more into my life
This is the line that we cross
Ought to be on my way
The weight of the world, already too much to bear
Take every moment, you know that you own them
To mine their freedom out
The misconstrued my answers due to the lack of love, reason
For the Lord's gonna come in his heavenly airplane
Could never have had too many of these
Bless you wherever you are
I'll never amount to anything
Any word of affection
And the more we move ahead the more we're stuck in rewind
Nothing told us where we were unconscious fell
And the road you traveled leads to a dead end
I cannot kneel, I'm out of time
Now I'll have to go back to that place I know best
If you're scared, I'm here beside you,
Call me raincheck in the afternoon
Make her make me mean more
"You're somebody's baby"
That may never be
She the girl in the movie and I'm the hero
The light shines on
And I hope that you're dreaming of me
That time won't heal a broken hearted
And she pinned back her hair Shouldered with care 
If time is all I had
And it's your life
Brings memories back when you were here
Can't get enough
And his scaly glass shards
Oh with the wave of her hand
Butterflies
And I must of said the the right things
I've been up at nights to paint the house ghost white
You brighten up the moon and the stars at night
There was a time, don't you forget, when I was green and you were red
Falling in love and going into the red 
We're just better off apart
And I hated that you've gone away so far
I know I can fly
Oh you, you, it's always you, 
Mom may never understand why baby's come and gone
Promised you You believed me 
Winter drives
Before you turn, something to ponder in your heart
'Cause I believe in silence, x
And you kept it like a ghost forever
Put it away, wait 'til tomorrow
Spend all that you earn
When we said goodbye
Well this heart is on wheels tonight
A spill will blister, learn not to leave skin exposed
On my face
And I am come to you
And memories of distant days come to life again
Now it makes me sad
And she slurs, "No no, just one more"
I've come home
But who are they to judge us
To be with yourself, take all the blood you want
Take a minute, take a moment, realise
Last night I saw your shadow
Tearin' up the Beltway
Tonight I won't say tonight it's ok
Lorsqu'on voudrait qu'il reste droit
We turn our backs to end of time
Yes you say life's so unfair
One night
Und so verkriech ich mich mit allen meinen Schätzen
They're just not like that man of mine,
And it always makes me cry, oh my
Of the high pressure area
You'll see a thousand lost goodbyes
The peaches snuggle closer down into the clotted cream 
When the sun came by you opened up your eyes
Far away we'd roam
The bones of the plane
So, till I meet you there, I'm singing
All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes
When we go to sleep and wake to another brand new day
Call me when you get
I'm a fool in the fetter
I'm never alone
Who only wanna be pleased
Open your heart and let me live
And I've got a thoughtless feeling inside
Whever the fuck that is somebody help
All of us under its spell
The weather was bone dry
Sailing for the new horizon
Looking for the way you thought could not be found
I've emailed and I've phoned
And when the night is falling
Gave my wife my devotion, when she died the ocean my tears
When you're specially designed for crash testing
Feel you again, anytime I feel like I'm too far
In the blink of an eye
And even if somehow he could have shown you the place you wanted
First whose heads are gonna drop
Lately you've been bothered by your friends
How is it you never notice
Damn I ain't never felt this way
I come up the stairway
I'm here in the protectorate, the fear I held was delicate, to
A flower in the twilight
How you get your adrenaline flowing now, now, now, now, now
Mourning, I've done my time here
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, I'm alright
Love, I hope we grow old
I've journeyed here and there and back again
Mil acasos me tomam pela mão
Instead of sister and brother
Is anyone alive x
Everything else will follow,
When your unfeigned heart called to me through the dark
Just keep your eyes to the ground
That's what has become
And I got tired of this little romance,
So no one else can have you when it ends
No, I don't want to be the only one you know
We all have a chance to murder
She got tricks in the stash
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Now you can find peace at last
Fly me high on an angel's wing
And the rattle of springs
No one can see us tonight
And there is where you'll stay, heheh
You thought you'd just rest a while
But I guess, I guess you just ain't better than the rest
Summer weather, we're back together
Farbeit to explain what has been done
And now the brains are leaving my tomb
I'm, not inclined to meet anyone
Got my hands all over you but not a sound
I remembered Macha running faster than the horses
C'mon now, people, get yourselves out of it
um meinem Schicksal geschickt zu entkommen  doch es kam
E se vai all'Hotel Supramonte e guardi il cielo
Broken hearted, separated
Oh when the storm comes,
I remember the things you hated
Something in the way you sing
And when the bride groom comes, there will be noise
Your lips glistening in the light
But I know one day it's gonna happen
I'm bored, you're boarding the  out of town 
I promised I'd have you home before daylight
Chase his fears away
You don't look back, you don't look down
Where I used to shine
Look at me again, you'll make my heart explode
Are you who you say you are
My morning yearning
It's still much more
I can't do anything 'cept be in love with you
Snow or rain it's all the same
Wander the great indoors
The fears are toying with my head
Also my partner Bankhead, , what it is, nigga
We're at the ground floor
Where they touch the sky
Uh there's me no, no use in pretending
He says the White King thinks the game of chess is wrong
Ich hab so fest an meinen Bruder geglaubt
We say the wrong thing
I write one more
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
No matter how hard you fight
I'm sure it will always be
And look at each other
Every time I look into your eyes
Or bitch I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
And the warm wind chills my bones
I'm standing in the street 
Well you have caused
And make me stay
And the sun no longer shines
Let's do it right here
So large, people thought my windows
Ooh precious pain
We've been circling for time baby
Through smokefilled mouths
And coke's close as we get to sugar cane
It always, comes back to this
I drove for miles and miles
With my torch I light your way
But I've been thinkin' and it got me back to sinkin' in
And hold me for goodbyes and whispered lullabyes
I love you I love you
Did you imagine you could ever feel so strong,
Don't know how to fly
Searching for a reason,
Wait to last winter, love of any kind
To show the things I feel and to tell you what I meen
And you cheat, you lie
Move Don't hold back, my dance devotion
It's the windows, the doors, the passageways to the truth
May no man's touch ever tame
But I found myself in trouble
The sun don't know, when its glowing
That's no way to live
'Cause all I own fits on my back
Some bed of roses I have given you
Misfortune, got you like a sickness
It's pulling me down the drain
Where I breathe
I've seen the look in his eyes
The love I hold is older than the sky we lay under
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
You're the last of your kind, Mona Lisa
You say my name
And grief doesn't frighten me
A thread cut with a carving knife
As man and wife
Picking up broken words
Just when the day finds you
Till I'm in the ground and I'm cold
They think I need some time to myself
I know 'cause you're calling me, yeah
We sing as the sky falls down
With all her heart and darkening door
Don't be scared, don't hide your eyes
It is written in my face
I been in the ring and I took those right hooks
Some people say that we are not rappers We're rappers
Honey, lovin' you is the greatest thing
But you know, the sad thing is the boys all say,
Two little ones
Down deeper down, yeah
Now I just pretend
My time
I said don't go away
Slowly in the sky
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours,
And it may be a trick of the firelight
If you don't know what to say, well, that's all right
Let me take you along for the ride
Nobody knows what I believe
Deeply pulsing up toward the surface
Till your will is gone
The winds of fury pave the way to paths of glory
Encounters with police
River running black and red
I'm standing in the dark
It seems it's been such a long time
This is your anthem for tonight
Than what we're living for
I know I lost my soul
But you will never see the sun
For my love feel unready
I need you close to sing
Come swing me baby
My girl you make all the smart moves
Avaa suoneni
Stars and midnight blue
I feel I am slipping away from underneath my toes 
No more words
Down the track of loneliness, down the path of love
It lulled me to sleep
Just think about the end
If you let me have my way, I swear I'll tear you apart
The song that the trees sing when the wind blows
I see the same things
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Oh, into the dark
Shine like broken glass  
And he feels like he stands by the gates of hell
No, it's the promise of a better place
And somewhere out there is the future Out there is the future
We say the words we take them in
There lies the truth of who I was
The coldest heart you've ever felt
In this dream I found myself making love to a strange man
I said before too long you'll be a memory
Everything's moving away too fast
I close my eyes to see
You were part of a dream
Always keep thinking
Or maybe number two
Don't say that it's done
I can't believe you're giving it all up over me
Back in the day, you stayed in my business
Beginning to laugh in his favorite place
You searched for this your whole life
But I will come home again
I was making a mess for the better, I guess
So come on, tell me, is this the end
I cling to you tonight
And all of these people sitting totally still 
When was this
You loved me once upon a summertime
Of eating up entire days
Here we are at last
At one time there was a rhythm on my stereo
Lay by the wind and show me
Still felt like she could ask my time
And I know who the hangman is
He smiles like a child
Now fall off to sleep, I'm not meaning to keep you
Lower than the sea
But there's a total lack of splendor
And it only makes you feel more lonely
Da waren Menschen in den Häusern, in denen wir leiden
Have a car and a nice girl too
I can't shoot my brothers anymore
Mais mon coeur aussi
But a fraction of this life
Revolution ain't a game it's another name for life fightin'
I see the world from rusted trains
You can hide yourself in so many words
The pond, it seems so quiet tonight
Until we fall asleep at night
From child to teenager
I'm one of few who's left
Turn me back into the pet
Har startat litet företag
I'll be recruited by someone
Forced to stand down and brave the winter
We stand on shoulders
And mentally puts her back together
When you first saw me ypour face was agrin
To the god, Fred Jordan, we're
And I have been lied to
You are there
The naming of killer boy
Lonely through the night
Yes, I'll remember who you are 
Please don't be upset my darling, please don't be upset
I might have not have reminded
Hier ist sie, die Wirklichkeit
Life's about film stars and less about mothers
Sometimes she robs the chief goatherd
I've got one week behind me,
I'm still fragile
Not the radio
But no one can argue with the good sense and strength of a solid foundation
It's snowing again
A lie it only covers
And I looked through the zoom lens
I think I'll fly across the ocean
A mirror of ourselves
I still feel you
Feels like there's something broken inside
'Cause I don't know, what I'm getting
Could we leave before it gets bad
The sheets are too tight
We were linking arms and skipping around
Such heavy heavy heavy stoning stones
Every handshake
Show the trail of my love and I
Gave all the vampires back to God that day
Someone thought of that and someone believed it
And even you have played a part
And there's still a hat 
Holdin' on to nothing when you should just let go
I know the words, I know the sounds
So this is goodbye
I'll get through this if I hang on
I just need you to know me
Wouldn't be the first time love made a fool of me
I was born here, I was raised here and
He'll prove it by using his son and his daughters
Or can I trace it to go home
We have feelings We have feelings
You can't haggle with your mother
Water and glass
You'll think there's a place where you made it
Yeah, I need you, I need you to hate
You're a bird with songs to shout
Will we murder each other
﻿Oh, but if I don't do it, you know somebody else will
If the world ends, it won't finish you
The other details are inventions
Put it to the back of your mind
And you and I can get through any weather,
When I'm too drunk to stay up with you
Im Abendlicht
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
Any more sunken treasures
We goners, moving on to
Poor bastard
All the people in my town would be born
I go to loud places
Run, run, you're not too cool
But anyway bird 
So much stays unknown till the time you are strong
The bold and the fair Suffer their share 
The theme returns so deep
Me with a drink in my hand
Swallowing each new possession
Die zweite soll ihr Ziel nicht schonen
It's what I'm feeling, too
Frozen in a secret space
You speak the truth, you speak the me
You're eyes are unkind,
It's like a pain locked in a part of your heart
Until time does heal
Where are you going with this, Bret
You're sweeping up these sorry streets
Did you find your secret friends
Of nothing
And where are you now
With you by my side
If we talk this teach
This room was in the middle of a sandy plain
Tow the hours of my memory
Another fool would go down to the,
It was the rocks you liked 
Keeping out of trouble, never doing nothing
I said, that I come from Dixie land
Espalhe por aí boatos de que eu ficarei aqui
And make what we can of this
So sleep
To steer me back to my life
You want it to be over that stone wall
Why can't you guess how I want to be loved
It's not high finance, it's called heart and soul
And I lie awake
Speak to me with your soft voice
I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
It could bring joy, it could bring sorrow
So my love don't show
To fix the outer shell
Through the window you tasted much sweeter
You can keep on crawling away
He wears his hat o'er his eyes
I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look before flying east
It was good to hear him say
Sing your life
A moonfaced memory with eyes downturned
Soft and warm, continuing
With diamonds and pearls at your head and your feet
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
And remembers a love
It's loaded deep as deep can be
No way to feel inside
To pass the time of those who mourn
Words that I knew were forbidden
What satisfies your mind
Won't you let me see the world 
Were always done in such a hurry
And the conversations continue endlessly
But sometimes I need a day off
In her dreams so she thinks her
Where the warm sun shines
The further from my side you go, the longing grows
The rhythm of a line of idle days
Who's now number one
Whenever there's a chance
When I waver on the attuning
Out there running just to be on the run
When I found out that each and every one of you were dead
Dreams are sweet when they turn real
Bring the answers on in waves
But every year it gets a little bit harder
You deserve more than nothing
All we can say is we're still having a blast
The prison walls are dark and cold and grey
If time will set you free
And I know it's a bit uncomfortable here in this door seater
With words like 'Lost and Found' and 'Don't Look Down'
When I got in my cab I didn't turn and wave
Please let me go back again
Everybody's got a reason
It overwhelms my breaking heart
The world is just illusion, trying to change you
Her head with pounding voices from home
Singing songs of love, songs of love
Whose time is this
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Oh honey know girl, give it one night
Sheltered me, from nothing but the weather
Yeah I figure one day I'll snap out of this
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
Someone like you
I cannot stop
My love oh my dear
And I know if I stay in this night,
The dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan Era
Her brother lay upon the bed 
There's many that you'll see
I just don't understand how you could throw it all away
And not a violent man
Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine
Red, for the blood I'd spill to own it
Venezuela, donde estás
And the ground is hard
Don't wanna think about when you were mine
Cut it down go put it away
Then I see all my friends, they're all in town
And once again I see the tragedies
te quiero te llevaste la vela
Now I'll tell you something for my heart beats for you deep inside
'Cause everyone knows that's how you get famous
Spell it out so everyone can see
Pisspoor, ride in her sun bathing fireside
In crowds of faces
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me
Irohke nul neeyope sosona malhalge
Ain't it strange that I can dream
Don't say that you forgot the love we knew
If the lesson is never learned it's just like stitches for show
For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
I have become pure water distorted and echoed
They make me feel alive
Grooving, grooving, grooving, yeah yeah yeah
Talking aloud as they sit 'round their tables
So try to feel somebody
You close my eyes when I just need to go and see
Nothing to discuss
Love keep me warm
Baby, just pretend
The coldest story ever told
Just lay your head back in my arms, girl
Is like walking on the freeway
I sang old songs from nowhere
Harlequin forest
And I'm questioning the reasons why nothing beautiful does last
And you heard my heart stop beating
Alejandro Tremell Morgan, man, I miss the shit out you, my nigga
A retriever with a frayed bandana 'round his neck
The other side is opening now
Never took no advice
Back to the years of looli lailay
Looks like I've been a friend to nobody
Jokers juggle in the air rainbow colored fountains of sugar waters flow
But please come soon
Don't cry
Pinpoint precision
Well, we'll sleep in, we'll do it again
But a memory still haunts at my door
Reaching for the door
Open this shit motherfucker what you doin'
I watched you shine
Reminding me that I'm alive
The fish float through the room
Even though I like your honesty
In my own time I am dying
So hard to please you
So I made up my mind
They're frightened of jumping, in case they survive
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting for so long 
I don't ever stay away for you, oh no
As he kisses the lips of the misses
E a manhã nos proverá outros pães
To you in bed that day
So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine
Storm warning, storm warning
I'll see you back tonight where
Loneliness, don't come around here
In the window of the tallest tower call
Summertime when it melts into dark
In Montreal, I got so mad, someone broke into the van
Metal fingers scrape the skies
The gate was open wide
It was a little bit cold that night
An ache, a yearning
It's the crummy lost at seasick with a floating on the waves
Watch it shatter on the ground
She's got me praying to the wrong god every night
You're my wonderwall
How should I stay calm
A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
She was crazy
Yeah one day soon I'll pull my head down out of outerspace
Well, you're really cool and you always say the right things to me
It's because the days have no numbers
I remember tears streaming down your face
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall
In the car behind the carnival
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
Up against the wall,
When you see the sores you can't believe them 
Until the fire burns and eats it with its blue and red orange
But I can't make myself say "Hi" because I'm scared
Why in the night sky are the lights hung 
While all your people around you start to leave you in the same place
Why does the sea rush to shore
A part of you and me is torn
It's all because of you
They all live in pain
Through the crowded streets into the fading grey
I turned it all away
Travel a different road
The dust in my head
So the nightbird took him in
Are the things that make you blow
A short simple way to reach you
Everyone's had it
I'm a living man 
No, I won't fade away, I won't fade away, I don't fade away
The face forgives the mirror
Well it's all for my betterment
I've got a picture of Jesus
A medical wonder
About the way I feel inside
It's just for tonight
Shot through the sky
That's your choice, no one can stop you
To the coming of The Swarm
It's written on the mountains
Talking shit about a pretty sunset
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
And you're just like a fucking ghostie
You've been so alone
I'm frightened by the way you feel
Ooh ooh but when you take my hand
Strictly biz, she don't play around
All my friends
So you can rest and repair
How can a love that will last forever
I'd love to impress you with a back somersault
The truth is clear
Schlaflos, was hast du mit mir gemacht
I feel the skin that separates us, start to fade
That wind around your eardrums
And still I stand this very day
Telling you to never look back
For all love ambitions
What are we going to do
Bet you thought you'd get away, didja
I can sense a world of heartache,
nagameru noni 
It had been out all night
The drowning down of man
Where I send my thoughts
Then I'm condemned to live my whole life on the curb
Unfurling hair
Because love comes from the dirt in my own backyard
In a dream
Under the water you scream so loud
Been burning through my head
For their last goodbyes
It feels that way sometimes
And there is fire, love, on the balcony right here
Forgettin you a man first, chasin the fame
Any fool can think up words that rhyme
My gentlemen polite and proud
We both made the call that it was only my fault
Tha ceo air a bheinn 
That I'm ready for the fall
With my eyes on the prize
So now I'm looking for a lucky charm
Oh why do I hear you and believe
No one's gonna stop me now
My sweet, sweet Madeline
And my tongue gets tied so quick
He likes to read books written for girls
And we stared from the windows of school
They went down to the dance and grind
I felt it all, your starry night
I live in a trailer home with a snowmobile, my car
Drunk on calliope songs, we met a homewrecking carnival girl
And have time to play
The ones I made friends with
I have seen your city lights
You better get real, real, real and realise that the situation is going nowhere
Then came the rain
As she passed away
But everyone knows
But we'll do our jobs till we break down and fall
But you come over at night and we practice all the breathing
More than we need
Pray that it's a Saturday is a better day for me to go on
Make way for the lemon parade
And you see your soul
Hugh Hefner will tell you he ain't got shit on me
Walking cross the floor
He said, "Boy, are you ready to die"
Says she, now my young man, you must be excused, 
I have your name print tattooed upon my skin
I went out for a ride and I never went back
My friends they talk about it and they said
Young men never die
Take me, take me, home Me, me, me, me
But where are you now
This game of cruelty
I try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't it
You said "I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die"
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Had it coming my friend, my friend
At the end of yet another day
A wildcat did growl
What's up baby there's alot of things I want you ta learn about me
Got the skin and the bones
There's a day in a month
Shooting up right through my heart
The sun will rise up, and I will wise up
Your word against mine
Those words that we don't say
Act like kids in love when the sun goes down
Stronger than the sun
"Take the wheel" she said "as I wander"
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings 
I'll break my life for a song
When a kiss had followed this
I want you to stay and I want you to go
Than to bear the pain
Someday I'll get over you
But silence arrives
And when belief
While you hold mine, I cannot wait
From dreams he sold
His father died at 
Don't even talk, I'd be glad to guess your name
If I could fly, I'd be coming right back home to you
Where alot of people lie, In a deep sleep
Help me while these thoughts are troubling me
Cept a slow slow song
I get it, I get it 
Sometimes she says
There are so many reasons to keep us apart
You could be my unintended friend
What a friendly offer
 What a way to cut lengthwise
Oa, oa vento dá na vela 
Seven miles above the earth, 
You take my breath away in
He's got two left feet and he bites my moves
It's way too late
Someone forgot the golden rule
Dancing 'round
How can we ask for a place we can imagine at
I hope I get out soon
One thing is for certain I'll BE HERE for you
Toi, tu crois déjà qu'elle chancelle et chavire
And I feel you scrub my skin
Won't you let me walk you home from school
His hatred to become
I get so busy and I shut you out
It's a new day, for a new wave
Tu as laissé son corps, je t'en veux
Eat up your shame
Control my every thought
I dance with the wind I flow into your dreams
Then you'd leave right away
But I'm quite alright hiding tonight
They have written in my soul
Your skins delight
I gave you all of my money
No universal truth this time
I don't know which way I've come
I never thought I knew
It might have been just a dark pretense
Sometimes when I lose my grip
And I know nothing sweeter than
With both feet on the ground
We've been swept up just by circumstance to where the coyote lives
But we'll do our jobs till we break down and fall 
Of your body next to mine
Just let them drift through your mind
But I'm going downtown like I still care
And I'll remember that summer as the right one
God grant me the strength to accept the things I can change 
You had your shot you took your chances
Through your mind and away
Trouble loves me
I sometimes wish I'd stayed inside
hur mycket jag älskar dej
Confessions stuck in your mouth
Did I love you just randomly
Dogs barking outside
Take a pill and swallow it
Is there anything that I can do
'Cause I'm living up here where the air is thin
My blueberry eyes full of love for life
See the leaves beneath the trees come into our room 
I hope it's not too late, I hope it's not too late
With her morning yearning
Yeah, it's the best job in the world 
Analyzing your moments when you're here
We've got a picture of Jesus
Everything else will follow
I remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully
Sometime at the end of June
Forget about your worries
How we'd love to die more often
They lost their faith
Low to the ground
If your wandering ever leads you
Following your aimless path away from us
While trouble sings along
You to be with somebody else
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin' get mine
Like the one I'm dreaming of
That was another time
When I leave there's nothing left to say
It took a lot of money to start my heart
To hide his face and cry
Alone with you
It say go, I say go, she say go
Please let me bring my man
They love the filthy way I talk
So why you cryin
On your old ways that have fallen out of step
From the highways to the hills
Your eyes are the rain, just a soul that's changin' in shape
A mother shepherds her young birds
In the distance
My cousin Toot ain't have to die, right in front of his son
Try to bring me down 
A city drowning, God's black tears
You occasionally cross my mind
Please Mr Lostman �れ�い�う
Everything's confused harmlessly untrue
As their up on their ties, lies, incites the tears to your eyes
From my lips into your breath 
But I won't be no fool
You're wood burnin' outside
Just know that I will end up strangled too
It is my perfect day
The way you wanted me
Que não vão entender
I struggle to breathe Is this all the
More than a couple of days,
Though even though I know that the bad boy move in silence
My Eveline
Come and wash me clean
And something's moving on the periphery
That love causes
So come and rescue me,
And I gathered up the gold
Some men call me Cain
I remember the first time when you came to town
Sometimes the city life feels like
Look at what doesn't care
donde hubo fuego, heridas quedan
Let's aim high, oh girl
And the bridges we burn, only light our way
If I could see you one last time
These are a few of my favorite things
Unless I was holding Taiyeh chainRest In Peace
Almost any day at noon
Don't forget
So don't you let them hurts try to change you
It's my whole life
Your skin and the sky light
The morning will come
I just wanted to stay
Living for only one
You keep the children down
Her way to say it
Laid on your shoulders
Through its shell,
We are drifting and the laughs are few
All I wanted was for you to believe
I fell into the ocean
Complaining "Women only like me for my mind"
There stands a young girl, naked 
You'll walk unscathed through musket fire
But I bet for the moon
Lessons I've learned
If You Understand
Never thought you'd fall
The sun goes down
I fell in love just once
Sometimes I wonder what we could have been
You looked so wonderful in your dress
But don't waste time
With a name like mine
For all the times I never
 qui descend
We march towards the sea
I cut as many as I could handle
E na vitrola whisky a gogo 
You can't fool me
You'd be outside waiting by the road 
Oh, I remember who you are
The image is cracked but so is the view here
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Oh I'd wait for the seas to part
Would you put on the fire for me,
Go crank up that radio
You didn't like it, you resigned
Gives nothing away
Well it's sticks and stones and broken homes
Sinking deeper every time I fall
And calm my nerves to look and find
But I've been there too, and I swear to god
Still I could hear
I'll be back for more
And the day they die
Enjoys alone folknocracy
And I'll get there soon
Sometimes I forget
Time to be with somebody else
Where the river cross, crosses the lake
When the rain comes
Till darkness came to pull her away
No, I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
When this beautiful cult of desire
I caress the infinite light
Like diamonds
I wonder where you'll be
& when it's late we'll say we're still wide awake so
Are you still with me 
Behind the frontlines
From these shores I came
He is sliding gently off her hand
When the day seems lost from the start
I could taste the lightning on your breath
She clenches and she cries and she lays on the stairs
Jaded sickened by your ugly ways
Someday I know I'll find a way
He was the wrong guy
Stay strong, move on, keep on
Say it, I can say no more
Don't you worry your head 'bout a thing
Jamal Hendrix, what's happenin'
We never knew where we were going
Because of you I knew how it felt to be loved
I would sing you songs of innocence
That makes me feel just great, although 
And they would think that I was he
This is Flytown now, my friend
A wide blue sky
Where's the day that never ended
Because I whistle to a different tune
Long ago I had a dream that quickly faded
A halflife disappears today
Because I'll be the preacher to all his converts,
Or that of my heart,
Can't get you off or out of my 
I heard you can Can you fly
We are so caught up with things
When I will come to you
And you're just some melody
I get the space in between here
From wondering what I left behind
Take me, take me, home, home
Like an ideal falling, tumbling to earth
Look at us now together
All around the frightened trapeze swingers
It was way better than getting mean
I fell in love with his sister unrepentantly
Mutta sielussasi  But within your soul
I find the same things
But there you are
Better learn the difference between do and say
So don't look at me
You can't wash out his desire
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours
Will I ever dare
y te rendiste en febrero
Yeah everything will be fine
All these pictures hanging in the room
They quickly come and go
And my chin in my hand
It has a wonderful way
She holds the hands of someone young 
Never been so inside
So much stays unknown till the time has come
And my li'l homeboy Poncho, and my li'l homeboy Rico
I'll fight to seize the day
And in a rare and lucid state
Walking with me towards a midnight swim
Two lovers on their street
Now some of us are weak, and some endure
And yeah I know they'll get you down
The whole place is pickled
The snow came down
I stare at my own reflection
But she's got a constant fever 
If you don't believe me ask yourselves
Mästare och president
You look so beautiful in this light
I'll try to be kinder and be more attentive
Before I turn this love into a crime
To wither the storm
With thoughts of you,
We're fools to try
There falls another
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you
Why don't you say goodbye
For a legacy of love
Make you blind, burn your insides
Just wishing the numbness to cut deeper with its pins
So overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form
You'll get through this if you hang on
Short simple way to reach you
Like something is falling apart
I said don't be upset I know you're feeling sensitive
She want's to get through to you,
All these thoughts abound my mind
These days it's hard to meet women
Sometimes it hurts me
And sometimes I meet the real you
I said venice
It ended when you said goodbye
Well there's a light
Take the road that leads to mine
No matter how hard you try
My pop's wanna get away from the pain
During the day we could'nt talk about
See the end of this
You make me feel as though I've been born again
And a love that's warm and bright
And no one needs to know
Nothing's at it seems, you can be redeemed
Keep it together
That's okay 'cause in a way I'm free
Summer nights
Or maybe it just hurt so bad she couldn't cry 
And douse them with a mouthful, put the baby down
Unverändert liegt das Land
Sometimes there's nothing left to say
Now he's decked in flowers for me
Let love slip through our fingers I say
I know he's out there, catching my faded flowers
You don't stand up
Ah, ah, concrete girl
Lace up, learn a lesson
Summer in our sky ships, forever, sailing the wind
A fever comes at you without a warning
I'm crying,
The steelbelted attendant with a 'Ring and Valve Special'
I feel the blood rush through my veins,
The water makes its way 'round it
Wasting all our time
Oh my love
'Cause I believe in silence, our hearts speak the same word,
When love and trust are gone
I'd keep standing by your side
But your road is yours to tread
Till death do you part
This foosteps
Can't I just sleep for now
I wish I'd seen you as a little girl
And I stole the moon
Passedout in the gutter, wornout in your head,
And this lesson I've learned, I've learned it the hard way
But I've been living underground,
Out on the edge, out on the town
Please, just say my name
I still can't believe you're gone
Well we all write our own endings
DIY  Do or die
To questions that are plaguing me
Is it alright
To me some surprising day
Gonna take my time
DUI students who can't drive their cars
Instrumental
It's OK, it's all right, because the day is just another night
Looking through our window when we sleep at night
And all his words keep echoing tremolo
He got that a time,
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
Tomorrow when we walk in the cold, keep hold your hand 'cause you know I like it so when
Like it's nothing at all
Des malentendus
You have nothing to prove
They're runnin' in an out of the bars
Her restless body stirring
And I'm still surprised that you stayed with me
And you can't do a thing to stop me
It's bringing me down
And I always thought that you havin' my child was our destiny
We're fools to believe it
Baseball cards poked in his spokes, his boots in oil he's patiently soaked
This soft is dimming the brightest cities every night at midnight
A lesson that you thought
Only darkness everyday
Lay only leopard flowers upon my path
Now I gathered up my sorrows
Put a new shade to my thoughts
You know I know who that you love
Right next to the right one
I get to play at being irresponsible
Everything I've forgotten looks just like new
I knew all about treasures
Shall keep us apart
In my opinion there's a bigger plot
Melt in to the floor
Waitin' for a call from my family
When I said you looked good baby
Another sweet little girl with secret sea foam eyes
To connect all things
Each day I'll turn it back
But the pressure
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
These simple games will soon be growing tales
How big, how blue, how beautiful,
We don't know which way we're goin'
She suffers an eternal night
Future dreams can never last
It's not just the flying 
Speak from my heart
Elle a des fleurs et elle pleure son coeur est pris au piège
And slept with your legs apart every night
The meaning of good love
The sacrifices he made for me His dream
Combing your hair
Watching you till all the work is done
Where the time doesn't matter
Into my sleep
Cigarettes and a headband
Regina Spektor I was hoping you could keep me company for the ride home, but it's okay if you're sleeping
All this time I was finding myself
You put down that telephone
Into the fade out line
She�s got these eyes well where do I start
I come home late and I love your soul
I didn't know you then, now did I girl
Wonderland, wonderland
We look like everybody else
Just you sleep a little baby
And all words aside
Tuck the whole thing
Harro geundela horretaz
So I'll sing a melody
I go to those places
And snap around your fingers
Behind the frontlines 
So hush little baby, Don't you cry
Well, I take a look outside at the pretty girls outside
Why after all this time I'm finally worth it
Outside there is a pain
Gonna keep moving on up to the higher ground
Well I wish you were closer than near
You're here afraid yet still you try,
The last time I saw you
Oh with no one to blame
He looked at me and we looked away
In your lost enchanted dreams
It's battleship grey outside
While you're sleeping in that southern state
That falls in your doorway
You're the one I'm talking to,
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
Und dein Rock  Schock  der ist doch indiskret
Well you might have it all but you'll still want more
Ele quis lhe pedir pra ficar
In the summer's air
But that's not the way that's not the way
Time will always slip through 
Throwing his morning hours away
So baby don't leave me alone
Overcome unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness
You're always welcome
When you sit right down in the middle of yourself
Just tryin' to make His way home
If you hold me in your warm hand 
It feels so good and
Could you make a flower grow
She pours white wine
I never get anywhere
But I know in time
The new is in, and we're feeling better already
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight 
It makes me feel like dirt
Walkin' blues have played a number on my feet
You're right next ti the right one
Darling, everything's on fire
Tell you I love you and I always have
Drain in the last from a jug
When you feel
I like sleeping
You can only find the gold by digging in the dirt
I'll say it's the spray
There was a time, dark and divine
You speak your fears
Don't stop feeling now
bboylle, tanssijoille, muusikoille,
And now it's getting worse
Let someone do your thinking for you
As the world you know begins to cry tonight
This part is sung in persian
You did your best to change that
When the rain is pouring down
Neither of which I get enough of
Have many things to tell me
It was your fear that helped me
In life today
Helplessly just watch it fade away
You know I'll be right here and
Her smiling face
Good times come and go
Say a word or two to brighten my day
I've been waiting for a sign to appear
I've known mornings white as diamonds
Got a job, I don't got no pension
If wishes were horses then beggars would ride
She was exceedingly liberal
And I set down onto love
Off his grip was loose and just a bit
Or make her go away
Is barking out my name
En el fondo se me ve cara de no pensar
I couldn't find a better life, couldn't find my way inside
I can only think one way and I only feel the way I felt
And steaming yourself in the warm shower spray
Yes keep your wide eyes wide wide open
Turn your head, feel the breeze
And though my body was strong
He's got a goldplated ceiling and a TV show
And you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
This is us intertwined and on fire
Won't you say my name one time
Do you recognize the one you knew before 
You want it, you need it
Light the morning with the sun on the rise
But we won't be watching tonight
But you without clothes
Somebody help hey
I don't expect anything
My God, what have I done
Dance in your eyes and fell through the skies
I've got your voice on tape
And the walls are thin
But I don't know what it was
Wiggly days, wiggly nights
We'll have our disagreements
I ain't jealous of the way you're living
Do I need to be in love
I'd catch some stars for you
I know a girl laying down 
Can't begin to see my future shine as yet
Your lack of light
And at once I knew I was not magnificent
Ha ha ha ha It died out long ago
Nu daz diu maget und der man, 
And when the moon is high and bright,
When my friends turned out, I found out
All I've seen is what you've done
I got me some braids and I got me some hoes
The storm is coming, the storm is coming
But I'm not too sure just what to say
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow, now I got to go up in it fast but I'mma finish last
And you don't have the right
I go to sleep, sleep and imagine that you're there with me
'Bout being naked to the elements
What's gone wrong
We may fall apart
Really need to say
'Cause I had on my headphones 
Unmanned and unvertical
We'll go our separate ways
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings, life's a trip when you want these things
I feel like, getting it right,
No prisoner could climb the walls
She's sleeping 
Motor cars, handlebars
Ice cream with a cherry plus a big pretty please
I know she'll try something
Must have been morning that stole them
Fixement, le ciel se tord
Compassion for your pain
And I, I will follow, but I'll never fall in
Call your mother, say "take me home"
Stay sick together
On lackluster times
I think I hear the bells ringing in the square
With these hands, I will cling to you,
Let me wake, let me open up my eyes
It's a mystery how people behave
I want you around
Clean the earth surrounding and cause the warm to drown
Take you from the loneliest
That's what you did
Cómo olvidar tus miradas
Thirty years, six months and two days ago
I'll wait and I'll sit and watch the clouds
Is it a kind of dream
But, oh, my friend
Telling all your friends that this love is just made for bleeding,
But when it comes to the crunch, I just hide in disgrace
Call me up, and that's all I need,
Why the sudden change
 qui m'accordera
We loved to dream aloud
It'd come to make a mess of things
Tell me boy boy boy are you tending to your joy
shteyt nisht, brider, ot azoy zikh
I stop and watch the airplanes leave the city
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
Living underneath this guilt
Virá ou ela me espera 
Voices have left me
I don't expect anything,
It still hurts
And as we talk, I go all red
Shut up and say goodnight
And men do foolish things
It's in everything
Yeah, freedom's mine and I know how I feel
Black cars in a single line
And the melody's lost
Are those eyes overrated They make me want to give up on love
But please don't let me down this time
The song of heart's desire
United states of mind in troubled times
Why can't I just curl up onto problems and get missed of my own life
And everything
With the sound of laughter came a sense of doubt
And as the sun goes down
Why does it matter how I treat you
It doesn't seem like the first time
Just take a look
Still I wish that I knew
I knew that you're mine
I know while this buzzing gotta be ringing in your ear
So renovate your soul before you get too old
Glanced in your eyes and fell through the skies
Into the morning light
The pressure just keep it real
'Cause it seems all right,
Oh when they pause to consider all my blunders
A tender wind that reaches through the years
I want you inside out
Well in this lonesome meadow
I know you tell everyone I'm what's her name
My love goes free
Back back back in the back of your mind
I've seen the angels
And every time we kiss
And the ring around her finger is only there for make you
Bright eyes
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
Then I will take you away
Ohoh, no you didn't care, child, to see the light of day
But I know I'm out of my mind
All the world's just made it seem all quiet
Why tear our world apart girl
And you're breaking my back every time
For the rest of my years
Oh, my life is a setting sun
'Guess what These people can get away with that 
Paske nap we demen
Even if it's nothing they ever
Upon the flowers bloom
And I'd find a way
That hung on the post In heart remembering 
Oh I remember you like yesterday
Forget about your heartache
One day if I could breath
Trouble me or I'll go, trouble me with you
And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit
We'll say the one thing
Und wie gern würden sie auch mal woanders sein
When I'm walking out between parked cars
Can't you see all is not right
Every night
Growing up we didn't have a lot of money
Every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
You're here just a while
And the same refrain continues
And they shall enter from the back
Mojique plants devices through the free trade zone
The pictures are empty
Now every heart has a blind side
And their burning in your eyes
Can't I think what I did with that ol' skill and dye
Will be laughed at the way you're laughed at now
When its time for the shakedown would you take it
May there always be angels to watch over you
The things I've been through
That you call me to have the thing banned
Goes to show how tricky things can be
Alone down here
And I won't care, I won't fight
We know that nothing else for us is possible
I believe in the power
May you dance like rain upon a still lake
You move a sudden grace, a child upon the Earth
And I held your hand through all of these years
And one by one the ships descended to the sand
Passing out is taking off into the stubborn deep
Let's get the party on Let's get the party on
Light is shed not a breath too soon
And drift in space
Got a sick sense of humor
You're looking at fear
So I'm hoping that you'll fall in love again
Listen to the rain fallin' day by day by day
There are very many things
Still I feel it's not this way
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
You've been biting bullets all these years, I know
Son, time is all the luck you need
Each one feels like the first one
I watched you board a train in the London rain
You're going to break down and cry
Down to peace and contentment
Until it disappeared
And it's such a night, it's such a night
It breathes, it is my friend
The way they tried to do in the last centuries
So I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be 
It is wonderful
But the flames put a hole in my heart
Trading stories of loves
Than me, trust me your eyes will be
You know your words,
Like it would take forever
Imagine a world without me
With two daughters, a son and a remarkable wife
di hilf iz nor in aykh aleyn gevendt
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes
I took a river and the river was long and it goes on
,,Als Tristan and Isolde den Minnetrank getrunken,
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
Tell me and take your time 
With you last night
I know you feel, you need to prove 
Then pale monotony
Some hearts, some times, leave blind
Deeper, deeper and deeper relax
And in all of the kitchens in the world
Take me, take me, home
The light's on in the window; she's waiting by the phone 
'Cause in my head
I'd say" stay in the bed world sleep in peace"
Great waves
Everyday in every way I'm falling
But I'd be begging you to stop and stay
And there will be a next time
You are so dear to me
Walks beside me
The floods and fires might be coming through,
Wenn sich die Liebe in dir entfacht
Can you tend the soil inside of her
Everything evaporates when you come around, around, around
Outstepping
To bring some love in here today
The metal in my head clangs and clings as I walk
I'd paint the grey sky blue
I'm feeling oh so young
I stand at your gate,
So sturdy up sturdy up your heart for the road is long ahead
And when I get thirsty
For weaving their baby's new clothes
Thank you for leading me home that I 
The oak throws its seeds to the sky
She was alive
I'm tired of people
Under a lilac tree
And you said I think I know how you're feeling
I'm just, I'm just sayin' I was talkin' to the girls you know
Dreamland is calling I am drifting away
And I can always tell
And if the summer holds a song we might sing forever
And buy myself those things that I want
Ghostpenning songs for big haired aristocrats
I hope it's not too late that I 
There ain't no mountain that's too tall
I'm on a mission for dimepieces and sexy ladies
You know your baby mama loose, but ha, what can you do
Poor girl
A girl just like me
I've been searching in the pouring rain
And when you're in trouble I turn away
So I can watch somebody doing something
That you need me
Say hello to the rug's topography
Since you are a shining light
At least there's something good in most bad news
x I'm gunning down romance
But not so deep as my love for him
Faded away with tears in the rain
It did rain all night the day I left
Feeling shyer, I'm feeling shyer
Right under you, grinning in the dark
Walking, walking, walking, yeah yeah yeah
Till the end of time
When the rest of the world
By this new depth I don't think I ever felt
And he said something like this
Follow all these footsteps I left behind,
Come into your room
Should you be scared
It sounds different everyday
So is it true that only good girls go to heaven
No matter the moment we decide to make our minds up
And the big red wasp
I'm tossing the burnt out engine aside
When the ocean met the sky
The way out here is trapped
I've got your voice on tape
Never will be told, oh, child of mine
Oceans of blue and a room with a view
And you love them
Never to see your face again
Maybe it's about the perfect place
Anything that you wanted
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well
If we do, there'll be no turning back
It's ladies night, all the girls drink for free
The nightbirds start to sing their favorite song
You keep stayin' on my mind
When shapes are for looking at
Because it's only the start
Iça, iça Vela do barco 
Is the whole of the heart
But what when your fields are all rotten, your waves of grain, amber waves of grain
Ah She's my butterfly
And even I can't pretend we're not near the end
So I gave into your love
Was founded on liars and selfmade men
If we don't, well, there is no chance of that
After all, we were more than friends
It's creeping in sweetly
�트�진 tonight
I know there's something more
We returned and set the table, by the door
But you're still a long way from home
And graft my soul upon Your grief
Something old and new
She's holding a truth that she'll never reveal,
Where soul meets body
Oh my God, it echoes the mind
And pulling all your threads saying
You and I could swim beside
Now now the winter glows 
Wild flowers growing in the park
What good are songs with no dances
You're the one who should be feeling that
And the children, when they see me, cry
Find your smile now
Like a summer rose, I'm a victim of the fall
She pours a daydream in a cup
Of beautiful lies 
That I can't shake those memories
Well I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee
That makes you alive
We said 'We already do, don't worry we'll do the rest'
And alone
When other people say you're someone to misuse 
These are the moments in my life that I seek
Will you be there to carry me home
Was she tryin' to make it back
"Sometimes to keep it together
It'll take you 'round and 'round
I wanted to tell you how I feel
The haunted and lonely technology 
Sooner or later, sooner or later
And tomorrow Dick is wearing pants
Not to fools like me
And I just hope that I have mine
I would like to move away from it
É como não provar o nectar de um lindo amor
Someone lovely and she's bringing bad news
We are small
Everybody's been there, I just live there too
Things you've had to face, what you have seen
If I lower mine to yours would you kiss me on the face
Above all it would be warm but we would keep our heads all 
If I'm not right by your side 
Wardour Street, not phoning packwidth
'Cause I'm so tired of a love
All your doubt becomes your own belief
Unseen by the human eye
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in
In so many ways
I said, "Baby, it's scary
And feel no shame
I've got a whole congregation living in my head these days
Spring came, rain fell
You'll make me come to you
So leave me out of all your plans 'cause I don't need them now
No, nothing has changed 'cause I'm still fact, she's fiction
But if you spread your wings
And we could ride the tides
With the line and hook, delight I took 
Believes in me
The way I'm forced to dream of you
Fever I know your face just like a dove
I traced your steps through the city of romance lazily
Bodies at once we were
On the top of dead man's hill
On the highway I will run
Lonely drive
And who wouldn't have done all of that
But I haven't got the time
We're in each other as hand in glove
Finds a street light, steps out of the shade
Well she sleeps like a girl
Let the journey entice you to stay
Seeing others doing things we do
How we long for a life as a slave
Planet starting to lift up over ours
I'm on the karma payment plan
With my sorrow in hand
In that stillness once again
I was waiting for your smile
And warm me up again
I taught you how to feel, why do you feel numb
I'm not man enough to handle it still, oh
You could quit the fight or you can say goodnight
Lightning bugs are flashing on the front porch
All I've got left is the taste of salt in my mouth
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
Just wanted to be one of you
Fish still bite just like this right, right
Everything is so boring and clean
He's kissin' on you
Who let you get on my train
'Cause there, there's a light in me 
I will dress you in fine linen, you'll appear like a queen,
In winter their lips leap
Down, down, baby Down in the in the center of this town
You're gonna be the one I never got that got away
Wish that you and I were lovers
Carried my feet to the clear lake
Went out to fight for peace, liberty and all,
Don't you remind me
Not so complex in design
Kind woman, I give you my all
Just a ghost of who I used to be
Baby is there anything that we can do
Erkki lives in tampere, now where the hell is that
There's nothing left
And even though we feel bad we won't be seein you around anymore
In need of a substance to steady my hands
Something bad happens and a lot of people go
Knowing you'll never walk away
Ooh and the waves are going out
Things must change
Started to scare me
And in autumn it's girls and a broken heart
Nobody's buying so come up with the money boys or you'll be chocking on a barrel
Please don't go, I want you to stay
Then hold on, hold on to the ones you love
das war dein Leben an das ich dachte
Swaying to a gentle lady's breeze of ocean, sailing the wind
Lying on our backs in summer grass,
är det för att jag ska komma
And I created a lie
My world just falls away
Uh, yeah, ohoh
Last time they've seen his smiling face
And forgets It takes two to tango
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Ain't it funny, child
Last night our boy was out there
I hope I see you on the other side of this changing world
Some whispers around the trees
And I love you, I swear that's true
But what when all your fields are rotten, your waves of grain, amber waves of grain
Some things are hard to remember
Who's charm so endears that whole nations cheer and sigh
Heard his song up in the blue 
From the moment I opened my eyes
But most often I just hang my head and cry
She was true
On the day that we met
And when they asked us how we knew his name
And to hear what she might say
Little drops of rain, whispers of the pain
I'd rather hide these teardrops deep down inside
The calling of time 
Then in the forest I made my home
But all good things, they say, never last
With the sounds it makes you won't hear it if I call
But I'd never get over you  Oh, No  So
beyze vintn mit yirgozn
Filigree circles round her young wrist
All the cries of thirsty children
I've got to have your word on this
The city tonight
Together and be
I am your state of mind
Wanna keep on moving on up to the higher ground
And if it's about where we're heading, 
If you have any boubts of what my love is about
About lovers and how they should lay
There is no one guessing for me
I'm pulled to the side of the road 
It was just another way of saying 
A front room endless hours, weeks, years even
Drawing pictures with some chalk
I know a place where we can rest tonight
Diamonds in the snow sparkle
That someone really cares
Watching the sky
I do not want to forget
'Who the hell can see forever'
Everything running through my mind
Mojique buys equipment in the market place
Come in and slit him, I've got tokens
Mare nubium, umbriel
Won't you come and fix it
All through the night 
But every move you make
My, way home
Lookin' way cool comin' through with the doshure
But I am not a simple man
I wrap my hands around his head
Are the things that make you blow Hold your own, know your name
It's all in the dark
How could we be so right
If we aren't home
I wish you knew
I don't want anyone else
Coral reefs, strange grasses and rare things
Close comes the winter, summer is no longer
When you thought you'd soaked up all of the blows
For me to admit the way that I felt
Beth Orton and Terry Callier
I switch off like a 'television', and close my eyes
My mother
We have not talked for so long
Wishing there was someone just like You
I wonder if you hear me
Darling you're with me, always around me
Neither one listens to "Brothers in Arms"
My little love affairs are all scheduled 'round the TV guide
Wir kennen die Gerüche
Down to our September kiss
Now I watch you fall asleep smiling
The darkness in the pylons and the smoke and creosote
But when the war is done
That's the way
When the flame turns blue,
She ran until her face was numb with cold and
And it never stops, no, it never stops
Taking time
The brittle and bitter bones
Can you please try harder while you can
Close your eyes
This is world as we know it
Relax and all these whores will lick the membrane
I turn into the world's worst Romeo
And I bet, then you exploded in my heart
And go where we are told to go
But I've been feeling closer day by day
The full moon dips its golden spoon
Well, Honey, I'm flexible Oh, yeah
I love the way, try to call now
Or if you haven't one, rest in my arms
Memories always stain, you can't wash them down the drain
Leave out nothing tell me everything
There are times I can leave my heart wide open
Jesus, a friend in the better times
Moving out tonight
I hope they won't be too quick to begrudge me
Well, I had a little metaphor to state my case
We are survivors
I'll jump off and take a drive
Call you up and acknowledge you to come through
The noise just fell away
There's no way to describe
Into strangest heavens
Oh, we're living in the wild life
Here's my list of all the things I should have said and done
Everything but sleep
Let the atmosphere surround me,
It's not too late for you to take a drive
What is faith
Leaving the town in akeeping
She was forty three years old and as far as I know
I heard them whisper your name
Looking back on your life
Paintin' pictures to discover foreign lands
'Cause I don't want to end up being
Trying to keep you and Paris on my mind
We kiss goodnight with a firm handshake
And once more darkness it descends
I remember hours scraped away
I'm foolish and crazy
A past so strong
When the moon explodes or floats away
Saw a balloon floating away
Looks like a little beauty
They tore it to pieces
But all that good advice gets lost somewhere
Carve out your heart for keeps in an old oak tree
Oversee the living
See what kind of tombstone I might have
As a place of infinite possibilities
You got a new friend, well I got homies
Or if I say that you're beautiful to me
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment
Look at where you've got yourself now
Damn baby, I can't do it that fast
Something in the way she woohs me
When I love you
Are you the girl I've been dreaming of
Take up your wings
Now you know what can come from dreams
On my way by now
I wish I had one hundred thousand pounds
It's safe to say that you could lighten up a little and then some
Give until there's nothing left
Good night
But you still have all of me
I cannot get o'er
And water rolls on off the round captain's belly
Because I'm all you've got
It's scary what you'll find
Ice dripping, cold sweat
You'd feel what hatred brings
The sky is your blue kingdom
Doch die Erinnerung verblaßt
This is a story 'bout the three of us
And though I struggle through the days now
Down, down to a perfect relaxation
Your mouth against my skin
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
That borders your back yard
None of them along the line
Awoke this morning
, we're all waiting for the year 
You know you had it coming my brother, oh my brother
A winter melody she plays
When you marry and you look around
Marie you are the wild blue sky
I never have a bad thing to report
Look in your wallet all you'll find
Blood on the leaves
It's so full of change
The neon signs got tired
Yeah, I'm alright
I breathe the masculine scent of his skin
We can clink our glasses still being entwined
Don't think I know when, he tries to bring them home, maybe that would be a way if he lived alone
And nobody seems to know where you go
Prisonnier de ton enchantement
You've climbed much too high to let the truth stop you now
Though I still believe in everything
Ooh And the years keep rushing on
And she fights for her life as she goes in a store
Hear the wind blowing chimes
But nothing could be farther from the truth, my love
D'aller visiter le Mali mais son visage a pâli
That a pretty face can take you places, you don't wanna go
And you've found a brand new life somewhere
Or fake your death and only tell your closest friends
Always in awe
We question of this hatred as we sacrifice 
Tender love's what you're giving me and
I see it in the stars,
Help to carry Jacob Marley's chain
Well, you left me here so I could sit and cry
And even if you ask right
If I stay right here, and forever with you
I left my friends on another continent
You think the world is trying to bring you down
I'm with Akinyele in the street, trying to get us a deal
For I know that there's a man inside the boy
My angel Gabriel
She says oh well oh well you'll do just fine
Because my angel eyes ain't here
Inside a sea turned from frog to freak to tiny red and meek
But I sailed too far out to sea
I'll let you sleep
The wood from the tree
And you left it at your door
About the first time that you fell
And thought you're sick
And feel desire
Out of this place
And I'm still fact she's fiction
Never forced themselves into my arms
Stay, you can leave tomorrow
Than wasted breath
Still I took all my chances, earned myself an even score, tried to learn my lessons well
Phones will come alive
That she's cried while he's away 
Filhos feitos de amor
I sleep in these dirty sheets
Twodimensional ships like ocean liners sailed across this desert
Oh, this close, yeah, yeah
Will you forget the scent of violets on my skin
We got lost
Imagine that you're standing here
And I will not stay with you
All your love could hide,
Sweet dogs, sweet rain, never come and go
My lovely protector
In the morning
Lying down I notice what you see below us
It felt like Christmas time
A young girl, unchained 
Like they're holding the world together; like it'll blow any minute
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away
And I'm gonna stay here so just let me be
And I drove all night to find my child
Desperation's the tenderest trap
He knew, he knew
When you're turning out the lights
Then I thought I'd heard you in the hall,
Then on a bright day at North Point
Now I find that I'm thigh deep
Will be gone and I won't see you anymore
Now that it's late fall
Inútil explicar
Never said it was good, never said it was near,
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
And a one last try
hon har sitt bo ovanför mitt huvud
Good girls voices drift like anaesthesia
Fallen in love and I hope that you want me
And it burns but it turns out golden
And let it wash over me
And I love that it's right on time
When words got me down, you keep me up
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky
To have such a woman with me
On an old dirt road, where the sun doesn't look like such a waste
Take your hands and feel my heart beat
Say hello to everything you've left behind
Like a man, prepared to take whatever comin' for me
Never look over my shoulder
Lovers on the landfill,
This is the voice of our past
We ran out to see the future, from the ground
Cracks in the mirror and your mind slips
And my mind gets slower too
Projecting what I want is always hard to know
Fühl die Welt um dich herum
But the sun is burning
How to dream anymore
I will try to dry my eyes, my love
ein ander z'arzâtîe
Oh, truly I love you
I pray for rain, while the water's rising fast
The sun is still there, except it's not
The cold harsh Winter's
Back to the old house
October and the trees are stripped bare
And counting the change
I'm on the right track, yeah we're onto a winner
Even when I'm gone
Says your cheapshots won't be able to break bones
Okok, all right all right, just fine just fine
Oh, you say you hate me now, and you burn me with your words
Really need to say
Go ahead and build it up again
And the devil makes, the devil makes, good use of these hands of mine
I guess he just has to cry from time to time
Just look at the state I'm in
I lost the plot underneath the fire
And watch the water wash them away
Gone in the blink of an eye
Carnival arms have
Or place for the rage
So open your arms and sing for us
You could see it, I was blind
Maybe you'll rewrite my love song
Only to find dreams made of sand
Can't get you out of my head
And wherever you are, land on another star
It's not easy, she would say
Doesn't seem like anything you're saying or saying or doing
Like a prince in your little fairy tale
It's my heart
You can't feel it anymore
Abre essa janela
Holy, holy is his sacrament
And maybe we're right
That we come together to make it sweet
She's telling all of those lies
I hear my sister singing
And yes sir she lookin' so mighty mighty
I've said goodnight tonight
She can walk on two feet now, she can go where she wants
I know that you say I get mean when I'm drinking,
Yeah, need some kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk, kicks
I tried to run and save them, but I had molasses feet
Emitting frequencies, lost between the leaves and things
And what will you do when your suntan is fading and the summer's gone
The dead are haunting me
Keep it under wraps in the cold store
Find your heart now
There's a band in our cellar, baby, and they're playing a song of the drunks in the street
Et moi je suis fouMais comment te dire
Believe, yeah
A lovely singing voice
These abstract wordless movements
Taj Mahal I've come to rest
In your father's garden, that day we did part
Blind to the gemstone alone
Oh you know you had it coming my friend, my friend
Believing stories only hearts can tell
The river met the sea again
You lift up my spirits, you shine on my soul
There is no one to keep you caged in
I am lucky just to have a heart
This desert road's forever winding
Tragedy he used to come through all the time
And his story left untold
Whatever happened to those lights
Poisoning the soul
Vinden synger de evige toner
Now you'd better put some beauty back
A four month old rat terrier pup
And now my mind is free to walk the streets we used to walk so quietly
Let me see you smile again
Is to know me all wrong, they warn
Your arms are like the trees
She says it to herself "Don't go"
Yeah we'll just stay in our home, in our homes
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
'Cause we're enjoying our time
Now you're too young for the golden age
It'd just be misunderstood
And you believe in loneliness
The vineyard the graveyard the grapes and the bones
Whatever the weather
I can see clearly now the rain has gone
From which he says "I miss you so"
And for a moment I lose myself
You've got too much in this
Sing it loud and clear, I'll always be waiting for you
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,
In the corner of your eye
Who cannot sleep at night 
Don't back down, there is nothing left
Don't you mind, you can take one, too
He who taught me to love like a beast
Back up to Heaven all alone
Wade through the sand
If you need to find yourself
As he neared I felt the ancient fear
To the honey bee
I've got no need for open roads
og vil til bestandighet
Fall into these arms of mine
Let's none of us forget about who we are
We lost our world
'Cause I want to kiss you and weep
I long to be a picture of Jesus
It still pounds inside and it's red
I might smash up all these windows
Because
Don't be put off by looks
Oh I never wanna go back again
I don't believe you now 
We were broken up bound and everything fell to fear
See how the breeze has softened
Instruments of death before me
Nature will get her way
They'll drink to your death with pink champagne
I'm always having with myself
You know the sandman's on his way
And when you're in the moon
'Cause you won't let go of anything you hold
And everything counted
Standing on the outside, looking, looking
I promise we'll resume tomorrow 
You're working hard on a life of your own
Everywhere empty roads
I want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds
Spinning pictures, blue screens, and red kisses
Oh and you're standing right behind me
Oh honey don't know how long it's been
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
You want to catch your breath, you want to get out 
Of a world
Now eating from your hand
I rode you on a chair and in the shower
The blood of the pretty
And at my funeral
Lets fly away tonight
Well this place is a whorehouse tonight
Don't try to understand A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man
I looked for you in everyone
To the movie star and his sordid life
Looks to the sky above
Vanhan runontekijän sanoin
mikä ikinä tuliskin, älä pysäytä musiikkii vaa
On the loneliest cloud in the sky
Because I'm lost for words
You sit down slow and watch yourself in the glass
She's aware of her implant
Your heaven beckons me enticingly
But there's pressures from inside
I know, baby baby can't you see that another fella just may be the kinda man you need
You can raise your arm, you can wiggle your hand
About everything you can't understand
Nothing will ever be as it was
I'll fall apart from the inside and die
With the disease
I let you fool around
Everyone needs
Boy so hard, boy so hard
The final dying joke caught in our hands
Give me a boat that will carry two
Disconnected from choices we make
I'm prayin' you're gon' make it through the season
It makes me mad at truth
Hell no reason go on and scream
Will be washed away
Attracts me like no other lover Don't need no other lover
Where are you going
I'm overjoyed, and in the sun,
I want to be alone
The small place I was coming from
I can feel the salt upon my skin
And you can't take back what you've taken away
And I lied alot too
And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme
This is Your love, oh, God
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Sit back, watch it turn to dough, watch it go out the door
Into the night
Livin' in a different world
I can smell the grass, and touch the flowers
Polished off the whiskey tonight
I swam with sharks and beasts of the sea
I finally shut my mouth so I can here my self think
Nothing but bluebirds all day long
Everybody's got a hunger
Springtime was always my favorite time of year,
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
It's only human to wonder how
Free beer and basement shows
With your head upon my shoulder
Don't fall over
Seems like it could go on forever
They say
And everything you say is true 
So that you don't get bored
Did I give my heart for that waste
Saw the sign of the times
The boats are in their docks under a clear blue sky
When my soul starts growing
Och Fredrik är gammal men månen är ny
And smash on the floor
Watching our every last word
You know we'll never be alone
Gardens growing full again with life
So please try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
Where is someone
"Oohweeee man"
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Your silence kills me;
If an angel could hold it in his polished white hand
But as close as I get to you
I'm so in love with you, but you'll drown me
Oh lord
All the time  I'm sure
And I wake up everyday in the same place,
But my guess is right you break like glass
Just say
The way you feel is not my problem
Whoowhoowhoo, whoohooo, whoohoooooh
From corporate exploitment
Burning candles in your room,
I've made a crown for you, put it in your room
Watch the fire burn out
'Cause this life is anything but certain
There is no such place, o yes I have seen it too
Am I far away
Program director on the radio won't play no music until the caller tell him so
Your words were "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye"
Who's singing this simple melody
All of my life
At last, the skies above are blue
No going back no going home
This comforts so deciving all common sense aside This world wonders grieving but from the depths we hide 
When I drink I don't die 
Doesn't mean you feel a thing
When you looked around I couldn't be found
Still won't wake
A love like yours
My name is William James McPhee
I need a map but not the destination
Kaum zu glauben, wie der Wind sich für Dich dreht
Sail through the wind and rain tonight
I'm the new  and I change out to my new s
No one's job but mine
Beyond the realm of being friends"
I just can't seem to find solid ground
That shit around you is lookin' dumb, it's gettin' hard to accept it
But that's all right
As the neighbourhood gets quiet
And for once in his life, it was quiet
Just place both your feet on the ground
I was sleeping, I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow
And I give you peace when peace is fragile
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
Sometimes it's easy
I want you to be mine
Can't we all get over ourselves
You don't know anything
May you find kindness in all that you meet
So if I cannot tell you if though words I do not find I want you to know
Peace is long been forgot
For the blood of the pretty
I could wrap you in your favourite clothes
Well I can hardly stand
She fills their mouths and warms their souls
Making up songs and words and singin' from the soul
You're a flower, you're a river you're a rainbow
And they all got answers from trouble they've known
That shines brightly, yes
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
And I see fire
I'll tell you what do, then, if you're inclined
I can't keep thinkin' I was right
She asked the pisspoor "Why you lookin' for that
Hey friend listen up their playing our song
Fears will soon fade away
Riding on waves, walking on sand
That taught us how to smile
We look through antiques on a fuzzy, fuzzy day
I'll wear my sword at my side x
Love was meant to be
And if I do I wonder how just you will see me
Stay right where you are, cause
It's so heavy a heavy price to pay
And dumb dumb words
So I walk away,
She wished she went away
See lean to the side in my ride, huh, yo
But I miss the way life was
But Maybe they're right for a change
Shit, The truth is that we need each other, yeah
The burdens that were his Mending the coat 
Your heart's against my chest
Slip away
Since you've been gone
Yes it always, comes back to this again
You want it to change
Wonder if you'd even recognize me
These ships were always full of people facing windows
Time and time again I've been told
I'd breathe you in
You changed my life and all my goals
We'll see if Jah wills that we're alone again
I can let the current carry me
Are symphonizing their way
If you're scared just think of me
You happy enough to stay
For her to open her eyes"
A tortured soul
Let me fall but catch me mid flight
There will come a time gigantic
AND I'll find somebody new and baby, we'll say we're through
I'm getting taken under
It's a fucking swarm of bees
Everything will come It will come in time
I want your flowers
How deeply, the distant mountain breathe
Every other face is bent and broken
Never miss an event, helping them with their homework
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls
Ending with a friend named Sunny Skies
Keep moving on to higher grounds
Too many fucked up times
And he gambled away the rent
A spotlight's shining brightly
Baby won't you please come home
All the hearts they're messing with
We held hands and we ran
Our hands are swollen We all need to sleep 
Where the eyes of your demons are gleamin
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize 
The place where my best friend passed away
But now look, just another day
With her pair of old wings that opened just once
Left him with a little somethin', sixteen he was stuntin'
On my knees in a faceless crowd
I keep singing the same way
But I'ma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like jigga man
I had sixteen stitches all around my head
Won't let the bastards grind me down 
But there's something you should know now
Why does her friends phone keep on ringing
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
Please forgive me, 'cause I've been there
The universal man
An airline ticket to romantic places 
Let me open your eyes
To go running from love again
We could build an island
I know, I know, I know, I know all the games you play
And the clouds melt away into water
We would say that we had found this man in a crack
For there's none of them can sing so sweet 
How come, how come, how come,
A time to go a time to live
Slow your breath down, just take it slow
Is no life at all
No running away from the scene of the crime
I wasn't as aroused as I was concerned
I've watched them falling
And just stop talkin' shit
Prey on the light in the room
Let me in unlock the door
All things in town went, nothing will last
I really thought I wanted to go
I'd have done anything
Inspiration, look and see
Why in the night sky are the lights hung Oh
What are we if we're not alone
They won't know who we are
Even though I know you've had a bad day
I want you to stay course I want you to go
Tidal wave rushing on and on
Come the night you could be my confidant
I've got a lot of things to figure out
Full of letters, as a kid, I'd always meant to send
Where we captured all the fireflies
And all the pain you've been facin'
I bet you didn't even know
How the wind feels free
For the wind to suck
Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
Someone caught us in the kitchen
Take me back to the stems of it
To calm down the flames but now they've won
A speck in space
To give someone what they need
But most niggaz don't, and they whole life hurried
But the silence surrounds you
When aI look at my reflection
And everything you had is gone in the split of a second
If you're walking and nothing's turning out the way I planned
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
This world is burning and I'm terrified
Of everything you ever wore
But no one else can see
And no one can dissuade me
At a time when you least expect it nigga
It leaves you cold and wet
They stand beside me and all that I am
That breathing is sexual
She died of a fever and no one could save her
But I don't know the game
This old world's going to reel and rock
When I'm walkin' round here dreamin'
I know my soul is battered
Now is the time
I'n the only one you run to in the night
By the love my heart endured
But I'll be your candyman
But 'til that morning, there ain't nothin' can harm you
Tremble and fall
You can make it last forever you
Stand in the light Stand in the light Stand in the light
Oh there's more left to life, Mona Lisa
She's softly breathing next to me
Thought that I'd be different this time around
And these are the bricks that shattered my heart
Yeah they're gonna dig a coalface out of you,
Noye dusonul saranghae saranghae
You can forget about what he put you through
Has his love truly blown
And not make a sound
When people say it's sad
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
And you waited on the rain,
She laughs at most everything, whether it's funny or not
You know that when that time comes and nobody is checkin'
To pull our earth back round again
But this song about you keeps coming out
That looks at you from the shadow
You danced for me in your bare feet
It's always this way
Guess your death was a lesson in life, it taught me that
From the cold grey sea
Why care, why share
So much for running
Gave it all back to the life I led
From which this living near can be exempt
Trying to make His way home
Young wild and reckless is how we live life
The days start to fade out of the frame
For the things we are
Make something else up there's majesty in motion
You hold your heart out in your hand
We once had dreams of being something useful
I love you anyway
wann kommt es wieder zurück
I feel music in your eyes
I concede into the sea
Hieroglyphic every particle,
Blue light of morning palm trees in rows 
I made it all end
Is the thing I can't help but fear
That I tend bury into you
A move, a glare
Wonderin' who to blame next, low this
Having my moment, you know what I mean
The closing of the doors 
And I'm filling it with things
"Stories of cold," I smiled at the Hobo;
Can you share in the pain and the happy times
Your kisses ring
Crown you in my heart
Walking down the road
Now don't say a prayer for anyone
Teach you how before we're done
But I don't get disapproving
Keep on kissin' me, yeah
Lay your head back in my arms, oh, I know your worth
When time wreathed a rose
The days I saved
You keep an eye on the driver,
Amanda awakes in a moment believing
To straighten up your life
You're like a child that cries
I'm exactly where I dreamt
I still smell you, distance aside
On Sunday morning
And our first goodbye always seemed like hours
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
We can always be
I'd llllllove to be a man
In your eyes I see the shame
He tried to make it clear
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me", follow me
Brown eyes 
Let her have some fun
Try to keep from missing love
Don't need to tell me 
Somewhere so far away, yeah
Whoowhoowhoo, ahhhaa, whoohoooooh
Just another red light x
No need to run, no need to hide
She walked into the party
'Cause I've been sitting here since half past nine
You know it'll shine until we fly
Is the moonlight just a flame for her memory
It would shake me till I'm still
Sob o sol da manhã
And my feet don't move in time
Leave out nothing, tell me everything
In houses lights are glowing
The perfect place for me to find a friend
And even darkness won't stay when you come around, around, around
Far from the shadows that's haunting my day
He's far gone now
And our bodies got so much clearer
I fall deeper in love because I
Ist der Weg das Ziel,
Not afraid to close my eyes
Jag saknar dig mindre och mindre
I'm still hopeless
I'm a crooked soul trying to stay up straight
He's got a lot to say
Of mental illness
All the young faces come and replace the dying ones
Ah, la, la, la, life goes full circle
Of all the things I've said, I like this the best
Like time was on my side I said
All drift away and a mother cries
I lay in the ground, wait, lonely for you
A pleasure sweet my body heat
I never knew I could feel so alive
I am a ghost to everyone I know
Do you remember the day we left the Earth
And now I am supplying you the time and space
Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain
So I take a step away
I've become amused
Oh truly I love you
His name is embroidered on my mantle so green
What did you see in me
I undermined you,
Well are you
The shrill cry through darkening air
Nothing in particular
Everything's going west nothing's going east, straighten
Yeah, my shell isn't as hard as it seems
That kind of thing made me crazy
It's the only place I know how to bare
And the scent of your heartache, baby, and the taste of your blood, run within me
It's going to be a bright, bright sunshiny day
I don't wanna waste another day or night
I like to stick to walls
And your vision is clear while you blind your own kind in a curtain of fear, your words twisted skywards distracted by stars
I'll choose unloved instead
See here, when I die make sure I'm gone
You'll be mine
I prayed one day
Like birds of paradise
Made you clothes from insulation
Since you've been kissed
You live within the sense
A gull takes to the wind
So what if this is a man's world
And it's so pretty and so lonely
We still move to hurt each other
But how will you know if he's kind
Hold on to nothing
When all is said and done I will love you
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
And I saw your hand
Let the bees make honey
Tripping and nobody cares
When I put my arms around you
There's one or two things I'd sure like to ask
A rush of memories washing over me
You go west for the black setting sun
When your face is caked with mud,
Now you are the warrior who will conquer this land
Just want a way of keeping you inside
Well, you know I believe in how ooh
My weapons left by the bedside
My singing bird as you 
Cling to the side and any sign of your memory
Die Riemen rum
Integrity is too damn expensive, discount the price but still
To keep the stop in time
Just the veteran taking the mic back
It said "hey man, there goes the hood"
He makes me dance
Just as I think it's done
How to keep away
I keep finding words that leave you  I told you I don't mind
If I'd been a prophet, I would tell you how the future lies
Water reaching up just to swallow me whole
No I never meant to hold you back
It was just a boring day that we decided to betray
Let me remind
Been carted away
And marmalade thighs with scrambled yellow hair
And don't ever think of trouble
Oh, starry are your spheres, delight
So right,
And now shades become shadows in your light
In my life
I returned a paler blue bird
My heart was broken
That the world's gone and left you behind
Patterned always yes, maybe no
And leaves us behind
Send angel's prayers
Sometimes I wonder if there could be really
Gone with the wind and home is far away from me
I've seen the world, done it all
And we'll all float along with everything
Remember you said you needed me there
I guarantee you, you will never see nothing like this again
No one disturbing, that's alright
The day time the night time when the angels are calling
Passed off an open glare
She wants to move to Kansas City
I send them out of the house
And I do not want what I haven't got
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
And drift into one moment somewhere
You said at least a song will come out of it
men när hon andas på mej
In the city only for a while, oh
Concrete heart
Is bawling goodbye
But baby please don't say we're through
You're crying out your wishes I understand
And if you're this this this full of bitterness now
No use in turning back
Fought in places
I'm on my way home
But there's only so much that one man can take
Love and other moments are just chemical reactions in your brain
Este e um sonho estranho
And I'm not the smartest man
My heart, sometimes
Last breath, last scream
"Everything is fine, I am here, I am here"
You right next to the right one
In D, I was behind the wing 
Let's see who can get down
I cut all cords with a sigh and a smile
You see what you believe
Restless little one
There's a pleasure we must all feel
There are colour explosions
If you search it out it will make you strong
My heart goes like
Endless need, like a burning sun
A lonesome figure gleamed
Even if it's not what you need
Take me to your house
The night had a number, number  babe
Son ex Un playboy SDF
After the show you walked right past
Focused on what you feel
'Cause you're still around,
Now, don't you cry for me
Sometime I don't think
And it takes no time to fall in love
And you won't come home again
Don't patronize me sorrow
It's always the same
But your soul is never lost until the deal is signed
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
The dark that troubles you most
That makes us insincere
And I will always feed you and feed you and feed you
The angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore
I am drunk again 
He's been there since the very start
I know that You're the one to pull me through
Today you may feel a little sleepy
Now, noone knows the year
It's awfully considerate of you to think of me
Flowers cut and brought inside
Mind your manners, wave your banners
Shake it out, static anonymity
Sleep in silence, reshape
I took my time
But sweetness alone who flew out threw the window
Hear them bicker, watch them die impaled on balsa spears
How many drinks till I'm happy
Truth no lies, tears and smiles are locked in our eyes
Her weeping I made into this song
Wenn du ihn mitnimmst, wenn du gehst,
Every time you look at me
In the holly red in the night
I still think of you
'Til you came 'round with your pretty style
Doll, I love you
Last night for quite some time
They just fade out when you take a breath
Whenever you come undone
There are many things that I would like to say to you
I was a person who would censor "Pee Wee's Adventure"
It's all replaceable
Babies underneath their beds
But he and I, we both knew
You need not to climb mountain tops
I warned I
All that grace, all that body
Sealgair nam fiar  
Those squinty eyes are just starting to see
You have a piece of mine
When he found that bed so easily
Your fingers reach around the bone
Bring my broken heart to an invisible king with a hope one day you might answer me, so I pray don't you abandon me
My bones are aching for you
All over the hall carpet
When I'm feeling sad,
Me believe in you
Tunnelma lämmin ja surullinen
And when I am through those doors
Jjust the way I'm supposed to be
We'll stand around forever
And darker walls are bent and torn
You're with me all the time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sua vida, seu amor, seu lar 
Would it be different if we knew we would win
The light that sets you free
I should care if the wind blows east or west
I hope that I haven't said too much lately, ooh lately
Slow your breath down, just take it slow
That you're that close to losing your mind
Sweet nothings left behind
I'd felt so insecure that night
And my words won't be done, They'll never be done till the end
Sometimes I feel so lonely, sometimes I feel so lonely
And you're not gonna take what they've got to give
You spend you days just waiting for your next defeat
All good things they say, never last
I need it so much
And I can see it in your face
als wir raus waren
The sunlight in your head
How does it make you feel
Now papa Hemingway he rent this boat
I will be waiting here with open arms
Caught in this pool held in your eyes
Ach das Blut läuft aus dem Mund
