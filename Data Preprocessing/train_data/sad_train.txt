And look no further for happiness
I will not turn again
'Cause my heart has found its home
Everyone I'll never meet
And the friends I won't now make
The adventures that there could have been
And the risks I'll never take
But among your books, among your clothes
Among your noise and fuss, I've let it go
I can stop and catch my breath
And look no further for happiness
And I will not turn again
'Cause my heart has found its home
It's never easy, and you'll never know
What leaves you crying, and what makes you whole
There ain't no way that I can hold it down
Falling to pieces, forever in doubt
But it's alright, why don't you tell me again
How you'll still be there, when the heartache ends
But it's alright, why don't you tell me my friend
How you'll still be there, when the heartache ends
There ain't nobody, who can show you how
To find the surface, when you're underground
There ain't no blanket, that can hide this cold
There ain't no memory, that ever gets old
But it's alright, why don't you tell me again
How you'll still be there, when the heartache ends
But it's alright, why don't you tell my friend
How you'll still be there, when the heartache ends
Well I move all directions, to the corners and the outskirts
While the lovers and the lonely, start to whisper all about me
And if I stand here silent, I almost start to feel you fading in
Telling me hold on
'Cause it's gonna be alright, why don't you tell me again
How you'll still be there, when the heartache ends
Well it's alright, why don't you tell me my friend
How you'll still be there, when the heartache ends
How you'll still be there, when the heartache ends
Say you'll be with me, when the heartache ends
Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologise for it
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Allie woke up 8AM
Graduation day.
Got into a car,
And crashed along the way.
When we arrived late to the wake,
Stole the urn while they
Looked away,
And drove to the beach
'Cause I knew you'd want it
That way.
And you were standing
On the hood of the car
Singing out loud
When the sun came up.
And I know I wasn't right,
But it felt so good.
And your mother didn't mind,
Like I thought she would.
And that ((REM)) song was playing
In my mind.
And three and a half minutes
Felt like a lifetime
It felt like a lifetime
And you move like water
I could drown in you.
And I fell so deep once,
Till you pulled me through
You would tell me
"No one is allowed to be so proud
They never reach out
When they're giving up."
And I know I wasn't right,
But it felt so good.
And your mother didn't mind,
Like I thought she would.
And that ((REM)) song was playing
In my mind.
And three and a half minutes
Felt like a lifetime
Are you sitting in the lights?
Or combing your hair again,
And talking in rhymes?
Are you sitting in the lights?
When I got home, heard the phone,
Your parents had arrived.
And your dad set his jaw
Your mom just smiled and sighed.
But they left soon
And I went to my room.
Played that disc that you'd given me,
And I shut my eyes
Swear I could hear the sea.
When we were standing
On the hood of your car
Singing out loud when the sun came up.
And I know I wasn't right,
But it felt so good.
And your mother didn't mind,
Like I thought she would.
And that ((REM)) song was playing
In my mind.
And three and a half minutes,
Three and a half minutes,
Felt like a lifetime
I think
It's getting to the point where I can be myself again
I think
It's getting to the point where we have almost made amends
I think
It's the getting to the point that is the hardest part
And if you call
I will answer
And if you fall
I'll pick you up
And if you court this disaster
I'll point you home
I'll point you home
You think
I only think about you when we're both in the same room
I'm only here to witness the remains of love exhumed
You think
We're here to play a game of who loves more than whom
And if you call
I will answer
And if you fall
I'll pick you up
And if you court this disaster
You think
It's only fair to do what's best for you and you alone
It's only fair to do the same to me when you're not home
I think
It's time to make this something that is more than only fair
So if you call
I will answer
And if you fall
I'll pick you up
And if you court this disaster
I'll point you home
I'm warning you
Don't ever do
Those crazy messed up things that you do
If you ever do
I promise you
I'll be the first to crucify you
Now it's time to prove
That you've come back here to rebuild
Rebuild
I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road
And it's not like her to drive that slow, nothings on the radio
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell
She usually comes right in, now I can tell
Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain, Here comes me wishing things had never change
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye
I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way
One day I thought I'd see her with her daddy by her side
And violins would play here comes the bride!
But here comes goodbye, here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain, Here comes me wishing things had never change
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye
Why does it have to go from good to gone?
Before the lights turn on, yeah and you're left alone
All alone, but here comes goodbye
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain, Here comes me wishing things had never change
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye
Found myself just the other day
In the backyard of a friends place
Thinking about you
Thinking of the crowd you're in,
What you're up to, where you've been,
Just thinking...
You know the clothes that you wear, and the colour in your hair,
Shouldn't change you,
Now you tell me why is it so,
You're bigger than Almighty Joe
At least you think so
God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know,
If I can call you, and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down,
Plant your feet back on the ground
Threw my smoke down on the ground
Turned my head and I heard the sound, that reminded me
Of the days so young and sweet,
Always so much fun to me
At least I thought so
Now you think you're so damn fine,
You could rule the world,
No not mine,
I don't think so
God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much, that I don't know,
If I can call you and tell you I care
Know the scene that you're in,
And the people that you've been with,
Just get to me,
But you think I'm not as cool
As you are so beautiful,
Who you foolin?
Well I'm here to tell you babe,
The game you're in is just a game
So damn pretentious
God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know,
If I can call you, and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down,
Plant your feet back on the ground
You think you're so beautiful... So beautiful
Held your standards close to heart
But late one night you threw them down
Simple promises you said you'd never break
But now you have
All throughout the morning, though I'm begging
No your lips they stay perfectly still
Did he fill the empty spaces
Was he everything I'm not
There's no force behind my mouth
But in just three words he brings you down
There's a movement out the door I swear but no
Your lips they stay perfectly still
Childhood living is easy to do
The things that you wanted, I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild horses couldn't drag me away...
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
And now you've decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away...
Faith has been broken and tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away...
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them someday
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them someday
I dumped you again
Don't understand
It's happened before
Can't take it no more
These foolish games
Always end up in confusion
I'll take you back
Just to leave you once again
I died in my dreams
What's that supposed to mean?
Got lost in the fire
I died in my dreams
Reaching out for your hand
My fatal desire
I failed you again
'Cause I let you stay
I used to pretend
That I felt OK
Just one big lie
Such a perfect illusion
I made you mine
Just to hurt you once again
I died in my dreams
What's that supposed to mean?
Got lost in the fire
I died in my dreams
Reaching out for your hand
My fatal desire
Oh oh
You keep pushing me away
In spite of what you say
I found out yesterday
That I've been wasting all my time
Trying to make you smile
Trying to make this seem worth
While you've been pushing me around
In spite of what I do
Trying to make things good for
You, take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away...
You've been racing through my mind
You're picking up in speed
You're driving recklessly
It's like a car crash happening on my street
Broken bodies at my feet
And sirens on the way
They're too late
'Cause nobody's going to save us
We're a rubbernecker's dream
We're burning gasoline
Go take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away...
And go
Go ahead and destroy this
Better come with an army
Are you feeling, feeling okay baby?
Take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away
I knew that I'd get like this again
That's why I try to keep at bay
Be 100% when I'm with you and then
The perfect heart's length away
The stickler is you've played not one beat wrong
You never promised me anything
Even sat me down and warned me just how they'd fall
I knew the odds were I'd never win
And here I am
It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life
My self-worth measured in text back tempo
It's been two days and 8 minutes too slow
Well there may well be others but I still like to pretend
That I'm the one you really want to grow old with
Got a schedule to stick to, got a world to keep sweet
You're so much to everyone all the time
Will you ever slow down? Will I ever come first?
The universe contracts to sigh
It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life
It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling, please
You know you'll never be lonely, no you'll always be loved
And maybe you never need more than that
But for the surplus that loves, what's to become of us?
Does it even register on your conscience?
Long for one last showdown from a box in a crowd
Air compressed tight to explode
I'm clenching my ticket to the only way out
As you disappear in a puff of smoke
It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life
It's a half life
With you as my quarterback
A daft life
Sweet summer days when I was feeling so fine
Just you and me girl was a beautiful time
Oh yeah, said I felt so happy, my my my
I was through with doubt and pain
All the love I felt hadn't been in vain
Got damaged, I got damaged
I got damaged, I lost myself in you
I'd wake up beside you, you'd hold me in your arms
Nothing and nobody's gonna do me any harm
Oh yeah, said I felt so happy, my my my
And the way I felt inside
Made me feel so glad to be alive
Got damaged, I got damaged
I got damaged, I lost myself in you
(Do do doo) I'd never felt so happy
(Do do doo) I'd never felt so happy
(Do do doo) I'd never felt so happy
I'll never feel that way again, no, no, no, no, no, no
My my my, oh-oh
People can be precious but they ain't for keeping
I got too possessive but souls ain't for stealing
You were my addiction, I got strung out and crazy
Hit me like a fever when you left me baby
Stone, stone, stone in love with you
I was stone, stone, stone in love with you
I was stone, stone, stone in love with you
I was stone, stone, stone in love with you
I was stone...
This is the part of me that needs medication
This is the part of me that believes in heaven
This is the part of me that thinks outer space is all dead
This is the part of me that wishes it was with it
This is the part of me that's trying to be funny
This is the part of me that loves my parents
This is the part of me that thinks that ants are cavemen
This is the part of me that thinks all humans are ants
This is the part of me that learns from sitcoms
This is the part of me that means nothing
And I don't know
Well, I could go away and you could wish that I had stayed or just stayed gone
And I don't know
And I don't know at all
So, out of the context and into what you meant
And you know your reasons
You don't know who you are, but you know who you wanna be
I don't know
So you go to the library to get yourself a book
And you look and you look
But you didn't find anything to read
And I don't know at all
Left all my kinder parts rusting and peeling
That guy was complaining as he looked at the ceiling
My nose isn't that big, it looks nothing like me
We're all doctors trading sadness for numbness
Grass looks much greener, but it's green-painted cement
The mayor's machines are there cleaning the pavement
You can't make dirt clean so we'll just lemon-scent it
It was January, 1963
When Johnny came home with a gift for me
He said 'I bought it for you because I love you
And I bought it for you 'cause it's your birthday, too'
He was so very nice, he was so very kind
To think of me at this point in time
I used to think of him, he used think of me
He told me to close my eyes
My gift would be a great surprise
I saw tears were in his eyes
He never meant to hurt me
Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
There's so many ways our lives have changed
But please, I beg, don't do this to me
Johnny, don't point that gun at me
Can I save my life at any price?
For God's sake won't you listen to me?
And though he was ashamed that he had took a life
Johnny came home with another wife
And he often remembered how it used to be
Before that special occasion, 1963
There is too many ways that you could kill someone
Like in a love affair, when the love has gone
He used to think of her, she used to think of him
He told me to close my eyes
My gift would be a great surprise
I saw tears were in his eyes
He never meant to hurt me
Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
There's so many ways our lives have changed
But please, I beg, don't do this to me
Johnny, you keep on using me
Can I change my life for any price?
Oh, Johnny, won't you listen to me?
He told me to close my eyes
My gift would be a great surprise
I saw hatred in his eyes
But he never meant to hurt me
Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
There's so many ways our lives have changed
But please, I beg, don't do this to me
Johnny, you keep on using me
Can I change my life for any price?
Oh, Johnny, won't you listen to me?
I just want you to be mine,
And I don't want this world to shine
I don't want this bridge to burn
Oh, Johnny, do you miss me?
I just want to feel free
I will always feel free
I will always feel free
I will always feel free
I will always feel free
I hope my smile
Can distract you
I hope my fists
Can fight for two
So it never has to show
And you'll never know
I hope my love
Can blind you
I hope my arms
Can bind you
So you'll never have to see
What we've grown to be
One may think
We're all right
But we need pills
To sleep at night
We need lies
To make it through the day
We're not ok
One may think
We're doing fine
But if I had to lay it on the line
We're losing ground
With every passing day
We're not ok
But that's one thing
I would never
One thing I would never
That's one thing
I would never say to you
I wait for the postman to bring me a letter.
I wait for the good Lord to make me feel better.
And I carry the weight of the world on my shoulders
A family in crisis that only grows older.
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?
Daughter to father, daughter to father
I am broken but I am hoping.
Daughter to father, daughter to father
I am crying, a part of me is dying and
These are, these are
The confessions of a broken heart.
And I wear all your old clothes, your polo sweater.
I dream of another you
The one who would never (never).
Leave me alone to pick up the pieces
A daddy to hold me, that's what I needed.
So why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?!
Daughter to father, daughter to father
I don't know you, but I still want to.
Daughter to father, daughter to father
Tell me the truth, did you ever love me?
Cause these are, these are
The confessions of a broken heart.
I love you
I love you
I love you
I...
I love you!
Daughter to father, daughter to father
I don't know you, but I still want to
Daughter to father, daughter to father
Tell me the truth
Did you ever love me?
Did you ever love me?
These are
The confessions of a broken heart
Oh, yeah
I wait for the postman to bring me a letter.
Did you expect it all to stop
At the wave of your hand?
Like the sun's just gonna drop
If it's night you demand.
Well, in the dark we're just air
So the house might dissolve,
But once we're gone, who's gonna care
If we were ever here at all?
Well, summer's gonna come,
It's gonna cloud our eyes again.
No need to focus
When there's nothing that's worth seeing.
So we trade liquor for blood
In an attempt to tip the scales.
I think you lost what you loved
In that mess of details.
They seemed so important at the time,
But now you can't even recall
Any names, faces, or lines,
It's more the feeling of it all.
Well, winter's gonna end,
I'm gonna clean these veins again
So close to dying that I finally can start living.
I just finished writing Jubilee Street
I lay down on my bed and fell into a deep sleep
And when I awoke, I believed I'd taken a bride called Mary Stanford
And I flew into a frenzy searching high and low
Because in my dream, the girl was very young
I said, "Hey little girl, where do you hide?
You draw lightning from the sky"
Oh, all of this and her dark hair
And all of this and her dark hair, oh Lord
Oh, see that girl coming on down
Coming on down, coming on down
See that girl coming on down
Coming on down, coming on down
Last night your shadows scampered up the wall
It'd fly and leaped like a black spider between your legs
And cried, "My children, my children
They are lost to us"
All of this and her dark hair, oh no
All of this and her dark hair, oh Lord
See that girl coming on down
Coming on down, coming on down
See that girl coming on down
Coming on down, coming on down
See that girl coming on down
Coming on down, coming on down
See that girl coming on down
Coming on down, coming on down
He calls me to the ocean
Takes me wandering through the street
A restless imagination
But for now I move my feet on the ground
'Cause I feel like going home
I can float above the ceiling
I like drifting through the air
I tend to lose my concentration
But right now the clouds don't appeal too much
I feel like going home
Sometimes late at night while running from the rain
Running from the voices filling up my brain
Now I wish they'd leave me alone
And let me be, to go off on my own
Let me be to go home
I feel like going home
Walking up the hill tonight
And you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make
All those mistakes and be wise
But please try to be patient
I know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to see
The strength inside me burning
Where are you my angel now?
Don't you see me crying?
And I know that you can't do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying
I'm on my knees in front of him
But he doesn't seem to see me
But all his troubles on his mind
He's looking right through me
And I'm letting myself down
By satisfying you
And I wish that you could see
I have my troubles too
Looking at you sleeping
I'm with a man I know
I'm sitting here weeping
While the hours pass so slow
And I know that in the morning
I'll have to let you go
And you'll be just a man
Once I used to know
But for these past few days
Someone I don't recognize
This isn't all my fault
When will you realize?
Looking at you leaving
I'm looking for a sign
People say we got it made
Don't they know we're so afraid?
Isolation
We're afraid to be alone
Everybody got to have a home
Isolation 
Just a boy and a little girl
Trying to change the whole wide world
Isolation
The world is just a little town
Everybody trying to put us down
Isolation 
I don't expect you to understand
After you've caused so much pain
But then again, you're not to blame
You're just a human, a victim of the insane 
We're afraid of everyone
Afraid of the sun
Isolation
The sun will never disappear
But the world may not have many years
Isolation
Friends we've been for so long
Now true colors are showing
Makes me wanna cry oh yes it does
'Cause I had to say goodbye
By now I should know
That in time things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad
How can I adjust
To the way that things are going
It's killing me slowly
Oh I just want it to be how it used to be
'Cause I wish that I could stay
But in time things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad
You cannot hide the way you feel inside I realize
Your actions speak much louder than words
So tell me why oh
By now I should know that
That in time things must change
So it shouldn't be it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad
By now I should know
That in time things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad
By now by now I should know
That in time things must grow
And I had to leave to you behind
So why do I feel so sad
If it couldn't be that bad
Tell me why?
By now I should know
That in time things must grow
And I had to leave you behind
So why do I feel so sad
If it couldn't be that bad
Tell me why
By now I should know
That in time things would change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad
Tryin' to be misunderstood
But it doesn't do me any good
Love the way they smiled at me
Held their face for eternity
Now let them all fly off
When it comes down
It all comes down
And you will not be found
When it's over, it's all over
Even if I make a sound
I'll be misunderstood
By the beautiful and good in this city
None of it was planned
Take me by the hand
Just don't try and understand
Tryin' to be misunderstood
Just a product of my childhood
And still I find myself outside
You can't say I haven't tried
Perhaps I tried too hard
No excuses, won't apologise
Or justify your lies
Come find me, tell them to me
Look me in the eyes
I'll be misunderstood
By the beautiful and good in this city
None of this was planned
Take me by the hand
Just don't try and understand
Can't forgive, sorry to say
You don't know you're guilty anyway
Isn't it funny how we don't speak
The language of love?
I'm working on my backwards walk
Walking with no shoes or socks
And the time rewinds to the end of May
I wish we'd never met, then met today
I'm working on my faults and cracks
Filling in the blanks and gaps
And when I write them out they don't make sense
I need you to pencil in the rest
I'm working on drawing a straight line
And I'll draw until I get one right
It's bold and dark, girl, can't you see
I done drawn a line between you and me
I'm working on erasing you
Just don't have the proper tools
I'll get hammered, forget that you exist
There's no way I'm forgetting this
I'm working hard on walking out
Shoes keep sticking to the ground
My clothes won't let me close the door
'Cause the trousers seem to love your floor
I been working on my backwards walk
There's nowhere else for me to go
Except back to you just one last time
Say yes before I change my mind
Say yes before I
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're
Midnight's calling 
Are you close behind? 
Midnight's calling 
Are you close behind? 
Trees without leaves an' notes that don't ring 
Wine left to rot an' a voice that can't sing 
And hours of making love inside
And a light that won't shine in the darkness 
Could I be any clearer? 
Could I speak any plainer? I need you here 
Just to lead my way
And fall, fall, fall 
She'd scolded me for my sinful and wicked ways
Towered above me, do you follow? 
And watched with concealed pleasure 
As I've ripped out my heart and said 
I'm bad, I just can't help it 
But I tr-tr-try to be good 
And trees without leaves and notes that don't ring 
Wine left to rot and a voice that can't sing 
And hours of making love inside 
And a light that just won't shine in the darkness
Could I be any clearer? 
Could I speak any plainer? I need you here 
Just to lead my way
And fall, fall, fall 
There's people making lonely
There's people making lonely sometime
I've run out of complicated theories
So now I'm taking back my words
I'm preparing for the breakdown
Your t-shirt lost its smell of you
And the bathroom's still a mess
Remind me why we decided this was for the best...
Because I miss you love
I miss you love
Because I miss you love
I miss you love
Because I miss you love
I miss you love
I know the distance is a factor
But I stretch as often as I can
My goal is to reach your hands any day now
Please don't blame me for trying,
To fix this one last time
I have a hard time as it is
Because I miss you love
I miss you love
Because I miss you love
I miss you love
Because I miss you love
I miss you love
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Don't act like you don't know me
It's still me, I never changed
I'll be here when you come back
And I miss you love
I miss you love
And I miss you love
I miss you love
And I miss you love
I miss you love
And I miss you love
I miss you love
And I miss you love
I miss you love
And I miss you love
I miss you love
And I miss you love
I miss you love
Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare
Is there I still longing there?
Oh I hate myself, and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale
Current girlfriend, ex-girlfriend
I'm trying to be cool
Am I being paranoid, am I seeing things?
Am I just insecure?
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby
So I wait for you to call and I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah I want it all over you, I'm gonna mark my territory
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Please don't forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history
But I'm your girlfriend, now I'm your girlfriend
Trying to be cool
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
That I'm just insecure
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby
So I wait for you to call and I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah I want it all over you, I'm gonna mark my territory
So I wait for you to call and I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah I want it all over you, I'm gonna mark my territory
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
It was in the march of the winter I turned seventeen
That I bought those pills
I thought I would need
And I wrote a letter to my family
Said it's not your fault
And you've been good to me
It's just lately I've been feeling
Like I don't belong
Like the ground's not mine to walk upon
And I've heard that music
Echo through the house
Where my grandmother drank
By herself
And I sat watching a flower
As it was withering
I was embarrassed by its honesty
So I'd prefer to be remembered as a smiling face
Not this fucking wreck
That's taken its place
So please forgive what I have done
No you can't stay mad at the setting sun
'Cause we all get tired, I mean eventually
There is nothing left to do but sleep
But spring came bearing sunlight
Those persuasive rays
So I gave myself a few more days
My salvation it came, quite suddenly
When Justin spoke very plainly
He said "Of course it's your decision,
But just so you know,
If you decide to leave,
Soon I will follow"
I wrote this for a baby
Who has yet to be born
My brother's first child
I hope that womb's not too warm
'Cause it's cold out here
And it'll be quite a shock
To breathe this air
To discover loss
So I'd like to make some changes
Before you arrive
So when your new eyes meet mine
They won't see no lies
Just love.
Just love.
I will be pure
No, no, I know I will be pure
Like snow, like gold
Like snow, like gold
Like snow, like snow
Like gold, like gold, like gold
I must be
One of the devil's daughters
They look at me with scorn
I'll never hear their horn
Sometimes
It's like chains
Sometimes I hang my head
In shame
When people see me 
They scandalize my name
I'm going down
To the devil's water
I'm gonna drown
In that troubled water
It's coming 'round my soul
It's way beyond control
I must be one
I must be one
I must be
One of the devil's daughters
They look at me with scorn
I'll never hear their horn
Sometimes
It's like chains
Sometimes I hang my head
In shame
When people see me 
They scandalize my name
I'm going down
To the devil's water
I'm gonna drown
In that troubled water
It's coming 'round my soul
It's way beyond control
I must be one
I must be one
I must be
I bet you're wondering how I knew
That this would come to an end
He stole your heart from you
So you tossed me out to the wind
I keep pretending not to care
But the winter scent in her hair
Compels my hands to do
The things my heart wouldn't dare
I'll keep holding on to you
See no use perfecting lives with strangers
If only you, if only now
And in the twilight of this hour
When fools are mistaken for men
This shadow suits me well
My regrets, I'll face in the end
I'll keep holding on to you
See no use perfecting lives with strangers
If only you, if only now
I'll keep holding on to you
See no use perfecting love with strangers
If only you, if only now
There's an eclipse in your eye
Where I used to shine
Every secret untold
Is a planet aligned
Don't need prophets or preachers
To make sense of the signs
When the buried and hidden
Can be seen by the blind
You're right,
Some words are just unspoken
So right,
Then it all just falls apart
The day I break your heart
I caught my reflection
In the corner of your eye
You said "Don't even ask the question,
And I won't tell the lie"
Where there's no accusation
There's no need for denial
And if you hadn't heard that whisper
There'd be no tear to wipe from your eye
You're right,
Some words are best unspoken
So right,
Then it all just falls apart
The day I break your heart
Never took no advice
Not the foolish, not the wise
All the truth that I needed
Was right there in your smile
Every prophecy written
Of what's going to be
All beginnings and endings, 
They're about you and me
You're right,
Some words are best unspoken
So right,
Until it all just falls apart
You're right,
Some words are best unspoken
So right,
Then it all just falls apart
The day I break your heart
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't want to leave home
Without your love
Without it
You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it
Then what'd you say forever for
If forever is out the door
I'll ignore when you call
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't want to leave home
Without your love
Without it
You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real and I believe that
But if I fall for it again, I would be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't want to leave home
Without your love
Without it
I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen
You acted like you wanted this
But then you let me off
I thought you would be there when I go
You promised you would be there when I go
But all the broken promises I won't miss
I'm finished, all I know are the facts
When I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
Been there done that
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't want to leave home
Without your love
Without it
I hitched a ride with my soul by the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame down memory lane
I never did find my way back
You know that I've gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me?
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you?
You're standing ignoring me
I thought that I heard someone say now
"There's no time for running away now"
Hey now, hey now
Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame
The first thing I saw as I walked through the door
Was a sign on the wall that read
It said you might never know that I want you to know
What's written inside of your head
And time as it stands won't be held in my hands
Or living inside of my skin
And as it fell from the sky I asked myself why
Can I never let anyone in?
I thought that I heard someone say now
"There's no time for running away now"
Hey now, hey now
Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame
Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame
I hitched a ride with my soul by the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame down memory lane
I never did find my way back
You know that I've gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me?
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you?
You're standing ignoring me
I thought that I heard someone say now
"There's no time for running away now"
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame
Two great European narcotics,
Alcohol and Christianity,
I know which one I prefer
We never went to church,
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
But it's hit me since you left us,
And it's so hard not to search.
If you were still about,
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now,
I just get a bit scared,
Every now,
Hope I made you proud.
On your birthday when mum passed the forks and spoons,
I put my head on the table I was so distraught with you,
You tidied your things into the bin,
The more poorly you grew,
So there's nothing of yours to hold or to talk to.
You'd put your hand up and interrupt the conversation with a, but...
People say I interrupt people with the same look.
Sometimes I think so hard I can't remember how your face looked,
Started reading about dreams in your favourite book.
I panic and pace when I can't see the right thing to do.
You'd be scratching your head through the best advice you knew.
And I feel sad I can't hear you reciting it through,
I miss you dad but I've got nothing to remind me of you
We never went to church,
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
But it's hit me since you left us,
And it's so hard not to search.
If you were still about,
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now,
I just get a bit scared,
Every now,
Hope I made you proud.
I needed a break when your book about dreams was taken,
I needed to pray or see a priest that day,
I needed to leave this trade and just heave it away.
But I cleaned up my place like you so I could see things straight.
I never cared about God when life was sailin' on the calm,
So I said I'd get my head down and I'd deal with the ache in my heart,
And for that if God exists I'd reckon he'd pay me regard,
Mum says me and you are the same from the start.
I guess than you did leave me something to remind me of you,
Everytime I interrupt someone like you used to,
When I do something like you you'll be on my mind or through,
'Cause I forgot you left me behind to remind me of you.
We never went to church,
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
But it's hit me since you left us,
And it's so hard not to search.
If you were still about,
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now,
I just get a bit scared,
Every now,
Hope I made you proud.
We never went to church,
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
But it's hit me since you left us,
And it's so hard not to search.
But you you still tell me how you didn't know what to do even now,
And then I'm not so scared somehow,
'Cause I know that you'd be proud.
I got a good one for you dad,
I'm gonna see a priest, a Rabbi and a Protestant clergyman,
You always said I should hedge my bets.
When my dad died the worms ate out both his eyes.
His soul flew right up in the sky and I cried myself to sleep.
My mother lies alone on her back at night.
Adding up hours till her demise, she counts herself to sleep.
When my sister finds my body closed up like the blinds,
I tell her I promise its fine, but she cries herself to sleep.
The men in black ties arrive at the house in surprise.
To find a little girl by your side in the wood box where you're sleeping.
I still see you inside of this God-awful house
You move awfully quiet now
And I still feel you everywhere
You told me this has always been worth living,
But what's really worth living anymore?
Did you close your eyes as you walked away?
Did I get too close in the pouring rain?
If there's one more chance for us here tonight
I'll take the long way 'round this time
We sing
Oh, love, it's easy if you don't try to please me
If you don't want to see me any more
We sing out...
Oh, oh
Here we go again
I know how I lost a friend
We go 'round and 'round again
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Bitter is the kiss that says goodbye
I can hear it in your voice, I see it in your eyes
'Cause we've been this low and we've been around this bend
I don't to lose you all over again
We sing
Oh, love, it's easy if you don't try to please me
If you don't want to see me any more
We sing out...
Oh, oh
Here we go again
I know how I lost a friend
We go 'round and 'round again
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh no,
Here we go again
I know how I lost a friend
We go 'round and 'round again
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Around here
We've got a light here that's not going away
If all is broken and all is lost
Then I've been found
So here's my heart I'll give over and over again
Oh oh,
Here we go again
I know how I lost a friend
We go 'round and 'round again
Oh no
Oh no
James, he came to my place
He said he had to see my face
He hopes that we can still be friends
In his own way, he'll love me till the end
And, James, he came to the door
Wanting to know for sure
Why love gets up and goes
I'm sorry, but it had no place to grow
Oh, James, my love for you is stronger, don't you know?
I'd like to celebrate you, dear
All in all, it's been a pretty good year
I looked deep within myself
I got scared by just how hard I fell
Oh, James, you broke me, I thought I knew you well
Oh, you had me, honey and me, oh, sun and the moon
I'll be fine by June, I could tell that you weren't well
Oh, James, you broke me, I thought I knew you well
Oh, James, you broke me, I thought I knew you well
Oh, can't you see you belong with me?
I could tell that you weren't well
Oh, James, you broke me, I thought I knew you well
Oh, James, you broke me, I thought I knew you well
How long I'll wait 
Just to say goodbye 
Ten different ways to enjoy this night 
Can't do this anymore 
Won't feel you anymore 
How long I'll wait 
Just to say goodbye 
You could never let me in 
Holding on until the end 
The time I waste just to say goodbye 
Out of your way 
I could do this right 
Can't see you anymore 
Won't feel you anymore 
How long I'll stay 
Just to say goodbye, say goodbye 
Leave it all the fights and all 
Summer's getting colder 
Drive all night to hold you tight 
Back to California 
Days went by 
We waited and I guess we're getting older 
We couldn't win in the end 
You're gone 
I'm miles away 
Turning out your lights 
Ten different ways I could end this night 
Can't do this anymore 
Won't feel you anymore 
How long I'll wait 
Just to say goodbye, say goodbye 
Leave it all the fights and all 
Summer's getting colder 
Drive all night to hold you tight 
Back to California 
Days went by 
We waited and I guess we're getting older 
We couldn't win in the end 
You're gone
It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them too?
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp-lit streets and dew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam?
Hear the song our heart is beating to
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will leave
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
And oh
And oh
And oh
I can see the stars
From America
Here we are
Stuck by this river
You and I
Underneath the sky that's ever falling down, down, down
Ever falling down
Through the day
As if on an ocean
Waiting here
Always failing to remember why we came, came, came
I wonder why we came
You talk to me
As if from a distance
And I reply
With impressions chosen from another time, time, time
From another time
I turned my head away
Didn't wanna hear what you said
You had changed your mind
I showed up insecure
But I thought you would be sure
I guess I had lost sight
But at the end of my life
I'll look back of my life
And I'll know that my life was good
At the end of my life
I'll look back of my life
And see I went after you like I should
I went after what I wanted
I went after what I wanted
And I never really got it
But it don't matter at all
I guess it was a lot
To ask for these things we'd lost
I guess it was just a dream
And time changes many things
But my heart it still sings
For you, I don't know why
But at the end of my life
I'll look back of my life
And I'll know that my life was good
At the end of my life
I'll look back of my life
And see I went after you like I should
I went after what I wanted
I went after what I wanted
And I never really got it
But it don't matter at all
I thought I'd spend my last days holding your hand
Now how can I
[ Since he's | Senses ] lying dead on the floor
But at the end of my life
I'll look back of my life
And I'll know that my life was good
At the end of my life
I'll look back of my life
We'll see I went after you like I should
I went after what I wanted
I went after what I wanted
And I never really got it
Everything else I lost it
I went after what I wanted
I went after what I wanted
And the rest don't really matter
It don't matter at all
It don't matter at all
Tempo a gente tem quanto a gente dá
Corre o que correr, custe o que custar
Tempo a gente dá quanto a gente tem
Custa o que correr, corre o que custar, ah
O tempo que eu perdi, só agora eu sei
Aprender a dar foi o que ganhei
E ando ainda atrás desse tempo
Te...mpo de não correr, nem de me encontrar
Ah, não se mexer!
Beija-flor no ar
Thuru-tchuru, tchuru-tchuru
Thuru-tchuru, tchuru-tchuru
Thuru-tchuru, tchuru-tchuru
Thuru-tchuru, dara-dara-dara
O rio fica lá, a água que correu
Chega na maré, ele vira mar
Como se morrer fosse desaguar
Derramar no céu, se purificar
Ah, deixar pra trás
Sais e minerais, evaporar

This won't break your heart, but I just think it could
'Cause I haven't tried as hard as I should
To separate you from everything I do
But I would never want to come between us two
I'll keep your memory vague
So you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said
Sometimes so it reminds me
I'll keep your memory vague
So you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said
Sometimes so it reminds me
Now I'm thinking back to what I said before
I hope your heart won't have to hurt anymore
'Cause it's really not that sad from here
Because the moments I can feel you near
They keep you close to me my dear
And if they ever become too clear
I'll keep your memory vague
So you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said
Sometimes so it reminds me
I'll keep your memory vague
So you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said
Sometimes so it reminds me
Now you've gone away, don't worry it's okay
That you're gone away
Now you've gone away, further than yesterday
But you'll never leave these scenes
My mind replays
I'll keep your memory vague
So you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said
Sometimes so it reminds me
I'll keep your memory vague
So you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said
Sometimes so it reminds me
I'll keep your memory vague
So you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said
Sometimes so it reminds me
(Where in the world have you gone now?)
I'll keep your memory vague
So you won't feel bad about me
(Where in the world have you gone now?)
I'll say the things that you said
Sometimes so it reminds me
(Where in the world)
Poetry is no place for a heart that's a whore
And I'm young and I'm strong
But I feel old and tired
Overfired
And I've been poked and stoked
It's all smoke, there's no more fire
Only desire
For you, whoever you are
For you, whoever you are
You say my time here has been some sort of joke
That I've been messing around
Some sort of incubating period
For when I really come around
I'm cracking up
And you have no idea
No idea how it feels to be on your own
In your own home
With the fucking phone
And the mother of gloom
In your bedroom
Standing over your head
With her hand in your head
With her hand in your head
I will not pretend
I will not put on a smile
I will not say I'm all right for you
When all I wanted was to be good
To do everything in truth
To do everything in truth
Oh I wish, I wish, I wish I was born a man
So I could learn how to stand up for myself
Like those guys with guitars
I've been watching in bars
Who've been stamping their feet to a different beat
To a different beat
To a different beat
I will not pretend
I will not put on a smile
I will not say I'm all right for you
When all I wanted was to be good
To do everything in truth
To do everything in truth
You bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
Oh you bloody
I will not pretend
I will not put on a smile
I will not say I'm all right for you
For you, whoever you are
For you, whoever you are
I should've known
With a boy like you
Your middle name is always
I'd always love you
Uh-huh yeah
You let the needle drop
I think that you could do so much better
Those conventions are taking their toll on you
The phantom is disguised
It's horrifyin' right before your eyes
The phantom is inside
And I should've known
With a boy like you
Your middle name is always
I'd always want you
Uh-huh yeah
The phantom is disguised
It's horrifyin' right before your eyes
The phantom is inside
It's hideous right before your eyes
The phantom he's watchin' you
The phantom is watchin' you
You
Before you advertise, all the fame is implied
With no fortune unseen
Sell the rights to your blight time machine
While I'm dulled by excess (dulled by excess)
And a cynic at best (cynic at best)
My art imitates crime
Paid for by the allies, so invest
Now I'm finding truth is a ruined, nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring into glassy eyes, mesmerized
There's a vintage thirst returning, but I'm sheltered by my channel surfing
Every famine virtual. Retrovertigo
A tribute to false memories with conviction, cheap imitation
Is it fashion or disease? Post-ironic, remains a mouth to feed
Sell the rights to your blight and you'll eat
Now I'm finding truth is a ruined, nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring into glassy eyes, mesmerized
See the vintage robot wearied then awakened by revision theories
Every famine virtual. Retrovertigo
It hurts to feel
It hurts to hear
It hurts to face it
It hurts to hide
It hurts to touch
It hurts to wake up
It hurts to remember
It hurts to hold on
Turn my head
The hurt's relentless
The hurt of emptiness
The hurt of wanting
The hurt of going on
The hurt of missing
The hurt is killing me
Turn my head
Off
Forever
Turn it off
Forever
Off forever
Turn it off forever
Ever blind
If you're searching out for something -
Don't try so hard
If you're feeling kinda nothing -
Don't try so hard
When your problems seem like mountains
You feel the need to find some answers
You can leave them for another day
Don't try so hard
But if you fall and take a tumble -
It won't be far
If you fail you mustn't grumble -
Thank your lucky stars
Just savour every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are raging round you
Stay right where you are
Don't try so hard
Ooh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools they make these rules
Don't try so hard
One day you'll be a sergeant major
Oh you'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons
Dressed as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try
To stand out from the crowd
Oh what a beautiful world
Is this the life for me
Oh what a beautiful world
It's the simple life for me
Oh don't try so hard
Oh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools - they make these rules
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard
Remember when I cried to you a thousand times
I told you everything, you know my feelings
It never crossed my mind that there would be a time
For us to say goodbye, what a big surprise
But I'm not lost, I'm not gone
I haven't forgot
These feelings I can't shake no more
This feeling's running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Remember when...
I remember when, it was 'together till the end'
Now I'm alone again, where do I begin?
I cried a little bit, you died a little bit
Please say there's no regrets, and say you won't forget
But I'm not lost, I'm not gone
I haven't forgot
These feelings I can't shake no more
This feeling's running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Remember when...
That was then, now it's the end,
I'm not going back, I can't pretend
Remember when
These feelings I can't shake no more
This feeling's running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Well a person can work up a mean mean thirst
After a hard day of nothin' much at all
Summer's passed, it's too late to cut the grass
There ain't much to rake anyway in the fall
And sometimes I just ain't in the mood
To take my place in back with the loudmouths
You're like a picture on the fridge that's never stocked with food
I used to live at home, now I stay at the house
And everybody wants to be special here
They call your name out loud and clear
Here comes a regular
Call out your name
Here comes a regular
Am I the only one here today?
Well a drinkin' buddy that's bound to another town
Once the police made you go away
And even if you're in the arms of someone's baby now
I'll take a great big whiskey to ya anyway
Everybody wants to be someone's here
Someone's gonna show up, never fear
'Cause here comes a regular
Call out your name
Here comes a regular
Am I the only one who feels ashamed?
Kneeling alongside old Sad Eyes
He says opportunity knocks once then the door slams shut
All I know is I'm sick of everything that my money can buy
The fool who wastes his life, God rest his guts
First the lights, then the collar goes up, and the wind begins to blow
Turn your back on a pay-you-back, last call
First the glass, then the leaves that pass, then comes the snow
Ain't much to rake anyway in the fall
It must be the colors
And the kids
That keep me alive
'Cause the music is boring me to death
It must just be the colors
And the kids that keep me alive
'Cause I wanna go ride away
To a January night
Built a shack with an old friend
He was someone I could learn from
Someone I could become
Will you meet me down
On a sandy beach
We can roll up our jeans
So the tide won't get us below the knees
Yellow hair
You are a funny bear
Yellow hair
You are such a funny bear
Slender fingers
Would hold me slender limbs would hold me
And you could say my name
Like you knew my name
I could stay here
Become someone different
I could stay here
Become someone better
It's so hard to go in the city
'Cause you wanna say hello to everybody
It's so hard to go into the city
'Cause you wanna say hey I love you to everybody
When we were teenagers we wanted to be the sky
Now all we wanna do is go to red places
And try to stay outta hell
It must be the colors
And the kids
That keep me alive
'Cause the music is boring me to death
It must just be the colors
And it must just be the kids
That keep me alive on this January night.
Yellow hair
You are a funny bear
Yellow hair
You are such a funny bear
This whiskey got me Feelin' pretty
So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry about the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind
You take me higher
Higher than I've ever been babe
Just come over let's pour a drink babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late
Too late
You're like my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a jay
I wanna go back to the old ways
But I'm drunk instead with a full ashtray
With a little bit too much to say
Lili, take another walk out of your fake world
Please put all the drugs out of your hand
You'll see that you can breath without no back up
So much stuff you got to understand
For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought
I'll be your guide
For every street of any scene
Any place you've never been
I'll be your guide
Lili, you know there's still a place for people like us
The same blood runs in every hand
You see it's not the wings that make the angel
Just have to move the bats out of your head
For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought
I'll be your guide
For every street of any scene
Any place you've never been
I'll be your guide
Lili, easy as a kiss we'll find an answer
Put all your fears back in the shade
Don't become a ghost without no colour
'Cause you're the best paint life ever made
For every step in any walk
Any town of any thought
I'll be your guide
For every street of any scene
Any place you've never been
I'll be your guide

Somewhere's hole to divides any way you want

Faking now faking who you are

Instrumental
Oh why can't I be what you need?
A new improved version of me
But I'm nothing so good, no I'm nothing
Just bones, a lonely ghost burning down songs
Of violence of love and of sorrow
I beg for just one more tomorrow
Where you hold me down, fold me in
Deep, deep, deep in the heart of your sins
I break in two over you, oh,
I break in two, and each piece of me dies
And only you can give the breath of life
But you don't see me, you don't
Here I'm thin between darkness and light
Bleached and blinded by these nights
Where I'm tossing and tortured till dawn
I view visions of you, then you're gone
The shock bleeds the red from my face
When I hear someone has taken my place
How could love be so thoughtless, so cruel?
When all, all that I did was for you
I break in two over you, oh,
I break in two, and each piece of me dies
And only you can give the breath of life
But you don't see me, you don't (x2)
I break in two over you, oh,
I break in two
Over you, I break in two
I will break in two, for you
Now you see me, now you don't
Now you need me, now you don't
Remembering everything
About my world and when you came,
Wondering, the change you'd bring
Means nothing else would be the same.
Did you know what you were doing, did you know?
Did you know how you would move me? Well,
I don't really think so.
But the night came down and swept us away.
And the stars, they seemed, to paint the most elaborate scene to date.
How could we know, that song, this show,
We'd learn so much about ourselves?
From Toledo to Tokyo,
The words were scribed on every page and now there's
Books up on our shelves.
Did you know how you would move us, did you know?
When the light first came upon us and we saw the Everglow?
And the moment's magic swept us away.
And the young man's dream was almost seen so plain...
When was the night that showed us the sign,
Revealed in the sky, to leave all behind?
But where to begin throwing caution to the wind?
We reached for the stars; everything is now
Ours...
Did you know how you would move me, did you know?
Did you know how you would move me? Well,
I don't even think so.
But the moment's magic swept us away.
And it's so close but
We're so far away.
It's so close but
We're so far away.
And I'll fall on my knees
Tell me how's the way to be
Tell me how's the way to go
Tell me all that I should know
And I'll fall on my knees
Tell me how's the way to go
Tell me how's the way to be
To evoke some empathy
Danger will follow me
Everywhere I go
Angels will call on me
And take me to my home
This tired mind just wants to be led home
And I'll fall on my knees
Tell me how's the way to go
Tell me how's the way to see
Show me all that I could be
And I'll fall on my knees
Tell me how's the way to be
Tell me how's the way to go
Tell me why I feel so low
Danger will follow me
Everywhere I go
Angels will call on me
And take me to my home
These tired eyes just want to remain closed
I don't see clearly
Can't feel nothing
Can you hear me
And I'll fall on my knees
And danger will follow me everywhere I go
Angels will call on me and take me to my home 
And danger will follow me everywhere I go
Angels will call on me and take me to my home 
And danger will follow me everywhere I go
If you find yourself here
On my side of town
I pray that you'd come to my door
And talk to me
Like you don't know
What we ever fought about
'Cause I don't remember anymore
I just know that she warms my heart
And knows what all my imperfections are
And she said that I was the brightest
Little firefly in her jar
And I just know that she warms my heart
And knows what all my imperfections are
And she says that I am the brightest
Little firefly in her jar
People you love will turn their backs on you 
You'll lose your hair, your teeth 
Your knife will fall out of its sheath 
But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie
People you hate will get their hooks into you 
They'll pull you down, you'll frown 
They'll tar you and drag you through town 
But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie 
No you still don't like to leave before the end of the show...
People you hate will get their hooks into you

No you still don't like to leave before the end of the show
I want summer-sad songs behind me
I want a to laugh again without her (fail or the bell?)
Want to be part of that nineteen eighty
Welcome to lookin' (come?) back tomorrow
Lookin' back every (at the?) day
I wanna see you put your hands (hand?) together
I wanna close my mind (hive or heart?)
I wanna hope to die
I hear Kate Moss talk
She talks to me
She's looking for a new beginning every day
When Monday comes, I want nothing
On Tuesday mornings, I want the same
Every day
Bye-bye
Nothing to embrace
Nothing for me every day
Nothing to embrace
Nothing for me every day
Nothing to embrace
Nothing for me every day
Every day
(To end)
It's about time that I came clean with you
I'm no longer fine, I'm no longer running smooth
I thought that I found myself under something new
Just one more line I repeat over and over again
Till I'm blue in the face with a choking regret
As I talk in circles round you on my bed
Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
When you left that night
It's about time that you got sick of me
No longer fun and so far from interesting
I thought that I found me a cure for feeling old
Just one more line to keep me sleeping loudly and cold
In disgrace with a shameful regret
As I talk in tongues to myself in my bed
Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
When you left that night
And all that followed fell like mercury to hell
Somehow we lost our heads for the last time
And all that followed fell like mercury to hell
Somehow we lost our heads for the last time
And I don't dream since I quit sleeping
And I haven't slept since I met you
And you can't breathe without coughing at daytime
And neither can I
So what do you say, your coffin, or mine?
I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them,
And then it was clear - I can't deny, I really miss him...
To think that I was wrong;
I guess you don't know what you got till it's gone...
Pain is just a consequence of love;
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us...
He wasn't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say,
And now that he's gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time to push my pride away,
'Cause you are, you are, you are my everything...
You are, you are, you are my everything...
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance;
You're travelling with my heart - I hope this is a temporary feeling,
'Cause it's too much to bear
Without you, and I know sorry ain't the cure...
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours,
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for, 'cause you are...
You weren't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say;
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time I push my pride away...
You are, you are, you are my everything...
You are, you are, you are my everything...
You are, you are, you are...
You are, you are, you are... my everything...
The reception's gotten fuzzy
The delicate balance has shifted
Put on your gloves and your black pumps
Let's pretend the fog has lifted
Now you see me
Now you don't
Now you say you love me
Pretty soon you won't
If we get our full three-score and ten
We won't pass this way again
So kiss me with your mouth open
Turn the tires toward the street and stay sweet
All the chickens come on home to roost
Plump bodies blotting out the sky
You know it breaks my heart in half, in half
When I see them try to fly
'Cause you just can't do
Things your body wasn't meant to
Hike up your fishnets
I know you
If we live to see the other side of this
I will remember your kiss
So do it with your mouth open
And take your foot off of the brake, for Christ's sake
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye my love
I can't hide
Can't hide
Can't hide what has come
I have to go, I have to go, I have to go
And leave you alone
But always know, always know, always know
That I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
Oh
Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye for now
Goodbye sunshine
Take care of yourself
I have to go, I have to go, I have to go
And leave you alone
But always know, always know, always know
That I love you so
I love you so
Oh
I love you so
Oh
La lullaby, distract me with your eyes
La lullaby, la lullaby, help me sleep tonight
La lullaby
La lullaby
La lullaby
I have to go
I have to go
I have to go
And leave you alone
But always know, always know, always know
That I love you so
I love you so
(Goodbye)
(Lullaby)
I love you so
(Goodbye)
(Lullaby)
I love you so
(Goodbye)
(Lullaby)
I love you so
(Goodbye)

I love you so
I love you so
Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye my love
Ronald Isley:
I feel you
I feel you
I ah
I feel you
I feel you
I wanna
I ah
You can put a stick in my spokes
I can be the butt of your jokes
I can be the laughing stock, I can be the hoax
But I ain't gonna lose you
No I ain't gonna lose
They can come and tear my house down
They can run me out of town
They can tie me up, call me a clown
But I ain't gonna lose you
No I ain't gonna lose you
I can't stand
The thought of another man
No I ain't gonna lose you
They can make me turn my back on my friends
Send me away to san quentin
Put me in the hole, a thousand times again
But I ain't gonna lose you
No I ain't gonna lose you
Throw me in a hurricane
Tell the whole world I've gone insane
Run an electric shock to my brain
But I ain't gonna lose you
No I ain't gonna lose you
I can't stand
The thought of another man
No I ain't gonna lose you
No I ain't gonna lose you
Ain't gonna lose X4
I'll sing it from my roof top
I'll sing it from the bus stop
I'll sing it on the street drunk to a cop
But I ain't gonna lose you
No I ain't gonna lose
Ain't gonna lose you
Ain't gonna lose
Laid our blessings on the ground,
The softening of sound
Draws us closed again
Stay, stay and watch the coals
Till they cease to glow
Like empty promises
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Baby?
There's nothing I can say
Nothing I can do
To bring you back again
This of life I know is true
It's all a falling through
And so I reach for you
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Don't you care
That it may seem unfair?
(You steal things you ought to borrow)
Don't you find
That it may seem unkind?
(I'd rather breathe than drown in sorrow)
Why, why did you go
Why did you go away baby
Trouble oh, trouble set me free.
I have seen your face and it's too much, too much for me.
Trouble, oh, trouble can't you see?
You're eating my heart away
And there's nothing much left of me.
I have drunk you wine.
You have made yours worth mine
So won't you be fair?
So won't you be fair?
I don't want no more of you
So won't you be kind to me
So let me go where,
I want to go there.
Trouble
Oh, trouble
Move away
I have seen your face
And It's to much for me today.
Trouble, oh, trouble
Can't you see?
You have made me a wreck
Now won't you leave me in my misery?
I have seen your eyes
And I can see Death's disguise
Hangin' on me, hangin' on me.
I am beat and torn,
Shattered and tossed and worn,
Too shocking to see
Too shocking to see
Trouble, oh, trouble
Move from me
I have paid my debt
Now won't you leave me in my misery.
Trouble, oh, trouble
Please be kind.
I don't want no fight
And I haven't got a lot of time.
They come here alone and they leave in twos
Except for you and me who just came to use
If you're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me?
Why you tell me stuff that's so plainly untrue?
If you'll be straight with me, I'll be straighter with you
If you're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me?
I've been wanting to do anything for a long time
But whatever you got right now will probably suit me fine
If you're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me?
I've been wanting to do anything for a long time
Whatever you're doing now would probably suit me fine
If you're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me?
What are you doing hanging out with me?
And through the life force and there goes her friend;
On her Nishiki, it's out of time...
And through the portal, they can make amends;
Hey... would you say, "Whatever, we're blanket friends"?
Can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way...
And through the walls, they made their mudpies;
"I've got your mind," I said, she said, "I've your voice..."
I said, "You don't need my voice, girl, you have your own,"
But you never thought it was enough of...
So they went, years and years
Like sisters, blanket, blanket girls, 
Always there through, through that and this;
"There's nothing we cannot ever fix," I said...
Can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way...
Hey... can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way...
Bells and footfalls, and soldiers and dolls;
Brothers and lovers, she and I were...
Now she seems to be sand under his shoes;
There's nothing I can do...
Can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way...
Can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way...
And now I speak to you, are you in there?
You have her face and her eyes, but you are not her...
And we go at each other like blankettes,
Blankettes who can't find their... their thread and their bare...
Can't stop... can't stop loving... you...
Can't stop loving, can't stop what is on its way...
And I see it coming, and it's on its way...
If you're hurt
Why don't you tell someone
Don't feel bad
You're not the only one
Don't go hiding
Hiding in the shade
Don't go hiding
Hiding in the shade
If you were abused
I'll find someone to help you
I know you were used
What are you gonna do
Don't go hiding
Hiding in the shade
Don't go hiding
Hiding, in the shade
Don't go hiding
Hiding in the shade
Don't go hiding
Hiding in the shade
Hiding, hiding
Don't go hiding, hiding, hiding in the shade
In the shade, in the
In the shade, in the shade
In the shade
Shade
From inside his mouth, I lick the blood
While he's roaring and biting, I wash off the mud
'Cause the tempest is out to wrestle a while
Stop charging, my darling, get closer, be quiet
'Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
(We're entering a brave new world)
Set out with no map and turn off your torch
(And we're only but a second away!)
'Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
(Take my hand and we can out-run time!)
You'll get through, you'll be home, you'll be home
From inside his mouth, I lick the scars
In the woodland, the leaves are marking a path
And if you'd just rest your head, stop repeating the charge
You know that this time will turn all the locks
'Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
(We're entering a brave new world)
Just set out with no map and turn off your torch
(And we're only but a second away!)
'Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
(Take my hand and we can out-run time!)
You'll get through, you'll be home, you'll be home
Just sit still, does it hurt? Does it hurt?
Just sit still, does it hurt? Does it hurt?
Just sit still, does it hurt? Does it hurt?
Just sit still, does it hurt? Does it hurt?

Need a change
Not to imitate, but to irritate
All the ones who hate
I may be late
Always seem to get the wrong date
Well I guess it's fate
I live in a cemetery
Full of good will and integrity
You see, I have no specialty
Here's your warning
I'll give you click, click, boom
I live in a cemetery
I need a change
Not to imitate, but to irritate
I live in a cemetery

The drunk kids, the catholics
They're all about the same
They're waiting for something
Hoping to be saved
Well I have been happy the past couple days
Just thinking of the women who've taken your place
And every night I think I certaintly won't ever sleep sober or alone
And then suddenly it occurs to me
I've slept alone before you
And so I pour myself the stiffest drink my stomach can stand
And convince myself to lay back down again
I'm gonna lay back down, I'm gonna lay back down again
The drunk kids, the catholics
They're all about the same
They're waiting for something
Hoping to be saved
The drunk kids, the catholics
They're all about the same
They're waiting for something
Hoping to be saved

To paint in the caves
But I'm working all weekend
I need to get paid
They crawl from the oceans
To paint in the caves
But I'm working all weekend
I need to get paid
They crawl from the oceans
To paint in the caves
But I'm working all weekend
I need to get paid
They crawl from the oceans
To paint in the caves
But I'm working all weekend
I need to get paid
Quote you are my soul unquote
Now does that sound familiar?
You kissed the boy and make him feel this way
Quote well this is me unquote
And you have been so ugly your entire life
So why change now?
Is this how you wanna go down, right before my eyes?
You're the saddest sight I know
You're quiet, you never make a sound
But here inside my mind you are the loudest one I know
Quote we never talk unquote
And that's when I don't answer
Don't you dare ask why
Because you don't want to know,
Quote Well woe is me unquote
How different I've become
And no one understands, my dear, no one really cares
Is this how you wanna go down?
Right before my eyes, you are the saddest sight I know
And you're quiet, you never make a sound
But here inside my mind you are the loudest one I know
And you were right, right from the start
It took everything you had, but you finally broke my...
And now the old flames will pass away
I saw your life once
Did you see mine
But not all things will pass away
You turned your light off
So I turned mine, away from your sadness, away from the nothing that you feel for me
Is this how you wanna go down?
Right before my eyes, you are the saddest sight I know
You're so quiet and you never make a sound
But here inside my mind you are the loudest one I know
And you were right, right from the start, it took everything you had, but you finally broke my...
Quote, hey listen 'cause I'll only say this once
I finally found the words
That mean enough to me (You're right)
Good bye my soul, unquote
This is our music from the bachelor's den;
The sound of lonliness turned up to ten;
A horror soundtrack, from a stagnant waterbed
And it sounds just like this
This is the sound of someone losing the plot
Making out that they're ok when they're not
You're gonna like it but not a lot
And the chorus goes like this
Oh baby here comes the fear again
The end is near again
A monkey's built a house on your back;
You can't get anyone to come in the sack
And here comes another panic attack oh
Here we go again
So now you know the words to my song
Pretty soon you'll all be singing along
When you're sad when you're lonely and it all turns out wrong
When you've got the fear
And when you're no longer searching for beauty or love
Just some kind of life with the edges taken off
When you can't even define what it is that you are frightened of
This song will be here
Oh baby here comes the fear again
The end is near again
If you ever get that chimp off your back
If you ever find the thing that you lack
Oh you know you're only having a laugh oh
Oh here we go again
Until the end
Until the end
Easy, easy
My man and me
We could rest and remain here, easily
We are tested and pained
By what's beyond our bed
We are blessed and sustained
By what is not said
No one knows what is coming
Or who will harvest what we have sewn
Or how I've been dulling and dumbing
In the service of the heart alone
Or how I am worn to the bone
By the river
And in the river made o' light
I'm your little life-giver
I will give my life
Haven't you seen what I've seen?
Don't you know what you ought to do?
I was born to love
And I intend to love you
Down in the valley where the fields are green
Watch my luck turn, fro, and to
Pluck every last daisy clean till only I may love you
I am easy
Easy to keep
Honey, you please me
Even in your sleep
But my arms want to carry
My heart wants to hold
Tell me your worries, I want to be told
Sit, and see how the fog
From the port in the bay
Lays like snow at the foot of the Roanoke
Hear the frog, going courting
Till the day he croaks
Saying, even then
How there is light in the river
And there's a river made o' light
C'mon, you little life-giver
Give your life
Who asked you?
Asked you if you want to be
Loved by me?
Who died and made you in charge of who loves who?
All the livelong day
If I have my way, I will love you
But one can't carry the weight
Or change the fate of two
I've been waiting for a break
How long's it gonna take?
Let me love you
How about it?
How about what I have to say?
How about that livelong day?
How am I gonna stay here without you?
Easy, easy
You must not fear
You must meet me to see me
I am barely here
But like a Bloody Mary
Seen in the mirror
Speak my name
And I appear
Speak my name
And I appear
Speak
And I appear
Just one look into your eyes
One look and I'm crying
'Cause you're so beautiful
Just one kiss and I'm alive
One kiss and I'm ready to die
'Cause you're so beautiful, yeah
Just one touch and I'm on fire
One touch and I'm crying
'Cause you're so beautiful
Just one smile and I'm wild
One smile and I'm ready to die
'Cause you're so beautiful
And you're so beautiful
My darling
Oh, you're so beautiful, oh...
You're so beautiful
Oh, my baby
You're so beautiful
Oh, and you're so beautiful, yeah
Oh, my darling; oh, my baby, yeah
And you're so beautiful
Oh...
If I could look across the country
From California to New Jersey
Then I would count the parks and lake resorts
And number all the jets and airports
All those rather dreary rain clouds still bother me
'Cause I look through the camera eyepiece and cannot see
If I could open up my window
And see from Tampa Bay to Juneau
Then I would survey all those open miles
And line them up in single file
Everywhere I look I see green scenic sublime
And all those oceanic vistas are so divine
If I was standing on the balcony
And you were walking down below
I'd feel rather depressed and out of place
And lonely just to watch you go
If you were swinging from the highway overpass
Within the western hemisphere
I'd feel rather afraid and insincere
If you began to disappear
If I was walking through a sad art gallery
And you were driving through the night
I'd feel rather alone and ill at ease
Beneath the brilliant showroom light
If I was flying on a plane above your town
And you were gazing at the sky
Somehow I'd feel intact and reassured
If you began to wave goodbye
Walk it off now
You can tell them all how, how hard we tried to work it out
Walk it off, dear
Standing here with your tail between your thighs
Here we stand, there's nothing left for you
There's nothing left for me
Here I am, there's nothing left for you
There's nothing left for me
I will never be what you want to see now
I will never be what you want to see now
I never wanted you to go
But I'd be the last to let you know
Walk it off now
You can tell them all how, how good it feels to be let down
Tell them all about
How long it was to get around to her side of town
Here we stand, there's nothing left for you
There's nothing left for me
Here I am, there's nothing left for you
There's nothing left for me
I will never be what you want to see now
I will never be what you want to see now
I never wanted you to go
But I'd be the last to let you know
Walk it off now
You can tell them all how I finally let you down
Stand around here in this small town
And tell me how it feels, tell me how it feels
Well it's your hometown
I think I've outgrown
I wanna travel the world but I, I just can't do it alone
So I'm just waiting on fate to come.
Wrap around me
Think about all the foreign places we could be
I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside till you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Just think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
Riding on waves, walking on sand
Digging in caves to find the treasures of the land
And if we find gold
Well, we'll just throw it away
We can write stories 'bout the journeys that we made
(We could be big in Japan)
I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside till you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Just think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
Waiting on a brand new day
They said they'll keep me here
But I couldn't do another year
I said I'll see you soon
Because I whistle to a different tune
Think of all the places we could be
Think of all the people we could meet
I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside till you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
The winter wind
Is blowing so strong
My hands have got
No gloves
Wish to my sole
That I could have
The boy I'm dreaming of
Don't you remember me, babe
I remember you quite well
Caused me to leave
All of New York town
With a high sheriff on my tail
A high sheriff on my tail, boys,
High sheriff on my trail.
All because I've fallen for
A curly headed dark-eyed boy
Who's gonna stroke
Your coal black hair
And your sandy colored skin
Who's gonna walk you side by side
And tell you everything is all right
Who's gonna look
You straight in the eye
And hold your bad luck hand
Who's gonna walk you
Who's gonna talk to you
And who's gonna be your woman
The winter wind
Is blowing so strong
My hands have got
No gloves
Don't you remember me, babe
I remember you quite well
Love the coal
Love the way you're waiting
I love your kind patience
Dust and water, water and dust
Water and dust
Did you think I'd leave you here
Forever?
Dust and water, water and dust
Water and dust
How long can dust wait?
Ask the moon
But ask him soon
Ask him soon
Dust and water, water and dust
Water and dust
Dust and water, water and dust
There's no end to the love you can give 
When you change your point of view to underfoot very good 
You may be flat but you're breathing 
And there's no doubt he's at home in his room 
Probably watching porn of you from the fall 
It's last call and you're the last one leaving 
And you thought you could change the world 
By opening your legs 
Well it isn't very hard 
Try kicking them instead 
And you thought you could change his mind 
By changing your perfume to the kind his mother wore 
Oh God Delilah why? 
I never met a more impossible girl 
In this same bar where you slammed down your hand 
And said "Amanda, I'm in love", no you're not 
You're just a sucker for the ones who use you 
And it doesn't matter what I say or do 
The stupid bastard's gonna have his way with you 
You're an unrescuable schizo 
Or else you're on the rag 
If you take him back 
I'm gonna lose my nerve 
I never met a more impossible girl 
At four o'clock he got off and you called up 
"I'm down at Denny's on route one 
And you won't guess what he's done" 
Is that a fact Delilah? 
Larry tap let you in through the back 
And use his credit card again 
For a quick hand of gin 
You are impossible, Delilah, the princess of denial 
And after seven years in advertising you are none the wiser 
You're an unrescuable schizo 
Or else you're on the rag 
'Cause if you take him back 
I'm gonna lose my nerve 
He's gonna beat you like a pillow 
You schizos never learn 
And if you take him home 
You'll get what you deserve
I never met a more impossible girl
So don't cry Delilah 
You're still alive Delilah 
You need a ride Delilah 
Let's see how fast this thing can go 
Let's see how fast this thing can go 
Let's see how fast this thing can go
Think I'm goin' home
I think I'm gettin' lost for a while
Tired of getting stoned
And thinkin' 'bout you in the night
So I'll file away all my dreams
Though I still believe in everything
I wished your love away
I wished your love away
Honestly over you
Honestly over you
One lie short of true
Honestly over you
Lookin' for some hope
Polished off the whiskey tonight
You turned a man to stone
For lookin' at you straight in the eyes
So I'll drive away with all my things
Though I've a faint belief in everything
I wished your love away
I wished your love away
Honestly over you
Honestly over you
And I'll tell the world
Honestly over you
I wished your love away...
What's that you're saying there? oh well,
Rain rushing, window pane, oh well,
Not sure what space I'm in, oh well,
But I'm safe inside me here, oh well,
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well.
What's that you're saying there? oh well,
Rain rushing, window pane, oh well,
Not sure what space I'm in, oh well,
But I'm safe inside me here, oh well,
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well.
Lying here, lie, lie, lie, lie,
Lying here, lie,
Lying here, lie, lie, lie,
Lying here, lie,
Lying here, lie, lie, lie,
Lying here, lie,
Lying here, lie, lie, lie,
Lying here, lie.
Looking out the door
I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight, you're on my mind so
You never know
Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight?
Child, you know how much I need it.
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run
Sometimes a man gets carried away,
When he feels like he should be having his fun
Much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really,
He has no one...
So I'll wait for you... And I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return?
Oh, will I ever learn?
Oh, Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late.
Lonely is the room the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns for a sleep
That won't ever come
It's never over,
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over,
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her...
It's never over,
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter...
It's never over,
She's a tear that hangs inside my soul forever...
But maybe I'm just too young to keep good love
From going wrong
Oh... lover you should've come over...
Yes, and I feel too young to hold on
I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind
To see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
Oh, love, well I'll wait for you
Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late.
I hopelessly, helplessly, wonder why,
Everything had changed, around me, mhmm
I'd tell it to your face, but you lost your face along the way,
Can I say it on the phone, if I thought you were alone,
Why do things have to change?
And you don't need my pictures on your wall,
You say you need no one,
And you don't need my secret midnight call,
I guess you need no one,
Is anybody waiting at home for you,
'Cause it's time that we'll tell if it's heaven if it's hell or if it's,
Anybody waiting at home for you,
'Cause it's time that we'll tell this tale,
You're in and out, up and down,
Wonder if you're lost or found,
But I got my hands on you,
Are you strong enough to tow the line,
Are you gonna make me yours,
Or do I make you mine,
I'm in and out I'm up and down,
Wonder if I'm lost or found,
But I need your hands on me now,
But you don't need my pictures on your wall,
You say you need no one,
And you don't need my secret midnight call,
I guess you need no one,
Is anybody waiting at home for you,
'Cause it's time that will tell if it's heaven if it's hell or if it's,
Anybody waiting at home for you,
'Cause it's time that will tell this tale,
I hopelessly,
(Is anybody waiting at home,)
Helplessly,
'Cause it's time that will tell if it's heaven, if its hell)
Wonder why,
Is anybody waiting at home)
Everything's gotta change...
I can feel her breath as she's sleeping next to me
Sharing pillows and cold feet
She can feel my heart, fell asleep to its beat
Under blankets and warm sheets
If only I could be in that bed again
If only it were me instead of him
Does he watch your favorite movies?
Does he hold you when you cry?
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts?
When you've seen it a million times
Does he sing to all your music
While you dance to "Purple Rain"?
Does he do all these things
Like I used to?
14 months and 7 days ago
Oh, I know you know how we felt about that night
Just your skin against the window
But we took it slow and we both know
It shoulda been me inside that car
It should have been me instead of him in the dark
Does he watch your favorite movies?
Does he hold you when you cry?
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts
When you've seen it a million times?
Does he sing to all your music
While you dance to 'Purple Rain'?
Does he do all these things
Like I used to?
I know, love
(Well, I'm a sucker for that feeling)
Happens all the time, love
(I always end up feeling cheated)
You're on my mind, love
(Oh sorta let her when I need it)
That happens all the time, love, yeah
Will he love you like I loved you?
Will he tell you everyday?
Will he make you feel like you're invincible
With every word he'll say?
Can you promise me if this was right?
Don't throw it all away
Can you do all these things?
Will you do all these things
Like we used to?
Oh, like we used to
Here I'm standing on the seashore
She is gone, now she's gone
All the angels praying for me
As I fall, as I fall
While I'm melting in the rain
Deep in pain, she is so far
Will we ever meet again
As friends, after so long?
To my nightmare with the devil
I'll go strong, I'll go strong
All my friends now try to save me
What a joke, what a joke
While I'm melting in the rain
Deep in pain, she is so far
Will we ever meet again
As friends, after so long?
While I'm melting in the rain
Deep in pain, she is so far
Will we ever meet again
As friends, after so long?
While I'm melting in the rain
Deep in pain, she is so far
Will we ever meet again
As friends, after so long?
Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no
You were my lesson, I had to learn
I was your fortress, you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Do you wanna go higher
There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
You were my lesson, I had to learn
I was your fortress
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
Learn... to... say... good... bye
I yearn... to... say... good... bye
There's nothing left to try
There's no more places to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
I read the signs, I got all my stars aligned
My amulets, my charms, I set all my false alarms
So I'll be someone who won't be forgotten
I've got a question and you've got the answer
I'll do a dance to make the rain come
Smile to keep the sky from falling down, down, down, down
Collect the love that I've been given
Build a nest for us to sleep in here, you know it's real
I check my palms, the cracks in the sidewalk
My visions and my dreams, I cross all my fingers
That you'll be someone, who won't be forgotten
What was your question? I've got the answer
I'll do a dance to make the rain come
Smile to keep the sky from falling down, down, down, down
Collect the love that I've been given
Build a nest for us to sleep in here, you know it's real
There are no signs and there are no stars aligned
No amulets, not a charm to bring you back to my arms
There's just this human heart that's built with this human flaw
What was your question? Love is the answer
I'll do a dance to make the rain come
Smile to keep the sky from falling down, down, down, down
Collect the love that I've been given
Build a nest for us to sleep in here, you know it's real
We can never go home
We no longer have one
I'll help you carry the load
I'll carry you in my arms
The kiss of the snow
The crescent moon above us
Our blood is cold
And we're alone
But I'm alone with you
Help me to carry the fire
We will keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
It will light our way forever
If I say shut your eyes
If I say look away
Bury your face in my shoulder
Think of a birthday
The things you put in your head
They will stay here forever
Our blood is cold
And we're alone, love
But I'm alone with you
Help me to carry the fire
We will keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
It will light our way forever
Help me to carry the fire
We will keep it alight together
Now help me to carry the fire
It will light up our way forever
If I say shut your eyes
If I say shut your eyes
Bury me in surprise
Where I say shut your eyes
Help me to carry the fire
We will keep it alight together
Help me carry the fire
It will light our way forever
Live version
We can never go home, son
We no longer have one
I'll help you carry the load
I'll carry you in my arms
We walk through the ash
And the charred remains of our country
Keep an eye on my back
I'll keep an eye on the road
Help me carry the fire
To keep it light together
Help me carry the fire
This road won't go on forever
If I say shut your eyes
If I say look away
Bury your face in my shoulder
Think of a birthday
The things you put in your head
They will stay there forever
I'm trying hard to hide your soul, son
From things it's not meant to see
Help me carry the fire
To keep it light together
Help me carry the fire
This road won't go on forever
If I say shut your eyes
If I say shut your eyes
Bury me in surprise
When I say shut your eyes, eyes
Help me carry the fire
To keep it light together
Help me carry the fire
This road won't go on forever
Tie me up with sheets, and hang me from your tree
I'll stay our here all night, it doesn't even matter
As long as I can see, into your room and feel
Like I'm inside your life, I'll follow you forever
Don't cut me down just yet, I'll make things right again
Don't close your blinds on me, on me...
I will never recover from this
I will never believe in this again
And I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started
The snow won't go away, My nose runs down my face
No one sees me here, It doesn't even matter
And every step I take, I stay in the same place
I can't begin to start again why can't I just be perfect?
I will never recover from this
I will never believe in this again
I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started
I will never recover from this
I will never believe in this again
I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started
You see my ghost and you'll never forget it
My face is as white as the snow that haunts me
Your windows my door and nothing can stop me
Sometimes betrayal can make you happy
Don't cut me down just yet, I'll make things right again
Don't close your blinds on me, on me...
I will never recover from this
I will never believe in this again
I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started
I will never recover from this
I will never believe in this again
I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move
And settle, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (brave)
I'm not brave
I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Been living in an idea
An idea from an another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views
Maybe I should move
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell
(It's a loop)
What would you recommend I do?
(And the other side of a loop is a loop)
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (brave)
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companions sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming a dream in a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think about dreaming a dream
Where I can not, where I can not
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second
A moment one solar flare would consume, so I nod
Spin this flammable paper on the film's that my life
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry, about you
See some colors, light hangglide off the moon
(In the dark, in the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for...
I still love you
I still want you
I still need you
Afterall
For better or worse
Sickness and health
Till death do us part
Afterall
Please don't keep me
(Please don't leave me)
Please don't keep me
(Please don't leave me)
Please don't keep me
(Please don't leave me)
Afterall
(Please don't)
Afterall
(Afterall)
Afterall
(Afterall)
Afterall
(Afterall)
Afterall
Afterall
I should have seen it coming, I should have fucking known
How could I let you play me, I don't even know
I should have seen it coming, I should have fucking known
How could I let you play me, I don't even know
I'm such a fool I can't believe I let you in my life
You broke the rules but I should have known you do it all the time
Though we were cool but then again who am I kidding
It's every players favourite crime, to make you feel
Like it's all real, when it's a lie
And I should have known
I should have known, my family they never did pretend
My mama felt, she never liked you neither did my friends
And when you blamed it all on me I should have known
That's what liers always try to do, it wasn't me, 
It was you, you're the fool
And I should have known
If your heart was simple just like mine is, then you would know just how it feels
When someone takes advantage of your kindness, you think you're never gonna heal
If your soul was deep just like mine is, then you would known not to give up
Keep my faith even through the darkness, yeah I still believe in love.
I still believe...
Loaded forecast on you
The pants are tight
You are ready to use
Searching for some trouble
Who's gonna be the one
And try to feed your hunger
Empty eyes
Leading your own sorrow
No one to get on
No one to roll over this night honey
The lavatory is open
As you blocked his head away
Twenty-one is such a good number
Conversation lost its weight anyway
We are walking on a thin line
No you better stay away from this
And shut your mouth
And read my lips
We are just kids
Do you talk to me
Pull the string
So I can be a doll
You won't cover me up
'Cause I'm the girl who kisses the dawn
Kiss the dawn
Kiss the dawn
Rebel mad and broken
Why do you throw your days away
Twenty-one was not a good number
Conversation lost its hate anyway
You are walking on a thin line
And you better avoid the risk
So shut your mouth
And read my lips
We are just kids
Do you talk to me
Pull the string
So I can be your doll
You won't cover me up
'Cause I'm the girl who kisses the dawn
Don't you talk to me
Pull the string
Don't want to be your doll
You can't cover me up
Because I'm the girl who eats the scrub
It's to reveal that fucked up cop
Amped up on prescription pills
That brought my heart to a stop
And I want to tell you there's a riot coming
Like a drug in the water
A punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters
I met a girl on the square
Who showed me how to kill my cares
But once that's done, man, there's nothing to do
Time's running backwards from me and you
There's a riot coming
Like a drug in the water
A punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters
My body's running but I don't see why it bothers
Sat down in jail with this friend of mine
Who'd never close both his eyes
But one was shut all the time
To cover the thing he was scared of
While he watched with the other
There was a riot coming
Like a drug in the water
A punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters
There's a riot coming
There's a riot coming
There's a riot coming
He takes your hand
I die a little
I watch your eyes
And I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that?
When you walk by
I try to say it
But then I freeze
And never do it
My tongue gets tied
The words gets trapped
I hear the beat of my heart getting louder
Whenever I'm near you
But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish, that was me
He looks at you
The way that I would
Does all the things
I know that I could
If only time could just turn back
'Cause I got three little words
That I've always been dying to tell you
But, I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish, that was me
With my hands on your waist
While we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me
That you'll call later on
'Cause you wanna say good night
'Cause, I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish
Oh, how I wish
Oh, how I wish
That was me, me, me
Oh, how I wish, that was me
I never should of waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you till the final goodbye
Hold, draw me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside the world wages its rewards, I'll rest in peace as long as you know
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you till the final goodbye
Promise you our love will carry on
Until you turn eternal, we belong
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you till the final goodbye
Passing slowly though a vector
Damp with fog the bog that grows the former business sector
With my laugh, my lone companion.
Only I can save the lives that blink within this canyon
Whoa
We're passing slow, passing slow. Slow, Slow
Drink the colors of the night time
If you were wrong then I was right and this will be the right time
I'll display my disaffection (you grind me up, yeah, you spit me out)
Out across the city
Loud and proud in your direction
Whoa
We're passing slow, we're passing slow. Slow, Slow.
Whoa
We're passing slow, we're passing slow. Slow, Slow.
But when I get to your apartment I climb the rail outside the building
A band of them were in your apartment
They tied you up unwound, unwilling
I watch them cut, watch them touch, watch them do what they came to do
And in I come to lick it up
Clean up what is left of you
Ha ha ha show me what you got
I'll remember it
And Dublin in a rainstorm
And sitting in the long grass in summer
Keepin' warm
I'll remember it
Every restless night
We were so young then
We thought that everything
We could possibly do was right
Then we moved
Stolen from our very eyes
And I wondered where you went to
Tell me when did the light die
You will rise
You'll return
The phoenix from the flame
You will learn
You will rise
You'll return
Being what you are
There is no other Troy
For you to burn
And I never meant to hurt you
I swear I didn't mean
Those things I said
I never meant to do that to you
Next time I'll keep my hands to myself instead
Oh, does she love you
What do you want to do?
Does she need you like I do?
Do you love her?
Is she good for you?
Does she hold you like I do?
Do you want me?
Should I leave?
I know you're always telling me
That you love me
Just sometimes I wonder
If I should believe
Oh, I love you
God, I love you
I'd kill a dragon for you
I'll die
But I will rise
And I will return
The Phoenix from the flame
I have learned
I will rise
And you'll see me return
Being what I am
There is no other Troy
For me to burn
And you should've left the light on
You should've left the light on
Then I wouldn't have tried
And you'd never have known
And I wouldn't have pulled you tighter
No I wouldn't have pulled you close
I wouldn't have screamed
No I can't let you go
If the door wasn't closed
No I wouldn't have pulled you to me
No I wouldn't have kissed your face
You wouldn't have begged me to hold you
If we hadn't been there in the first place
Ah but I know you wanted me to be there oh oh
Every look that you threw told me so
But you should've left the light on
You should've left the light on
And the flames burned away
But you're still spitting fire
Make no difference what you say
You're still a liar
You're still a liar
You're still a lawyer
(Yes it's really LAWYER, according to the official books!)
Once my life was plain and clear
I recall
Once my ignorance was bliss
Nightfall came
Like a serpent's kiss
To my troubled mind
Why, oh why my God
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me cross the river wide
Binding promises were made
On my soul
Grand illusions lead astray
Ice cold winds swept my heart away
Bring me back to you
Why, oh why my God
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me cross the river wide
(Helena)
I remember a song
Like in a dream
Where September was long
And winter unreal
Why, oh why my God above
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me cross the river wide
Telling your son a joke 
He doesn't think is funny 
"We'll catch him unawares but 
What if he doesn't wear underwear." 
Lighting it up 
You were so cool 
Her school colors 
Black and light black 
Giving it up 
She has started 
Your life's colors 
Black and light black 
Getting your hair from under your bed 
Breaking your fingers 
Getting killed by a car 
Before you can make him pay
Smoke is rising from the houses
People burying their dead
I asked somebody what the time is
But time doesn't matter to them yet
People talking without speaking
Trying to take what they can get
I ask you if you remember
Prospekt, how could I forget
Drums
Here it comes
Don't you wish that life could be as simple
As fish swimming round in a barrel when you've got the gun?
Oh, when I run
Here it comes
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get the other kind of control
But I wasn't one
But here I lie
On my own in a separate sky
And here I lie
On my own in a separate sky
I don't wanna die
On my own here tonight
But here I lie
On my own in a separate sky
Call Louise Louisa do
I assess myself through you
Call Louise Louisa do
I had such a night
Come true
Overhead
Morning skies all for you
What a day I have had
What a day I have had
Now it's over, isn't it?
What a day I have had
What a day I have had
Now it's over, isn't it?
There goes Louisa
There goes Louisa
Dig out yourself from rubble
Removing all your skin
And don't ever think of trouble
The darkness that has been
Don't patronize me sorrow
I don't mean to
I'm in a car
I don't know where we are headed for
Stay with me
Don't want to be alone
Smile down on us, sun
Show your rays when things come undone
All animals lead us to light
When we can't see
Stars, Saturn and moon
Glow for those who cannot get through
Rain fall and voice sound
For those of whom still are not found
Gentle moon
Find us soon
Gentle moon
Find us soon
Black sky and black sea
Lighten up when we can't breathe
All dreams escape fire
Over worlds, fly but won't tire
Slow down on us, wind
Hold us still when everything spins
All secrets and lies
Let them out
Dreams escape fire
They won't tire
Dreams escape fire
They won't tire
Gentle moon
Find us soon
Gentle moon
Find us soon
All calendars pass
Days die off and hope cannot last
But if love is like stone
Yours was mine through to my bones
Oh, but how can we give
Back to those with whom we can't live?
When will the flame break
And spare the good people it takes?
Souls escape fire
They rise higher
Souls escape fire
They rise higher
Gentle moon
Find us soon
Gentle moon
Find us soon
You made me smile with my heart
You made me beg for admission cards
You will never stay
In my home on my way
Forlorn from today
We have nothing more to share
Only air, that old breath
All I pare off to a road
As my goad into my grave
One sear scratch is lying in the door
Falling on the floor
All fleet snatch is laying waste my gore
It will drop down on the floor
You will never stay in my home, on my way
Forlorn from today
We'll never find us again
Lady, all the troubles are my fright, I disgust you.
Feel the power. you cut the truth into you.
Why? did you think I did not on this rely?
I could kiss you, with lines of escape in my mouth.
Please let me bring back these gifts of mine to the woman.
Stars shined on my back as I slept and knew you.
You didn't leave it all.
You made an even call.
My belly released the stars and tears between the scars.
Ooh.
Below this we'll end here until the end of time
Beyond the moment that ends our bondage
I am your failed husband contender,
I'm your loan shark of bliss.
This dream you've ridden on turns your world to explosions
I need to be alone to heal this bleeding stone.
Now, smell the rain of london, it still insists
That we beg for our purity
As if we are pure in the reign of our contentment
As if I can think of this no more.
Hey Lucy, I remember your name...
I left a dozen roses on your grave today;
I'm in the grass on my knees, wipe the leaves away;
I just came to talk for a while,
I got some things, I need to say...
Now that it's over,
I just wanna hold her,
I'd give up all the world to see,
That little piece of heaven looking back at me;
Now that it's over,
I just wanna hold her;
I've gotta live with the choices I made,
And I can't live with myself today...
Hey Lucy, I remembered your birthday...
They said it'd bring some closure to say your name;
I know I'd do it all different if I had the chance,
But all I got are these roses to give,
And they can't help me make amends...
Now that it's over,
I just wanna hold her,
I'd give up all the world to see,
That little piece of heaven looking back at me;
Now that it's over,
I just wanna hold her;
I've gotta live with the choices I made,
And I can't live with myself today...
Here we are,
Now you're in my arms;
I never wanted anything so bad...
Here we are,
For a brand new start;
Living the life that we could've had...
Me and Lucy walking hand in hand,
Me and Lucy never wanna end!
Just another moment in your eyes,
I'll see you in another life,
In heaven, where we never say goodbye!
Now that it's over,
I just wanna hold her,
I'd give up all the world to see,
That little piece of heaven looking back at me;
Now that it's over,
I just wanna hold her;
I've gotta live with the choices I made,
And I can't live with myself today!
Here we are,
Now you're in my arms;
Here we are,
For a brand new start;
Got to live with the choices I've made,
And I can't live with myself today!
Me and Lucy walking hand in hand,
Me and Lucy never wanna end!
I got to live with the choices I've made,
And I can't live with myself...
Today...
Hey Lucy, I remember your name...
Whenever paul thinks of rain,
Swallows fall in a wave and tap on his window with their beaks
Whenever paul thinks of snow,
Soft winds blow round his head and his phone rings just once
Late at night-like a bird calling out,
"Wake up, paul. don't be scared.
Don't believe you're all alone."
"Wake up, paul," whisper clouds rolling by and the seeds
Falling softly from the branches of the trees.
It's probably what's best for you, I only want the best for you
And if I'm not the best then you're stuck
I tried to server ties and I, ended up with wounds to bind
Like you're pouring salt in my cuts
I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart
Even though I know what's wrong, how could I be so sure
If you never say what you feel, feel
I must have held your hand so tight, you didn't have the will to fight
I guess you needed more time to heal
Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart
Ooh, Ooh, oh, whoa, oh, oh yeah
Ooh, Ooh, oh, whoa, oh, oh yeah
You must be a miracle worker
Swearin' up and down you can fix what's been broken yeah
Please don't give my hopes up, no, no
Baby tell me how could you be so cruel
It's like you're pouring salt on my cuts
Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart
Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart
Oh no, no, no
You never really can fix a heart
Oh no, no, no
You never really can fix heart
You never really can fix my heart
How could you 
You are the river 
Pour out of this life 
How could you 
You are the morning bird 
Who sang me into life every day 
Fly away 
You are the blood of me 
The harvest of my dreams 
There's nowhere I can find peace 
And the silence won't cease 
Nothing's quite how it seems 
The ghost of my joy 
Won't let me be 
If you set me free I will not run 
I will not run 
I will not run
I still smell you, distance aside
Still smell the rain, distance aside
Oh water that had kept me alive
I will miss you, distance aside
It's funny I know
But I'm disappointed in you
I thought you could read my mind
But I came home early
And saw that a drawer'd been opened
Looks like you've been reading my diary instead
How does it feel to realize
You're all alone behind your eyes?
It seems to me if you can't trust
You can't be trusted
Caught in a dream
Picking up astral signals
Some of them psychic, you better watch what you think
Happens to be that
Everybody else's dreams are Freudian clues
You better watch what you dream
You wanna see the other side
What's going on behind the eyes
Still it seems if you can't trust
You can't be trusted
Didn't you know we're as close as we can be?
The sun's coming up
She's pulled all the blankets over
Curled in a ball
Like she's hiding from me and
That's when I know
She's gonna be pissed when she wakes up
For terrible things I did to her in her dreams
You wanna see the other side
What's going on behind the eyes
Still it seems if you can't trust
You can't be trusted
Didn't you know we're as close as we can be?
Hello.
I don't ever ask you where you've been,
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with...
I can't even think straight, but I can tell
That you were just with her, and I'll still be your fool...
I'm a fool for you...
Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart,
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want...
Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart,
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for...
I don't ever tell you how I really feel,
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean...
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say;
I know I'm not your only, but I'll still be your fool,
'Cause I'm a fool for you...
Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart,
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want...
Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart,
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for...
Just a little bit...
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
I know I'm not your only, but at least I'm one;
I heard a little love is better than none...
Oh, babe...
Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart,
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want...
Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart,
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for...
Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart, (Just a little bit, baby, baby,)
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want... (Is all I want...)
Just a little bit of your heart (just a little bit), just a little bit of your heart,
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for...
It's been in the past for awhile
I get a flash and I smile
Am I crazy?
Still miss you baby
It was real, It was right
But I burned to hot to survive
All that's left is
All these ashes
Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together?
I had to know why, I
Had to lose you
Now you'll just become
Like everything I'll never find, again
At the Bottom of the ocean
Dododo dodododo
Dododo dododo
Dododo dododo
In a dream you appear
For awhile you were here
So I keep sleeping
Just to keep you with me
I draw a map, connect the dots
With all the memories that I got
What I'm missing
I'll keep reliving
Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together?
I had to know why, I
Had to lose you
Now you'll just become
Like everything I'll never find, again
At the Bottom of the ocean
This is it
Let go
Breathe
You don't have to love me for me
Oh baby ever understand
Just know I love the time that we both had
And I don't ever wanna se you sad
Be happy
I don't wanna hold you
If you don't wanna tell me you love me babe
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for both of us to say
Be happy
Dododo dodododo
Be happy
Dododo dodododo
Be happy
We know full well there's just time
So is it wrong to toss this line?
If your heart was full of love
Could you give it up?
'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special
Don't give me up
Don't give...
Me up
How unfair, it's just our love
Found something real that's out of touch
But if you'd searched the whole wide world
Would you dare to let it go?
'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special
Don't give me up
Don't give...
Me up
'Cause what about, what about angels?
They will come, they will go, make us special
It's not about not about angels, angels
He drowns in his dreams
An exquisite extreme, I know
He's as damned as he seems
And more heaven than a heart could hold
If I tried to save him
My whole world could cave in
It just ain't right, it just ain't right
Oh and I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster
He's magic and myth
As strong as what I believe
A tragedy with
More damage than a soul should see
And do I try to change him
So hard not to blame him
Hold on tight, hold on tight
Oh 'cause I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster
I'm longing for love and the logical
But he's only happy, hysterical
I'm waiting for some kind of a miracle
Waiting so long
So long
He's soft to the touch
But frayed at the ends, he breaks
He's never enough
And still he's more than I can take
Oh 'cause I don't know
Don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster
He's beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
Oh oh... beautiful
Oh oh... beautiful disaster
Hey girl, open the walls, play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family
When you walk away is when we really play
You don't hear me when I say
"Mom, please wake up, dad's with a slut
And your son is smoking cannabis"
No one ever listens, this wallpaper glistens
Don't let them see what goes down in the kitchen
Places, places, get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
Hey girl, look at my mom, she's got it going on
Ha, you're blinded by her jewelry
When you turn your back, she pulls out a flask
And forgets his infidelity
Uh-oh, she's coming to the attic
Plastic, go back to being plastic
No one ever listens, this wallpaper glistens
One day they'll see what goes down in the kitchen
Places, places, get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
Hey girl
Hey girl, open your walls, play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family
Places, places, get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become? My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become? My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way
I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That is would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can spend the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother; I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago
'36 Hudson in the garage
All sorts of junk in the unattached spare room
Dishes in the kitchen sink
New straw for the old broom
Friends who don't have a clue
Well-meaning teachers
But down in your arms, in your arms
I am a wild creature
Floor two-foot high with newspapers
White carpet thick with pet hair
Half-eaten gallons of ice cream in the freezer
Fresh fuel for the sodium flares
I write down good reasons to freeze to death
In my spiral ring notebook
But in the long tresses of your hair
I am a babbling brook
There's always something in the way
There's always something getting through
But it's not me
It's You
It's You
Sometimes ignorance
Rings true
But hope is not in what I know
It's not in me
It's in You
It's in You
It's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know
And I find peace when I'm confused
And I find hope when I'm let down
Not in me, me,
In You
It's in You
I hope to lose myself for good
I hope to find it in the end
Not in me, me,
In You
In You
It's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know
In You
In You
It's in You
In You
There's always something in the way
There's always something getting through
But it's not me
It's You
It's You
It's You
It's You
It's You
(It's all I know)
It's You
It's You
(It's all I know)
It's You
It's You
(It's all I know)
It's You
It's You
(It's all I know)
It's You
So dear friends, your love is gone
Only tears to dwell upon
I dare not say as the wind must blow
So a love is lost, a love is won
Go to sleep and dream again
Soon your hopes will rise and then
From all this gloom life can start anew
And there'll be no crying soon
You left it, I sent it 
I want it back 
You left it, I sent it 
I want it back 
If I had you here, I'd clip your wings 
Snap you up and leave you sprawling on my pin 
This plan of mine is oh so very lame 
Can't you see the grass is greener where it rains 
You left, I died, 
I went and you cried 
You came, I think 
But I never really know 
I've served my time 
I've watched you climb 
The wrong incline 
But what do I know 
Accept it, Don't let it 
Turn the screw 
Accept it, And let it 
Scream back at you 
Now this applies both equally to you and I 
The only thing we share 
Is the same sky 
These empty metaphors 
They're all in vain 
Like can't you see the grass is greener where it rains 
In the garden Snake was a charmin' 
And Eve said let's give it a try 
Now lead us not into temptation 
But no matter how hard I try 
When in the garden and 
Snake is a charmin' 
And Eve says let's give it a try 
Eve is the apple of my eye 
And I lie behind you 
And a cradle you in the palm of me 
And I pat your hair down 
I think will we sink or swim? 
'Cause we could do either on a whim
How did we ever go this far?
You touch my hand and start the car
And for the first time in my life
I'm crying
Are we in space? do we belong?
Someplace where no one calls it wrong
And like the stars we burn away
The miles
I'm a star, you're a star
We were ordered to burn
Someone found and gave away
The addresses of our meetings
Eyes on the ceiling
No one will find us
Voices will slip
And ice will break
And no one has the key
The grave is the bed
It's time to turn off
They're onto us
Smile, untie
Cover the mirrors
You break and tell me
She's dead, she's dead
Close yourself off
Nothing will stand
My hand doesn't shake
My hand is okay
It is ready for vengeance
Easy as two times two
Get in the taxi, and suck it
Forgive you? Never
Don't you ever beg
Good, good
I've created my vengeance
All that's left is powder
Multiply by six
Don't call, don't call
I'm tired, I'm tired
I don't want you
You are me
How did we ever get this far?
It shouldn't have to be this hard
Now for the first time in my life
I'm flying
Are we in love? Do we deserve
To bear the shame of this whole world?
And like the night we camouflage
Denial
Never, nothing
Nothing to begin with
Never, no one
To die and to keep silent
Not to search for, not to love
Not to regret and not to sleep
Never, nowhere
Not to let anyone go
Not to gather, and to kill
The water will dream for them
Not yours, not mine
Wires, wires
Heroin. No pulse.
You'e not the only one to blame
(Your phone has been disconnected)
How did we ever go this far?
You touch my hand and start the car
And for the first time in my life
I'm crying 
Are we in love? Do we deserve
To bear the shame of this whole world?
And like the night we camouflage
Denial
'Member when we argued o'er the concept of regret
You were an expert even then but not me, not yet
Now all you gotta do's remind me that we met
And there, you got me, that's how you got me
You taught me to regret
'Member how I asked you why are you so mean
You didn't know how to react to being seen
I tried to be your friend, you made me shamed, so I'm getting even
And there, you got me, that's how you got me
You taught me to be mean
But I ran out of white doves' feathers
To soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth
Every time you address me
Oh, I ran out of of white doves' feathers
To soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth
Every time you address me
'Member when I was so sick and you didn't believe me
Then you got sick too and guess who took care of you
You hated that, didn't you, didn't you
Now, when you look at me, you're condemned to see
The monster your mother made you to be
And there, you got me, that's how you got free
You got rid of me
But I ran out of white doves' feathers
To soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth
Every time you address me
Oh, I ran out of of white doves' feathers
To soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth
Every time you address me
Alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Alone
Instrumental
There's a house on my block
That's abandoned and cold
Folks moved out of it a
Long time ago
And they took all their things
And they never came back
Looks like it's haunted
With the windows all cracked
And everyone call it
The house, the house where
Nobody lives
Once it held laughter
Once it held dreams
Did they throw it away
Did they know what it means
Did someone's heart break
Or did someone do somebody wrong?
Well the paint was all cracked
It was peeled off of the wood
Papers were stacked on the porch
Where I stood
And the weeds had grown up
Just as high as the door
There were birds in the chimney
And an old chest of drawers
Looks like no one will ever
Come back to the
House were nobody lives
Once it held laughter
Once it held dreams
Did they throw it away
Did they know what it means
Did someone's heart break
Or did someone do someone wrong?
So if you find someone
Someone to have, someone to hold
Don't trade it for silver
Don't trade it for gold
I have all of life's treasures
And they are fine and they are good
They remind me that houses
Are just made of wood
What makes a house grand
Ain't the roof or the doors
If there's love in a house
It's a palace for sure
Without love...
It ain't nothin' but a house
A house where nobody lives
Without love it ain't nothin'
But a house, a house where
Nobody lives.
So you just stepped out of the front of my house
And I'll never see you again
I closed my eyes for a second and when they opened
You weren't there
And the door shut shut, I was vacuum packed
Shrink-wrapped out of air
And the spine collapsed and the eyes rolled back
To stare at my starving brain
And fully clothed, I float away
(I'll float away)
Down the Forth, into the sea
I think I'll save suicide for another day
And I picture this corpse on the M8 hearse
And I half run away to sleep
On a rolled up coat against the window
With the strobe of the sun and the life I've led
Am I ready to leap? Is there peace beneath
The roar of the Forth road bridge?
On the Northern side is a Fife of mine
And a boat in the port for me
And fully clothed, I float away
(I'll float away)
Down the Forth, into the sea
I'll steer myself through choppy waves
(choppy waves)
These manic gulls scream it's okay
(It's okay)
Take your life, give it a shake
(Give it a shake)
Gather up all your loose change
I think I'll save suicide for another year
Should've kissed you there,
I should have held your face,
I should've watched those eyes,
Instead of run in place,
I should've called you out,
I should've said your name,
I should've turned around,
I should have looked again,
But oh, I'm staring at the mess I made,
I'm staring at the mess I made,
I'm staring at the mess I made,
As you turn,
You take your heart,
And walk away,
Should've held my ground,
I could've been redeemed,
For every second chance,
That changed its mind on me,
I should've spoken up,
I should have proudly claimed,
That oh, my heads to blame,
For all my heart's mistakes,
But oh, I'm staring at the mess I made,
I'm staring at the mess I made,
I'm staring at the mess I made,
As you turn,
You take your heart,
And walk away,
And it's you,
And it's you,
And it's you,
And its falling down,
As you walk away,
And its on me now,
As you go,
But oh, I'm staring at the mess I made,
I'm staring at the mess I made,
I'm staring at the mess I made,
As you turn,
You take your heart,
And walk away,
And its falling down,
As you walk away,
And its on me now,
As you go,
But oh, I'm staring at the mess I made,
I'm staring at the mess I made,
I'm staring at the mess I made,
As you turn,
You take your heart,
And walk away,
It goes like the clouds
It floats like the sky
I want to go someplace and find you there.
Don't go away
I need you to stay
I want to go someplace and find you there.
And, yes, you just run to him
And I'll be down on my knees begging you,
Begging you: Don't! I love you.
I saw through your lies
I saw through your disguise
I want to go someplace and find you there.
And, yes, you just run to him
And I'll be down on my knees begging you,
Begging you: Don't! I love you.
Don't go away,
I need you to stay.
I want to go someplace and find you there!
I want to go someplace and find you there.
Breeze still carries the sound 
Maybe I'll disappear 
Tracks will fade in the snow 
You won't find me here 
Ice is starting to form 
Ending what had begun 
I am locked in my head 
With what I've done 
I know you tried to rescue me
Didn't let anyone get in 
Left with a trace of all that was 
And all that could have been 
Please 
Take this 
And run far away 
Far away from me 
I am tainted 
The two of us 
Were never meant to be 
All these pieces 
And promises and left-behinds 
If only I could see 
In my nothing 
You meant everything 
Everything to me 
Time
Fading 
Everything 
And all that 
Could have been 
Could have been 
Please 
Take this 
And run far away 
Far as you can see 
I am tainted 
And happiness and peace of mind 
Were never meant for me 
All these pieces 
And promises and left-behinds 
If only I could see 
In my nothing 
You meant everything 
Everything to me
Meet me on the other side
Meet me on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
See you on the other side
Honey now if I'm honest
I still don't know what love is
Another mirage folds
Into the haze of time recalled
And now the floodgates cannot hold
All my sorrow, all my rage
A tear drop falls on every page
Meet me on the other side
Meet me on the other side
Maybe I oughta mention
Was never my intention
To harm you or your kin
Are you so scared to look within?
The ghosts are crawling on our skin
We may race and we may run
We'll not undo what has been done
Or change the moment when it's gone
Meet me on the other side
Meet me on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
I know it would be outrageous
To come on all courageous
And offer you my hand
To pull you up on to dry land
When all I got is sinking sand
That trick ain't worth the time it buys
I'm sick of hearing my own lies
And love's a raven when it flies
Meet me on the other side
Meet me on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
See you on the other side
Honey now if I'm honest
I still don't know what love is
a) EDEN EYE
(A loved one laid his head on her lap
Red roses fell to the floor
And the world, stood still)
My mouth was a crib and it was growing lies
I didn't know what love was on that day
My hearts a tiny blood clot
I picked at it, it never heals, it never goes away
I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die
I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
I would have told her then, she was the only thing
I could love, in this dying world
But the simple word "love" itself
Already died and went away
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die
I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
b) APPLE OF DISCORD
Her heart's a bloodstained egg
We didn't handle with care
It's broken and bleeding
And we could never repair
Her hearts a bloodstained egg
We didn't handle with care
It's broken and bleeding
And we can never repair
And we can never repair
Here her head, she lay
Until she'd rise and say:
"I'm starved of mirth
Let's go and trip a dwarf"
Oh, what to be done with her?
Oh, what to be done with her?
Oh...
Ice water for blood
With neither heart or spine
And then just
To pass time; let us go and rob the blind
What to be done with her?
I ask myself:
What to be said of her?
Oh...
But when she calls me, I do not walk, I run
Oh, when she calls, I do not walk, I run
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
I can love you desperately, though your love ain't guaranteed
Oh, I wish you knew the deal, gotta learn from far away
And I simply needed space, space for me to be
And I think you need it too
Though I know you call me selfish for assuming
I did this for you too, you still got me around your finger
Even though I'm far away
Please believe me when I say
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make, I only make for you
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise one day I'll come back for you
Oh, you say you hate me now, and you burn me with your words
Calling me a fool, saying that I've effed up everything
And you'll never forgive me, though I'm doing this for you
Baby, can't you see if there is such a thing
Of loving someone so much that you need
To give them time to let them breathe
But you don't understand, I wish you understood
Oh, I hope one day you do
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make, I only make for you
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise one day I'll come back for you
Believe in you, believe in me, we're meant to be together
I told you, weren't lyin', I know you aren't relying
And now I am supplying you the time and space
To let you grow into the person that I know, that I know you can be
And I can be one too
And I'll come back to you
And I am ready for you, baby, I am ready for you now
I'm not ready for you now, please don't hate me
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make, I only make for you
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise one day I'll come back for you
I promise one day I'll come back to you
I promise one day I'll come back to you
I promise baby, one day I'll come back to you
I promise baby, one day I'll come back to you
Reborn and shivering
Spat out on new terrain
Unsure, unconvincing
This faint and shaky hour
Day one, day one
Start over again
Step one, step one
I'm barely making sense
For now I'm faking it
Till I'm pseudo-making it
From scratch, begin again
But this time I as I and not as we
Gun-shy and quivering
Timid without a hand
Feign brave with steel intent
Little and hardly here
Day one, day one
Start over again
Step one, step one
With not much making sense
Just yet I'm faking it
Till I'm pseudo-making it
From scratch, begin again
But this time I as I and not as we
Eyes wet toward
Wide open frayed
If God's taking bets
I pray he wants to lose
Day one, day one
Start over again
Step one, step one
I'm barely making sense
Just yet I'm faking it
Till I'm pseudo making it
From scratch, begin again
But this time I as I and not as we
The TV's blaring, the radio is turned up loud
Maybe then I'll sleep well, maybe then I'll drown you out.
Don't want to think much I don' t want to reminisce
'Cause love songs and poems have all lead, they've all led me to this.
It's dangerous, to be sleepin' alone.
And it's way way way it's way to cold
To be at home.
I've locked up tightly I must say I've had my doubts
'Cause they will kick and they will scream but there's no way they're ever getting out.
They breathed fresh air once, a long time a long time ago.
And now stuck up inside my head, how they ever gonna grow?
It's dangerous, to be sleepin' alone.
And it's way way way it's way to cold
To be at home.
And I am what I am, yes I am what I am
It ain't that bad.
What I'm tryin' to say here is not worth, it's not worth your time
I'm just a lonely, a lonely love sick boy with my rhyme.
It's dangerous, to be sleepin' alone.
And it's way way way it's way to cold
To be at home.
And I am what I am, yes I am what I am
It ain't that bad.
And even the toughest white boy, yes even the baddest white boy
He still gets sad.
Just because I don't say anything doesn't mean I don't like you.
I open my mouth and I try and I try, but no words came out.
Without 40 oz. of social skills, I'm just an ass in the crack of humanity.
I'm just a huge manatee... a huge manatee.
And besides, you're probably holding hands with some skinny, pretty girl that likes to talk about bands,
And all I wanna do is ride bikes with you and stay up late and watch cartoons.
Duck Tales, shirt tails, Talespin, Sailor Moon, GI Joe, Robotech, Ron Jeremy, Schmoo.
I wanna watch cartoons with you -- Josie and the Pussycats and Scooby-Doo.
I want you to watch cartoons with me -- He-Man, Voltron and Hong Kong Phooey.
I tried to ask you to your face but no words came out.
I put on my hood and walked away -- that doesn't mean I don't like you.
And besides, you're probably holding hands with some skinny, pretty girl that likes to talk about bands,
And all I wanna do is ride bikes with you and stay up late and maybe spoon.
Just because I don't say anything doesn't mean I don't like you.
No... I opened my mouth and I tried and I tried.
And besides, you're probably holding hands with some skinny, pretty girl that likes to talk about bands,
And all I wanna do is ride bikes with you and stay up late and watch cartoons.
I'm just your average Thundercats ho.
Heaven can wait
And a band of angels wrapped up in my heart
Will take me through the lonely night
Through the cold of the day
And I know, I know
Heaven can wait
And all the gods come down here just to sing for me
And the melody's gonna make me fly
Without pain, without fear
Give me all of your dreams
And let me go alone on your way
Give me all of your prayers to sing
And I'll turn the night into the skylight of day
I got a taste of paradise
I'm never gonna let it slip away
I got a taste of paradise
It's all I really need to make me stay
Just like a child again
Heaven can wait
And all I've got is time until the end of time
Well, I won't look back, I won't look back
Let the altars shine
And I know that I've been released
But I don't know to where
And nobody's gonna tell me now
And I don't really care, no, no, no
I got a taste of paradise
It's all I really need to make me stay
I got a taste of paradise
If I had it any sooner you know
You know I never would have run away from my home
Heaven can wait
And all I've got is time until the end of time
Well, I won't look back, I won't look back
Let the altars shine
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Well, I won't look back, I won't look back
Let the altars shine
Let the altars shine
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
I know a man, he came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown
He said Dolores I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering 
I'm afraid that I will disappear
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
And I know a woman, became a wife
These are the very words she uses to describe her life
She said a good day ain't got no rain
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
And I know a father who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he'd done
He came a long way just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and headed home again
He's slip slidin'
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
And God only knows, God makes his plan
The information's unavailable to the mortal man
We're working our jobs, collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway
When in fact we're slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
Well, I listen to the weather
And he's changed his tone of voice
And he can see it on the radar
Only seven hours away
Well, there's gonna be a snowstorm
And the TV's goin' out
And they got nothin' else to think of
And they're letting me go home
Well, I'm lookin' at the snowflakes
And they all look the same
And the clouds are goin' by me
They're playin' some kind of game
Well you know there's a snowstorm
When the TV has gone out
And they got nothin' else to think of
And they're letting me go home
We are just a moment in time
A blink of an eye
A dream for the blind
Visions from a dying brain
I hope you don't understand
The open wound she hides
She just keeps it bundled up
And never lets it show
She can't take much more of this
But she can't let it go
And that's ok, she don't want the world
All the things she says
While he's just lying there
Without someone to hear her cry
She slips off into a dream
About a place to hide
And that's ok, she don't want the world
This love she feels
Everything she's ever known
Or ever thought was real
Seems like it's been thrown away
Now how's she gonna live
It's ok, she don't want the world
Those words he never spoke
Haunt her life, the memories
Of all the times before
She tried to show him love
While he would only ask for more
But it's ok, she don't want the world
Softly in her sleep
Pictures of the life she's longing
For slowly appear
She's seen them all before
But somehow never quite this clear
She just smiles, she don't want the world
This love she feels
Everything she's ever known
Or ever thought was real
Seems like it's been thrown away
Now how's she gonna live
It's ok, she don't want the world
A brand new morning shines
As she wakes up alone again
This time to face the day
She swears there's time to make it
As she simply walks away
And it's ok, she don't want the world
I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we
Left this haunted town
The spookiness of night surrounds us in trees
Us on bikes on fountains
Never been alone as such
Your foots on the clutch
Your hand's on my crutch
Slow down
And run in little circles till circles are
Black and on the ground.
And clever isn't where it's at
'Cause dumb is back
Heads are holes and clouds
And I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we got this flaunting down
A feather in a baseball cap
You dance all wack
Weakened knees call
And I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we rocked three daunting nouns
It's better not to holla back
'Cause life long cracks
Speak through these walls
If I give up on you I give up on me
If we fight what's true, will we ever be
Even God himself and the faith I knew
Shouldn't hold me back, shouldn't keep me from you
Tease me, by holding out your hand
Then leave me, or take me as I am
And live our lives, stigmatized
I can feel the blood rushing though my veins
When I hear your voice, driving me insane
Hour after hour day after day
Every lonely night that I sit and pray
Tease me, by holding out your hand
Then leave me, or take me as I am
And live our lives, stigmatized
We live our lives on different sides
But we keep together you and I
Just live our lives, stigmatized
We'll live our lives, We'll take the punches everyday
We'll live our lives I know we're gonna find our way
I believe in you
Even if no one understands
I believe in you, and I don't really give a damn
If we're stigmatized
We live our lives on different sides
But we keep together you and I
We live our lives on different sides
We gotta live our lives
Gotta live our lives
Were gonna live our lives
We're gonna live our lives, Gonna live our lives
Stigmatized
Well I'll write you a letter
To say my last goodbye
I just think it's time for me to go away
Cause the sun it seems to sink now
Like my love into her grave
This life is not yet over
But it doesn't need to be saved
Well the chambers of my heart
They echo all the same
I'm a solitary man
Who drives himself insane
Well we'll all come back
And we'll smile once again
I'll try and try, until I die, to make you understand
My love, I'll make you understand
I take a drive in my car
I take a drive in my car
I see the sun disappear
I see the sun disappear
Oh, little stranger, bring my baby back to me
Oh, little stranger, bring my baby back home
My leather glove grips the wheel
My leather glove grips the wheel
I see the sun disappear
I see the sun disappear
Oh, little stranger, bring my baby back to me
Oh, little stranger, bring my baby back home
I took a drive in my car
I saw the sun disappear
My leather glove gripped the wheel
I saw the sun disappear
Bring my baby back
Bring my baby back
Windows down and my hair in the breeze
Windows down and my hair in the breeze
I see the sun reappear
I see the sun reappear
Oh, little stranger, bring my baby back to me
Oh, little stranger, bring my baby back home
Bring my baby back home
It's just a simple line
I can still hear it all of the time
If I can just hold on tonight
I'll know that nothing
Nothing survives
Nothing survives
I think I'm turned around
I'm looking up not looking down
And when I'm standing still
Watching you run
Watching you fall, fall into me
Am I making something worthwhile out of this place?
Am I making something worthwhile out of this chase?
I am displaced, I am displaced
And she's my friend of all friends
She's still here when everyone's gone
She doesn't have to say a thing
We'll just keep laughing
All night long, all night long
Am I making something worthwhile out of this place?
Am I making something worthwhile out of this chase?
I am displaced, I am displaced
It's just a simple line
I can still hear it all of the time
If I can just hold on tonight
I know that no one
No one survives, no one survives
I don't worry anymore
Nothing like I did before
I don't worry
I just watch her rolling by
I don't worry anymore
'Cause it's all right, all right to see a ghost
And I wanna see 'em go down in the river where they go
And I wanna see 'em rolling, rolling by
And I wanna see 'em go
'Cause it's all right, all right to see a ghost
I'm gonna run to the river
Kiss my hand and wave
Gonna run to the river
Gonna throw a blue bouquet
'Cause they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss 'em so much
I will settle in and dream
Of the slow and funny scene
I will settle in and watch 'em rolling back
I will settle in and dream
'Cause it's all right, all right to see a ghost
And I wanna see 'em go down in the river where they go
And I wanna see 'em rolling, rolling back
I'm gonna run to the river
Kiss my hand and wave
Gonna run to the river
Gonna throw a blue bouquet
'Cause they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss them so much
I'm gonna run to the river
Kiss my hand and wave
Gonna run to the river
Gonna send 'em on their way
'Cause they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss them so much
Yeah, they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss 'em so much
Midnight late last week, my daughter's diary
Didn't know what it might be 'til it was open
I only read one page and then put it away
Talk about your big mistakes. Hey Shan, nice going
Photos show no tears in her eyes
All those pretty years gone by
I just cannot believe could do that to a child
A child
A child
Shannon just flew down. Four days back in town
She sleeps in, lies around, and then she goes out
And then one day she's gone. What should I have done?
Joe turns the TV on with all the lights out
Photos on the wall, she's my baby, she's my baby doll
Is she someone I don't know at all? Is she someone I betrayed?
It's a grey day in the fall
And the radio's singing down the hall
And I rise to turn it off 'cause all I'm seeing is her face, age eight
Eight
Your eyes are almost dead
Can't get out of bed
And you can't sleep
You're sitting down to dress
And you're a mess
You look in the mirror
You look in your eyes
Then you realize
Everybody goes
Leaving those
Who fall behind
Everybody goes
As far as they can
They don't just care
Your mother's dead
She said, "Don't be afraid."
Your mother's dead
You're on your own
She's in her bed
They stood on the stairs
Laughing at your errors
Everybody goes
Leaving those
Who fall behind
Everybody goes
As far as they can
They don't just care
You're a wasted face
You're a sad-eyed lie
You're a holocaust
I don't care to say what
I failed to recognize
Every single day from the poker to the prize
Running out of Springfield
I worked for the Capitol Air, in the bags
Found a woman there who said
She had a mind to make
Me a messenger man
If my father took his life
For the national plan, I don't care
I'm not about to stick my grave with an
Apron and a bucket of plans, never ever
I can take the pillow cases
Off the yellow pillows,
Make a property line from the bed
In the living room, the living room,
The morning papers made the most
Out of nothing at all
So we took the room
With a view of the runaway
I took off my clothes,
And she took it for a holiday
I was taken for all the things
That I never had before
Running out of Springfield
She left me with a note saying:
"Bobby, don't look back."
And if my wife took a bicycle ride
With a knife in her hand
I saw it coming
All the shad-flies run at once
With a trumpet or a train,
Oh I'm running from it
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
Give a minute, lady
I can explain the aftershave
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
Give a minute
Bobby got a shad fly
Caught in his hair
Do you remember
The things we used to say?
I feel so nervous 
When I think of yesterday
How could I let things
Get to me so bad?
How did I let things get to me?
Like dying in the sun
Like dying in the sun
Like dying in the sun
Like dying x2
Will you hold on to me
I am feeling frail
Will you hold on to me
We will never fail
I wanted to be so perfect you see
I wanted to be so perfect
I had it all, but I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around, feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone, ooh
Losing my mind from this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete, yeah
Lord, I'm needing you now, tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly, woah
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care, oh
You might say you don't miss me, you don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do inside
Oh, love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I, I was so blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
And I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there alone, oh oh
How can I forget your love?
How can I never see you again?
There is a time and place
For one more sweet embrace
And there's a time, ooh
When it all, ooh, went wrong
I guess you know by now
That we will meet again somehow
How, oh, oh
Oh baby, how can I begin again?
How can I try to love someone new?
Someone who isn't you?
How can our love be true
When I'm not, ooh
I'm not over you?
I guess you know by now
That we will meet again somehow
Time can come and take away the pain
But I just want my memories to remain
To hear your voice, to see your face
There's not one moment I'd erase
You are a guest here now
So baby, how can I forget your love?
How can I never see you again?
How can I ever know
Why some stay, others go
When I don't, ooh
I don't want you to go?
I guess I know by now
That we will meet again somehow
Time can come and wash away the pain
But I just want my mind to stay the same
To hear your voice, to see your face
There's not one moment I'd erase
You are a guest here now
So baby, how can I forget your love?
How can I never see you again?
What would it take
For things to be quiet
Quiet like the snow?
 
And I know, this isn't much
But I know, I could...
I could be better
I don't think I deserve it
Selflessness
Find your way into my heart
All stars could be brighter
All hearts could be warmer
What would it take
For things to be be quiet
Quiet like the snow?
Are we meant to be empty handed?
I know, I could...
I could be better!
I don't think I deserve it
Selflessness,
Find your way into my heart
All stars could be brighter
All hearts could be warmer
What would it take for things to be quiet? (Find your way into my heart)
What would it take for things to be quiet? (Find your way)
What would it take for things to be quiet?
Go, go, go, go now
Out of the nest, it's time
Go, go, go now
Circus girl without a safety net
Here, here now, don't cry
You raised your hand for the assignment
Tuck those ribbons under your helmet
Be a good soldier
First my left foot then my right behind the other
Pantyhose running in the cold
Mother, the car is here
Somebody leave the light on
Green limousine for the redhead
Dancing, dancing girl
And when I dance for him
Somebody leave the light on
Just in, just in case I like the dancing
I can remember where I come from
I walked into your dream
And now I've forgotten how to dream my own dream
You are the clever one aren't you
Brides in veils for you
We told you all of our secrets
All but one and don't you even try
The phone has been disconnected
Dripping with blood and with time and with your advice
Poison me against the moon
Mother, the car is here
Somebody leave the light on
Black chariot for the redhead
Dancing, dancing girl
He's going to change my name
Maybe you'll leave the light on
Just in, just in case I like the dancing
I can remember where I come from
I escape into
Your escape into
Our very favourite fearscape
It's across the sky
And across my heart
And I crossed my legs
Oh my god
First my left foot then my right behind the other
Breadcrumbs lost under the snow
Mother
Mother, the car is here, here
Maybe, maybe you'll leave the light on
For the, for the, for the dancing girl
He's going to change my name
Maybe you'll leave the light
Just in case I like the dancing
I can remember where I come, come from
Mother, mother, mother
I watch you grow away from me in photographs
And memories like spies
And salt betrays my eyes again
I started losing sleep and gaining weight
And wishing I was was ten again
So I could be your friend again
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up
I heard you found some pretty words to say
You found your little game to play
And there's no one allowed in
Then just when we believe we could be great
Reality it permeates
And conquers from within again
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time 
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up
We're OK I know we're OK
These days we go to waste like wine
That's turned to turpentine
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
I didn't mean to waste your time
So I'll fall back in line
But I'm warning you we're growing up
Does it hurt to hear me say
That I never really meant to stay
I left you right where I want you
Now there's nothin' left
And not a reason
There's nothin' left to believe in
When just one remains
I've sailed away
Such a foolish game
That we have been playin'
Now you got me right where you want me
I left you in the right
But you wouldn't let me take the fall
Now you've got me right where you want me
Now there's nothin' left
And that's the reason
There's not much left to believe in
If it's all just the same
I'll sail away
You pushed so hard
You have to know that
You might just get what you wanted
And when just one remains
I've sailed away
I found out on my own
Everything that I've been missin'
Now I've got you right where I want you
Now that we're apart
I see just who you are
You're always gonna be
The one to keep hatin'
Now I've got you right where I want you
Now there's nothin' left
And that's the reason
There's not much left to believe in
If it's all just the same
I'll sail away
You pushed so hard
You have to know that
You might just get what you wanted
And when just one remains
I've sailed away
I'm not one to hide my face behind the pain
It's not like me to beg you to stay
I'll just sail away
Now there's nothin' left
And that's the reason
There's not much left to believe in
If it's all the same
I'll sail away
You pushed so hard
You have to know that
You might just get what you wanted
And when just one remains
You know I've sailed away
And when just one remains
You know I've sailed away
Does it hurt to hear me say
That I never really meant to stay
A black sheep boy revolves
Over canyons and waterfalls
A black sheep boy dissolves
In syringe or in shower stall
Says
"There's plenty of time to make you mine tonight"
Says
"There's plenty of time to make you mine"
Says
"There's plenty of ways to know you're not dying
All right
Hell, there's plenty of light still left in your eyes
In your eyes"
A black sheep boy grows horns
Breathing smoke through his microphone
The airwaves stretch and they groan
Bleeding, birthing his black diapason
Says
"There's plenty of things to wear when you come to me
Every color of sleeve to be rolled
Millions of rolling eyes that still cling to me
Every language of king is concerned
So why did you bawl
From the spell of some old holy song
Some liar laughed as he composed
Some liar I loved to control"
A black sheep boy dissolves
In hot cream, in sweet moans
In each dead bed and empty home
In each seething bacterium
Killing softly and serial
He lifts his head, handsome, horned, magisterial
He's the smell of the moonlight wisteria
He's the thrill of the abecedarian
(See the muddy hoofprints where he carried you)
And there's plenty of ways to claim his crimes tonight
And there's plenty of things to do on his dime
And there's plenty of ways to wear his hide tonight
You've got yours, I've got mine
You've got yours, I've got mine
So why did you flee
Don't you know you can't leave his control
Only call all his wild works your own
So come back and we'll take them all on
So come back to your life on the lam
So come back to your old black sheep man
Says
"I'm waiting on hoof and on hand
I'm waiting, all hated and damned
I'm waiting, I snort and I stamp
I'm waiting, you know that I am
Calmly waiting to make you my lamb"
I will not take my love away
When praises cease and seasons change
While the whole world turns the other way
I will not take my love away
I will not leave you all alone
When striving leads you far from home
And there's no yield for what you've sown
I will not leave you all aone
I will give you what you need
In plenty or in poverty
Forever, always, look to me
And I will give you what you need
Teignmouth 
On the night train 
From the city to the south 
I saw spirits 
Crawl across the river mouth 
In skewed ascension 
With no destination 
Like this lone bachelor in me 
This constant yearning 
For great love and learning 
For the wind to carry me free 
So when the birds fly south 
I'll Reach up and hold their tails 
Pull up and out of here 
And bridle the autumn gales 
Down to the burning cliffs 
To the everlasting roll 
To marry the untold blisses 
And anchor this lost soul 
From my window 
I saw two birds lost at sea 
I caught our reflection 
In that silent tragedy 
But with hope prevailing 
I draw galleons sailing 
In full sail billowing free 
So when the birds fly south 
We'll reach up and hold their tails 
Pull up and out of here 
And bridle the autumn gales 
I give you my hand 
The fingers unfold 
To have and forever hold 
To marry the untold blisses 
And anchor this lost soul
mis dias sin ti son tan oscuros
tan largos tan grises
mis dias sin ti
mis dias sin ti son tan absurdos
tan agrios tan duros
mis dias sin ti
mis dias sin ti no tienen noches
si alguna aparece
es inutil dormir
mis dias sin ti son un derroche
las horas no tienen principio, ni fin
tan faltos del aire
tan llenos de nada
chatarra inservible
basura en el suelo
moscas en la casa
mis dias sin ti son como un cielo
sin lunas plateadas
ni rastros de sol
mis dias sin ti son solo un eco
que siempre repite
la misma cancion
tan faltos del aire
tan llenos de nada
chatarra inservible
basura en el suelo
moscas en la casa
pateando las piedras
aun sigo esperando que vuelvas conmigo
aun sigo buscando en las caras de ancianos
pedazos de niño
cazando motivos que me hagan creer
que aun me encuentro con vida
mordiendo mis uñas
ahogándome en llanto
extrañándote tanto
mis dias sin ti
mis dias sin ti
mis dias sin ti
como duelen los dias sin ti
sin ti............
sin ti............
Translation
my days without you are so dark, 
so long, so gray, 
my days without you are so absurd, 
so bitter, so tough, 
my days without you, 
my days without you don't have nights, 
if someone appears, 
it's useless to sleep, 
my days without you are an excess, 
the hours don't have a beginning, or end 
so short of air, 
so full of nothing, 
useless junk, 
trash on the floor, 
flies in the house 
my days without you are like a sky, 
without silvery moons, 
nor traces of the sun, 
my days without you are only an echo, 
that always repeats, 
the same song 
so short of air, 
so filled with nothing, 
useless junk, 
trash on the floor, 
flies in the house 
stumble on the rocks, 
still i keep waiting that you'll return to me, 
still i keep looking in the faces of the old people, 
bits of a child, 
hunting reasons that make me believe, 
that i'm still alive, 
biting my fingernails, 
drowing in my tears, 
missing you so much, 
my days without, 
oh how they hurt, my days without you
I'm feeling crossed, I take it inside
Burn up the pain, my thoughts are strange
Just like the things I used to know
Just like the tree that fell, I heard it
If art is still inside I feel it
I wanna' bleed, show the world all that I have inside
(I wanna' show you all the pain)
I wanna' scream, let the blood flow that keeps me alive
(I wanna' make you feel the same)
Take all these strings, they call my veins
Wrap them around, every fucking thing
Presence of people not for me
Well I must remain in tune forever
My love is music, I will marry melody
I wanna' bleed show the world all that I have inside
(I wanna' show you all the pain)
I wanna' scream let the blood flow that keeps me alive
(I wanna' make you feel the same)
I said
I wanna bleed
I wanna feel
(Show you all the pain)
I wanna scream
I wanna feel
(Make you feel the same)
Won't you let me take you for a ride
You can stop the world, try to change my mind
Won't you let me show you how it feels
You can stop the world, but you won't change me
I need music
I need music
I need music
To set me free
To let me bleed.
It's a dark road
And a dark way that leads to my house
And the word says
That you're never gonna find me there, oh no
I've got an open door
It didn't get there by itself
It didn't get there by itself...
There's a feelin'
But you're not feelin' it at all
There's a meaning
But you're not listening any more
I look at that open road
I'm gonna walk there by myself...
Uuh
And if you catch me I might try to run away
You know I can't be there too long
And if you let me I might try to make you stay
Seems you never realise a good thing till it's gone...
Oh ... uuh ... uh
Maybe I'm still searchin' but I don't know what it means
All the fires of destruction are still burnin' in my dreams
There's no water that can wash away this longin' to come clean...
Hey ... yeah ... yeah ...
Oh ... uh ... uh
I can't find the joy within in my soul
It's just sadness takin' hold
I wanna come in from the cold
And make myself renewed again
It takes strength to live this way
The same old madness everyday
I wanna kick these blues away
I wanna learn to live again
Hey ... hey ... hey
Hey ... hey ... hey
It's a dark road
And a dark way that leads to my house
And the word says
That you're never gonna find me there oh no
I've got an open door
It didn't get there by itself... ooh
It didn't get there by itself
Last night something pretty bad happened
We lost a friend (we lost a friend)
All shocked and broken (all shocked and broken)
Shut down, exploded (shut down, exploded)
Jeddy 3 is what we first called him
Then it was Jed (then it was Jed)
But Jed's systems dead (Jed's systems dead)
Therefore so's Jed (therefore so's Jed)
We assembled him in the kitchen
Made out of this and (made out of this and)
Made out of that and (made out of that and)
Whatever was at hand (whatever was at hand)
When we finished Jed we were so proud
We celebrated (we celebrated)
We congratulated (we congratulated)
At what we'd created (what we'd created)
Jed could run or walk, sing or talk and
Compile thoughts and (compile thoughts and)
Solve lots of problems (solve lots of problems)
We learned so much from him (learned so much from him)
A couple years went by something happened
We gave Jed less attention (gave less attention)
We had new inventions (had new inventions)
We left for a convention (left for a convention)
Jed had found our booze drink and drank every drop
He fizzled and popped (he fizzled and popped)
He rattled and knocked (he rattled and knocked)
And finally he just stopped (and finally he just stopped)
The seconds ran away
Minutes passed at speeds we can run at
As hours start to fade, deep into the night
I'm not in the mood for laughing
It's slipping away, there's nothing we can do
It's slipping away, there's no tomorrow without you
I wish these 24 hours would never end
Oh, in these 24 hours
Wish the clock had no hand
For 24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours
You're still mine
If this isn't real, just can't deal
In a way you could say, I was always a cynic
Hopeful for awhile
Lost in denial
I wish this could last
Forever
It's slipping away, there's nothing we can do
It's slipping away, there's no tomorrow without you
I wish these 24 hours would never end
Oh, in these 24 hours
Wish the clock had no hand
For 24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours
You're still mine
I won't settle on
I won't settle on (24 hours)
'Cause in 24 hours (x2)
You'll be gone (x3)
In 24 hours
24 hours
We still have time
24 hours
You're still mine
I wish these 24 hours would never end
Oh, in these 24 hours
Wish the clock had no hand
For 24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours
You're still mine
I could go back,
To every laugh,
But, I don't want to go there anymore
And I know all the steps, 
Up to your door
But, I don't wanna go there anymore
Talk to the wind
Talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why,
And let me know what you find
I'll leave my window open,
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain
I could stand up,
And sing you a song
But, I don't want to have to go that far
And I, I got you down
I know you by heart,
And you don't even know where I start
Talk to yourself
Talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here,
And don't wait for the sky to clear
I'll leave my window open,
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain
I've watched you so long,
Screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say
But, I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired tonight for all these games
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain
I could go back,
To every laugh,
But, I don't want to go there anymore
They slapped them on you
Where that bracelet used to be
You know the one I bought you in phoenix
Where they sell old jewellery
I was trying to make you angry
But I didn't feed you to the cops
When I threw that drink in that guy's face
It was just to piss you off
'Cause, honey, it's over
It's harder now that it's over
It's harder now that it's over
Now that the cuffs are off
And you're free
You're free with a history
I heard your wrists got bruised
Must've felt just like old times
I wish you would've grabbed the gun
And shot me 'cause I died
And I'm nothing now without you
Yeah, I'm less than nothing now
I'm the one between the bars
And lost forever now
'Cause it's over now
It's harder now that it's over
It's harder now that it's over
Now that the cuffs are off
And you're free
You're free with a history
Free with a history
You're free
Free with a history
I'm sorry
I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired.
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth
And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen
A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, "Pity please the ones who serve,
They only get what they deserve"
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly
Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen
To those of us who know the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me
We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say, come dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me
At seventeen
Instrumental
Seems like you never really knew me
Seems like you never understood me
Seems like you never really knew how to feel
But electricity it drew you near to me
What you needed was to be rid of me
There were times you really made me smile and
There were times you really made me cry and
There were times I never really knew how to feel
But electricity it drew you near to me
What you needed was to be rid of me
And the fear made you so unsure of me
What you needed was to be rid of me
But electricity it drew you near to me
What you needed was to be rid of me
And the fear made you so unsure of me
What you needed was to be rid of me
I still have a flame gun
For the cute, cute, cute ones
And I saw your hand
With a loose grip
On a tight ship
I still have a flame gun
For the cute ones
To burn out all your tricks
And I saw your hand
With a loose grip
On a very tight ship
And I know
In the cold light
There's a very big man
There's a very big man
Leading us into
Temptation
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
And he's related to you
He's related to you
He is waiting to meet you
He's related to you
He's related to you
He is dying to meet you
Backhand, role reversal
Where is someone?
Backhand, reversible roles
I know there's someone
I still have a flame gun
For the cute ones
To burn out all your tricks
And I saw your hand
With a loose grip
On such a tight ship
And I know in the cold light
There's a very big man
Leading us into
Temptation
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
And he's related to you
He's related to you
He is waiting to meet you
He's related to you
He's related to you
He is dying to meet you
He's related to you
He's related to you
He's related to you
He's nude as the news, nude as the news
Nude as the news, nude as the news
All over, all over, all over, all over, all over, all over, all over
You
Yes and no are just distinguished by
Distinction, so we choose the in-between.
Give up your books and put an end
To your worries. Enjoy Central Park in spring.
Our minds are empty, like we're too young
To know to smile.
We know to fear what others fear
Is nonsense, right?
The books suggest we set our hearts
On doing nothing,
And then nothing's left undone.
Everybody's busy waiting for the go-ahead,
But by then their heads are gone.
Our minds are empty, grave as well as
Strange. (Take this.)
We know to seek success is utter nonsense,
The best is to be blank.
{Here we are. Here we are.
We are antici-there it is. There it is.}
You're the feeling of hurting
More is what
I'm asking for
Little lies cross overboard
Wait for the crying
Love to aim at besides
Lever pulled
Go where you are little pond
Never be seen by your saw
We'll work it out
Now the feelings are right where you saw
Forever is right where we were
Never be clean
Lever pulled
Be where you are
She was lying on the floor and counting stretch marks
She hadn't been a virgin and he hadn't been a god
So she named the baby Elvis
To make up for the royalty he lacked, and
From then on it was turpentine and patches
From then on it was cold Campbell's from the can
And they were just two jerks playing with matches
'Cause that's all they knew how to play, hey
And it was raining cats and dogs outside of her window, and
She knew they were destined to become sacred roadkill on the way
And she was listening to the sound of heavens shaking
Thinking about poodles and puddles and mistakes
'Cause it's been turpentine and patches
It's been cold, cold Campbell's from the can
And they were just two jerks playing with matches
'Cause that's all they knew how to play, hey
Ah-da-da-da-da
Nuh-nuh-ah, nuh-ah
Oh, and they knew how to play
Mmm, hey
Elvis never could carry a tune
And she thought about this irony as she stared back at the moon
She was tracing her years with her fingers on her skin
Saying, "Well, why don't I begin again"
With turpentine and patches
With cold, cold Campbell's from the can
After all, I'm still a jerk playing with matches
It's just that he's not around to play along, yeah
I'm still an asshole playing with candles
Blowing out wishes, blowing out dreams
Just sitting here and trying to decipher
Wha, What's written in braille upon my skin
Haaa-ahhh-ahh-ha
Ah-da-da-da-da
Nuuh-aw
Aw
Awwww
Aww, this skin
Mmmm-mmm-mmmm-mmm-oooh-ooooh-ooh-ooh-oooh
Hooo, ohhhh
Hoh
She was lying on the floor and counting stretch
She was lying on the floor and counting stretch
She was lying on the floor
La-la-lying
La-la-la-la-laaa-la-la-la-la, la-lying, and
Counting stretch
Everything's cool, yeah
It's all gonna be okay, yeah
And I know,
Maybe I'll leave and
Laugh about it someday
But not today, no
'Cause I don't feel so good
I'm tangled up inside
My heart is on my sleeve
Tomorrow is a mystery to me
And it might be wonderful
It might be magical
It might be everything I've waited for,
A miracle
Oh, but even if I fall in love again
With someone else
It could never be the way I loved you
Letting you go is
Making me feel so cold, yeah
And I've been trying to make
Believe it doesn't hurt
But that makes it worse, yeah
See, I'm a wreck inside
My tongue is tied and my
Whole body feels so weak
The future may be all I really need
And it might be wonderful, yeah
It might be magical, uh oh
It might be everything I've waited for,
A miracle
Oh, but even if I fall in love again
With someone else
It could never be the way I loved you
Like a first love,
The one and only true love
Wasn't it written all over my face, yeah
I loved you like you loved me (oh)
Like something pure and holy
Like something that can never be replaced
And it was be wonderful,
It was magical,
It was everything I've waited for,
A miracle
And if I should ever fall in love again
With someone new
Oh, It could never be the way
No, It will never be the way
I loved you
I can tell, I can tell how much you hate this
And deep down inside, you know it's killing me
I can call, wish you well and try to change this
But nothing I can say will change anything
Where were my senses?
I left them all behind
Why did I turn away, away?
I wish I could save you
I wish I could say to you
I'm not going nowhere
I wish I could say to you
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
Didn't mean, didn't mean to leave you stranded
Went away 'cause I didn't wanna face the truth
Reaching out, reach for me, empty-handed
You don't know if I care, you tryin' to find the proof
There were times I'd wonder
Could I have eased your pain?
Why did I turn away, away?
I wish I could save you
I wish I could say to you
I'm not going nowhere
I wish I could say to you
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright (save you)
It's gonna be alright (I wish I could save you)
We can pretend nothing's changed
Pretend it's all the same
And there will be no pain tonight
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright (save you)
It's gonna be alright (I wish I could save you)
I'm not going nowhere
I wish I could say to you
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright (save you)
It's gonna be alright (I wish I could save you)
It's gonna be alright
If you don't mind, why don't you mind?
Where is your sense of indignation
You are too kind, much too kind
Where is the madness that you promised me?
Where is the dream for which I paid dearly?
When things go wrong I sing along
It is the nature of the business
But you're not here to make my sad songs more sincere
No one will ever love you honestly
No one will ever love you for your honesty
No one will ever love you honestly
No one will ever love you for your honesty
Wake up, wake up, little sparrow
Don't make your home out in the snow
Don't make your home out in the snow
Little bird, oh don't you know?
Your friends flew south many months ago
Your friends flew south many months ago
You're just a baby, you cannot fly
Your wings won't spread up against the sky
Your wings won't spread up against the sky
Wake up, wake up, little sparrow
Don't make your home out in the snow
Don't make your home out in the snow
Don't make your home out in the snow
I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.
How can you love me if you don't love yourself? I love you. (I love you.)
How can you love me if you don't love yourself? I love you. (I love you.)
How can you love me if you don't love yourself? I love you.
How can you love me if you don't love yourself? I love you.
How can I love you if I don't love myself? I love you.
We're not going anywhere. Sun is bright and standing still, it's alright.
We're not going anywhere. Sun is bright and standing still, it's alright.
We're not going anywhere. Sun is bright and standing still, it's alright.
We're not going anywhere.
We're not going anywhere. Sun is bright and standing still, it's alright.
We're not going anywhere. Anywhere
I love you.
How can you love me if you don't love yourself?
I love you, anyway. I love you. I love you, anyway. I love you.
Now I notice the streetlamp's hum 
The ghosts of graffiti they couldn't quite erase 
The blank-faced stares on the subway as the people go home 
The parks lay empty like my unmade bed 
The streets are silent like my lifeless telephone 
And this is where I live but I've never felt less at home
So I'm not unsympathetic
I see why you left
There's no one to know 
There's nothing to do 
The city's been dead 
Since you've been gone
Sometimes I stand on my roof at night 
And watch as something seems to happen somewhere else 
I feel like the breeze will pick me up and carry me away 
Out and over the iridescent grid 
Up and away from the bar fights and neon lights 
And out and away from everything that makes me what I am
So I'm not unsympathetic 
I see why you left 
There's no one to know 
There's nothing to do 
The city's been dead 
Since you've been gone
Oh I never had just whatever it is you want, baby 
And I really tried, tried and tried with all my might, it made me crazy 
To try to figure out what it is I've done wrong every time when
Everything I love, everything I hold dear 
Heads out sometimes 
All I ever say now is goodbye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
The young man stands on the edge of his porch
The days were short and the father was gone
There was no one in the town and no one in the field
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
And now I am sure my heart can never be still
So collect your courage and collect your horse
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time
Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace
So one man has and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves, you know not what is in store
There will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you've always denied
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, "You haven't met me, I am the only son."
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time
Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me
I know what I've done, 'cause I know what I've seen
I went out back and I got my gun
I said, "You haven't met me, I am the only son."
The singer finished singing
And she's walking out
The singer sheds a tear, fear of falling out
And it's hard to say how I feel today
For years gone by and I cried
It's hard to say that I was wrong
Its hard to say that I miss you
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
My worries weigh the world
How I used to be and everything (I'm cold)
Seems a plague in me
And it's hard to say how I feel today
For years gone by, and I cried...
It's hard to say that I was wrong
Its hard to say that I miss you
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
It's hard to say I held my tongue
It's hard to say if only
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
Worse than the fear it's the lie you told a thousand times before.
Worse than a fear, it's the knife.
And it's hard to say how I feel today.
For years gone by, and I cried...
It's hard to say that I was wrong
Its hard to say that I miss you
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
It's hard to say I held my tongue
It's hard to say if only
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
This highway's dark and empty.
Just miles and miles of endless road.
I've got a sickness pounding in my head.
I'm at the mercy of the ghost.
What will it take to live as if I would not another day?
To live without despair, and to be without disdain.
How can I instill such hope, but be left with none of my own?
What if I could sing just one song and it might save somebody's life?
I sought after, after reasons to stay.
I was lost, I was lost.
Then the sky turned black,
And the rains poured down.
I was waiting, waiting to be found. oh, no.
How can I instill such hope, but be left with none of my own?
What if I could sing just one song and it might save somebody's life?
Then I would sing all that I could sing
Cause that is when, when I feel that I'm not just counting time.
Oh when I sing all that I can sing
Maybe just for a moment things would seem all right.
Oh when I sing, oh when I sing
Oh when I sing, oh when I sing
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
She said, "Some days I feel like shit"
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long
And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home
Come back home, you know the place where you used to live
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once and a while
Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Hey, I wanna crawl out of my skin
Apologize for all my sins
All the things I should have said to you
Hey, I can't make it go away
Over and over in my brain again
All the things I should have said to you
Counting stars wishing I was okay
Crashing down was my biggest mistake
I never ever meant to hurt you
I only did what I had to
Counting stars again
Hey, I'll take this day by day by day
Under the covers I'm okay I guess
Life's too short and I feel small
Counting stars wishing I was okay
Crashing down was my biggest mistake
I never ever meant to hurt you
I only did what I had to
Counting stars again
Counting stars again (5x)
By the second verse, dear friends
My head will burst, my life will end
So I'd like to start this one off by saying
"Live and love"
I was young and at home in bed
And I was hanging on the words some poem said in '31
I was impressionable, I was upsettable
I tried to make my breathing stop
Or my heartbeat slow
So when my mom and John came in I would be cold
From a bridge on Washington Avenue
The year of 1972, broke my bones and skull
And it was memorable
It was half a second in, I was halfway down
Do you think I wanted to turn back around and teach a class
Where you kiss the ass that I've exposed to you?
And at the funeral, the university
Cried at three poems they'd present
In place of a broken me
I was breaking in a case of suds at the Brass Rail
A fall-down drunk with his tongue torn out
And his balls removed
And I knew that my last lines were gone
While, stupidly, I lingered on
Oh, but wise men know when it's time to go
And so I should, too
And so I fly into the brightest winter sun
Of this frozen town, I'm stripped down to move on
My friends, I'm gone
Well, I hear my father fall
And I hear my mother call
And I hear the others all whispering, "Come home"
I'm sorry to go
I loved you all so
But this is the worst trip I've ever been on
So hoist up the John B. sail
See how the mainsail sets
I'm full in my heart and my head
And I want to go home
With a book in my hand
In the way I had planned
Well, this is the worst trip I've ever been on
Hoist up the John B. sail
See how the mainsail sets
I'm full in my heart and my head
And I want to go home
With a book in each hand
In the way I had planned
Well, I feel so broke up, I want to go home
A long day
If ever these questions were yours, what would you say?
I don't know
But I'm writing the answers on cheap paper napkins
And now he's turning off
Now she's shutting down
No, it's not what it seems
Nothing's the same when you give it away
No, it's not what it seems
It's just what you think it is
And these fights
They climb through my veins like it's mercury rising
And these nights
I seem to remember a home that was better
And now he's turning off
Now she's shutting down
No, it's not what it seems
Nothing's the same when you give it away
No, it's not what it seems
It's just what you think it is
Now he's turning off
This family's breaking down
No, it's not what it seems
Nothing's the same when you give it away
No, it's not what it seems
It's just what you think it is
It's just what you think it is
No, it's not what it seems
Nothing's the same when you give it away
No, it's not what it seems
It's just what you think it is
It's just what you think it is
It's just what you think it is
What you think it is
In a violent place we can call our country
It's a mixed up man and I guess that's me
The sun's in the sky but the storm never seems to end
It's a place of sorrow but we call it a home
And the darkest thoughts, yeah, I guess they're my own
There's wealth in the bank but there's nothing to show inside
It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's gettin' cloudy now
In a special place that I call my life
The father was cruel and he lost his wife
But I don't see, either 'cause I live across the street
It's a beautiful thing when it starts to rain
A man who drinks just to drown the pain
And I can't stop from dreaming there's something else
It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's gettin' cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's gettin' cloudy now
We are a fucked up generation
It's cloudy now
A fucked up generation
It's cloudy now
We gotta get out of here
It's cloudy now
A fucked up generation
It's cloudy now
The day our house collapsed
I went down stream.
I followed the swans
Like I follow my dreams.
Oh! I was living on borrowed time in a
Borrowed house for a borrowed crime.
In need of help I came to your door.
Saw the spike of the railings from
The 28/3rd floor.
Singing
"Build your castle, stop collecting stones
And the river bed shall not be yoru home"
To the lighthouse my friend!
I bless your words and education
To the lighthouse my friend.
Just go! just go!
To the lighthouse my friend.
I am sorry that you came to find
"Great great minds
Against themselves conspire'
Now the bombs drop around our feet,
Do we throw them back
Or bow and greet them.
Everyone now, is so terrified
Of the glowing dark
And those orange skies.
Sing it:
'Build your castle, stop throwing stones
'Cause those fire birds are
Coming down on our homes"
To the lighthouse my friends
It cannot even be a question
To the lighthouse my friends
We must go, we must go
In my platforms I hit the floor
Fell face down didn't help my brain out
Then the baby came before I found
The magic how to keep her happy
I never was the fantasy
Of what you want wanted me to be
But don't judge me so harsh little girl
So you've got a playboy mommy
But when you tell them my name and
You want to cross that bridge all on your own
Little girl they'll do you no harm
Because they know your playboy mommy
But when you tell them my name
From here to Birmingham, I got a few friends
I never was there, was there when it counts
I get my way you're so like me
You seemed ashamed, ashamed that I was
A good friend of American soldiers
I'll say it loud here by your grave
Those angels can't ever take my place
Don't judge me so harsh little girl
You got a playboy mommy
But when you tell them my name and
You want to cross that bridge all on your own
Little girl they'll do you no harm
Because they know your playboy mommy
But you just tell them my name
You tell them my name, I got a few friends
Somewhere where the orchids grow
I can't find those church bells
That played when you died
Played Gloria, talking about Hosanna
Don't judge me so harsh little girl
You got a playboy mommy come home
But when you tell them soldiers my name
You cross that bridge all on your own
Little girl they'll do you no harm
'Cause they know your playboy mommy
But I'll be home, I'll be home
To take you in my arms
Do you hear the jet plane yawning miles across the sky?
Hear the garbage truck back down in boulevard
Setting off the car alarms as it passes by?
Do you hear the static of one thousand de-tuned radios?
Shut the window love, keep the world outside
I don't want to think about anyone
And the footsteps are getting louder
Drowning out the sound of the rain as it knocks on the windowsill
I'm not answering the phone, let it ring
Lately I've been feeling like a falling bomb
The ground is getting closer and the sky is falling... down
This song has been brought to you... by a falling bomb
This song has been brought to you... by a falling bomb
And the winter moves about Illinois
When my sister picks a fight
With the Alexander boy
And my father locks the car by the store
Still we figure out the keys
And follow him once more
Oh my God, we see it on the floor
The woman on the bed
The ankle brace she wore
Stones and sled
It could have been some other
The mind that knows itself
Has a mind to serve the other
But we run back, scratching at the door
Scratching at the door
If I'm hiding in the sleeves of my coat
When my father runs undressed
He's pointing at my throat
And my brother has fit in the snow
And the traffic stops for miles
We take him by the elbow
Oh my God, the shuffling and the floor
A mind that knows itself
Is a mind that knows much more
So we run back, scrambling for cover
The mind that knows itself
Has a mind to kill the other
(Oh my God, no one came to our side
To carry us away from danger)
Oh my God
He left us now for dead
He left us now for dead
1, 2, 3, 4
Leave just as you came
Without a sound
Nothing to ruffle your ends
I've been wadering 'round
Making up movies in my...
So we say don't let it go
Let me try and pull out my pride
I already forget how I used to feel about you
Leave as fast as you came
No invitation
No where to go from here
I've been wandering around wondering how
I got so, got so...
So fucking bored all of a sudden
So fucking scared, I'm not scared
You'd mean so much more to me
You'd mean so much more if I remembered
Close your eyes
Get some sleep
It's too late now
To change anything
But it's all right
Get some sleep
It's so dark outside
So close your eyes
And feel the world turn round
If you're not lost
I guess that makes you found
You're the night, Lilah
A little girl lost in the woods
You're a folktale
The unexplainable
You're a bedtime story
The one that keeps the curtains closed
I hope you're waiting for me
'Cause I can't make it on my own
I can't make it on my own
It's too dark to see the landmarks
And I don't want your good luck charms
I hope you're waiting for me 
Across your carpet of stars
You're the night, Lilah
You're everything that we can't see
Lilah
You're the possibility
You're the bedtime story
The one that keeps the curtains closed
And I hope you're waiting for me
'Cause I can't make it on my own
I can't make it on my own
Unknown the unlit world of old
You're the sounds I've never heard before
Off the map where the wild things grow
Another world outside my door
Here I stand I'm all alone
Driving down the pitch black road
Lilah you're my only home
And I can't make it on my own
You're a bedtime story 
The one that keeps the curtains closed
I hope you're waiting for me
'Cause I can't make it on my own
I can't make it on my own
I said what you wanted to hear
And what I wanted to say
So I will take it back
And all the dishes intact?
Let them be broken, broken
It's easy to be
Easy and free
When it doesn't mean anything
You remain selfless, cold and composed
You've done me no favor
To call and be nice
Telling me I
Can take anything I like
You don't owe me to be so polite
You've done no wrong
You've done no wrong
Get out of my sight
It's easy to be
Easy and free
When it doesn't mean anything
You remain
Selfless, cold and composed
Come on baby, now throw me a right to the chin
Don't just stare like you never cared, I know you did
But you just smiled like a bank teller
Blankly telling me, "Have a nice life."
Come on baby and throw me a right to the chin
Just one sign that could show me that you gave a shit
But you just smile politely
And I grow weaker and I
Said what you wanted to hear
And what I wanted to say
So I will take it back
It's easy to be
Easy and free
When it doesn't mean anything
When it doesn't mean anything
You can take anything
You can take anything
You're so selfless, cold
You're so selfless, cold
You're so selfless, cold and composed
Feeling scared today
Write down "I am OK"
A hundred times the doctors say
I am OK
I am OK
I'm not OK
Skin is crawling off
Mopping the sweaty drops
Sticking around for this shit
Another day
Another day
Not another day
Pink pill feels good
Finally understood
Take me in your warm embrace
I am trying
I am trying
I wanna live again
I wanna start everything over again
I wanna get this right
I'll meet you in another life
Over again
I'm coming back around again
Coming back over again
I'm coming back around again,
But now it's over
We're out of time and I can't breathe
I told you not to believe in me
'Cause all I do is put you far away from me
All I do is push you far away from me
Out of time and I can't breathe
I told you not to believe in me
'Cause all I do is push you far away from me
All I do is push you far away from me
I'm gonna make this work
I'm gonna change everything wrong with me
I'm gonna prove you wrong
When I meet you in another life
Over again
I'm coming back around again
Coming back over again
I'm coming back around again,
But now it's over
We're out of time and I can't breathe
I told you not to believe in me
'Cause all I do is push you far away from me
All I do is push you far away from me
Out of time and I can't breathe
I told you not to believe in me
'Cause all I do is push you far away from me
All I do is push you far away from me
I never had the gift of holding on to you
You're so far, so far away
No I, never had to give up of holding on to you
You're so far, so far away
I wanna live again [x3]
I wanna start everything over again
I wanna live again [x3]
I wanna start everything over again
We're out of time and I can't breathe [x4]
I told you not to believe in me
'Cause all I do is push you far away from me
All I do is push you far away from me
We belong together 
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force
We've all been spoken for
The hammer may strike 
Be dead on the ground 
A net to my hand
A cross on this crown 
But we're done if we're undone 
Finished if who we are incomplete 
As one we are everything 
We are everything we need
We belong together 
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force
We've all been spoken for
What good is a life 
With no one to share 
The light of the moon 
The honor of a swear
The kingdom of men
Is hollow within
Without depth
Without a care
That it takes to make a perfect love
The passion to find the utter truth
To visualize the straightened from the askew
To trade a common comfort for a view
Will you try to live the way in which you speak
Taste the milk of your mother earth's love 
Spread the word of consciousness you seek 
We are everything we need
We belong together 
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force
We've all been spoken for
Spoken for
Spoken for
We belong together 
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force
We've all been spoken for
All this indecision 
All this independent strain 
Still, we've got our hearts on safe
We've got our hearts on safe
Someday when you're lonely 
Sometime after all this bliss 
Somewhere lost in emptiness 
I hope you find this gift 
I hope you find this gift
I hope you find this gift
It's funny how
Even now
You still support me after all the things that I've done
You're so good to me
Waiting patiently
And isn't it sad that you still have to ask if I care
I never said I was perfect
But I can take you away
Walk on shells tonight
Can't do right tonight
And you can't say a word 'cause I leap down your throat
So uptight am I
I never said I was perfect
But I can drive you home
I got down on myself
Working too hard
Driving myself to death
Trying to beat up the faults in my head
What a mess I've made
Sure we all make mistakes
But they see me so large
That they think I'm immune to the pain
Walk on shells tonight
Can't do right tonight
And you can't say a word 'cause I leap down your throat
So uptight am I
I'm praying for a miracle
But I won't hold my breath
I never said I was perfect
But can you take me home
Oh no, God damn
I missed the last tram
I killed a party again
God damn, God damn
I wanna sleep in my bed
I wanna clean up my head
Don't wanna look this dead, don't wanna feel this dread
I killed a party again
I ruined it for my friends
Well, you're so silent, Jens
Well, maybe I am, maybe I am
Now at the central station
No time for being patient
I feel like goin' home
But at the same time, I don't
Black cab
Black cab
Black cab
Black cab
Black cab
Black cab
Black cab
Black cab
And I've heard all the stories 'bout the black cabs and the way they drive
But if you take a ride with them you may not come back alive
They might be psycho killers but tonight I really don't care
So I say turn up the music, take me home or take me anywhere
Black cab
Black cab
Black cab
Black cab
You don't know anything
So don't ask me questions
You don't know anything
So please don't ask me any questions
You don't know anything
So don't ask me questions
Just turn the music up
And keep your mouth shut
Black cab
Black cab
Black cab
Black cab
I tried to murder the lonely,
Contemplate our mortality.
Into infinity,
Frozen memory
Wipe the tears from yesterday,
A time for change, take the pain away.
Angel, my destiny,
Can you feel me?
Out here
Barely see my breath, surrounded
By jealousy and death
I can't be reached
Only had one call
Dragged underneath
Separate from you all, you all
This time
Lost my own return in spite of
Everything I've learned
I hid my tracks
Spit out all my air
Slipped into cracks
Stripped of all my cares, my cares
I'm so tired
Sheep are counting me
No more struggle
No more energy
No more patient
You can write that down
It's all too crazy
I'm not sticking 'round
Travelling again
I know exactly how it's gonna end
The routine daydream starts to sock it off
I'm holding up the queue
'Cause my ticket won't go through
I know it should be simple but it's not
So don't take my photograph
'Cause I don't wanna know how it looks to feel like this
As cars and people pass
It feels like standing still but I know
I'm just moving uncomfortably slow, yeah, slow...
Something's gotta change
I know I'm lucky in a lot of ways
So why do I want more than what I have?
Brace myself to hear the lies
I wonder if they know that I
Don't get the jokes but I just need to laugh
So don't take my photograph
'Cause I don't wanna know how it looks to feel like this
As cars and people pass
It feels like standing still but I know
I'm just moving uncomfortably slow, yeah, slow...
I'm just moving uncomfortably slow down
There's infinite detail in it,
Break it down
It all becomes simple how
It all becomes clearer now
So don't take my photograph
'Cause I don't wanna know how it looks to feel like this
As cars and people pass
It feels like standing still but I know
I'm just moving so consciously
One day I guess I'll be
The man that you think you see
I'm just moving uncomfortably slow, yeah, slow...
If I died tomorrow would this song live on forever?
Here is my... unopened letter to a world
That never shall reply
If I died tomorrow would this song live on forever?
Here is my... unopened letter to a world
That never shall reply, never shall reply
From this second story window I can hear the church bells
Calling out my name. This table is set for one
Even angels would be homesick in this forsaken town
On random notes of parchment I'm scrawling my existence,
Dressed in white. This candle radiates throughout the night
And it's never burning out, Never burning out
From this second story window I can hear the children
Down on Main Street. They're singing their songs tonight
In the shadows, I will listen to their every movement
Mr. Higginson, am I not good enough for the world?
Am I destined only to die the same way that I lived...
In seclusion?
From high up on this mountain I can almost see
Your lonely windowsill. They'll carry you off tonight
There's a ghost in your old bedroom
And a candle burning bright
If I died tomorrow
Would this song live on forever?
There are worse ways for a guy to spend his time
Than to sit and think of you
I think I'd marry you
Just your smile 
Keeps me satisfied
Though you're not mine
So for the rest of my life
I'm gonna search for someone just like you
And we tend the garden all day long
Watching history unfold
And I'd be enough
And you'd be enough
And we'd grow old
So for the rest of my life
I'm gonna search for someone just like you
For the rest of my life
I'm gonna search for someone just like you
Yeah, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna search for someone just like you
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from rain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in a war for a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year
Running over the same old ground. What have we found?
The same old tears
Wish you were here
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the coloured balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon
It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the coloured balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon
There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh, to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the coloured balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon
Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're givin' back some glares
To the people who you met
And it's your first cigarette
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the coloured balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon
Now you say you're leavin' home
'Cause you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the coloured balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the coloured balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon

Gotta be honest
Gotta be guarded
You sure aren't gonna say
Right on the inside
That is the hardest
The hardest game to play
We sorted it all out 
And managed to slip through 
The night into the day 
Life and the soul
Do you ever get lonely?
I'm gonna take you home
Found a way to understand the things I'm learning 
Found a way to understand the time you're burning 
Found a way to understand the things I'm learning 
Found a way to understand the time you're burning 
Gotta be honest 
Gotta be guarded 
Sure i'm gonna say 
Right on the inside
That is the hardest
The hardest game to play
Sorted it all out
Managed to slip through
The night into the day
Life and the soul
Do you ever get lonely?
I'm gonna take you home
Found a way to understand the things I'm learning
Found a way to understand the time you're burning
Found a way to understand the things I'm learning
Found a way to understand the time you're burning
I'm gonna take you home 
Gotta be honest
Gotta be guarded
You sure aren't gonna say
Right on the inside
That is the hardest
The hardest game to play
Take your eyes off me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changing
You have given me something I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changing
We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to mean
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive
That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me
Hey Mr. Curiosity
Is it true what they've been saying about you
Are you killing me?
You took care of the cat already
And for those who think it's heavy
Is it the truth
Or is it only gossip
Call it mystery or anything
Oh just as long as you call me
I sent the message on did you get it when I left it
Said well this catastrophic event
It wasn't meant to mean no harm
But to think there's nothing wrong is a problem, oh
I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
Love is a mystery
Mr. Curious...
Come back to me
Mr. waiting-ever-patient can't you see
That I'm the same the way you left me
Hurry to spell check me
And I'm underlined already in envy green
And pencil red
And I've forgotten what you've said
Will you stop working for the dead and return
Mr. Curious, well I need some inspiration
It's my birthday and I cannot find no cause for celebration
The scenario is grave but I'll be braver when you save me
From this situation laden with hearsay
I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
This love is a mystery
Mr. Curiosity
Be Mr. Please
Do come and find me, oh
Oh, come on oh, yea yea
I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
Trying not to ask why
Cause love is a mystery
Mr. Curiosity
Be Mr. Please
Do come and find me
Love is blinding when the timing's never right
Oh but who am I to beg for difference
Finding love in a distant instant
But I don't mind, at least I've tried
Oh, well I tried...
Are you there?
Is it wonderful to know
All the ghosts, all the ghosts
Freak my selfish out, my mind is happy
Need to learn to let it go
I know you'd do no harm to me
But since you've been gone I've been lost inside
Tried and failed as we walked by the riverside
Oh I wish you could see the love in her eyes
The best friend that eluded you lost in time
Burned alive in the heat of a grieving mind
But what can I say now?
It couldn't be more wrong
'Cause there's no one there
Unmistakably lost and without a care
Have we lost all the love that we could share?
And it's wearing me down
And it's turning me round
And I can't find a way now to find it out
Where are you when I need you
Are you there?
Are you there?
Are you there
this is forgiven
if the uniform fits
postponed, at the first showing
this is the tension mold
of frozen icicles
and it feels like it's snowing
you speak in tongues
tremors that warn us of ourselves
(walk away)
born in hearts
etched in cold
at the first showing
(walk away)
born in hearts
etched in cold
nothing bleeds the same
my travel expenses paid
postponed, at the first showing
this dance is out of rhythm
we trip on excess steps
postponed, at the first showing
you speak in tongues
tremors that warn us of ourselves
(walk away)
born in hearts
etched in cold
at the first showing
(walk away)
born in hearts
etched in cold
born in hearts
yet etched in cold
swingsets pay
the playground toll
tremors that hold us
tremors that warn us
nothing bleeds like
(walk away)
born in hearts
etched in cold
at the first showing
(walk away)
born in hearts
etched in cold
And no more shall we part
It will no longer be necessary
And no more will I say, dear heart
I am alone and she has left me
And no more shall we part
The contracts are drawn up,
The ring is locked upon the finger
And never again will my letters start
Sadly, or in the depths of winter
And no more shall we part
All the hatchets have been buried now
And all of birds will sing to your
Beautiful heart
Upon the bough
And no more shall we part
Your chain of command
Has been silenced now
And all of those birds
Would've sung to your beautiful heart
Anyhow
Lord, stay by me
Don't go down
I will never be free
If I'm not free now
Lord, stay by me
Don't go down
I never was free
What are you talking about?
For no more shall we part
And no more shall we part
All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same
Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Now that I've really got a chance
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Everything's falling into place
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Seeing my past to let it go
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's Child
(Oh, whoa)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was (x2)
Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and Lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet
Lucky old sun is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms
(Oh-neh don' go)
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Now that I've really got a chance
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Everything's falling into place
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Seeing my past to let it go
(Yeah, throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I
When the night shows
The signals grow on radios
All the strange things
They come and go, as early warnings
Stranded starfish have no place to hide
Still waiting for the swollen Easter tide
There's no point in direction 
We cannot even choose a side
I took the old track
The hollow shoulder, across the waters
On the tall cliffs
They were getting older, sons and daughters
The jaded underworld was riding high
Waves of steel hurled metal at the sky
And as the nail sunk in the cloud
The rain was warm and soaked the crowd
Lord, here comes the flood
We will say goodbye to flesh and blood
If again the seas are silent, in any still alive
It'll be those who gave their island to survive
Drink up, dreamers, you're running dry
When the flood calls
You have no home, you have no walls
In that thunder crash
You're a thousand minds, within a flash
Don't be afraid to cry at what you see
The actor's gone, there's only you and me
And if we break before the dawn
They'll use up what we used to be
Lord, here comes the flood
We will say goodbye to flesh and blood
If again the seas are silent, in any still alive
It'll be those who gave their island to survive
Drink up, dreamers, you're running dry
I don't do yoga, never tried pilates
Not many people want me at their parties
Tryin'a find my place some place, oh I, oh I, oh I
And I drink a little more than recommended
This world ain't exactly what my heart expected
Tryin'a find my way some way, oh I, oh I, oh I
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, Oh I am free
If you ask the church then I am no believer
Spend Sundays asleep I'm just another dreamer
Still tryin'a find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I
And I guess I ain't too good with money neither
I got two left feet, no, I'm no Jackson neither
Just tryin'a find my way, some way, oh I, oh I, oh I
Sing, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, I am free
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, oh I am free
Yeah I'm free yeah I'm free yeah [repeating in background]
Still tryina find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I
I drink a little more than recommended
'Cause this ain't exactly what my heart expected
Whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, I am free
Whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, oh I am free
Whoa, c'est la vie
'Cause maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, oh I am free
Tell me lies, slap me on the face, just...
Improvise, do something really clever,
That'll make me hater your name forever
You might swear, you'd never touch a lady
Well, let me say, you're not too far from maybe
Everyday you find new ways to hurt me
But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
Always having my heart set on you
Till the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
Ah, fool
God resigned from hearing my old story
Every night, I'm paying hell for glory
I'm embarrassed but I'm much more sorry
All this pain, begins to feel like pleasure
With my tears, you'd make a sea a desert
Salt my wounds, and I'll keep saying thank you
But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
Always having my heart set on you
Till the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
Ah, fool
It was just before the moon hung
Her weary heavy head in
The gallows and the graves of
The milky milky cradle
His tears have turned to poppies
A shimmer in the midnight
A flower in the twilight
A flower in the twilight
And our screaming
Is in his screaming
Our screaming in the willow
They took him to the gallows
He fought them all the way though
And when they asked us how we knew his name
We died just before him
Our eyes are in the flowers
Our hands are in the branches
Our voices in the breezes
And our screaming
Is in his screaming
Our screaming in the willow tree
We're waiting by the willow
Our milky milky cradle
Our lockets long have rusted
His picture worn and weathered
Our hair is in the garden
Our voices in our toeses
Our heart are in the blossoms
Our eyes are in the branches
And our screaming
Is in his screaming
Our screaming in the willow tree
There is a black river
It passes by my window
And late at night
All dolled up like Christ
I walk the water
Between the piers
Singing
Oh, river of sorrow
River of time, river
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time
For we all know the baby has expired
Long ago she was pulled from the mire
And no precious liar or well-wisher
Can return the love that was stolen
So oh, river of sorrow
River of time, river
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time
Can you see the light
At the end of the dark passageway?
Take me with you towards the light
Into the darkness passing over the faces in the river
Hear me, I'm whispering in your ear
Oh, river of sorrow
Oh, river of time
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time
Oh, river of sorrow
Oh, river of time
River of sorrow
Don't swallow this time
In 1969
I killed a man of mine
In a small Montana town
I was hunted down by hounds
Hear the nighthawks cry
Their voices dry and hollow
Hear the crowd cheer
They cheer me to the gallows
In 1985
I was doing time alive
I made a plan to escape
And live as the lady of the lake
Hear the crowd of ghosts
Their voices dry and hollow
Can't you hear their call
They cheer me to the gallows
1995
Was the year I came up for trial
I listened to his song
And watched the sun make the shadows long
Hear the nighthawk cry
His voice is dry and hollow
Hear the crowd call
They cheer me to the gallows
Hear the nighthawk call
His voice is dry and hollow
Here the nighthawk call
In a voice that's hollow
Needs dying all
Hard night
Feel you tight
Crop the wire
Cold child
Crop the ire
Dying oh
Grow up at night
Feel you tight
As near as I
Cold child
We dry soil, heartmill
Feel you and I high
We die forever
'This dream never ends,' you said
'This feel never goes
The time will never come to slip away
This wave never breaks,' you said
'This sun never sets again
These flowers will never fade'
Never fade
'This world never stops,' you said
'This wonder never leaves
The time will never come to say goodbye
This tide never turns,' you said
'This night never falls again
These flowers will never die'
Never die
Never die
These flowers will never die
Never die
'This dream always ends,' I said
'This feeling always goes
The time always comes to slip away
This wave always breaks,' I said
'This sun always sets again
And these flowers will always fade'
'This world always stops,' you said
'This wonder always leaves
The time always comes to say goodbye
This tide always turns,' I said
'This night always falls again
And these flowers will always die'
Always die
Always die
These flowers will always die
Between you and me
It's hard to ever really know
Who to trust
How to think
What to believe
Between me and you
It's hard to ever really know
Who to choose
How to feel
What to do
Never fade
Never die
You give me flowers of love
Always fade
Always die
I let fall flowers of blood
The ghost of your smile is always looking
For new bodies to haunt
And it's been here and disappeared
It's hanging around aloofly for a while
Gradually gone
It's pleasing and freezing
Well, I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster
You looked all over town
Got turned around
To walk back through the mud
The kind you had left behind you
Everybody is the same in this long no-win game
Where every new blood
Gets time to become resigned
Now I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster
Why you never tried to tame your master
You just blow through the coals
Blow through the coals
Blow through the coals
Until everyone knows that your smile is just a ghost
The ghost of your smile was seen on a body in the park
It's old news
You see that it's no use
Waiting to start
Waiting to light
Waiting until dark
I told you, man
I told you
Well, I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster
Why you never tried to tame your master
My friend, she told me such a story
But she didn't know what I knew
I laughed with my friend when she got to the end
I knew we were laughing at you
She told me that you made some money
You got yourself framed on the wall
And people come by and they look at your face
And they say it's the fairest of all
Of course you protest, that's what you do best
And you're modest and shy to the end
You're watching them as they're looking at you
And you know it was money well spent
She told me you'd given up drinking
To be with somebody you knew
And you tried to get into the Bible
But it never got into you
You've still got some loyal disciples
I suppose that I'm one of the few
I shouldn't have laughed, 'cause I mean you no harm
But my friend got to me before you
So next time I see you, I'll be pleased to see you
I hope you'll be pleased to see me
I'll visit your picture, I won't have the nerve
To tell them that they've got you all wrong
Your warm whispers
Out of the dark they carry my heart
Your warm whispers
Into the dawn they carry me through
And I'm weeping warm honey and milk
That you stay surrounding me, surrounding me
Your warm whispers
Letting me drown in a pool of you
Your warm whispers
Keeping the noise from breaking through
And I'm weeping warm honey and milk
That you stay surrounding me, surrounding me
Yeah I'm weeping warm honey and milk 
That you stay surrounding me
Your warm whispers
Your warm whispers
Yeah I'm weeping warm honey and milk
Your warm whispers
Yeah I'm weeping warm honey and milk
Your warm whispers
Your warm whispers
Your warm whispers
You knock on her door
She don't recognise your voice no more
So she got on an aeroplane
Na na na na na so long after
Strip down from the fever
Laid down in a hotel bed
Wouldn't take no phone calls at all
Didn't want no more voices in her head
And that's the way that you feel
And that's the way that you feel
And that's the way that you feel honey know
That's the way that you feel
In the blue part of the evening
Sometimes its hard
She thinks she hears you coming
But she's stuck against the wall
Oh she wants what she wants
So she do what she do
But now she looks at you
She covers one eye 'cause she can see into your mind
She no longer want to
And that's the way that you feel
And that's the way that you feel
And that's the way that you feel honey know
That's the way that you feel
"Take me again," she said, thinking of him
"To the pond with the swans and the swimming"
Far from his room, the familiar perfume
How it left her aware she was naked
The lesson she learned when her memory serves
Is to marvel with love at the sunset
And walking away at the dark end of day
She will measure and break like a habit
Oh, how the rain
Sounds as loud as a lover's words
And now and again
She's afraid when the sun returns
"Take me again," she said, thinking of him
"I don't care for this careful behavior"
A brush through her hair, children kissing upstairs
Keeps her up with her want for her savior
The sun on the sand, on her knees and her hands
As she begs for her fish from the water
But turned them away, she's a whip and a slave
Given time she may find something better
Oh, how the rain
Sounds as loud as a lover's words
And now and again
She's afraid when the sun returns
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free.
Blackbird fly, Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.
Blackbird fly, Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Walk inside, gets noticed
Fears conspire, they won't go away
And I know, and I see, you'll be breaking hearts again
You break me gently
Break me gently
Break me gently
Break my fall in vain
Pain won't go, rest in peace
And I look, and I see, you could be breaking souls again
And I see me, break me gently
Break me gently
Break me gently
There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
Please don't you cry anymore
Can't you see?
Listen to the breeze, whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore
Even the valleys below,
Where the rays of the sun were so warm and tender,
Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see?
(Nevermore nevermore)
Why did you have to leave me?
(Nevermore nevermore)
Why did you deceive me?
You send me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
(Ah ah)
Nevermore, ah
Nevermore
The last selection in the ballgame.
Does never get a pass. 
Not appreciated's just his first name.
He's the scapegoat of the class.
There are no friends to cheer him up and
No girls, no sweet romance.
It's impossible to expand, when you never get a second chance.
Do you know, who's that guy, 
Who's all alone?
Do you care enough to see? 
He's in pain and misery.
He's not going to the school-prom. 
He said he had the flu.
Trumped-up excuses as he told mom.
- I'm safer here with you.
She told her son
- Someday, they'll all be 
Sorry for mistreating you.
Don't be afraid my son and trust me,
-You'll be someone they will look up to.
Do you know, who's that guy, 
Who's all alone?
Do you care enough to see? 
He's in pain and misery...
Do you care to see?
Do you know, who's that guy,
Who's all alone?
Do you care enough to see? 
He's in pain and misery. x3
Yeah!
All of these ghost towns I keep traveling through
All of these traffic signs and lonesome bars blindsiding me and
I swear I can be better
I could be more to you
But there are things that line my path
That I just have to do
If you've got visions of the past
Let them follow you down
For they'll come back to you some day
And I found myself attached to this railroad track
But I'll come back to you some day
To you
To you
To you
Some day
And I remember how you told me all that you wanted to do
That dream of Paris in the morning or a New York window view
And I can see it now you're married and your wife is with a child
And you're all laughing in the garden and I'm lost somewhere in your mind
If you've got visions of the past
Let them follow you down
For they'll come back to you some day
And I found myself attached to this railroad track
But I'll come back to you some day
To you
To you
To you
Some day
Maybe I should just turn around and walk away
For no matter how much I really do want to stay
You know I can't, no it's too late
For I've found myself attached to this railroad track
But I'll come back to you some day
To you
To you
To you
Some day
So the wind that blows across your room
Carried cheap perfume onto your dresser
It rained for jewelry and for credit cards
Two tickets to a film I don't remember
One day you'll kiss your rabbits nose, pick up the phone
To find I've been turned over
And you'll grab that piece of gold
Only to find that the smell has taken over
Now all the things you had, they aren't the same...
As what you hold
I'm standing in a room,
Its filled with older folks pleading "baby listen"
And I scream as loud as anyone,
But when asked to make a point I tend to whisper
Now highways turn to tidal waves
Theyre asking me to export all of your insecurities
But that wind that blows across your room
It's gonna set the sails, and send me back to you
Sometimes, when sailors are sailing
They think twice, about where they're anchoring
And I think, I could make better time of my time on land
Ill drink less
Cause lord knows I could use a warm kiss
Instead of a cold goodbye
I'm writing the folks back home to tell them
"Hey I'm doing all right"
It's a shame what your father did to your brothers head
He smashed it with a telephone
And your mother got scared and locked the door
You were only four, but lord you remember it
So now you're scared of love
I'm here to tell you loves not some fucking blood on the receiver
Love is speaking in code
It's an inside joke
Love is coming home
Sometimes, when sailors are sailing
They think twice, about where they're anchoring
And I think, I could make better time of my time on land
Ill drink less
Cause lord knows I could use a warm kiss
Instead of a cold goodbye
I'm writing the folks back home to tell them
"Hey I'm doing all right"
Yeah I'm doing just fine
And if she seems as lonely as me...
Let her sink.
Let her sink.
Let her
Do you wanna run away together?
I would say it was your best line ever
Too bad I fell for it...
And I walked along
Waiting for you to come along
Take my tortured heart by the hand
And write me off
Do you know I cry?
Do you know I die?
Do you know I cry?
And it's not the good kind...
You forced me to become strong
And I just cried, being weak
And you think you know
And I would like to think so
But do you know that when you go
I fall apart
Do you know I cry?
Do you know I die?
Do you know I cry?
And it's not the good kind
No, it's not the good kind...
I'm tired of hiding behind these lying eyes
I'm tired of this smile that even I don't recognize
Do you know I cry?
Do you know I die?
Do you know I cry?
Do you know I cry?
And it's not the good kind...
Do you know I cry?
Do you know I die?
Do you know I cry?
And it's not the good kind...
No, you're not the good kind
Good kind
No, you're not the good kind
Good kind
No, you're not the good kind
Just because
You call my name
I cannot hear
It's not the same
(Can't close my/you close your) eyes
And knock me back
All the things that I had to (have/live)
(And now you)...just...(fallen...)
I can't believe what I had to say
All the things you never say
I'll never be what you want me to be
Now I can't disappear
Close your eyes and look at me
I can't believe what I cannot see
Everything is like you say
Change your mind and you'll have to forgive
And I can't disappear
Now I can't
Now I can't
In every heart, there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along
I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much
My silence is my self-defense
And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon, I suppose
But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break
And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows
So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows
You wash them clothes
Swee dee dee
And hang 'em on the line
I can see by the way
You wash them clothes
Your cookin' must be fine
I'm with you in the morning
Till the break of day
And I know everybody
Has a little hard luck
Sometimes
And I know lately
I've been havin' mine
We used to live
In a fleabag apartment
You know the kind
And he come home and he'd say to me
We gotta leave, leave, leave the city
You wash them clothes
Swee dee dee
And hang 'em on the line
I can see by the way you wash them clothes
Your cookin' must be fine
I'm with you in the morning
Unill the break of day
I know everybody
Has a little hard luck
Sometimes
I know lately
I've been havin' mine.
You talk too much
Maybe that's your way
Of breaking up the silence
That fills you up
But it doesn't sound the same
When no one's really listening
We stumble
Into our lives
Reach for a hand to hold
Any wonder
We need to find
A certain something certain
Turn out the light
And what are you left with
Open up my hands
And find out they're empty
Press my face to the ground
I've gotta find a reason
Just scratching around
For something to believe in
Something to believe in
You have too much
Spending all your time
Collecting and discovering
It's not enough
And no matter how you try
You never find the one you want
We stumble into our lives
Without a hand to hold
Any wonder
We need to find
A certain something certain
Turn out the light
And what are you left with
Open up my hands
And find out they're empty
Press my face to the ground
I'm gonna find a reason
Still scratching around
For something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something I can believe in
Something I can believe in
Come on I need it
Something I can believe in now
Come on I need it
Something I can believe in
Come on I need it, oh
Something I can believe in
Come on I need it
Oh, oh
Right on, right now
Right on, right now
I just need something to believe in
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
It's the same old S.O.S.
But with brand new broken fortunes
And once again I turn to you
Once again I do I turn to you
It's the same old S.O.S.
But with brand new broken fortunes
I'm the same underneath
But this you, you surely knew
Life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
Life, life is a pigsty
Life, life is a pigsty
Life, life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
And if you don't know this
Then what do you know?
Every second of my life I only live for you
And you can shoot me
And you can throw me off a train
I still maintain
I still maintain
Life, life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
And I'd been shifting gears all of my life
But I'm still the same underneath
This you surely knew
I can't reach you
I can't reach you
I can't reach you anymore
Can you please stop time?
Can you stop the pain?
I feel too cold
And now I feel too warm again
Can you stop this pain?
Can you stop this pain?
Even now in the final hour of my life
I'm falling in love again
Again
Even now in the final hour of my life
I'm falling in love again
Again
Again
Again
I'm falling in love again
Again
Again
Again
When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart
And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy so was I
When she loved me
Through the summer and the fall
We had each other, that was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be
And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that
She loved me
So the years went by
I stayed the same
But she began to drift away
I was left alone
Still I waited for the day
When she'd say
"I will always love you"
Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
And she smiled at me and held me
Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me
When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart
When she loved me
Immer wenn ich dich besuch fühl ich mich grenzenlos
Alles andre ist von hier aus so weit weg
Ich mag die Ruhe hier zwischen all den Bäumen
Als ob es den Frieden auf Erden wirklich gibt
Es ist ein schöner Weg, der unauffällig zu dir führt
Ja, ich habe ihn gern, weil er so hell und freundlich wirkt
Ich habe Blumen mit, weiß nicht, ob du sie magst
Damals hättest du dich wahrscheinlich sehr gefreut
Wenn sie dir nicht gefallen, stör dich nicht weiter dran
Sie werden ganz bestimmt bald wieder weggeräumt
Wie es mir geht, die Frage stellst du jedes Mal
Ich bin okay, will nicht, dass du dir Sorgen machst
Und so red ich mit dir wie immer
So als ob es wie früher wär
So als hätten wir jede Menge Zeit
Ich spür dich ganz nah hier bei mir
Kann deine Stimme im Wind hören
Und wenn es regnet, weiß ich, dass du manchmal weinst
Bis die Sonne scheint; Bis sie wieder scheint
Ich soll dich grüßen von den Andern:
Sie denken alle noch ganz oft an dich
Und dein Garten, es geht ihm wirklich gut
Obwohl man merkt, dass du ihm doch sehr fehlst
Und es kommt immer noch Post, ganz fett adressiert an dich
Obwohl doch jeder weiß, dass du weggezogen bist
Und so red ich mit dir wie immer
Und ich verspreche dir
Wir haben irgendwann wieder jede Menge Zeit
Dann werden wir uns wiedersehen
Du kannst dich ja kümmern, wenn du willst
Dass die Sonne an diesem Tag auch auf mein Grab scheint
Dass die Sonne scheint, dass sie wieder scheint
Take a look at my body
Look at my hands
There's so much here
That I don't understand 
Your face saving promises
Whispered like prayers
I don't need them
I don't need them 
I've been treated so wrong
I've been treated so long
As if I'm becoming untouchable 
Contempt loves the silence
It thrives in the dark
With fine winding tendrils
That strangle the heart 
They say that promises
Sweeten the blow
But I don't need them
No, I don't need them 
I've been treated so wrong
I've been treated so long
As if I'm becoming untouchable 
I'm a slow dying flower
Frost killing hour
The sweet turning sour
And untouchable 
O, I need
The darkness
The sweetness
The sadness
The weakness
I need this 
I need
A lullaby
A kiss goodnight
Angel sweet
Love of my life
O, I need this 
Do you remember the way
That you touched me before
All the trembling sweetness
I loved and adored? 
Your face saving promises
Whispered like prayers
I don't need them
No, I don't need them 
O, I need
The darkness
The sweetness
The sadness
The weakness
I need this 
I need
A lullaby
A kiss goodnight
The angel sweet
Love of my life
I need this 
Is it dark enough? 
Can you see me? 
Do you want me? 
Can you reach me? 
Or I'm leaving 
You better shut your mouth
Hold your breath
Kiss me now you'll catch your death
O, I mean this
O, I mean this
Who's in a bad mood?
Who's in a taxi?
Turning the clock back,
Avoiding a fight with this man
He is meeting, stands in the lobby,
Counting his questions in the neon light
Sinking under the river,
Sewer line touches the edge of the suburbs
Back to the beach where
A family is waiting,
On rumors of summer.
Lay out a blanket,
Bring something to feed the birds
With all the luck you've had, why are your songs so sad?
Sing from a book you were reading in bed and took to heart.
All of your lives unled, reading in bed
Who will save the war child baby
Who controls the keys
The web we weave is thick and sordid
Fine by me
At times of war
We're all the losers
There's no victory
We'll shoot to kill, and kill your lover
Fine by me
War Child
Victim of political pride
Plant the seed, territorial greed
Mind, the war child.
We should mind, the war child
I spent last winter in New York
And came upon a man
He was sleeping on the streets and homeless
He said, "I fought in Vietnam"
Beneath his shirt he wore the mark
He bore the mark of pride
A two-inch deep incision carved
Into his side
War Child!
Victim of political pride
Plant the seed, territorial Greed
Mind, the war child
We should mind, the war child
Who's the loser now
Who's the loser now
We're all the losers now
We're all the losers now
War child, war child
Oh heart of steel, don't kill thy song
That sings so we, can heal the harm inside
Don't leave me stranded, don't leave me alone
Don't me leave me dying, without a lover to hold
Oh my heart, don't break the promise
Every time I pay the price
For a heart that can't be broken, oh
Oh heart of steel, you reel me in
Oh heart of steel, I can't let you win
Don't run, don't hide
Don't fight when I finally find
A hand to hold, a song that clings with mine
Don't leave me stranded, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me dying, without a lover to hold
Oh my heart, don't break the promise
Every time I pay the price
For a heart that can't be broken, oh
Oh heart of steel, you reel me in
Oh heart of steel, I can't let you win
Every night I feel you burning
Every night I hear you calling
Every night it's only you and I
Oh heart, don't break the promise
Every time I pay the price
For a heart that can't be broken, oh
Oh heart of steel, you reel me in
Oh heart of steel, I can't let you win
Oh heart of steel, you reel me in
Oh heart of steel, I can't let you win
I'm not comfortable with how we never talk
And I miss you since you went out for that walk
It's been 13 months since May
It still feels like yesterday
I was scared to fix what I had broke
It's a lonely place to live with just a ghost
There is love left in my life, I will see
But you still hurt me
I can still see all your clothes thrown on the floor
There are friends who never call me anymore
I remember throwing out all of your things
But I think I kept your ring
I'm not comfortable with how the story ends
We were lovers and now we're not even friends
You were perfect and I guess I'm just a creep
But you still hurt me
Instrumental
Another perfect day
They keep pilin??up
I got happiness that I can maintain
So, beginner?�s luck
I had shoes to fill
Walkin??barefoot now
Can?�t tell north from south
But no split hair?�s gonna get me down
I'm stayin??above the flat line
I?�m ahead of the curve
Take a piece of the sunshine with me
On a redeye flight to another world
It isn?�t any trouble
If you wanna come with me
I know it?�s out of the question, honey
But I sure could use the company
And a place to be
Now the sky is pink
Rooftop swimmin??pool
I?�m not carefree, no
I?�m free to care, I just never do
All the bags are checked
And the reasons why
Yesterday lingers on
That?�s the piece you keep when you say goodbye
You can get what you want now
Knock it out of the park
Bury it by the river, easy
There?�s a search party but it?�s getting dark
I won?�t hold you to nothin??
I wanna make that plain
Probably end up a stranger and crazy
But I?�m still hopin??there?�s another way
And a place to stay
What the scene has got too sentimental
When the night comes, when the night comes loose
All the things you put upon the mantle
What a shame, what a shame
It?�s old news, ah
I?�m stayin??above the flatline
I?�m ahead of the curve
Take a piece of the sunshine with me
On an all-night drive to another world
You can get what you want now
Knock it out of the park
Probably end up a drifter and lonely
But I?�m still hoping for a change of heart
And a place
A place
A place
To start
Yeah you cooked his dinners
You raised his children
Still he's not satisfied
He says "I'd rather switch with you
You don't know how hard it is
To work from 9 to 5"
But he speaks with his eyes closed
And even though you're not all alone
He's never there to be with you
And you remember when you were young
When life was new and it was fun
Now every corner's filled with dust
But you're not coming home tonight
You just took the train
And you left without a wave
Figured he'd never let you leave anyway
And now you're sitting on that train
Seeing life in a new way
And every forest sings a song
One for the heartbroken lovers
And one for the dreamers
And then there's one just for you
The winds been humming on it all day
Ans the soil lies awake
Waiting for it's drum solo
'Cause you're not coming home tonight
The ship is sailing
I'll meet you on the other side
The future's unclear
But hopefully it will be fine
You're not coming home tonight
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Looking out my bedroom window
See the planes take off from Heathrow
One by one they come and go
On and on, on and on
I think about the places I'd go
I think about this place I call home
All the shots and all that come
All around, all around
Red light, blinking in the twilight
Tracing out a path right out of here and now
Red light, blinking in the twilight
Tracing out a path right out of here and now
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Don't you think it's quiet around here?
Doesn't seem so much to do here
Think back to this time last year
Good times, good times, good times
Don't you think we stay for too long?
Don't you think the colour has gone?
Get on a plane; it can't be wrong
Moving on, moving on
Red light, blinking in the twilight
Tracing out a path right out of here and now
Red light, blinking in the twilight
Tracing out a path right out of here and now
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Baby baby
Baby baby
Baby baby
I think it's time we move on now
Dance halls are empty
The clubs are all closed down
Nothing's going on 'round here
It's time we left town
Got a feeling my love
We've gotta get out
Before it brings us down, down, down
And they're thought to be lies
But we saw them 
We looked right in their eyes
Right at them
Pinning space to the world
We're slaughtered
Not a sound to be heard
We're awful
And have you seen
How they run
Out of gas
They beat the pain
They sing in the rain
Endless and formless
They fly to the end
And back to the 
Beginning again
Have you put them aside
Your crazy thoughts and dreams
No they're a part of me
And they all mean one thing
The will to death is what keeps me alive
It's one step away
Limitations are set
Only then can we go all the way
And have you seen how the cars when they pass
They come your way
Then they're speeding away
Coming to you and then going away
But for them nothing changed
I went and messed around with her heart
So now she's run off with my car
But I can't live without her
(And it's so hard to take)
So I've set off out to find her
I'm back on the motorway
At this wheel I'd drive the earth for her
Every carriageway a mile for her
These five gears and wheels could drive to her
But this carriageway can't take me there
Drivin' at ninety miles per hour
It's hard to know what's comin'
Then on the horizon
Something makes me brake
I can see me darlin' ahead on the motorway
(I can see us dying on the bonnet of a chevrolet)
So why's my baby lying on the side of the motorway
(I wish that I had never said the things that I'd told her today)
'Cause now she's left me crying on the shoulder of the motorway
At this wheel I'd drive the earth for her
Every carriageway a mile for her
These five gears and wheels could drive to her
But this carriageway can't take me there
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart
Take back that sad word, "goodbye"
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me
Oh, un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt that you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many, many nights
Oh, un-break my, un-break my heart, oh baby
Come back and say you love me
Un-break my heart, sweet darlin'
Without you I just can't go on
(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Tell me you love me) Can't go on, ooh
(Un-break my)
(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Tell me you love me)
(Un-break my)
(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Tell me you love me)
(Un-break my)
(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Tell me you love me)
(Un-break my)
(Fade)
You tell me all the things you do
Tell me that it's up to you
Crying in the peaceful night
Telling all the things you hide
But out there in the future
Maybe you're the rainbow
There's no song without love
With your eyes shut, you cry in your bed
Is that all you wanted?
Songs about love?
Is that want you hoped you would find
When it's burning inside
But a song about love's not enough
So what do you want?
What are you needing?
Songs about memories
That hide and then shatter your mind
Like a constant reminder
I just want to find where you are
I just want to find where you are
I hold you and your eyes fall down
You barely even make a sound
Crying in the peaceful night
Showing all the things you hide
But out there in the future
Maybe on the rainbow
There's no song without love
With your eyes shut you cry in your bed
Is that all you wanted?
Songs about love?
Is that want you hoped you would find
When it's burning inside
But a song about love's not enough
So what do you want?
What are you needing?
Songs about memories
That hide and then shatter your mind
Like a constant reminder
I just want to find where you are
I just want to find where you are
I just want to find where you are
My toes can talk
And they're smiling at me
"Come down," they say
Not afraid anymore
And they talk to me
And they smile at me
I walked upstream
And I sat in the mud
Life sucks again
Watching trees decompose
And they talk to me
And they smiled at me
As I draw up my breath,
And silver fills my eyes.
I kiss her still,
For she will never rise.
On my weak body,
Lays her dying hand.
Through those meadows of Heaven,
Where we ran.
Like a thief in the night,
The wind blows so light.
It wars with my tears,
That won't dry for many years.
"Loves golden arrow
At her should have fled,
And not Deaths ebon dart
To strike her dead."
Keep changing your mind
Like clouds in the sky
Love me when you're high
Leave me when you cry
I know it all
It takes time
Like a river running dry 
When the sun's too bright
So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see clearly in a different light
Keep dodging lights
Like a thief in the night
The sun will rise
And expose all the lies
So why deny that you and I
Lead different lives
The rivers from your eyes
Can't change my mind
So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see clearly in a different light
The rivers from your eyes
Can't change my mind
So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see clearly in a different light
I do not exist
We faithfully insist
Sailing in our separate ships
And from each tiny caravel
Tiring of trying 
There's a necessary dying
Like the horseshoe crab 
In its proper season sheds its shell
Such distance from our friends
Like a scratch across the lens
Made everything look wrong 
From anywhere we stood
Our paper flew away 
Before we'd left the bay
So half-blind we wrote these songs 
On sheets of salty wood
Caught me making eyes 
At the other boatmen's wives
And heard me laughing louder 
At the jokes told by their daughters
I'd set my course for land
But you well understand
It takes a steady hand 
To navigate adulterous waters
The propeller's spinning blades 
Held acquaintance with the waves
As there's mistakes I've made 
No rowing could outrun
The cloth low on the mast 
Like to say I've got no past
But I'm nonetheless 
The librarian and secretary's son
With tarnish on my brass 
And mildew on my glass
I'd never want someone so crass 
As to want someone like me
But a few leagues off the shore
I bit a flashing lure
And I assure you
It was not what I expected it to be
I still taste its kiss
That dull hook in my lip
Is a memory as useless 
As a rod without a reel
To an anchor ever-dropped
Seasick yet still docked
Captain spotted napping 
With his first mate at the wheel
Floating forgetfully along
With no need to be strong
We keep our confessions long 
And when we pray we keep it short
I drank a thimble full of fire 
And I'm not ever coming back
Oh, my God
I do not exist
We faithfully insist
While watching sink the heavy ship 
Of everything we knew
And if ever you come near 
I'll hold up high a mirror
Lord, I could never show you 
Anything as beautiful as You
This song leaks out onto the pavement
It could be a joke, it could be a statement
The more that I fake it and pretend I don't care
The more you can read into what isn't there
Maybe it's time to stop swimming
Maybe it's time to find out where I'm at
What I should do, where I should be
But no one will give me a map
I'll leave now, this can't continue
But I forget which door I came through
And I know that the lift can be painfully slow
So I think I'll leave by the window
She took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue
And she locked the car and slipped past
Into rhythmic quietude
Lights burning
Voice dry and hoarse
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
The chimes fell over each other
I fell onto my knees
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
Now I'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
It'll make a whisper out of you
She took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue
The fairground's lit
A drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
Got his hat tipped bottle back in between his teeth
Looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
To take a little nap while the road is straight
I wish that car had never been discovered
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under
That's the one thing that he could never do
And it'll make a whisper out of you
She took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue
Cops were running around the scene
Looking for some kind of clue
They never get uptight when a moth gets crushed
Unless a light bulb really loved him very much
I'm lying down
Blowing smoke from my cigarette
Little whisper smoke signs that you'll never get
You're in your oldsmobile driving by the moon
Headlights burning bright ahead of you
And someone's burning out, out on condor avenue
Trying to make a whisper out of you
What a shitty thing to say
Did you really mean it?
You never said a word to me about what passed between us
So now I'm leaving you alone
You can do whatever the hell you want to
Well I thought that we could sit around and, talk for hours
About things I couldn't say to you
And things that we could never do and,
This conversation has had no face
When the words take days you can re-write and erase anything
You know my heart (So tell me honestly, did you ever really want this)
Knows all these...
And I'll borrow words from all my favorite paragraphs
To write about all of these faded things
We hope would mean the most to me
And each line is sent I have found a new pages
Of hope for the days when I feel like I've lost everything
You know my heart (So tell me honestly, did you ever really want this)
Knows all these parts (Cause my jealous heart can't take that)
So I'll sing this song for every word that's come out wrong
But, I'll be okay (Is that what you want me to say)
It's called breakup
'Cause it's broken
But I'll be okay (Is that what you want me to say)
It's called breakup
'Cause it's broken
I'll be okay
Is that what you want me to say
It's called Breakup
'Cause it's broken
I'll be okay
Is that what you want me to say
It's called Breakup
'Cause it's broken
I'll be okay, is that what you want me to say
'Cause it's broken
And well, try so bad to tell me that you
Make it that you're sorry and the
Lines we said
Never meant the words we meant
'Cause it's broken
Every kiss that you could ever mean
The everything that takes you back
The chocolate, rose, the kisses
That like chasing through your misses
I'll be ok
Is that what you want me to say
It's called Breakup
'Cause it's broken
I'll be ok
Is that what you want me to say
It's called Breakup
'Cause it's broken
Well I thought that we could sit around and, talk for hours
About things I couldn't say to you
And things that we could never do
All the windows are glowing
The branches bending low
The skyline is swinging
Rocking back and forth
Walking down this dirt road
Watching at the sky
It's all I can do
It's all I can do
All the years keep rolling
The decades flying by
But ah, the days are long
So here's one to the pigeons
The tugboats on the river
Here's one to you
For walking in my shoes, ah
Oh, you know I'd never leave you
No matter how hard I try
You know I'd never leave you
And that's just how it is
Oh, everybody sees right through
Oh, the static
That is, dear, everyone but you
Oh, it's funny to think it through
Everybody... that is, dear, everyone but you
City bird, haven't you heard?
Hasn't anybody told you?
The city blocks can't hold you
Your place is in the sky, how can I show you?
City bird, haven't you heard
Of the boundlessness of your freedom?
The sky is your blue kingdom
You neglect your wings like you don't need them
City bird, maybe these hands that feed you need you
Maybe you understand that, city bird
City bird, maybe these hands that feed you need you
Maybe you understand that, city bird
City bird, haven't you heard?
Hasn't anybody told you?
The city blocks can't hold you
Your place is in the sky, how can I show you?
There's a little child
Running round this house
And he never leaves
He will never leave
And the fog comes up
From the sewers
And glows in the dark
Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast
Grow up fast
Anything you want it can be done
How did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Somethings will never wash away
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
A wicked decision
We can agree
A wicked decision
Nothing's wrong with you and me
A week in the forest
A week in the fog
You'll be sad to hear that
I I I I I was robbed
And we're gonna own it
A fist to the voice
And we've found the music
Why did you try at the choice?
And decapitation
For failing to see
Nothing in this whole wide world saves us from this situation
(Nothing can save us)
Don't stop talkin' to me please
Baby cut me all to pieces
If you really want hell, hell
Ripped apart by the crows not the vultures
No one in this fair new world can talk us through this situation
Speak in the garden
You burn down the trees
I'll leave out the teasin'
While you are down on one knee
Never is heavy
And heavy is fine
But only in the street man
You ate your words wrong this time
It's wicked where you tread
Shot an arrow in your head
Since the apple wasn't there, yeah.
Ripped apart by the crows and the vultures
Ignore me in the parking lot
I'm petrified by conversation.
It's wicked where you tread
They shot an arrow at your head
Since the apple wasn't there, yeah.
We're ripped apart by the crow and the vultures
Ignore me in the parking lot
I'm petrified by conversation.
I'm throwing away pictures
That I never should have taken in the first place
And it's cold in my apartment
As I'm changing all the colors
From the brightest reds to grays
Well, it's 3 o'clock on Monday morning
I'm just hoping you're not seeing his face
I've been getting calls in these hotel rooms
Long enough to know that it was him
That took my place
And I hope this makes you happy now
That the flame we had is burning out
And I hope you like your pictures facing down
As even broken hearts may have their doubts
And I'm burning all the letters
Hoping that I might forget her
And a bad taste that she left when she was leaving me
A life of barely breathing as she walked out of this place
And you dropped the note and we changed key
You changed yourself and I changed me
I really didn't see us singing through this
Then you screamed the bridge
And I cried the verse
And our chorus came out unrehearsed
Then you smiled the whole way through it
I guess maybe that's what's worse
And I hope this makes you happy now
That the flame we had is burning out
And I hope you like your pictures facing down
As even broken hearts may have their doubts
And I'm taking all of your memories off the shelf
And I don't need you or anybody else
So take a look at me
See what you want to see
When you get home
Take me home
I'd rather die than be with you
Take me home
You have a problem with the truth
Take me home
Because this happens every time I knew it would
I knew it would 
Take me home
I'd rather die than be with you
Take me home
You have a problem with the truth
Take me home
Because this happens every time I knew it would
I knew it would
And I hope this makes you happy now
That the flame we had is burning out
And I hope you like your pictures facing down
As even broken hearts may have their doubts
And I'm taking all of your memories off the shelf
And I don't need you or anybody else
So take a look at me
See what you want to see
When you get home
I like your twisted point of view, Mike 
I like your questioning eyebrows 
You've made it pretty clear what you like 
It's only fair to tell you now 
That I leave early in the morning 
And I won't be back till next year 
I see that kiss-me pucker forming 
But maybe you should plug it with a beer, cause 
Papa was a rodeo, Mama was a rock'n'roll band 
I could play guitar and rope a steer before I learned to stand 
Home was anywhere with diesel gas, love was a trucker's hand 
Never stuck around long enough for a one night stand 
Before you kiss me you should know 
Papa was a rodeo 
The light reflecting off the mirror ball 
Looks like a thousand swirling eyes 
They make me think I shouldn't be here at all 
You know, every minute someone dies 
What are we doing in this dive bar 
How can you live in a place like this 
Why don't you just get into my car 
And I'll take you away I'll take that kiss now, but 
Papa was a rodeo... 
And now it's 55 years later 
We've had the romance of the century 
After all these years wrestling gators 
I still feel like crying when I think of what you said to me 
Papa was a rodeo... 
Before you kiss me you should know Papa was a rodeo 
What a coincidence, your Papa was a rodeo too
"You know, those red moments where it's thin, like, pretty, early on, and... But then, simul- I also, like, include the... like the tinted blues"

Speeches won't be made today
Clocks will carry on
Flowers won't be left in parks
Work will still be done
People won't be dressed in black
Babies will be born
No flags will fly, the sun will rise
But we will know that you are gone
You who love to love and believed we can never give enough
It wakes me every single night
Thinking through the day
Did you stop at any time
Have doubts at any stage
Were you calm or were you numb
Or happy just to get it done
I've lived my life without regret
Until today
And you who love to love and believed we can never give enough
I didn't get to say goodbye
The day before the day
Was trying to get to work on time
That's why I turned away
And missed the most important thing
You ever tried to say
I've lived my life without regret
Until today
And you who love to love and believed we can never give enough
And you who hoped that underneath
We all felt the same
That was until the day before the day
The day before the day
The day before the day
The day before the day
The day before the day
The day before the day
The day before the day
The day before the day
A year ago today we stood
Above this same awakening world
I held you
You never wanted me to know
Another year ago today
Before this same awakening world
I held you
I never meant to let you go
There was a moment
There always is
When time stood still
And always was this
One endless moment
You turn in pain
And I always let you go
Over and over again
A year ago tonight we lay
Below this same remembering sky
I kissed you
You never wanted me to know
Another year ago tonight
Behind this same remembering sky
I kissed you
I never meant to let you go
Another moment
There always is
As time stands still
And always is this
One endless moment
You tell me all
And I hold you and I kiss you
And I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
I never let you go
I'm grindin' until I'm tired
They say you ain't grindin' until you die
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day
A life of the night
Dear Lord it took so many of my people,
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
What the hell am I doin' right?
What the hell am I doin' right?
I'm grindin' until I'm tired
They say if you ain't grindin' until you die 
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, 
A life of the night
Dear Lord you've took so many of my people, 
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
What the hell am I doing right?
Na na na na na it goes around the world, 
Na na na na na it goes around the world...
Instrumental
I know that you cannot be
Here
I know that you are not mine
Now
Looking out the window
At another window
I see toenails changing colors
Like the leaves of fall
If you often smile
But often don't
Smile
Which do you do more often
Smile, or not?
I dreamt a hydrant
Was covered in snow
A white light glowing below
I know that you cannot be
Here
I know that you are not mine
Now
Looking out the window
At another window
I see toenails changing colors
Like the leaves of fall
I heard a whisper on my shoulder
Pretending life is worth the fight
O can you hear the song of thunder
When fear strangles a soldier's pride
And on the surface of the waters
Will dance reflections of the fire in the night
I remember cheering from the towers
A face is smiling in the light
I remember the bells, the flowers
Those days are dying in the dark
Boy I was shaped for the fury
Now I pay the price
Of the human race's vice
And I was promised
The glorious ending of a knight
But the crown is out of sight
I'm slowly drifting into slumber
'Cause I have lost the force to fight
It's like a cold hand on my shoulder
I'll see you on the other side
And in the arms of endless anger
Will end the story of a soldier in the dark
Lying in my plastic bed
Thinkin' how things weren't so cool to me
My baby likes to shoot pool
I like lying naked in my bedroom
Tying on that dinosaur
Tonight it used to be so cool
Now I've got the needle
And I can't shake but I can't breathe
Take it away and I want more and more
One day I'm gonna lose the war
Lying in my plastic bed
Thinkin' how things weren't so cool to me
My baby likes to shoot pool
I like lying naked in my bedroom
Tying on that dinosaur
Tonight it used to be so cool
Now I've got the needle
And I can't shake
But I can't breathe
Take it away, I want more and more
One day I'm gonna lose the war
How can I go forward when I don't know which way I'm facing?
How can I go forward when I don't know which way to turn?
How can I go forward into something I'm not sure of?
Oh no, oh no 
How can I have feeling when I don't know if it's a feeling?
How can I feel something if I just don't know how to feel?
How can I have feelings when my feelings have always been denied?
Oh no, oh no 
You know life can be long
And you got to be so strong
And the world is so tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough 
How can I give love when I don't know what it is I'm giving?
How can I give love when I just don't know how to give?
How can I give love when love is something I ain't never had?
Oh no, oh no 
You know life can be long
You've got to be so strong
And the world she is tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough 
How can we go forward when we don't know which way we're facing?
How can we go forward when we don't know which way to turn?
How can we go forward into something we're not sure of?
Oh no, oh no
Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
You know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do
'Cause I love you
Oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone 
Regretting some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
Look both ways when you leave the building
The wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
While the children of makeshift hills
Let the code of silence repeat 16 times
When we get delayed can we cast a line towards anyone dismayed
Can we go it alone say say say
Caught me listening to water dripping
From those old lips to a town where its dry
When you leave don't say
That anyone here will be thinking in modern ways
Can we go it alone say say say
Look both ways when you leave the building
The wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
Here underwater we're down. Here underwater way down.
Instrumental
You can't be like me
But be happy that you can't
I see pain but I don't feel it
I am like the old tin man
I'm as worn as a stone
I keep it steady as I can
I see pain but I don't feel it
I am like the old tin man
I miss it
I miss it
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling
I used to fill the sky around
With happiness and joy
I had news to give the wind
To keep myself and heart employed
I felt people move around me
I felt loneliness and shame
Back then every day was different
Now each moment is the same
I miss it
I miss it
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling (X2)
The feeling of feeling
The wind upon my face
And caring what it brings this way
The feeling of feeling
The minutes pass away
And caring what I do with them
Baby bring me love or something else
And so it goes a man grows cold
Some would say a man grows strong
They say life only grows short
I say the road only grows long
But as long as there's a road
My feet will never touch the ground
And if you won't give my heart back
I've no need to stick around
I miss it
I miss it
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling (X2)
They call her Mississippi
But she don't flow to me
Spends her light on the Bayou
But she don't come to see
She's the one that makes my dreams
They call her Mississippi
But she don't flow to me 
The shape of her horizon
Makes the morning sun
When she puts her eyes on
Each and anyone
She's the one that makes me fall
Midnight moon shines through it all 
She's the one that makes me fall
Midnight moon shines through it all
She's the one that makes my dreams
They call her Mississippi
But she don't flow to me
They call her Mississippi
But she don't flow to me

Anger steaming up your glasses, you've been holding parties all your life.
Of course it's long gone down, you're still hanging around.
It's not over till it starts again.
Ha ha ha!
Hear me laughing! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha! It died out long ago.
Did you hear me laughing in your head, when I saw you stuck in a rut again?
Oh that drink went down smoothly, just like the one before the last you had.
Questions I have answered, you are still asking yourself again.
Passed-out in the gutter, worn-out in your head,
Your voices aren't clear enough after all.
Ha ha ha!
Hear me laughing! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha! It died out long ago.
Anger steaming up your glasses, you've been holding parties all your life.
Of course it's long gone down, you're still hanging around.
It's not over till you start again.
Ha ha ha!
Hear me laughing! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha! You died out long ago.
Looking in your eyes
Praising every moment because you're my only light
Reading the stares at your passion that bears me now
Shedding no little tears
The silence scares us more than leaving could
Come back
Please don't leave me now
I'll be all that you need in life
Because I can't live without you and
I know all that you need
I can give you everything
When you're so far you'll forget about me
Waiting by your side
Knowing every moment is closer to your flight
Upset with the past, but it's all that holds us now
Believing no lies, telling each other we'll be fine forever
Come back
Please don't leave me now
I'll be all that you need in life
Because I can't live without you and
I know all that you need
I can give you everything
When you're so far you'll forget about me
But I'll wait
I could never leave your beautiful eyes
I know you're sorry
I know what you must be going through
And I feel sorry for you
But please don't leave me now (x3)
Your baby doesn't love you anymore
Golden days before they end
Whisper secrets to the wind
Your baby won't be near you anymore
Tender nights before they fly
Send falling stars that seem to cry
Your baby doesn't want you anymore
It's over
It breaks your heart in two
To know she's been untrue
But oh, what will you do?
When she said to you
"There's someone new
We're through, we're through
It's over, it's over, it's over"
All the rainbows in the sky
Start to weep, then say goodbye
You won't be seeing rainbows anymore
Setting suns before they fall
Echo to you "that's all, that's all"
But you'll see lonely sunsets after all
It's over, it's over, it's over
It's over
If you want money in your pocket
You want a top hat on your head
Hot meal on your table
And a blanket on your bed,
Well today is grey skies,
Tomorrow is tears,
You'll have to wait
Till yesterday is here.
I'm a going to New York City
I'll be leaving on a train
If you wanna see me
Till I come back again,
Well today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears,
You'll have to wait till
Yesterday is here.
Now if wanna go
Where the rainbows end
You will have to say goodbye.
All our dreams come true
Baby up ahead,
In a town where your memories lie.
Now the road is out before me
And the moon is shining bright
What I want you to remember
As I disappear tonight
That today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait till
Yesterday is here.
I am feeling very warm right now
Please don't disappear
I am spacing out with you
You are the most beautiful entity that I've ever dreamed of
At night I will protect you in your dreams
I will be your angel
You worry so much about not having enough time together
It makes no difference to me
I would be happy with just one minute in your arms
Let's have an extended play together
You're telling me that we live too far to love each other
But our love can stretch farther than the eye can see
So how does this make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
Do you know that when you look at me, it is a salvation?
I've been waiting for you so long
I can drive on that road forever
I wish you could exist to live on my planet
Well it's very hard for me to say these things in your presence
So how does this make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
How does it make you feel?
So how does this make you feel?
Well, I really think you should quit smoking
I'm under attack again my dear
I'm in the way
Got no resolutions, no clever anecdotes to say
And still, if I yell at the top of my lungs
Will it be the same
I'd fly you a flag, I'd bury this pen into my veins
I want to feel through you tonight
But I won't make you, I won't make you
The telephone number I got from you says nobody's home 
The best thing I can think to do right now is leave it alone
And you had an apology in your mailbox since last July
It's funny when you find the words to say
You find no reply
I want to feel through you tonight
But I won't make you, I won't make you
Scream my name just one more time
But I won't make you, I won't make you
And it's been hours now, to be here like this
And just to lay you down
And just to taste your lips
And just to keep me up, God I'm so tired of sleeping
And just to lay inside you, and just to know this feeling
I want to feel through you tonight
But I won't make you, I won't make you
Scream my name just one more time
But I won't make you, I won't make you
No one's picking up the phone
Guess it's me and me
And this little masochist
She's ready to confess
All the things that I never thought
That she could feel and
Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay? Are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
And I thought I wouldn't have to be
With you as something new
Sometimes I breathe you in
And I know you know
And sometimes you take a swim
Found your writing on my wall
If my heart's soaking wet
Boy, your boots can leave a mess
Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay? Are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
And I thought you wouldn't have to keep
With me hiding
Thought I knew myself so well
All the dolls I had
Took my leather off the shelf
Your apocalypse was fab
For a girl who couldn't choose between
The shower or the bath
And I thought I wouldn't have to be
With you a magazine
No one's picking up the phone
Guess it's clear he's gone
And this little masochist
Is lifting up her dress
Guess I thought I could never feel
The things I feel and
Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you gay? Are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
Hey Jupiter
Nothing's been the same
So are you safe now we're through?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
Hey Jupiter
Hey now, take your pills, and
Hey now, make your breakfast
Hey now, comb your hair and off to work
Crash land, no illusions
No collision, no intrusion
My imagination runs away
I know, I know, I know what I am chasing
I know, I know, I know that this is changing me
I am flying on a star into a meteor tonight
I am flying on a star, star, star
I will make it through the day
And then the day becomes the night
I will make it through the night
Hey now, take the U-Bahn
Five stops, change the station
Hey now, don't forget that change will save you
Hey now, count a thousand, million people, that's astounding
Chasing through the city with their stars on bright
I know, I know, I know what I am chasing
I know, I know, I know that this is changing me
I am flying on a star into a meteor tonight
I am flying on a star, star, star
I will make it through the day
And then the day becomes the night
I will make it through the night
I don't mind repeating
I am not complete
I have never been the gifted type
Hey man, tell me something
Are you off to somewhere?
Do you want to go with me tonight?
I know, I know, I know that this is changing
We walk the streets to feel the ground
I'm chasing: Überlin
I am flying on a star into a meteor tonight
I am flying on a star, star, star
I will make it through the day
And then the day becomes the night
I will make it through the night
Beyond love
The first thing that I do before I get into your house
I'm gonna tear off all the petals from the rose that's in your mouth
Beyond love
You wanted to find Elvis and I didn't understand
They take the simple things inside you
And put nightmares in your hands
Beyond love
This man comes to me
Heartbreak did this
He was made to believe
That he should live without it
All I know's what I see
No change in his
Visions born in the dreams
Of a world left without it
We really wanna know
We really do agree
We really do agree
We really wanna know
The last thing that she sees before they turn off all the lights
Was there a man up in the corner with the spiders made of light
We really wanna know (beyond love)
All I know's what I see
And I can't live without this
Could you ever believe (beyond love)
I really wanna know
I really wanna know
Winter blues, no love for you
Seasons change in a gothic way
10, 000 lux to lift us up
In these winter nights if I'm wandering all alone
I'll turn on my S.A.D. light
I'll turn on my S.A.D. light
I'll turn on my S.A.D. light
I'll turn on my S.A.D. light
Winter blues, no love for you
Seasons change in a gothic way
10, 000 lux to lift us up
In these winter nights if I'm wandering all alone
I'll turn on my S.A.D. light
I'll turn on my S.A.D. light
I'll turn on my S.A.D. light
I'll turn on my S.A.D. light
As I'm staring at Alpha Centauri
All I can see is low, it's glow seems so far
How did I get to this point of things playing
So heavy on my heart, heart?
Twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
I'll turn on my S.A.D. light
I'll turn on my S.A.D. light
I'll turn on my S.A.D. light
I'll turn on my S.A.D. light
Taken in context
It's not a bad thing
But when you start to pick it apart
It gets so depressing
It's that sorta thing that makes you think too much
It's that sorta thing that makes you lose your objectivity
So if you made it
Just be glad that you did and stay there
If you ever feel loved or needed
Remember that you're one of the lucky ones
And if it's over
Just remember what I told ya
It was bound to happen so just
Keep movin on
There's no perfect endings
You peel back the layers
Get down to the inside
But some times you lose sight
Of what it was you were trying to find
It's that sorta thing that makes you think too much
It's that sorta thing that makes you lose your objectivity
So if you made it
Just be glad that you did and stay there
If you ever feel loved or needed
Remember that you're one of the lucky ones
And if it's over
Just remember what I told ya
It was bound to happen so just
Keep movin on
There's no perfect endings
No perfect endings
I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With dripping peaches, I'm camera ready
Almost all the time
But I still get lonely
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying if I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying (yeah)
For something real
That I've been dying for something real
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine
But you still can find me if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines with the daisies
Feeling hazy in the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying if I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying (yeah)
For something real
That I've been dying for something real
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying if I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal
You don't know what love is
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you had to lose
You don't know what love is
You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped you're heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is
Do you know how lost hearts fear
The thought of reminiscing
And how lips tasting of tears
Loose the taste for kissing
You don't know how hearts yearn
For love that cannot live yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
How could you know what love is
It's just like you to contest
Wearing like a label on your breast
Don't you see what this takes of me?
A certain callousness complies
With your charm and in your pride
A hopeful look draped in despise
I want to give you whatever you need
What is it you need?
Is it what I need?
I want to give you whatever you need
What is it you need?
Is it within me?
It's hard to explain how I am getting by on so little from you
It's hard to believe that I would let myself get so wrapped into you
There's got to be something that would be worthwhile for me to give to you
We need a connection but you seem to push me far away from you
From you, from you
The harder I push the further I fall
Well you don't mind me being headstrong
But you don't want to sing along
Maybe it's trite but I can always, always, always be wrong
It's just like you to contest
Wearing like a label on your breast
Don't you see what this takes of me?
A certain callousness complies
With your charm and in your pride
A hopeful look draped in despise
I want to give you whatever you need
What is it you need?
Is it what I need?
I want to give you whatever you need
What is it you need?
Is it within me?
It's hard to explain how I am getting by on so little from you
It's hard to believe that I would let myself get so wrapped into you
There's got to be something that would be worthwhile for me to give to you
We need a connection but you seem to push me far away from you
From you, from you
The harder I push the farther I fall
Well you don't mind me being headstrong
But you don't want to sing along
Maybe it's trite but I can always, always, always be wrong
Be wrong
Be wrong
Trying not to be
Trying not to be
Trying not to be
Trying not to be wrong
Well, she's up against the register with an apron and a spatula
Yesterday's deliveries, tickets for the bachelors
She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes
Well, it's just an invitation to the blues
And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore
You wonder if she might be single, she's alone and likes to mingle
Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue
She said "How you gonna like 'em, over medium or scrambled?"
You say "Anyway's the only way", be careful not to gamble
On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting outta here
It's a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes
This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues
But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java
It's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers
Mercy mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey
But a broken-down jalopy of a man I left behind
And a dream that I was chasing and a battle with booze
And an open invitation to the blues
But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candy-apple Caddy
And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things
He probably left her for a socialite and he didn't love her 'cept at night
And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared
So they took the registration and the car keys and her shoes
And left her with an invitation to the blues
'Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight, good evening
You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while
Get me a room at the Squire, the filling station's hiring
And I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose?
Got a crazy sensation, go or stay? now I gotta choose
And I'll accept your invitation to the blues
Imagining all the drama like a film
It runs in my mind all the hard times how it turns
Imagining you there thinking of your future
And of your past and new walls painted
Your eyes look low
And the ticking of the clocks too slow
Seasons stormy weather
When it ends
We will stay warm together
Seasons stormy weather
When it ends
We will stay warm together
No distance can separate
Imagine us combined light up the room electrify
Our love could be so divine
We'll make rainbows at night
And when it's dark we'll be light
We'll be light
Stormy weather
When it ends
We will stay warm together
Seasons stormy weather
When it ends
We will stay warm together
We will stay warm together
We will stay warm together
I've been waiting up for you to rescue me,
To come around and cover everything.
Relying on my best memories,
To breathe for me, breathe for me'
So much better than all of this, all of this...
I'm tired of singing all the sad songs in my head,
But I can't find enough of anything to drown out what you said.
And sometimes I find I catch myself letting you back in
And I'm so tired of singing all the sad songs in my head.
And I can still smell summer on your skin,
And I can still remember giving in.
Wrapped all up in your hips, and in your sheets,
It felt great falling, great falling...
So much better than all of this, all of this...
Tired of singing all the sad songs in my head,
But I can't find enough of anything to drown out what you said.
And sometimes I find I catch myself letting you back in,
I'm so tired of singing all the sad songs in my head.
I feel so faded, so far gone...
Nothing surprises me anymore... (x2)
I'm not much better now, now
Tired of singing all the sad songs in my head,
But I can't find enough of anything to drown out what you said.
And sometimes I find I catch myself letting you back in,
I'm so tired of singing all the sad songs in my head.
Sad songs in my head'
I'm so tired...
I search in snow, in vain
For your footsteps trail
I have to kiss them
With my scalding tears
Until I see the ground
Bury me under ice
Smother me under the eyes
And snow
Please, extinguish me
And you said it would be funny
To keep me hanging in suspense,
Then I'd run over to your house
And I'd scale the chain link fence
That borders your back yard
And that I'd climb through your window
And I'd whisper that I love you
As you fall out of your clothes
And we'd lay there in the darkness
Like the dream of you I had
Where we captured all the fireflies
And we knew what time we had
Could be counted on our fingertips
That almost made you cry
You let me hold you tightly
As we said all our goodbyes
May I say I loved you more
May I say I loved you more
And It must have been an hour
That I clutched you in my arms
And I must of said the the right things
Because you instantly felt warm
And you heard my heart stop beating
And you wanted not to cry
As your sympathetic whispers
They told a tale of bad goodbyes
And you swore you say me laughing
And I swore I saw you smile
And this time we spent together
Has got to last us quite awhile
As I take this piece of you with me
I'll carry it to my grave
Knowing that for someone you're an angel sent to save
(Keep breathing my angel, if you go down I go down with you, keep breathing, just keep breathing)
May I say I loved you more
(Keep breathing my angel, if you go down I go down with you, keep breathing, just keep breathing)
May I say I loved you more
Lets drink to the memories that we shared
Down one to all the hopes and cares
Here's two for being unaware, that you're gone
Because before too long you'll be a memory
Lets drink to the memories that we shared
(Before too long you'll be a memory)
Down one to all the hopes and cares
(Because before too long you'll be a memory)
Here's two for being unaware
(I said before too long you'll be a memory)
That you're gone
I said before too long you'll be a memory
Home now, end of the night
It's colder to turn on your side
And I know you're up in two hours
We didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow
So don't ruin now.
How we gonna move together? Just come closer
If we don't move together, just come closer
How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace between the sheets
And I creep in, everything's loud
I'm sorry for walking you now
And we argue the tiniest thing
We didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow
So I'm done whispering, done whispering.
How we gonna move together? Just come closer
If we don't move together, just come closer
How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace between the sheets.
So maybe don't give me cold shoulder
Before you go turn around, let me hold you
Let me sit in the dark of the morning
Yeah, it's more one thing now
How we gonna move together? Just come closer
If we don't move together, come closer
How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace, just keeping the peace
Just keeping the peace between these sheets.
No one seems to care anymore
(As) I wander through this night all alone
No one feels the pain I have inside
Looking at this world through my eyes
No one really cares where I go
Searching to feel warmth forever more
The wheels of life they turn without me
Now you are gone... eternally
No...
Don't leave me here
The dream carries (me) on
Inside
I know...
It's not too late
Lost moments blown away
Tonight
Mankind, with your heresy
Can't you see that this is killing me
There's no one in this life
To be here with me at my side
Harold
Walks down
Any street
Of this town
Both crier
And witness
The sun drops
The clouds shift
His legs twitch
The clocks chime
On the cafes
Pharmacies
And dime stores
In bar rooms
He sits all alone
Erupting
In his head it's like the weather
In his head it's like the weather
In his head it's like the weather
Back and forth, it's like the weather
Back and forth, it's like the weather
Back and forth, it's like the weather
When it rains it pours down
Weatherman
Do you feel
Do you feel
Stormy inside
Of your veins?
I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet mother love
I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside
I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're gonna give me all your sweet mother love
My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet mother love
I feel numb wanna hold you
Wanna tell you that you'll be all right
Sad news from today's call
All the pictures are all in my mind
I miss you now
Older we're getting older
Are all my old friends gonna leave me and die
I'm helpless, it's gonna get us, before it gets us
I wanna kiss you goodbye
I miss you now
Feel numb wanna hold you
Wanna tell you that you'll be all right
Helpless it's gonna get us, before it gets us
I wanna kiss you goodbye
I miss you now
Moody (It's got me) x 7
Baby, why'd you have to leave?
Something up your sleeve?
Baby, I find it hard to breath
Moody (It's got me) x 8
Baby, why'd you have to leave?
Why'd you have to break free?
Why'd you have to go?
Moody (It's got me) x 7
Baby, why'd you have to run? 
Looking after number one?
Baby, why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to phone? (??)
Something you're afraid to show? (??)
Someone else you'd rather phone? (??)
Moody (It's got me) Mooday (It's got me)...
How do I say goodbye
To what we had
The good times that made us laugh
Outweighed the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday
I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through
If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday
There was a time, dark and divine
Exciting and new, shameful and true
Free to explore, we had it all
Towering trust, insatiable lust
Clouding the truth, both of us knew
This sordid affair is ending in tears
Yet we would go on, knowing the wrong
Until the day it was taken away
Oh, all our love fell down to Earth
Here, broken and cold, with great remorse
Before a while it all made sense
It might have been just a dark pretense
But you had me and I loved it
To be with you, to be the one
To live a lie, it really got me all excited
I felt wanted
Then in the night, the sorrowing sigh
Was taken away, deliverance came
Fell from the sky, heaven replied
Salvation in streams, silent and clean
All that we were, all that we knew
Faded away with tears in the rain
Yes all that we were, all that we knew
Is fading away like tears in the rain
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
I went to bed, I was thinking about you
It ain?�t the same since I'm living without you
All the memories are getting colder
All the things that I wanna do over
I went to bed, I was thinking about you
I wanna talk and laugh like we used to
When I see you in my dreams at night
It's so real but it?�s in my mind
And now, I guess,
This is as good as it gets
Don't wake me
?�Cause I don't wanna leave this dream
Don't wake me
?�Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough
When it's you I'm dreaming of
I don't wanna wake up
I went to bed, I was thinking about you
And how it felt when I finally found you
It's like a movie playing over in my head
Don't wanna look, ?�cause i know how it ends
All the words that I said that I wouldn't say
All the promises I made that I wouldn't break
It?�s last call, last song, last dance
?�Cause I can't get you back, can't get a second chance
And now, I guess
This is as good as it gets
Don't wake me
?�Cause I don't wanna leave this dream
Don't wake me
?�Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough 
When it's you I'm dreaming of
I don't wanna wake up
Don't wake me
We're together just you and me
Don't wake me
?�Cause we're happy like we used to be
I know, I've gotta let you go
But I don't want to be alone
These dreams of you keep on growing stronger
It ain?�t a lot but it?�s all I have
Nothing to do but keep sleeping longer
Don't wanna stop, cause I want you back
Don't wake me
?�Cause I don't wanna leave this dream
Don't wake me
?�Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough
When it's you I'm dreaming of
I don't wanna wake up
Don't wake me
We're together just you and me
Don't wake me
?�Cause we're happy like we used to be
I know, I've gotta let you go
But I don't want to be alone
I went to bed, I was thinking about you
?�Cause I don't wanna leave this dream
Ain?�t the same since I'm living without you
'Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough
I know, I've gotta let you go
But I don't want to wake up
Viktor was born in the spring of '44
And never saw his father anymore
A child of sacrifice, a child of war
Another son who never had
A father after Leningrad
Went off to school and learned to serve the state
Followed the rules and drank his vodka straight
The only way to live was drown the hate
A Russian life was very sad
And such was life in Leningrad
I was born in '49
A cold war kid in McCarthy time
Stop 'em at the 38th Parallel
Blast those yellow reds to hell
And cold war kids were hard to kill
Under their desk in an air raid drill
Haven't they heard we won the war
What do they keep on fighting for?
Viktor was sent to some Red Army town
Served out his time, became a circus clown
The greatest happiness he'd ever found
Was making Russian children glad
And children lived in Leningrad
But children lived in Levittown
And hid in the shelters underground
Until the Soviets turned their ships around
And tore the Cuban missiles down
And in that bright October sun
We knew our childhood days were done
And I watched my friends go off to war
What do they keep on fighting for?
And so my child and I came to this place
To meet him eye to eye and face to face
He made my daughter laugh, then we embraced
We never knew what friends we had
Until we came to Leningrad
I show the scars of every fear and doubt
I hurt myself to let the darkness out
Out
The days go by and nothing brings me joy
The glow was strong when I was a boy
But it's gone
And the glow
It goes
So slow
It goes
Cracks appear and passion slips away
Colours fade and turn to shades of grey
Fade away
And the glow
It goes
So slow
It goes
If you knew the man I used to be
Please hold me under the sea
Or scratch my arms till they bleed
Save me
Will you help me to feel the glow?
And the glow
It goes
So slow
It goes
Speak to me
For I have seen
Your waning smile
Your scars concealed
So far from home, do you know you're not alone
Sleep tonight
Sweet summerlight
Scattered yesterdays, the past is far away
How fast time passed by
The transience of life
Those wasted moments won't return
And we will never feel again
Beyond my dreams
Ever with me
You flash before my eyes, a final fading sigh
But the sun will (always) rise
And tears will dry
Of all that is to come, the dream has just begun
And time is speeding by
The transience of life
Those wasted moments won't return
And we will never feel again
Every attempt to...
Is filled with holes.
Reads like a polygraph I'm told.
I'm not bitter anyway.
Let it go.
I never sleep still
Lest I forget.
Tied down by handicaps instead.
I'm not bitter anyway,
But I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Sing a long goodnight,
Forfeit any fight.
Refuse to rest assured.
It comes with no reply.
Hold on too tight.
I hang on every word.
If it all ended tonight,
You know that I wouldn't mind.
Back to the good old times
Before it won.
If it all ended tonight,
You know that I wouldn't mind.
Back to the good old times
Before it won.
Sing a long goodnight,
Forfeit any fight.
Refuse to rest assured.
It comes with no reply.
Hold on too tight.
I hang on every word.
I've got a dying urge to feel the way you do
Too close for comfort, bed and breakfast in a spoon
The shortest breath of your young life
A long walk home on Friday night
You made one last stop at the store
So close to perfect, swear to hell, thought it was you
This bouncing baby boy's now turning baby blue
I've got your pictures on my walls
I've got a long list of calls I must make
To your existing family
You had nine lives and one by one you chewed 'em up
Your final coffin nail's been driven far too much
This won't take long, you said, I'm not going far
Go wait in the car
I often wonder what it feels like to be you
A mess like this stuck on your hands with crazy glue
Ran out of time, no kiss goodbye
Wish I could learn to let this sleeping dog die
Without lying to myself
You had nine lives and one by one you chewed 'em up
Your final coffin nail's been driven far too much
This won't take long, you said, I'm not going far
Go wait in the car
You had nine lives and one by one you chewed 'em up
Your final coffin nail's been driven far too much
This won't take long, you said, I'm not going far
Go wait in the car
Don't despair, you're there,
From beginning to middle to end.
Don't despair, 
You're there through my wasted days,
You're there through my wasted nights.
Oh despair, 
You've always been there, you're always been.
You're there through my wasted years.
Through all my lonely fears, no tears.
Will run through my fingers, tears,
They're stinging my eyes, no tears.
If it's all in my head, there's nothing to fear,
Nothing to fear inside.
Through the darkness and the light
Some sun had gotta rise.
My sun is your sun,
Their sun is our sun.
My sun is your sun,
Their sun is our sun.
Oh despair, you were there through my wasted days,
You're there through my wasted nights,
You're there through my wasted years,
You're there through my wasted life!
You've always been there, you're alaways been.
You're there through my wasted years.
Through all my lonely fears, no tears.
Will run through my fingers, tears,
They're stinging my eyes, no tears.
If it's all in my head, there's nothing to fear,
Nothing to fear inside.
Through the darkness and the light
Some sun had gotta rise.
My sun is your sun,
Their sun is our sun.
Sun has gotta rise.
My sun is your sun,
Their sun is our sun.
Sun has gotta rise.

Who said that I wasn't right?
I've lived for years without a life
Don't have a soul on my side
Still ridiculed despite how hard that I have tried
Don't take me under your wing
I don't need a hand, don't need anything
I've got a roof over my head
As if I'd rather be alone with me instead
Close yet far
Drop me a line and tell me how the hell you are
And I'll tip my hat to those who can't believe it's me
Though I never never never ever wanted this to be
I can hear the sounds of the city
Sunrise and set are the same to me
A hesitating pulse is good company
And my reflection offers no apology
But who said that I wasn't right?
I've lived for years without a life
Don't have a soul on my side
Still ridiculed despite how hard that I have tried
Close yet far
Drop me a line and tell me how the hell you are
And I'll tip my hat to those who can't believe it's me
Though I never never never ever wanted this to be
Close yet far
Drop me a line and tell me how the hell you are
I'll think of days when there was something to believe
Though I never never never ever wanted this to be
Side by side in silence
They pass away the day
So comfortable, so habitual...
And so nothing left to say
Nothing left to say
Nothing left to say
Side by side in silence
His thoughts echo round
He looks up at the sky...
She looks down at the ground
Stares down at the ground
Stares down at the ground
Side by side in silence
They wish for different worlds
She dreams him as a boy...
And he loves her as a girl
Loves her as a girl...
And side by side in silence
Without a single word...
It's the loudest sound
It's the loudest sound...
It's the loudest sound I ever heard
Come upstairs and I'll show you where all my
Where my demons hide from you
Just look at who I have become I am so ashamed
You were the one that made me feel the way I do
You broke me and taught me
To truly hate myself
Unfold me and teach me how to be
Like somebody else
And I felt strong enough
I was discovered by the love
I had been waiting for so long
You told me none of that was real
I can not hide how low I feel
To know that you were never wrong
You broke me and taught me
To truly hate myself
Unfold me and teach me
How to be like somebody else
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh eey yeah
You are lost and found
Falling out my babe
Broken down
Broken down
You broke me and taught me
To truly hate myself
Unfold me and teach me
How to be like somebody else
You broke me and taught me to
Truly hate myself
Unfold me and teach me
How to be like somebody else
Bring two prix fixe dinners up 
I'll unwrap the plastic cups 
It's just us my love 
It's just us my love 
I will make the room up nice 
Put your insides all on ice 
It was real true love 
It was real true love 
Close all the windows 
Put signs on the handles 
And strip down to my dun-dun-duns 
You have gone so far 
You have gone so far 
And tonight 
Its just me and the minibar 
Candles from the walmart that 
Every city's got to have 
That I bought last night 
That I bought last night 
I was so excited to 
Do such normal things with you 
When you left last night 
With your toothbrush dry 
No such details will spoil my plan 
That is the kind of girl I am 
Ha ha ha 
Can you hear room 'three eighteen' 
Man they're really happening 
They're a wild bunch 
They're a wild bunch 
But if they just knew 
What my night was coming to 
God would they vomit and run 
You have gone so far 
You have gone too far 
So tonight 
It's just me and the minibar 
Nobody else 
And I sing at the top of my lungs 
Happy birthday us 
Happy birthday us
Well, the night makes moves
And she shatters like broken glass
Better play it cool... better let it pass
Have you been screening your smokes?
And whispers in an all night bar
Better off as the fool
Than the owner of that kind of heart
They don't know you anyway
They don't know you and they don't watch you walk away
Just a nobody girl
With a radar to the scene
When the emptiness finds you
You find all the numbers you need
Say you follow your heart
Well, honey you're just being lost
You can follow your gut
But how much would it cost?
They don't know you anyway
They don't know you and they don't watch you walk away
You're nobody girl
You're nobody girl
You're a nobody, girl
You're nobody girl
You're nobody girl
You're a nobody, girl
The night plays games
And the people they come and go
Well, they trade in their places
For a late-night ride on your rodeo
If your horses could talk, I wonder if they would complain
I know they're rested and ready
They've been going nowhere for days
They don't know you anyway
They don't know you, they don't even mind the weight
'Cause you're nobody girl
You're nobody girl
You're a nobody, girl
You're nobody girl
You're nobody girl
You're a nobody, girl
Nobody girl
You're nobody girl
Nobody girl
So you sailed away into a gray sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Nothing's quite the same now I just say your name now
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had
So you stole my world now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonely
Send it in a letter, make yourself feel better
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't need me back
You're just the best I ever had
And it may take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I run away and hide
And I may find in time that you were always right
You're always right
So you sailed away into a gray sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
What was it you wanted? Could it be I'm haunted?
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
I don't want you back
You're just the best I ever had
The best I ever had, the best I ever
If you respect me, don't protect me
You can tell me, I can handle it
Stop pretending, 'cause we're going down
If you let go, then just let go
It's disrespectful how you've handled this
Never ending kind of run around
I lie to my heart 'cause I thought you felt it
You cannot have fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't want to
Don't act like I mean nothing
If you're gonna then you better
Unkiss me, untouch me, untear this heart
I'm missing just one thing, a brand new start
Can't erase this, can't delete this
I don't need this, I can handle it
I just feel it, that you're over us
Oh, if I wait here, if I see you
It won't matter, what's the point of this?
We're in pieces 'cause you're over us
I lie to my heart 'cause I thought you felt it
You cannot have fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't want to
Don't act like I mean nothing
If you're gonna, well then you better
Unkiss me, untouch me, untear this heart, yeah yeah
I'm missing just one thing, a brand new start
So unkiss me, unkiss me, yeah
So baby let go, got to let go
It's disrespectful, I can't handle this
Never ending kind of run around
Unkiss me, untouch me, untear this heart, oh no no no
I'm missing just one thing, a brand new start, yeah
So unkiss me, so unkiss me, yeah
Unkiss me
I watch you sleep, you look so peaceful
You look so vulnerable, I feel scared for you
To me you're precious, may you always
Shine like stars, shine like stars, shine like stars
I watch you dance, you look so happy
Lost in the moment of abandon, you're set free
To me you're precious, may you always
Shine like stars, shine like stars, shine like stars
Shine like stars, shine like stars
Shine like stars, shine like stars, shine like stars
I'm not sure why it always goes downhill
Why broken cisterns never could stay filled
I've spent ten years singing gravity away
But the water keeps on falling from the sky
And here tonight while the stars are blacking out
With every hope and dream I've ever had in doubt
I've spent ten years trying to sing these doubts away
But the water keeps on falling from my eyes
And heaven knows... heaven knows
I tried to find a cure for the pain
Oh my Lord, to suffer like you do...
It would be a lie to run away
So blood is fire pulsing through our veins 
We're either riders, or fools behind the reins
I've spent ten years trying to sing it all away
But the water keeps on falling from my tries
And heaven knows... heaven knows
I tried to find a cure for the pain
Oh my Lord, to suffer like you do...
It would be a lie to run away
A lie to run
It would be a lie
It would be a lie to run away
It keeps on falling
It keeps on falling
It keeps on falling
It keeps on falling
The water keeps on falling from my eyes
And heaven knows... heaven knows
I tried to find a cure for the pain
Oh my Lord, to suffer like you do...
It would be a lie to run away
It would be a lie to run away
It would be a lie to run away
Well the day begins, you don't want to live, 'cause you can't believe in the one you're with
'Cause you know her tricks and you know her past, when she makes a face you just have to laugh
And you feel like such a know-it-all when you only want just a tiny girl
And you hope she'll sing
So you turn around toward the tiny girls who have got no tricks, who have got no past
Yeah, that's what you think, and you hope she'll sing
But she sings of greed, like a young banshee, and she wants for this, and she wants for that
Ah, what did you think?
I'm gonna tell you
What you need to hear
And I'm a little too late
By three or four years
And it may not make much sense
Now that we are apart
But I'm going to stop pretending
That I didn't break your heart
You see I never thought enough of myself
To realize
That losing me could mean something
Like the tears in your eyes
And I want to tell you I'm sorry
And it's too late to start
But I'm going to stop pretending 
That I didn't break your heart
And it's Christmas Eve
Years down the line
Sitting here wishing I'd treated you better
When you were mine
And I have no way of knowing
Where you are
But I'm going to stop pretending 
That I didn't break your heart
I didn't mean to hurt you
I didn't know what I was doing
But I know what I have done
You might be just what I need,
No I would not change a thing.
Been dreaming of this, so long.
But we only exist in this song.
The thing is I'm not worth the sorrow
And if you come and meet me tomorrow.
I will hold you down, fold you in,
Deep, deep, deep in the fiction we live.
I break in two over you,
I break in two and if a piece of you dies.
Autumn, I will bring you back to life,
Of course I see you, I do.
I know it's hard to tell how mixed up you feel
Hoping what you need is behind every door
Each time you get hurt, I don't want you to change
Because everyone has hopes, you're human after all
The feeling sometimes, wishing you were someone else
Feeling as though you never belong
This feeling is not sadness, this feeling is not joy
I truly understand. Please, don't cry now
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here
I don't want you to hate;
For all the hurt that you feel,
The world is just illusion, trying to change you
Being like you are
Well this is something else, who would comprehend?
But some that do, lay claim
Divine purpose blesses them
That's not what I believe, and it doesn't matter anyway
A part of your soul ties you to the next world
Or maybe to the last, but I'm still not sure
But what I do know, is to us the world is different
As we are to the world but I guess you would know that
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel
The world is just illusion trying to change you
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you please, oh please don't leave here
I don't want you to change;
For all the hurt that you feel,
This world is just illusion, always trying to change you
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel
The world is just illusion trying to change you
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you please, oh please don't leave here
I don't want you to change;
For all the hurt that you feel,
This world is just illusion, always trying to change you
If you're looking for love 
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else
I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what I've seen in movies
Come to find out it's not like that at all
You see real life's much different
I don't want to see you go
I only want to see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see you there
We cried we lied
Cannot pretend to change the fact
That what we had could make us feel alive again
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope
Tell me that now is not the end
If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else
I've turned into someone else
I used to believe love conquers all
Cause that's what I felt when you held me
I thought you'd catch me if I fall
And fill me up when I'm empty
I don't want to see you go
I only want to see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see you there
We cried we lied
Cannot pretend to change the fact
That what we had could make us feel alive again
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope
Tell me that now is not the end
If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else
Love is patient
Love is selfless
Love is hopeful
Love is kind
Love is jealous
Love is selfish
Love is helpless
Love is blind
Love is patient
Love is selfless
Love is hopeful
Love is kind
Love is jealous
Love is selfish
Love is helpless
Love is blind
Love is patient
Love is selfless
Love is hopeful
Love is kind
Love is jealous
Love is selfish
Love is helpless
Love is blind
I've turned into someone else
I can't believe my hearts still pounding
I can't believe how close I came
And meanwhile heavens falling
Fallen angels flown away
And that'll be me someday
With stolen wings and evil ways
Straight south with the keys to the pearly gates
Hard to believe my heart stopped pounding
Hard to believe I played this game
My worst nightmares became real
I got so scared that I forgot my name
And that'll be me someday
With stolen wings and evil ways
Straight south with the keys to the pearly gates
There I was in uniform
Looking at the art teacher
I was just a girl then
Never have I loved since then
He was not that much older than I was
He had taken our class to the Metropolitan Museum
He asked us what our favorite work of art was
And never could I tell it was him
Oh I wish I could tell him
Oh I wish I could have told him
I looked at the Rubens and Rembrandts
I liked the John Singer Sargents
He told me he liked Turner
Never have I turned since then
No never have I turned to any other man
All this having been said
I married an executive company head
All this having been done
A Turner
I own one
And here I am in this uniformish pant-suit sort of thing
Thinking of the art teacher
I was just a girl then
Never have I loved since then
No, never have I loved any other man
As I drift away... far away from you,
I feel all alone in a crowded room,
Thinking to myself
"There's no escape from this
Fear
Regret
Loneliness... "
Visions of love and hate
A collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter
Echoes of silent cries
I wish I didn't know now what
I never knew then...
Flashback
Memories punish me once again.
Sometimes I remember all the pain
That I have seen.
Sometimes I wonder what might
Have been...
Visions of love and hate
A collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter
Echoes of silent cries
And sometimes I despair
At who I've become
I have to come to terms
With what I've done
The bittersweet taste of fate
We can't outrun the past
Destined to find an answer
A strength I never lost
I know there is a way,
My future is not set,
For the tide has turned
But still I never learned to live
Without regret.
Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking about everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
Because nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothing's going to change, not for me and you
That before I knew how much I had to lose
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door
And I'd say
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I let you walk
But I take it all back now
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you'd want to see now
Baby, what about the ending
I thought you'd be here by now
Thought you'd be here by now
So I've betrayed self
So I've betrayed you
So what now?
So what do we do?
Pushing you away
Pushing you away
Pushing you away
Away from me
Pushing you away
Pushing you away
Pushing you away
Away from me
So I'm, I'm confused
So you're not amused
So I'm feeling used
So what do we do?
Pushing you away
Pushing you away
Pushing you away
Away from me
Pushing you away
Pushing you away
Pushing you away
Away from me
Empty inside
I'm dying, I'm crying
She makes me bad
Betrays my head
Empty inside
I'm dying, I'm crying
She makes me bad
Nothing seems to show
The feelings come and go
And everything's so strange
The people never change
Am I only
Only one of you
Emotions never known
They talk though what you show
So easy you let go
What's left is torn and thrown
Am I only
Only one of you
You turn into a song
And everything feels wrong
There's so much more to see
But lost is meant to be
Am I only
Only one of you
Am I the only lonely one of you
Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not
Ready for you
Every part
Of my aching heart
Needs you more
Than the angels do
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Going, girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Going, girl?
If you could
I know that you'd stay
We both know
Things don't work that way
I promised I
Wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin
And my voice gets thin
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Going, girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Going, girl?
Honestly I know where you're goin'
And baby you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't
See you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Going, girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Going, girl?
With her army complete
She can take me apart
Off through the earth
Then back in the car
'Cause once you begin
You're not going to stop
I know how you are
Holy star
[?] You're not going to stop
Holy star
I know how you are
(?)
On the day that you were born
They built an empire off a scream
I can't explain
Endlessly they'll set you free
Give you reason to believe
This empty place
I may seem unafraid
And I may seem unashamed
But I will be special k
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even when their numbers draw you out
Everything I want is free
'Til the end
'Til the end
'Til the end
I'm gonna love you 101 percent
I'm gonna love you 'til this ends
Take a chance if you should go
Face upon your happy home
The scanners wait
Selfishly they might concede
You were always on your own
You can't escape
I may seem unafraid
And I may seem unashamed
But I will be special k
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even when their numbers draw you out
Everything I want is free
You're not me and never ever will you be
I'm gonna find you and never run again
I'm gonna find you 'til the end
'Til the end
'Til the end
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even when their numbers call you out
Everything I want is free
Free you're free with me
You're free with me
Now you sit there thinking feeling insecure
The mocking court jester claims there is no proven cure
Go back to your chamber, your eyes upon the wall
'Cause you got no one to listen, you got no one to call
And you think I'm curious
Drifting, drowning in a purple sea of doubt
You wanna hear she loves you
But the words don't fit the mouth
You're a loser, a rebel, a cause without
But don't think me callous
Dancing Rosemary, disappearing sister Ruth
It's just your yellow appetite
That has you choking on the truth
You gave in, you gave out, outlived your dream of youth
And I can't get jealous
So go on, you'll continue with your nose so open wide
Knocking on that door that says,
"Hurry. Come inside."
But don't bother to buy insurance 'cause you've already died
And you can't be serious
I saw my reflection in my father's final tears
The wind was slowly melting
San Francisco disappears
Acid heads, unmade bed, and you Woodward world queers
I know you're lonely
I know you're lonely
I know you're lonely
I know you're lonely
I know you're lonely
Thanks for your time
And you can thank me for mine
And after that's said
Forget it
Bag it, man
(Okay)
Did you hear the news about Edward?
On the back of his head
He had another face
Was it a woman's face
Or a young girl?
They said to remove it would kill him
So poor Edward was doomed
The Face could laugh and cry
It was his devil twin
At night she spoke to him
Of things heard only in Hell
They were impossible to separate
Chained together for life
Finally a bell tolled his doom
He took a suite of rooms
And hung himself and her
By the balcony irons
Some still believe he was freed from her
But I knew her too well
I say she drove him to suicide
And took Poor Edward to Hell
Bros before hos,
Disagree on the sidelines.
Fight for a fee.
The man needs a maid.
The maid needs a maid.
Bros before hos
Is a rule, read the guidelines
You trouble me.
Your breasts heave when you sing,
Your mouth should be working for me
For free
Sewing up the fold,
'Cause I've been laid up.
Would you put on the fire for me,
Draw the bath and remind me to eat?
You won't need a real job.
You won't need a real job because I would love to pay for you.
You could be a good wife to me.
I would love to pay for you.
You are the maid for me.
Here we are again with handguns for hearts
They had a master plan, wanted to tear us apart
Nothing to hold, all hope deleted
Our demise has been completed now
Nowhere left to go but down
The flames of hell they give me hope, I drown
In oceans of this tragic part of town
Where nothing's heard for miles but the sound
Of children wishing they were safely underground
We are the walking dead, we hold this ghost in our arms
We take our daily breath and thank our unlucky stars
Tried to get by on bread and water
Craving blood poured from the altar now
Not much left to do but drown
In flames of miscommunication, down
And out and off in search of someone proud
To translate what we truly dream about
As we lay in this bed thinking out loud
I'm screaming Uncle, mercy me
And my broken telepathy
For I'm left with nothing but this bloodless river bank
West Memphis please, I'm begging you to stop praying for me
Down, the flames of hell they give me hope, I drown
In oceans of this tragic part of town
Where nothing's heard for miles but the sound
Of children wishing they were safely underground
Joey will come to see your flowers
Joey will come to while away your hours
But she will tell you you're not so good for her
She wouldn't be there if it could be that you were.
Joey has loved but never shown her tears
So she may laugh in the autumn of your years
And when you're with her, you'll wonder if it's true
All they said of a world without you.
Where she may come from
Where she may go
Who she may run from
No one will know
Why she was late may trouble you some
Still you wait for Joey to come.
Joey will come when once more it looks like snow
Joey will come when it's really time to go
And you may smile when you find that you've been wrong
You thought you'd found her but she knew you all along
It's a trap
Someone's waiting in the tall grass
It's a trap
No one around for miles
But you're all smiles
This disease
I find everything pursuing
I forget that I hate so many things
Like techno clubs
I prefer the queuing
If I curse
If I should accuse you
Please tell me that I'm wrong
If I'm worse
I'm just scared to lose you
I've wanted this too long
Can you please
Tell me what I'm doing?
I don't know
Swear I haven't got a clue
It's all new
If I curse
If I should accuse you
Please tell me that I'm wrong
If I'm worse
I'm just scared to lose you
I've wanted this too long
Wa-o, wa-o, wa-o (That side of your bed is still mine)
Wa-o, wa-o, wa-o (That side of your bed is still mine)
Am I the reason why you tossed and turned last night
Everything was such a blur, it didn't come out right
All of a sudden it's cold and we're falling apart
No, this can't be, please don't leave me alone in the dark
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
Late night you make me feel like I'm desperate, I'm not desperate
Oh, a little bit possessive, little miss obsessive
Can't get over it
Wa-o, wa-o, wa-o (That side of your bed is still mine)
Wa-o, wa-o, wa-o (That side of your bed is still mine)
I've never been a fan of long goodbyes
I'm at the finish line and you're just way too far behind
In the morning, I got in a fight with myself
I got the bruises to prove it
Then I swallowed your words, and spit them right back out
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
Late night you make me feel like I'm desperate, I'm not desperate
Oh, a little bit possessive, little miss obsessive
Can't get over it
Now it's like a fairytale without a happy ending (Happy ending)
But then again maybe we are just pretending
Why does it have to be so unfair?
Tell me that you care
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it oh
Little miss (whoa), little miss (whoa), little miss (whoa), little miss obsessive
Little miss (whoa), little miss (whoa), little miss (whoa), little miss obsessive
Late night you make me feel like I'm desperate, I'm not desperate
Oh, a little bit possessive, little miss obsessive
Can't get over it now
Wa-o, wa-o, wa-o (That side of your bed is still mine)
Wa-o, wa-o, wa-o (That side of your bed is still mine)
I fell in love and I needed a road map
To find out where you lived, so excited now
Sleepwalking
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
The white trash boys listen to their headphones
Blasting white noise in the convenience store parking lot
I hung around there wasting my time
Hoping you'll stop by
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
I'm sleepwalking
A mutual friend's parents left town for a week
So we raided their liquor stash and walked down to the riverside
Sleepwalking
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
(Guess I'd better wash my mouth out with soap)
Think I just remembered something
I think I left the faucet running
Now my words are filling at the top
Darling you're just soaking in it
But I know you'll get out the minute
You notice all your fingers pruning up
I'm tired of being
Careful, gentle, trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh, there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I'd better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I'd better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
Think I got myself in trouble
So I fill the bath with bubbles
Then I'll put the towels all away
Should've never said the word "love"
Threw a toaster in the bathtub
I'm sick of all the games I have to play
I'm tired of being
Careful, gentle, trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh, there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I'd better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I'd better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I'd better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I'd better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
Over and out of it
For one more plane ride out
I'm not sure, and never was if this will
All head south, or what
Wait here, a month or two will pass
I'm sure I won't
Faith dear, enough to get you by
Until we're home
I wish, I don't wish I still smoked
And I wish I wrote you one original note
Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again
Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again
Over and out of it
For one more plane ride out
I'm not sure, and never was if this will
All head south
I wish, I don't wish I still smoked
And I wish I wrote you one original note
Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again
Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again
If you're scared and it shows 'cause you're watching them grow
And traveling blows when you're out of road
And when you jump up the earth wants you back
Your resentment grow till you're all alone
But you're so smart how could they not know
When you're standing there in good humored white
And how do you do it?
And make it seem effortless
When it's all the stupid things
So overwhelming to me
Like paying my bills
Or showing up for work early
Or laughing at your jokes
When you first said that anything goes
Or a problem is a task disguised in work clothes
That's when I knew I had to move
And why do you do it?
And make it seem delicate
When it's all the stupid things
So damn confusing to me
Like talking it through
Controlling my temper
Like letting it go
Saying please forgive me
Or laughing at your jokes
I have no idea what's been going on lately
And I just wish you'd come over and explain things
And I have no idea what's been going on lately
And I just wish you'd come over and explain things
I have no idea what's been going on lately
And I just wish you'd come over and explain things
I have no idea what's been going on lately
And I just wish you'd come over and explain things
Why do they do it?
Show up anyway
When they know that damn well
There is no room for promotions out here
And maybe it's wise
And maybe I'm just stupid
For laughing at your jokes
Fire-burned and blew out flowers
Showing me its comely powers
Still and all it would be hours
Before I would get burned
Someone mawed and put my cock in
Corner-eyed I saw it lock in
Twisters rolled but no one walked in
And only love was learned
Now I truly love you wholly
No one else could e'er have stole me
And the world so far below me
For ye and me it turned
It was only one hour ago
It was all so different then
Nothing yet has really sunk in
Looks like it always did
This flesh and bone
Is just the way that you were tied in
But there's no one home
I grieve for you
And you leave me
So hard to move on
Still loving what's gone
They say life carries on
Carries on and on, and on, and on
The news that truly shocks
Is the empty, empty page
While the final rattle rocks
Its empty, empty cage
And I can't handle this
I grieve for you
You leave me
Let it out and move on
Missing what's gone
They say life carries on
They say life carries on, and on, and on
Life carries on in the people I meet
In everyone that's out on the street
In all the dogs and cats
In the flies and rats
In the rot and the rust
In the ashes and the dust
Life carries on and on, and on, and on
Life carries on and on, and on
Life carries on and on, and on, and on
Life carries on and on, and on
Just the car that we ride in
The home we reside in
The face that we hide in
The way we are tied in
As life carries on and on, and on, and on
Life carries on, and on, and on
Did I dream this belief?
Or did I believe this dream?
Now I will find relief
I grieve
My city's still breathing, but barely, it's true
Through buildings gone missing like teeth
The sidewalks are watching me think about you
Sparkled with broken glass
I'm back with scars to show
Back with the streets I know
Will never take me anywhere but here
The stain in the carpet, this drink in my hand
The strangers whose faces I know
We meet here for our dress rehearsal to say
I wanted it this way
Wait for the year to drown
Spring forward, fall back down
I'm trying not to wonder where you are
All this time
Lingers, undefined
Someone choose
Who's left and who's leaving
Memory will rust and erode into lists
Of all that you gave me
A blanket, some matches, this pain in my chest
The best parts of lonely
Duct-tape and soldered wires
New words for old desires
And every birthday card I threw away
I wait in 4/4 time
Count yellow highway lines
That you're relying on to lead you home
That you're relying on to lead you home
That you're relying on to lead you home
A man inside a room is
Shaking hands with other men
This is how it happens
Our carefully laid plans
Shake it, shake it baby
Shake your ass out in that street
You're gonna make 'em scream someday
You're gonna make it big
You love so deep, so tender
Your people and your land
You love 'em 'til they can't recall
Who they are again
Work it, work it baby
Work your way 'round that room
You're gonna make it big someday
You're gonna make a boom
But I am, but I am, but I am
Not a number, not a name
But I am, but I am, but I am
A carefully laid plan
Shake what your mama gave you
You know that it won't last
You're gonna taste the ground real soon
You're gonna taste the grass
A man inside a room is
Shaking hands with other men
This is how it happens
Our world under command
Shake it, shake it baby
Shake your ass out in that street
You're gonna make us scream someday
You're gonna make us weep
You're gonna make us scream someday
You're gonna make it big
We heard the rain on the window
Like a simple waste of time
We heard the sirens' wailing
Like the world has lost its mind
We spend our days together
Hiding far with everything
Oh we knew it was over
When the summer turned to spring
And all the words we said
All the time we spent
Does it mean nothing?
Does it mean nothing?
All the words we said
All the time we spent
Does it mean nothing?
Does it mean nothing?
We heard the rain on the window
Like a simple waste of time
We heard the sirens' wailing
I knew they'd comfort you
We spend our days in heaven
Dying far with everything
Oh we knew it was over
When the needle didn't sting
And all the words we said
All the time we spent
Does it mean nothing?
Does it mean nothing?
All the words we said
All the time we spent
Does it mean nothing?
Does it mean something?
Does it mean something?
Does it mean something?
Does it mean something?
Does it mean something?
Does it mean something?
Does it mean something?
Does it mean something?
Does it mean something?
In the shadows buried in me lies a child's toy.
In the shadows the name is unknown to me.
In the shadows grey crusaders with tails
Mother made. In the shadows will to become their pride.
In the shadows I climbed mountains for chairs.
Don't look down.
Try this figure out memorize their words for hope
In the shadows stood up high for all to see
In the shadows counting these numbers down.
No one can
Take away leaf falls short
Dreams over a lie's the same
If I may weep.
In the shadows buried in me lies a child's toy
Tried to figure out memorize their words for hope.
I'm still remembering the day
I gave my life away
I'm still remembering the time
You said you'd be mine
Yesterday was cold and bare
Because you were not there
Yesterday was cold
My story has been told 
I need your affection all the way
The world has changed or I've changed in a way
I try to remain
I'm trying not to go insane
I need your affection all the way 
I'm still remembering my life
Before I became your wife
I'm still remembering the pain
And the mind games
Reverse psychology, never tainted me
I didn't sell my soul, I didn't sell my soul 
I need your affection all the way
The world has changd or I've changed in a way
I try to remain
I'm trying not to go insane
I need your affection all the way 
They say the cream will always
Rise to the top
They say that good people
Are always first to drop
What of Kurt Cobain
Will his presence still remain
Remember J.F.K.
Ever saintly in a way 
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
I say, where are you now
I need your affection all the way
I need your affection all the way
I need your affection all the way
I need your affection all the way
I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
It was a straight-faced lie I believed
It was a straight-faced lie
You would ever leave me
So for now I'll keep believing your words
And soon enough my strength will return
I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there
So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
Let me draw the blinds for you
You can watch the sunset from the bed 
In your hospital room 
Until you're sleeping 
And I'm sure I don't understand
How I found a love so pure
I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call on me
I'll be there
I'll be right there
So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there 
Don't lift a finger let me show you
The only way to let this go
Don't lift a finger, let me hold you
Hold you here until the pain has all gone
I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there
So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there
So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
So I'm waiting for this test to end,
So these lighter days can soon begin;
I'll be alone, but maybe more carefree,
Like a kite that floats so effortlessly;
I was afraid to be alone,
But now I'm scared that's how I like to be;
All these faces run the same,
How can there be so many personalities?
So many lifeless, empty hands,
So many hearts in great demand;
And now my sorrow seems so far away,
Until I'm taken by these bolts of pain;
But I turn them off, and tuck them away,
Until those rainy days that make them stay;
And then I'll cry so hard to these sad songs,
And the words still ring, once here, now gone;
And they echo through my head everyday,
And I don't think they'll ever go away;
Just like thinking of your childhood home,
But we can't go back, we're on our own;
Oh...
But I'm about to give this one more shot,
And find it in myself, I'll find it in myself;
So we're speeding towards that time of year,
To the day that marks that you're not here;
And I think I'll want to be alone,
So please understand that I don't answer the phone;
I'll just sit and stare at my deep blue walls,
Until I can see nothing at all;
Only particles, some fast, some slow,
All my eyes can see is all I know;
Oh...
But I'm about to give this one more shot,
And find it in myself, I'll find it in myself;
(Do, do, do, do-do-do) (x3)
Are you getting tired?
I think we've gone, and lost the fire.
But I don't wanna fight anymore,
I've had enough, of this town.
I can see the signs,
And I can read between the lines.
But I don't know what we were fighting for,
I'm just trying, to breakout.
I've been waiting for something,
I've been sitting for too long.
I've been waiting but oh tonight,
This one last try, goes on and on and on
I've been waiting for something,
I've been sitting for too long.
I've been waiting but oh tonight,
This one last try, goes on and on and on
You put your nets out,
And still you chose to do without.
The only way to catch a butterfly,
Is never waiting for the wings, and
The seasons bring change,
And as the seconds fade away.
I still don't know why we were holding on,
But I'm still trying, to breakout.
I've been waiting for something,
I've been sitting for too long.
I've been waiting but oh tonight,
This one last try, goes on and on and on
I've been waiting for something,
I've been sitting for too long.
I've been waiting but oh tonight,
This one last try, goes on and on and on
Should of known better than to listen.
When the dreams, and the words started falling down.
Should of known, when I hit the ground running.
Did you think that the night would posses us,
To keep sober like the rain that's falling down.
Did you notice when the clock stopped running.
Running
Running
Running
This is the countdown; they say our time is running out.
I tried to stay above the waterline,
But never taking off the weights that,
Keep us stuck here. In the comfort, and the fear.
I'll never know what we were fighting for,
But I'm still looking to breakout.
I've been waiting for something,
I've been sitting for too long.
I've been waiting but oh tonight,
This one last try, goes on and on and on
I've been waiting for something,
I've been sitting for too long.
I've been waiting but oh tonight,
This one last try, goes on and on and on
Think I wanna die if you don't stay
Drop dead in place, you can forget it
Carry a torch for days,
I'm gonna let it burn
I remember watching as you slowly loaded up the loom.
On repeat: Caravan and we danced around the room.
Once insecure about your scar but I think you got over it. (So right)
Dreamt of marimbas made from the bones of our relatives,
Who never live as long as we think that they oughta live.
You dreamt of sex with tigers
I tried to get my head around that one! (So right)
Left in a disguise for the faraway
Traveled all alone through boring meadows
While I sat at home
Wishing we could elope...
Will you ever know what you do to me?
I'm on my broken knees, no end of sorrow.
Sorry if that's sweet but it's tomorrow's hope.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Wanna die, wanna die, I wanna die, wanna die...
I wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die...
Think I wanna die if you don't stay
Drop dead in place, you can forget it
Carry a torch for days,
I'm gonna let it burn
Will you ever know what you do to me?
I'm on my broken knees, no end of sorrow.
Sorry if that's sweet but it's tomorrow's hope.
You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were
Leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes
When you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?
You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
I can't go on, just holding on to ties
Now that we're living (living) separate lives
Well I have learned to let you go
And if you've lost your love for me
Will you never let it show (never let it show)
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living) separate lives
Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall
And you make it stronger (build that wall)
Well you have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Someday I might (I might) find myself looking in your eyes
But for now we'll go on living separate lives
Yes for now we'll go on living separate lives
Ah
Separate lives
Anyone, caught in your mystery
Keep it angry
Keep it whispy
I've fallen down
Drunk on your juices
I
Turn my head
Turn my head
It's aimed at you
Funky temple
Your dress is torn to shreds
Your eyes are crazy
I bowed to save my head and
I can't forget you
But I can remember
I
Turn my head, turn my head
It's aimed at you
Turn my head, turn my head
It's aimed at you, baby, baby
Oh no, we came to love you
All day these bastards are leavin'
Somebody's go to stay
Whatever we called you
It's just a name
Just a name
Turn my head, (turn my head)
Turn my head
It's aimed at you
Turn my head, (turn my head)
Turn my head
It's aimed at you
It's aimed at you
Ahh...
You were born on a black day
Shot through with starlight
And all the angels singing
Just about got it right
Cut through the silver
And goodness did heaven know
I don't know where we're going
But darling bless your soul
Baby, set my soul on fire.
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to take you higher.
Baby, never should say never.
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever.
Sweetheart, may not be easy
But we're trying hard to hold on
Trying to make it better
Sweetheart, got so much freedom
But freedom is just another word
When you've no one left to hurt.
And I said
Baby, set my soul on fire.
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to take you higher.
Baby, never should say never.
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever.
Baby, set my soul on fire.
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to take you higher.
Baby, never should say never.
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever.
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to stay forever.
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever.
Your lipstick is smeared and sad
I adore you
I always have
And every time you overdose
I rush to intensive care
Another sad-eyed stare
Before you disappear
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then save it for me, baby
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then save it for me, baby
Ooh, ooh
Then save it for me, baby
Ooh, ooh
Then save it for me, baby
Your addiction
And you are in love
Now you're star-crossed
I wait my turn
And every time you overdose
I rush to intensive care
Another sad-eyed stare
Before you disappear
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then save it for me, baby
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then save it for me, baby
Ooh, ooh
Then save it for me, baby
Ooh, ooh
Then save it for me, baby
I wanna know, I wanna know, oh
If it's the last, if it's the last dance
I wanna know, I wanna know, oh
Baby, baby, please
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then save it for me, baby
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then save it for me, baby
Ooh
Then save it for me, baby
Ooh (This is the last dance, this is the last dance)
Then save it for me, baby
God visits all lost souls
To survey the damage
We noticed a bonfire
Burning in his eyes
He whispered,
"It's the atrocities of your story
Of your story."
God visits all lost souls
To survey the damage
And holding his bleeding heart
A tear comes to his eye
He whispered,
"It's the atrocities of history
Of history
Of..."
The he falls to the floor
For there's many more tears on the sunrise
And now we must eat those tears
Now we must eat our fill
Of the Atrocities
The Atrocities
The Atrocities
The Atrocities
Ooh (The Atrocities)
Ooh (The Atrocities)
Ah (The Atrocities)
Ah (The Atrocities)
You show up like a hurricane
All hungry-eyed and weather-stained
The clock forgets to tick and I the same
I died the day you disappeared
So why would you be welcome here
Ride the wind that brought you back away
No you can't come in
No you can't come in
I cannot stop my rebel hands
From pulling out the pots and pans
I left you in the cold until you shook
You're gentle now but I recall
Both tender fire and bitter squall
A history so deep it hurts to look
No you can't come in
No you can't come in
No you can't, you can't come in
If the sea should swallow up my house
I will turn the rooftop inside out 
And the wind will be wailing
But I will be sailing faster
Oh the elements I do not fear
But I fall apart when you appear
Cause you are the greatest
The greatest disaster
If the sea should swallow up my house
I will turn the rooftop inside out 
And the wind will be wailing
But I will be sailing faster
I heard you driving in my car
Then in a frozen bar
And I claimed I didn't care for you
But your verse got trapped inside my head
Over and over again
You played yourself to death in me
I thought I'd drop you easily
But that was not to be
You burrowed like a summer tic
So you invade my sleep and confuse my dreams
Turn my nights to sleepless itch
Stuck on you till the end of time
I'm too tired to fight your rhyme
Stuck on you till the end of time
You've got me paralyzed
Holding on the telephone
I hear your midrange moan
You're everywhere inside my room
Even when I'm alone I hear your mellow drone
You're everywhere inside of me
Stuck on you till the end of time
I'm too tired to fight your rhyme
Stuck on you till the end of time
You got me trapped inside
I can't escape your incessant whine
When you beam it out all across the sky
No I can't escape
(Stuck on you till the end of time)
Your insipid rhyme
(I'm too tired to fight your rhyme)
When you shoot it deep
(Stuck on you till the end of time)
Straight into my mind
When she laughs
The piano in the hall
Plays a quiet note
Waterfalls
Turning gentle into rough
Then gentle again
Morning dew
Washes yesterday's garden
Ready for today
Rocking chair
Is still without a rocker
But is still a chair
When she laughs
The piano in the hall
Resonates a note.
Waterfalls
Turning gentle into rough
Then gentle again
Morning dew
Washes yesterday's garden
Ready for today
Rocking Chair 
Is still without a rocker
But is still a chair
When she laughs
The piano in the hall
Plays a quiet note
It just happened, so what?
But they're all laughing, what's up?
Why the tears?
Have no fear.
We are here for you.
But I know how you feel, I know how you feel, when no one cares.
If you feel just like I feel (push people)
Everything's plastic, nothing's real (push people)
Fuck your normal vase, let's steal (push people)
We're just dancing, no big deal (push people)
Hey just let the bullshit pass (push people)
Or we'll skateboard your ass (push people)
Got my balls, my wheels (push people)
We're just dancing, no big deal (push people)
Breakout x12
(Push people) x8
Break away
All you can be is just you, 'cause you're real, not the plastic type.
But reality sets and you're stuck in this plastic life.
Why the tears? We're all here for you.
But I know how you feel, I know how you feel, and I do care.
Breakout x12
(Push people) x8
Break away
(Hey) Shit happens. (Hey) Just blow it off. (Woo)
Man, but don't it make you feel rage?
Rage, yeah. (woo)
Hey, shit happens, (Uh huh) just blow it off (woo)
Yeah, but don't it make you feel rage?
Rage, yeah (woo)
Just as long as we got the same thing in our veins, you and I, we are both the same
I'll bail you out, show you what you should see
One love, N.E.R.D.
Peace
Oh baby why
Do I miss you like I do?
Homeless my sweet
And the birds all sing the blues
And why? And why?
Call me on your way back home, dear
'Cause I miss you
Honey I ain't nothing new
Oh baby why
Did I treat you like I did?
Honey I was just a kid
Bubblegum on my shoe
But you loved me
And I loved you
Call me on your way back home, dear
'Cause I miss you
And I just wanna die without you
Oh I just wanna die without you
Yeah I just wanna die without you
Without you
Honey I ain't nothing new
I've been here before, I know this shade of blue
It's you
I've felt you touch before I know your way
A ghost-like sense of state
You're gone
So it seems you know me, I will wait
For you
I do
I don't care if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Don't mind if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Slowly I relive a better past
A time I thought I knew
I blew
Now I'm patient, now I know I'll last
I'll last
I've always known my heart's been held by you
I've always known it's true
With you
I don't care if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Don't mind if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
So I shook hands with you freely
Made a promise not to clean the slate
And I didn't need you till melody
Drew a line between love and hate
And I know I can be self righteous
And we both like to stretch the truth
But there's never been a song or a melody
That reminds me less of youth
Hey there hey there
Debbie down debbie down
And I felt my head exploding
So I left it beside the road
In the tall grass where
All the deer despair
At the thought of being stuffed in my home
And first we were antisocial
Till we tried hibernating through
All the seasons where you dye your hair
In a failed attempt on blue
Said the fibber to the snake
There's an opportunist dude
Watch his mouth its open wide
And he trying not to eat you
Hey there hey there
Debbie down debbie down
I just don't care anymore
I've reached the end of the road
I just don't care anymore
Won't cry these tears anymore
Can't find it in the bible
Can't find it on TV
Can't find it in diamonds
There's something inside me that just won't allow me to
Find it in music
Can't find it in my soul
Can't find it in chocolate
Oh babe I can't hide it I can't even find it in you
There's no way she can kiss you
The way that I do
I heard that you miss me
Oh you should be careful of who you keep talking to
Long nights without you have taught me to be strong
I've cut all my losses
Think no more about it 'cause I couldn't find it in you
There was a time I thought I'd die
If you should ever leave me high and dry
Now you don't want me any more
It's time to settle the score
I just don't care anymore
I've reached the end of my tether I've torn all your letters up
I just don't care anymore
Won't cry these tears anymore
I just don't care anymore
I've reached the end of my rope and it's time that I told you so
I just don't care anymore
Won't cry these tears anymore
I can't tell you anything you don't already know
I keep on trying, I should just let it go
I keep on singing, your eyes they just roll
It sounds like someone else's song
From a long time ago
You already know the story, the chords are just the same
You already know I love you and I sound like what's-his-name
But you can't stop me, I want you to know
I know it sounds like someone else's song
From a long time ago
When the hour is upon us
And our beauty surely gone
No you will not be forgotten
And you will not be alone
No you will not be alone
And when the day has all but ended
And our echo starts to fade
No you will not be alone then
And you will not be afraid
No you will not be afraid
And when the fog has finally lifted
From my cold and tired brow
No I will not leave you crying
No I will not let you down
No I will not let you down
I will not let you down
Now comes the night
Feel it fadin' away
And the soul underneath
Is it all that remains
So just slide over here
Leave your fear in the fray
Let us hold to each other
Until the end of our days
And when the hour is upon us
And our beauty surely gone
No you will not be forgotten
And you will not be alone
No you will not be alone
Some escape, some door to open
This path seems the blackest
But I guess it's the soonest
But there in the clearing
I know you'll be wearing
Your young aching smile
And waving your hand
Can't go with my heart
When I can't feel what's in it
I thought you'd come over
But for some reason you didn't
Glass on the pavement under my shoe
Without you is all my life amounts to
A final sleep
No words from my cutting mouth to your ear
Or taut wicked pinches
From my fingers to your bitter face
That I can't heal
I know tomorrow you will be
Somewhere in London, living with someone
You've got some kind of family there to turn to
And that's more than I could ever give you
A chance for calm, a hope for freedom
Outlet from my cold solitary kingdom
By the forest of our spring stay
Where you walked away
And left a bleeding part of me
Empty and bothered, watching the water
Quiet in the corner, numb and falling through
Without you, what does my life amount to?
U ne la nv I u me tsi
I go ga gv he i
Hna quo tso sv wi yu lo se

Under what spell the guiding light
Betook the undertaker
Under whose gaze did fall such evil blunder
Characters of flaming eyes
Eager to burn the wooden castle
Eager to wet the paper heart of children birds
The aching starlet
The singing sinew
The whining ghost
Brutal wind of snowy harlot
Chafing mine eyes
A sandpaper kiss
Bloody rosen my cheek
Purple kiss of stardust
Pink balloon of time
Candied on the inside
Baby pit bull butterfly
Do da do da do dah do dah
In my happy home I barely breathe
In my lover's arms I find relief
And there's a sky that's changing and a bird that sings
I never once in my wayward life was heading to run out
In my lover's arms I wait for morning
I beg my god to speak and tear me apart
I'd lay down my body I'd lay down my arms
I never once in my sweet short life meant anybody harm
In my happy home I read the signs
In my lover's arms I move in time
There's no more crying and there's no more lies
I never once in my sweet short life was waiting for desire
And there's no more crying
And there's no more pain
I never thought for one second I'd have nothing left but shame
In my happy home I barely breathe
I never once in my wayward life was heading to run out
I don't know
What am I doing here
There's a shadow in my place
Maybe now everything will be so clear
You shed light into this empty space
And all I am, all I have doesn't even matter now
I can't understand why I feel this way
But I do, I do
I just want to love you when the goings tough
I just want to hold you when you're not enough
I just want to give you everything I've got
I do, I do
I don't know
What am I sayin' here
There's a hole in my heart and it's beggin' please
Maybe now everything will be so clear
'Cause you're all I'll ever need
All I know is, I don't want to lose control
I just want to touch your soul
I do, I do
I just want to hold you when the goings tough
I just want to love you when you're not enough
I just want to give you all that I can give
I do, I do
I just want to kiss you in the morning sun
I just want to love you when the day is done
I just want to hold you just because I can
I do, I do
I just want to fold you up into my arms
I just want to listen to your beating heart
I just want to love you just because I do
I do, I do
Standing in the dark outside the house
Breathing the cold and sterile air
Well I was thinking how it must feel
To see that little light
And watch it as it disappears
And fades into
And fades into the night
So I know you're going pretty soon
Radiation sore throat got your tongue
Magic markers tattoo you
And show it where to aim
And strangers break their promises
You won't feel any
You won't feel any pain
And the streets are jammed with cars
Rockin' their horns
To race to the wire
Of the unfinished line
Thought that I'd forget all about the past
But it doesn't let me run too fast
And I just wanna stand outside
And know that this is right
And this is true
And I will not
Fade into
Fade into the night
Standing here in the dark
We drive tonight,
And you are by my side
We're talking about our lives,
Like we've known each other forever
The time flies by,
With the sound of your voice
Its close to paradise
With the end surely near
And if I could only stop the car
And hold onto you,
And never let go...
I'll never let go.
As we round the corner
To your house
You turned to me and said,
"I'll be going through withdrawal of you for this one night we have spent."
And, I want to speak these words
But I guess I'll just bite my tongue,
And accept "someday, somehow"
As the words that we'll hang from.
And I... don't want to speak these words.
'Cause I, don't want to make things any worse.
Why does tonight, have to end?
Why don't we hit restart,
And pause it at our favorite parts.
We'll skip the goodbyes
If I had it my way,
I'd turn the car around and runaway,
Just you and I
And I... don't want to speak these words.
'Cause I, don't want to make things any worse.
Why leave me hanging on a star
When you deem me so high
When you deem me so high
When you deem me so high.
And why leave me sailing in a sea
When you hear me so clear
When you hear me so clear
When you hear me so clear.
And why leave me hanging on a star
When you deem me so high
When you deem me so high
When you deem me so high.
I regret my past
Stay alone

Jetzt könnt ihr noch jemanden aufnehmen.
Aufnehmen? Wen?
Jemanden aus dem Westen.
Geh schlafen
Wenn du willst, kannst du dich ins Schwesternzimmerchen legen.
Wohin solls n gehn?
Wo fahren Sie hin?
Ik wees was Sie jetz denken - dat denken viele! Aber ik bins nich.
Können Sie nen Moment warten? Dauert nicht lange.
Spring is frozen now I'm stuck in low
Wrapped with wire, tapped to the heart
Can't find no poison, now I've got no cure
(The) fangs are stuck inside my skin
Payne county line
Watching unjust claims
One man's righteousness is another man's
Long haul, sentence carried out
Long haul, counting the miles
To the four corners of the world
Spring is rusted shut, (faith's) coiled and cracked
Apparitions worth their weight in gold
Scratched in metal, name erodes away
Hands are scarred, heart is charred
Burnt though, and ashen
Trip on fence post line
Sifting through the remains
One man's close pursuit is another man's
Last chance, make it through the divide
Last chance, suffer the weight or get buried by this
Black heart, sweeping over the land
Black heart, crawling its way
To the four corners of the world
Now it's years since your body went flat, and even memories of that
Are all thick and dull, all gravel and glass 
But who needs them now, displaced they're easily more safe
The worst of it now, I can't remember your face
Return, return, return, return
For a while, with the vertigo cured
We were alive, we were pure
The void took the shape of all that you were
But years take their toll
And things get bent into shape
Antiseptic and tired, I can't remember your face
Return, return, return, return
You were supposed to grow old
You were supposed to grow old
Reckless, unfrightened and old
You were supposed to grow old
You were supposed to grow old
You were supposed to grow old
You were supposed to grow old 
Return, return, return, return
You were supposed to return
You were supposed to return
Take a leaf of paper draw your mind
A bourbon brown that can burn my eyes
I lost your presents underneath the bridge
Unlock the door
Let's talk it out
Against the wall
Hands on my mouth
Can this be it, is it really over now?
You wore a pink t-shirt and khaki pants
You played your songs and danced your dance
I unwrapped your present underneath your feet
Nine to eleven you're getting week
The tile is cold I can barely speak
And I think she's gone but I'll be sure for safety's keeping
If you say no then no it will be
I'll stick it out, skin pierced with colly strings
Just play it cool, yeah, and try to avoid being seen
I'll stick it out, skin pierced for nothing
Well yeah I saw inside the mirror and your smoking gun,
Unloading lead inside me, I was subscribing one by one,
And I fell so fast in seth ott's bedroom
You said you saw it coming, but you didn't see nothing
Your eyes were on the living room, your eyes were on the closet
Don't worry about it, don't worry about anything
A pity invitation to an awkward house
For pseudo-boy who would rather wear a blouse
I sincerely saw your skin for the very first time
My curly hair and a voting booth
Confessantly, this is the first time I've loved you
And God I mean it, God I mean it, I hope that I mean it
Because like dying young, idols got the best of me
Well don't stop calling, you're the reason I love losing sleep
And the building collapsed, so we'll shop one, we'll shop one for something
We'll stick it out, skin pierced for something
Besides, don't release me until it's over
Besides, we can't believe without bleeding
Besides, we can't believe without bleeding
Ooh, oh...
Oh, yeah, yes... 
Ooh, oh...
Ooh, my...
Here we are face to face with the memories that can't be erased;
Although we need each other, things have changed - it's not the same...
Sometimes it makes me wonder where would I be (Where would I be?)
If you hadn't discovered which I did inside of me -
I know there was something that we could compare...
Oh, well, I never meant to cause you no pain;
I just wanna go back to being the same...
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life...
Oh, oh... yeah...
Remembering the good times from a portrait hung on high; (Hanging so high...)
It's filled with so much color and the laughter we left behind...
I made the choice, and you couldn't decide...
I made the choice - I was wrong, you were right;
Deep down inside, I apologize...
Never meant to cause you no pain;
I just wanna go back to being the same...
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life...
Well, I never meant to cause you no pain... baby, yeah;
I just wanna go back to being the same...
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life...
Though I made plans with you to always have time for you...
(Before you walk out of my life...)
I guess it's true - cannot live without you;
Don't ever go away, ooh, oh, yeah...
Never meant to cause you no pain... baby, yeah...
I just wanna go back to being the same...
Well, I only wanna make things right, baby,
Before you walk out my life... Oh, yeah...
Never meant to cause you no pain;
(I just wanna go back to being the same...) I wanna go back, I wanna go back, baby...
I only wanna make things right... yeah, yeah,
Before you walk out of Monica's life, baby...
Never meant to cause you no pain... baby, believe me,
(I just wanna go back to being the same...) I just wanna go back to bein'... bein', baby, yeah...
I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life...
Before you walk out of my life...
Lately I've been thinking
Lately I've been dreaming with you
I'm so resistant to this type of thinking
Oh now it's shining through
I was alone for the last time
Before my nights' vacation with you
Alive from the first now I'm denied
By the ghost of you
Oh you take yourself a photograph and laugh at me
Please
I know there's little use in crying
It's more wide awake and dying than I'm used to
I thought we'd walk these streets together
Now I'm hoping that I'll never have to meet you
Step aside from all this anger
And somewhere in between I can feel you
Ask me should we try again
I'm thinking no yeah
It's not what I believe in
It's not what I believe in
Oh, Won't you take yourself a photograph and laugh at me
Please
You make yourself a photograph and laugh at me
Please
No I, wanna taste your love
No I... no I
No I, just wanna taste your love
Oh, no I
Standing in your shoes I turn
And now you're standing bare in my doorway
I only wish that I had been prepared
I'm gonna have to go along with your way
Just take the plastic camera out
It's in the pants you borrowed in the driveway
Alive from the first now I'm denied by the ghost of you
Make yourself a photograph and laugh at me please
Yeah make yourself a photograph and laugh at me please
No I want a taste of love no i
I was alive from the first now I'm denied by the ghost of you
The nicest man I ever met
Was more malicious than malcontent
Yeah, he taught me how to hold my tongue
And wait to strike 'til their backs were turned
And you slither away like the snake that you are
Yeah, you slither away like the snake that you are
And all I ever did was look up to you
And if all I ever did was let, let you down
Ain't nothing stopping me now
The vanities fell correctly beneath
The receding part of his twenties
Was capital M-E (I couldn't subscribe)
Was capital M-E (but you can't say I didn't try)
You say what you want (maybe I didn't get my way)
So you say what you want (maybe I didn't get my way)
But I got, I got away
All I ever did was look up to you
And if all I ever did was let, let you down
Ain't nothing stopping me now
Was it everything you hoped for?
Was it all of that and more?
Too much too soon?
Or too good to be true?
Was it everything you hoped for?
Was it all of that and more?
Well, all I ever did was look up to you
And if all I ever did was let, let you down
Ain't nothing stopping me now
But all I ever did was look up to you
And if all I ever did was let, let you down
Ain't nothing stopping me now
So we've put an end to it this time.
I'm no longer yours and you're no longer mine.
You said this hill looks far too steep
If I'm not even sure it's me you wanna keep.
And it's been ten days without you in my reach,
And the only time I've touched you is in my sleep.
But time has changed nothing at all -
You're still the only one that feels like home.
I've tried cutting the ropes and
I let you go but you're still the only one
That feels like home.
You won't talk me into it next time,
If I'm going away your hearts coming too.
'Cause I miss your hands I miss your face.
When I get back let's disappear without a trace.
'Cause it's been ten days without you in my reach,
And the only time I've touched you is in my sleep.
But time has changed nothing at all -
You're still the only one that feels like home.
I've tried cutting the ropes,
Tried letting go but you're still the only one
That feels like home.
So tell me, did you really think...
Oh tell me, did you really think
I had gone when you couldn't see me anymore?
When you couldn't...
'Cause baby time has changed nothing at all -
You're still the only one that feels like home.
And I've tried cutting the ropes,
I let you go but you're still the only one
That feels like home, yeah,
You're still the only one that feels like home,
You're still the only one I've gotta love.
Oh yeah...
Watch my life
Pass me by
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time
Are becoming clearer
I don't want to waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes
Yeah
'Cause I want you
And I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger
Like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken
And I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me
I've been dying inside
Little by little
No where to go
But going out of my mind
In endless circles
Running from myself until
You gave me a reason for standing still
And I want you
And I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger
Like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken
And I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me
Falling faster
Barely breathing
Give me something
To believe in
Tell me it's not all in my head
Take what's left
Of this man
Make me whole
Once again
'Cause I want you
And I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
A hunger
Like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken
And I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have all that's left, yeah yeah yeah
What's left of me?
I've been dying inside you see
I'm going out my
Out my mind
I'm just running in circles all the time
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?
Just running in circles in my mind
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?
Take what's left of me
Ever since I was eight or nine
I've been standing on the shoreline
Always waiting 
For something lasting
Loose your hunger, you loose your way
Get confused and you fade away
Oh this town
Kills you when you are young
Oh this town
Kills you when you are young
I'm not the boy I used to be
This town has got the youth of me
All eyes turn hollow
From the work of sorrow
Standing on the paving
By the office building
They've got so much to do
Never time for you
We are shadows
Oh we're shadows
Shadows in the alley
You die when you're young
You die when you're young
You die when you're young
Well, they're lining up to mad dog your tilt-a-whirl
Three shots for a dollar, win a real live doll
All the lies that you tell, I believed them so well
Take them back, take them back to your red house
For that fearful leap into the dark
Well, I did my time in the jail of your arms
Now Ophelia wants to know where she should turn
Tell me, what did you do, what did you do the last time, why don't you do that?
Well, go on ahead and take this the wrong way
Time's not your friend
Do you cry, do you pray, do you wish them away?
You're still leaving nothing but bones in the way
Did you bury the carnival with the lions and all? Excuse me while I sharpen my nails
And just are you, who are you this time?
You look rather tired, are you pretending to love?
Well, I hear that it pays well
How do your pistol and your Bible and your sleeping pills go?
Are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes?
Well, I fell in love with your sailor's mouth
And your wounded eyes
You'd better get down on the floor
Don't you know this is war
Tell me, who are you this time?
Tell me, who are you this time?
They never heard you play their loud songs, on the Bellerophon
Round the sea I'm not floating by the saints of heaven
And you said that I was liar and I'm lost somewhere on the inside, forever alone.
London, did you have to take my child away?
You buried him under rent and low pay.
I've been cycling in circles 'round your empty streets.
I've been searching in the pouring rain.
I've been going alone to the cinema.
I've been stealing all my food from the electric avenue.
Now the pigeons gather 'round my feeding hand.
And we talk till the evening fades.
I have learnt how it goes.
What you wait for never shows.
And what you least wanted, holds you down like a stone.
Just like a stone.
So.
Now I feed the birds. Day after day.
Only they can hear me pray for.
A lighter heart. A lighter load.
To be moving. Moving. Moving my way home.
My, way home.
Way home.
My, way home.
How long did we all
Think this all would last?
Who could have counted days
As they flew past?
But before we go
Sing us a song, sing us a song
To hum through the hours of dying
Who would have thought
It'd come as such a show?
A pink and silver day
Who was to know?
But even as we go
Sing us a song, sing us a song
To hum through the hours of dying
Sing us a song, sing us a song
To hum through the hours of dying
But even as we go
Sing us a song, sing us a song
To hum through the hours of dying
Sing us a song, sing us a song
To hum through the hours of dying
Sing us a song, sing us a song
To hum through the hours of dying
Sing us a song, sing us a song
To hum through the hours of dying
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
I looked over Jordan
And what did I see
Coming for to carry me home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Am I?
Am I to be paid?
If we run far away
Think we will ever die?
We'll throw these books (In the fire)
Can you stop the train?
Cause it some delay
The change machine lied
And it's too late (To scream, how long is the night?)
Night, it's never over, it's never over
And the ribbon is tied
The card was never read
It's never over, it's never over
The ribbon was crimson
The color of the night
Can you see the handwriting
On the walls?
And on the autumn leaves that fall
What are we gonna do?
Trees are giving up
On us
The needle and the thread
Stitch us to the branch
And the night never ends
What are we gonna do? (Stand up)
The trees are giving up (To sight)
On us
The needle and the thread (Won't stitch, won't stitch us)
Won't stitch us to the branch
And the night, it never ends
The night, it never ends
It never ends
The night, it never ends
I will never sleep again (I, I, I'll never even close my eyes)
I will never sleep again (I, I, I'll never even close my eyes)
I will never sleep again (I, I, I'll never even close my eyes)
I will never sleep again (I, I, I'll never even close my)
If the sun's on its way
Then we will never die
And we'll follow these tracks (To the sight)
Now, the lungs collapse
Air is getting thin
And all breath expired
Is it too late? (To heal, how long is the night?)
Night, it's never over, it's never over
And the ribbon was tied
The card was never read
It's never over, it's never over
The ribbon was crimson
The color of the night
Is all I ever see (Anymore)
But the day looked so bright (Bright)
In the pictures
In the photoalbum that you gave me
(Is all I have)
To live for (Live for)
I'm falling down
I'm falling down
And you're not there
To break my fall
I shut my eyes
When you're around
I hold my breath
To kill the sound
I'm falling down
I'm falling down
And you're not here
To catch my fall
I shut my eyes
When you're around
I hold my breath
To kill the sound
I'm falling down
I'm falling down
And you're not here
To catch my fall
"Independent. Independent."
"As we put it this way. Rich gets richer. Poor gets poorer."
"Oi."
Phone's off the hook
No one knows where we are
It's a long time since I
Drank champagne
The ocean is blue
As blue as your eyes
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go
Old long since gone
Now way back when
We lived in Coney Island
Ain't no good thing
Ever dies
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go
Far far away a train
Whistle blows
Wherever you're goin'
Wherever you've been
Waving good bye at the end
Of the day
You're up and you're over
And you're far away
Always for you, and
Forever yours
It felt just like the old days
We fell asleep on Beaula's porch
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go
All broken down by
The side of the road
I was never more alive or
Alone
I've worn the faces off
All the cards
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go
Children are playing
At the end of the day
Strangers are singing
On our lawn
It's got to be more
Than flesh and bone
All that you've loved
Is all you own
In a land there's a town
And in that town there's
A house
And in that house
There's a woman
And in that woman
There's a heart I love
I'm gonna take it
With me when I go
I'm gonna take it
With me when I go
It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present, you know what I mean?
Honey, I'm a roller concrete clover
Tadzio, Tadzio
Arm wrestle your mother simply over
Tadzio, over you
But beware my heart can be a pin
A sharp silver dragonfly
Tryin' to get my mansions green (Tryin' to get my mansions green)
After I've Grey Gardens seen (Grey Gardens seen)
(Gardens seen)
In between tonight and my tomorrows
Tadzio, where've you been
In between tonight I know it's Ta'zo
Tadzio don't you fight
Honey can you hear me in between
Been draggin' a dragonfly
Tryin' to get my mansions green (Tryin' to get my mansions green)
After I've Grey Gardens seen (Grey Gardens seen)
(Gardens seen)
Honey won't you hold me tight (Honey won't you hold me tight)
(hold me tight)
Get me through Grey Gardens tonight
Tadzio, Tadzio
Tadzio, Tadzio
Tryin' to get my mansions green (Tryin' to get my mansions green)
After I've Grey Gardens seen (Grey Gardens seen)
(Gardens seen)
Honey won't you hold me tight (Honey won't you hold me tight)
(Hold me tight)
Get me through Grey Gardens tonight
Tadzio, Tadzio
Tadzio, Tadzio
Tadzio, Tadzio
Everything is tragic, it all just falls apart
But when I look into your eyes, it pieces up my heart
If I only had an answer to put it all to bed
I wish sometimes I could take back every word I've said
I walk back in the night alone, got caught up in my song
Forgot where I was sleeping, none of the lights were on
I heard my mother thinking me right back into my birth
I laughed so loud inside myself, it all began to hurt
So I turned on a picture show, I disappeared the lines
As memories came flooding in, the tears blew up my eyes
I see an elevator, a moment I am above
I look for you or someone who can still remind me of
The tight grip and the sun lick 
And the calm weight of all things summer
When it's all here and it's all new
And you're not hungover
Fierce and light and young
Fierce and light and young
When you don't know that you're wrong
Or just how wrong you are
My feet are always heavy as I inch toward the door
I thought we'd leave this for ourselves a hundred times before
But I guess we're always leaving even when we look the same
And it eases me somehow to know that even this will change
If you've still got some light in you then go before it's gone
Burn your fire for no witness, it's the only way it's done
Fierce and light and young
Fierce and light and young
Hit the ground and run
Hit the ground and run
Sworn to secrecy
I might go after school
She was an angel
I saw her swimming there
I am in such a mess
I can't cope without this
She just teases me
Pretends she can't see me here
So let me go out there
I can breathe fresh air
Lay with you all night
Just let me love you
Just for a while want to
Be with you all night
Be with you all night
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Just let me be here
I won't tell anyone
Don't want to wake up
Don't want to wake up
The blind lead the blind
So why can't I find my way
This could be heaven
But I don't know where I am
I am too scared to come out
From behind here
My body is aching
It feels like it's wearing me
So let me go out there
I can breathe fresh air
Lay with you all night
Just let me love you
Just for a while want to
Be with you all night
Be with you all night
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Just let me be here
I won't tell anyone
Don't want to wake up
Don't want to wake up
Mr. Hudson:
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
You will be numb and blue
Frank Ocean and Mr. Hudson:
(I can't be there with you) But I can dream
(I can't be there with you) But I can dream
(I can't be there with you) But I can dream
(I can't be there with you) But I can dream
(I can't be there with you) But, but, but, but I can dream
(I can't be there with you) But, but, but, but I can dream
(I still dream dream dream
I still dream, dream
There will be tears)
Frank Ocean:
My grandaddy was a player, pretty boy in a pair of gators
See I met him later on, think it was 1991
The only dad I'd ever know, but pretty soon he'd be gone too
Hide my face, hide my face, can't let 'em see me crying
'Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
And they weren't crying, my friend said it wasn't so bad
You can't miss what you ain't had, well I can, I'm sad and
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
You will be numb and blue
I can't be there, that's all you had to say to me was
You couldn't be there, why couldn't you say to me
You won't be there, you coulda warned me
You wouldn't be here right here, you wouldn't be here for me, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Tell myself I'm fine 
In celebrating nothing
And all the time I waste 
On celebrating nothing
How many times can I blow it all
How many times will I burn it down
Give me a reason to stay alive
I've got the feeling we're gonna die
I hide behind 
My eyes 
And lies
And broken mirrors
And every day I say 
This time
Around 
My vision's getting clearer
How many times can I blow it all
How many times will I burn it down
Give me a reason to stay alive
I've got the feeling we're gonna die
Give me a reason to stay alive
I've got the feeling we're gonna die
How many times can I blow it all
How many times will I burn it down
How many times can I blow it all
How many times will I burn it down
Give me a reason to stay alive (we're gonna die)
I've got the feeling we're gonna die (we're gonna die)
Give me a reason to stay alive (we're gonna die)
I've got the feeling we're gonna die
When I found out this love's undone
I was like a gun
Sure as it was over
Felt like nothing good could come
Sure as it's gonna play and play
Like michael back in the day
I'm gonna peel you away
Now as I begin
To wash you off my skin
I'm gonna peel you away
'Cause you're not right within
I love you so
Sometimes love has to let go
So this time don't think it's a lie
I say goodbye
Now as I begin
To wash you off my skin
I'm gonna peel you away
'Cause you're not right within
Now it's time
To wash you off my skin
Now as I begin
It couldn't be right 'cause you're not right within
I say goodbye
I'm outside your house
2 am it's dark
So many mistakes
Come back home from bars
I am on your side
I just want to tell you off
So many lies
Are taking hold
It's not your fault
There's many scars
I am on your side
It's taken me a long time
I am on your side
I'm on your side
And I listen
Yeah I listen
Can you listen?
Now I'm listening
I am on your side
It's taken me a long time
I am on your side
I'm on your side
(And I listen) I am on your side
(Yeah I listen) It's taken me a long time
(Can you listen?) I am on your side
(Now I'm listening) I'm heading out tonight
(And I listen) I'm heading out tonight
They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because she was making it with sisters and brothers
And everyone else, all of the others
Like cheap officers who would stand there and flirt in front of me
They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things that they heard she had done
The black Air Force sergeant was not the first one
And all of the drugs she took, every one, every one
And I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
But my heart is overflowin' anyway
I'm just a tired man, no words to say
But since she lost her daughter
It's her eyes that fill with water
And I am much happier this way
They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because number one was the girl friend from Paris
The things that they did - ah - they didn't have to ask us
And then the Welshman from India, who came here to stay
They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things she did in the streets
In the alleys and bars, no she couldn't be beat
That miserable rotten slut couldn't turn anyone away
I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
But my heart is overflowin' anyway
I'm just a tired man, no words to say
But since she lost her daughter
It's her eyes that fill with water
And I am much happier this way
I was just thinking that I have been missing you for way too long
There's something inside this weary head that wants us to love just instead
But I was just thinking, merely thinking
I've got loads of pictures
I've got the one of you in that dancing dress
But man I feel silly in that dim light
Just after doing you by the sight of My Kodak delights
I am sinking, merely sinking
I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe
I'm a singer without a song
If I wait for you longer my affection is stronger I,
I was just thinking, merely thinking
This boat is sinking
I'm tired of postcards, especially the ones with cute dogs and cupids
I'm tired of calling you, missing you, dreaming I've slept with you
Don't get me wrong I still desperately love you 
Inside this weary head I just want us to love instead
But I was just thinking and thinking, merely thinking
I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe
And time is running me still
If I wait for you longer my affection is stronger
I was just thinking - I was just thinking
That I'm tired of calling you once a week
And thinking of long distance rates instead of kissing you
Baby I'm sinking, merely sinking
Some people think he's good looking
Other people think he's not
Some people don't even know his name
Other people know it by heart
Some people think he likes to go out dancing
Other people not
One guy I know thinks he's hard to get along with
But a lot of people think he's fine
Yeah, yeah, a lot of people think he's fine
And he don't even know
Just sees how each day goes
Some people say she's funny
Other people say she's dumb
Some people say she's stuck-up
Others say she's shy
Some people like her for her charm
Some people take her for granted
Some people wanna steal her heart
Yeah, some people wanna steal her heart
And she don't even know
How could that be so?
It hasn't been that long
Since we drank to the sunset until it was gone
And down with it went our pain and fear
As we slowly broke contact more and more with every beer
And we passed out in each other's arms
Both admitting we'd never felt better, never felt so warm
But awoke in each other's eyes
Without wearing a stitch of clothing, we were both deeply in disguise
And maybe I just set aside the fact that you were brokenhearted
In my own special selfish way
And if I hadn't set aside the fact that you were brokenhearted
Hell knows where your heart would be today
Maybe with me
It seems like it's been so long
Since we kissed through the darkness until it was dawn
Up with it came our pain and fear
That we'd already lost each other, we both knew that the end was near
And maybe I just set aside the fact that you were brokenhearted
In my own special selfish way
And if I hadn't set aside the fact that you were brokenhearted
Hell knows where your heart would be today
Maybe with me
Everything
Is catching up with me
I awake
To find I'm not at all where I
Should be
And it feels
I'm getting to the end
And it's hard
To figure out what's real
And what's
Pretend
To break from what
We're tied to
God knows
How much I've tried to
And I am still inside you
And I am still inside you
I escape
Every now and then
And to think
I find myself
Back here again
And again
I used to know who I was
Until you came along
I return
To the only place
I've ever felt
That I belong
To break from what
We're tied to
God knows
How much I've tried to
And I am still inside you
And I am still inside you
Yeah
She loves him more he loves her more
Seems like they ain't never let each other go
Laughin' and kissin' it's a match made in heaven
Behind the rings on their fingers imprints the ink deep in the inner
That has stained their souls' together now
Stained 'soul mates' forever now
Seems like they've made it to the other side
Where the grass is greener and the sky is always blue
And it goes on forever and forever but iujhiuhiuhiughi
Next door yelling cries mercy she is begging please
'Don't end my life your all I need and darlin' I will never leave never leave'
And then she prayed on her knees
She said
'Save him, save him from the hand that he beats me on'(4x)
Dark clouds cover her paradise
She covers her eyes and hides
Behind enemy lines
And she walks through the night with her child in her arms
She's thrown back hostaged
You see twenty years ago
When she was just ten years old
Lost in imagination
She was left alone
And Pops had nothing to let his anger on
Oh he beat her cold, yes he did
He beat her cold
She used to pray on her knees
She said
Deep at night I'm awakened from my dreams
Next door
Yellin' cries mercy she's beggin please beggin please beggin please
- "Get up get up"
He brings her to her feet and smacks her down till she falls to the ground
Oh and over and over again
He brings her to her feet till she can no longer stand
Oh and still the beating never ends
Oh on and on and on it goes
Until he brings out a gun
And says to her
"Stop crying and bring me my son"
She cries harder and harder
He cries harder and harder
She says
"Baby please don't don't do this"
Oh two shots to her chest
And a blow to his own head
She quickly loses breath
And blood rushes to their bed
And baby cries he cries his eyes out
Yeah
She loves him more he loves her more
Seems like they ain't never let each other go
Laughin' and kissin'
It's a match made in heaven
Hyvyyden varjo peittää kyyneleen
Löytäneen luo vie askeleen
Rauha saa
Kehto uneen tuudittaa
Toivo jää, tie rakkauteen
Tie syvään vapauteen
Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved
If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him,
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love, to dance with my father again
When I and my mother would disagree
To get my way I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me (yeah, yeah)
Then finally make me do just what my momma said
Later that night, when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me
If I could steal
One final glance
One final step
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
'Cause I'd love love love to dance with my father again
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
I'd hear how my mother cried for him
(X2) I'd pray for her even more than me
I know I'm praying for much too much
But could you send back the only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But dear Lord she' s dying to dance with my father again
Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream
When I find myself in times of trouble, mother Mary comes to me,
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me,
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
And when the broken hearted people living in this world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see,
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
Whisper words of wisdom: let it be!
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light, that shines on me,
Shine until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music, mother Mary comes to me,
Speaking words of wisdom, I want you to let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
Oh, there's gonna be an answer: let it be!
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be!
Whisper words of wisdom: let it be...
I believe in medication 
And I believe in therapy 
And I believe in crystal light 
'Cause I believe in me, yeah 
It's so uplifting, fuck yeah 
I barely have motivation 
They say I suffer from a lack of serotonin
Synapses, they happen too infrequently for me 
To be functioning properly 
I took the pills 
I took the advice 
The panic stopped 
But I'm still not right 
Racing thoughts and wasted time 
It's the same old story-line 
This is my nursery rhyme 
And it goes:
I believe in medication 
And I believe in therapy 
And I believe in crystal light 
'Cause I believe in me, yeah 
It's so uplifting, fuck yeah 
I'm barely off the medication 
And now the walls are closing in again 
I can't breathe 
And I can't bleed 
Will you be my alibi? 
Tell them that I truly tried 
To give in? 
Whoa-oh-oh (hoo hoo) 
Whoa-oh-oh (hoo hoo) 
Whoa-oh-oh (hoo hoo) 
Whoa-oh-oh...
She just wept
Like I could not ignore
How can I act
When my heart's on the floor?
She just wept
'Til her eyes became sore
I knew who she was
But I don't any more
She just cried
To the ruins of time
That kept us apart
We were doing just fine
She just wept
She was put to the test
Those that she'd loved
She had learnt to detest
Daddy I've got nothing left
My life is good, my love's a mess
Daddy I've got nothing left
What can I do that's for the best?
Daddy I've got nothing left
My life is good, my love's a mess
Daddy I've got nothing left
What can I do that's for the best?
Yeah, all those stars drip down like butter
And promises are sweet
We hold out our pans with our hands to catch them
We eat them up, drink them up, up, up, up
Hey, let me in
Hey, let me in
I only wish that I could hear you whisper down
Mister fisherman, to a less peculiar ground
He gathered up his loved ones and he brought them all around
To say goodbye, nice try
Hey, let me in
Yeah yeah yeah
Hey, let me in, let me in
I had a mind to try to stop you
Let me in, let me in
Well, I got tar on my feet and I can't see all the birds
Look down and laugh at me
Clumsy, crawling out of my skin
Hey, let me in
Yeah yeah yeah
Hey, let me in
Hey, let me in
Yeah yeah yeah
Hey, let me in
Why am I so damaged, girl?
Why am I such poison, girl?
I don't know how long I can hold on
If it's gonna be like this forever
Why am I so damaged,
Why am I so troubled, girl?
I don't know how long I can hold on
If it's gonna be like this forever
I had the notion that you'd make me change my ways 
My bad habits would be gone in a matter of days 
I had the feeling that you'd open up my eyes 
To a whole new world that had since been in disguise 
But that day will most likely never come for me 
And it's just my luck to end up getting stuck 
To everything you are 
So tonight I'll sit and pick apart your pictures 
And overanalyze your words 
But the truth is that I've never fallen so hard 
It's taking everything in me 
Just to forget your sweater so far 
I had the notion that you'd make me forget the world 
But your undecisive mind shows me that 
You are "just another girl" 
I had the feeling that those looks you gave me were real 
What if I ripped your heart apart at the seams 
Maybe then you'd know how I feel 
But that day will most likely never come for me 
And it's just my luck to end up getting stuck 
To everything you are 
So tonight I'll sit and pick apart your pictures 
And overanalyze your words 
But the truth is that I've never fallen so hard 
It's taking everything in me 
Just to forget your sweater so far 
I can honestly say 
That I never, ever, ever felt this way 
Your lips, your eyelashes, your skin 
These are the parts of your body 
That cause my comatose to begin 
I can honestly say 
That I never, ever, ever felt this way 
Your lips, your eyelashes, your skin 
These are the parts of your body 
That cause my comatose to begin 
I will sleep another day 
I don't really need to anyway 
What's the point when my dreams are infected 
With words you used to say 
I will breathe in a moment 
As long as I keep my distance 
I wouldn't want to go messing anything up 
So don't go worrying about me 
It's not like I think about you constantly 
So maybe I do, but that shouldn't affect 
Your life anymore 
I knew it the moment you walked into the door 
So don't go worrying about me 
It's not like I think about you constantly 
So maybe I do, but that shouldn't affect 
Your life anymore 
I knew it the moment you walked into the door 
I'll let you get the best of me 
Because there's nothing else that I do well 
I'll let you get the best of me 
Because there's nothing else that I do well 
I'll be the giver and you'll be the taker 
I guess that's how this one's gonna go I'll be the giver and you'll be the taker 
You've got me down on my knees and I proclaim
All hail the heartbreaker
I fell in love with you
Long before I knew
What it meant to give everything up
I was a rolling stone
Rolling my way alone
Till you came and made sense out of everything
But you couldn't wait
I couldn't promise you anything
If it was all a mistake
Then I guess we're both to blame
I could have been
So many things
But it would never be enough for you
I was the one
You counted on
But I was never the one for you
Now I know, I lost you a long time ago
City of strangers
Out of danger
In your arms, I was half awake, half asleep
Grab ahold to what I got
Regretting all that I'm not
I couldn't be the one who'd stand by your side
If it was all a mistake
Then I guess we're both to blame
I could have been
So many things
But it would never be enough for you
I was the one
You counted on
But I was never the one for you
Now I know, I lost you a long time ago
I hold no grudges
I come bearing forgiveness
Only love, only love
Even if it's not enough
Only love, only love
Even if it's not enough
Now I know, I lost you a long time ago
I could have been
So many things
But it would never be enough for you
I was the one
You counted on
But I was never the one for you
Now I know, I lost you a long time ago
I was buried alive
I came back to haunt you
Are you dying to believe
I can't go on without you?
All we are is too fast for love
We're too young
I hate to love you
The night's gone
And you're gone too.
But you can't be missed
If you never go away
It's the end of a broken heart
I went on without you
I was lost from the start
I did what I had to
All we are is too fast for love
We're too young
I hate to love you
The night's gone
And you're gone too.
But you can't be missed
If you never go away
You don't know what I've seen
You can see that I've been damaged
Without you
And I don't know where you've been
I can wash your sins away
We're too young
I hate to love you
The night's gone
And you're gone too.
But you can't be missed
If you never go away
It's the end of a broken heart [x4]
Nothing could be bring me closer
Nothing could be bring me near
Where is the road I follow
To leave, leave?
It's under, under, under my feet
The sea spread out there before me
Where do I go when the land touches sea?
There is my trust in what I believe
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me down
To leave it, believe it
Leave it all behind
Shifting the dream
Nothing could bring me further from my old friend time
Shifting the dream
It's charging the scene
I know where I marked the signs
I suffer the dreams of a world gone mad
I like it like that and I know it
I know it well, ugly and sweet
I temper madness with an even extreme
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me down
I say that I'm a bantam lightweight
I say that I'm a phantom airplane
That never left the ground
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me down
To leave, believe it
Leave it all behind
Lift me, lift me
I attain my dream
I lost myself, I lost the
Heartache calling me
I lost myself in sorrow
I lost myself in pain
I lost myself in gravity
Memory, leave, leave, leave
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me down
To leave it, believe it
Leave it all behind
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me down
To leave it, believe it
Leave it all behind
Lift my hands, my eyes are still
I'll walk into the sea
Shoot myself in a different place
And leave it
I've longed for this to take me
I've longed for my release
I've waited for the callin'
To leave, leave
Leave, leave
Leavin', leavin'
From the back of your big brown eyes
I knew you'd be gone as soon as you could
And I hoped you would
We could see that you weren't yourself
And the lines on your face did tell
It's just as well
You'd never be yourself again
Saw you last night
Dance by the light of the moon
Stars in your eyes
Free from the life that you knew
You're the magic that holds the sky up from the ground
You're the breath that blows these cool winds 'round
Trading places with an angel now
Saw you last night
Dance by the light of the moon
Stars in your eyes
Free from the life that you knew
Saw you last night
Stars in the sky
Smiled in my room
Hungry, hungry again
Hungry, hungry again
When will it start to sway
When will it start to
Almost break you
Hungry, hungry again
Hungry, hungry again
I'll miss you
I don't wish you hurt
I forgive you
I don't wish you away,
Away, away
It'll almost break you
Almost take you
Almost break you
Almost break you up
Are you feeling lost and lonely?
You needn't be
Like you've lost all hope and your sanity
Oh you needn't be
If we only have one turn
In this life we have to learn
Carrying the world on your shoulders
You needn't be
Ever more as you get older
You needn't be, oh you needn't be
If we only have one turn
In this life we have to learn
We wish our lives away
Hoping for a better day
The future's miles away
And what is past is done and gone
If we only have one turn
In this life we have to learn
So the water's thickening 
His collar's pulled, begin to be aware 
(It's on) that he needs to focus 
Beyond that man, he brings a world of pain 
Cause 
The war is on, too weak to move 
Call it off, sorry refused 
So we bend the bracket
Shove it down anything to make it fit 
(It's on,) and being foolish won't cover up 
Exposing them as fakes
But
The war is on, too weak to move 
Call it off, sorry refused 
So boredom captured another fool 
Shredding him to bits
(It's on)
And the more we tense up, avoiding pain 
You'll never learn a thing
Cause
The war is on, too weak to move 
Call it off, sorry refused
Don't write me no more letters, my mailbox is full of bombs
Between you and the kooks on my block
I don't remember the good times, I wasn't there when you were kind
And my wife has some dogs in our yard
And I cannot hold a candle for every pretty gun
We were strangers many hours and I missed you for so long
When we were liars, lovers in combat
Faded like your name on those jeans that I burned
But I am older now
And we did it when we were young
I am older now
And we did it when we were young
There are no reasons to believe, I buried my faith in another plot
With your heart and your clothes when I find
That I don't feel you or recall, I'll put your bones out in the yard
For someone else to be called and called by
And I cannot hold a candle for every pretty gun
We were strangers many hours and I missed you for so long
When we were liars, lovers in combat
Faded like your name on those jeans that I burned
But I am older now
And we did it when we were young
I am older now
And we did it when we were young
I am older now
And we did it when we were young
I am older now
And we did it when we were young
I know I can't find you 
I'll go to sit beside you 
I need to remind you 
That I still, I still love you 
I know I can't find you 
I'll show every one around you 
That I need to be with you 
I still, I still love you 
But I know, I can't find you 
I know, I can't find you 
I know, I can't find you 
I know, I can't find you
God, please bring the rain 
Yeah, and bring it soon 
Let it flood right through the houses 
Into Judy's room 
With a father on amphetamines 
Her mother hides the pearls 
Reach out into the darkness 
And find my little girl 
'Cause she's angry like a salesman 
That couldn't make a sale 
Threw her wedding ring in the sewer 
And damned them all to hell 
Please lead her to the mountain 
That you fashioned out of sand 
While the roaches climb the walls 
From the hotel where he calls 
Most people never find a love 
Most people never find a love 
Sometimes you just can be a man
Sometimes you just can be a man
When your living in the darkness 
Of the shadowlands 
The shadowlands 
The shadowlands
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long I'll be here
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long
I've checked
I've checked to find
I've checked
I've checked to find
I am not for you one
There's no telling how long
Go figure that out
Figure that out
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I've checked
I've checked to find
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long I'll be here
I am not what you want
There's no eyes in your own head
I'll check
I'll check tonight
I am not what you want
There's no telling how long I'll be here
I am not what you want
There's no eyes in your head
In your head
At least I cannot see them
In your head
I'm not what you want
I'll get
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Tonight
I'm not what you want
There's no telling how long I'll be here
Be here
At least I cannot see them
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like I want to
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable,
Instead of just invisible
Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna look in your eyes
And make you realise
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
Świat wypadł mi z moich rąk
Jakoś tak nie jest mi nawet żal
Czy ty wiesz jak chciałbyś żyć, bo ja też
Chyba tak chciałem przez cały czas, lecz
Jeśli muszę i wybrać będę mógł jak odejść
To przecież dobrze, dobrze o tym wiem
Chciałbym umrzeć przy tobie
Wieje wiatr, pachnie wiosną i wiem
Że ty łatwo tak zgodziłaś na to się i
Jeśli muszę i wybrać będę mógł jak odejść
To przecież dobrze, dobrze o tym wiem
Chciałbym umrzeć przy tobie
Jeśli kiedyś wybrać będę mógł jak to zrobić
To przecież dobrze, dobrze o tym wiem
Chciałbym umrzeć z miłości
Nie na krześle, nie we śnie
Nie w spokoju i nie w dzień
Nie chcę łatwo, nie za sto lat
Chciałbym umrzeć z miłości
Nie bez bólu i nie w domu
Nie chcę szybko i nie chcę młodo
Nie szczęśliwie i wśród bliskich
Chciałbym umrzeć z miłości
Pretty Mary K walks along the dock
With some sailor's pay shoved down in her sock
Pretty Mary K with some little boy in blue
Who can't stay away from you
Pretty Mary K took him back to town
I'm down here by the bay where the water pounds
Up against the wall crying black and blue
He Keeps me away from you
Pretty words that you whispered
Maybe I misunderstood
Somebody's not paying attention to
What they promise and their word isn't good
Oh, Mary K, I can see your face
Down there in the waves, faded and erased
But I know it's just a reflection of the moon
A big fake resembling you
I'm going to go down in the water
Fill my mouth up full of sand
I'll be waiting still impatient
With my dead imagination while you're with some other man
Pretty Mary K is off in somebody's room
I'm down here by the bay, my arm around the moon
But I'll be with you soon just as soon as I've paid
A walk across the water with pretty Mary K
Walk on water, pretty Mary K
There are beads that wrap
Around your knees that crackle into the dark
Like a walk in the park, like a hole in your head
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world
And I guess it's worth your time
Because there's some lives you live
And some you leave behind
It gets hard to explain
The gardenhead knows my name
Leave me alone,
For you know this isn't the first time
In fact this is twice in a row
That the angels have slipped through our landslide
And filled up our garden with snow
And I don't wish to taste of your insides
Or to call out your name through my phone
For the glory boys at your bedside will love you
As long as you're something to own
Follow me through a city of frost covered angels
I swear I have nothing to prove
I just want to dance in your tangles
To give me some reason to move
But to take on the world at all angles
Requires a strength I can't use
So I'll meet you up high in your anger
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you
Someday they'll find your small town world
On a big town avenue
Gonna make you like the way they talk
When they're talking to you
Gonna make you break out of your shell
'Cause they tell you to
Gonna make you like the way they lie
Better than the truth
They'll tell you everything
You wanted someone else to say
They're gonna break your heart, yeah
From what I've seen
You're just one more hand me down
'Cause no one's tried to give you
What you need
So lay all your troubles down
I am with you now
Somebody oughta take you in
Try to make you love again
Try to make you like the way they feel
When they're under your skin
Never once do you think that they would lie
When they're holding you
Then you wonder why they haven't called
When they said they'd call you
You'll start to wonder
If you're ever gonna make it by
You'll start to think
You were born blind
I'm here for the hard times
The straight to your heart times
When living ain't easy
You can stand up against me
And maybe rely on me
And cry on me, yeah
Oh no, no, no
Someday they'll open up your world
Shake you down to the drawing board
They'll do their best to change you
They still can't erase you
Lay them down on me
Oh yeah
You're just one more hand me down
And all those nights
Don't give you what you need
So lay all your troubles down
On me
I'm gonna die of loneliness, I know
I'm gonna die of loneliness, for sure
I'm gonna die of loneliness, I know
I'm gonna die of loneliness, for sure
My dearest friend
You'll soon begin to love again
To love again
School holiday that she could do without,
A weekend break that slept in late.
A beach resort under a year of rain,
This is where it has to start.
When the AC hum inside your sleepy head,
Drowns the startup chime inside your heart,
Technology is there to cure yourself,
This is where it has to start
Unfamiliar brand falls from an empty shelf,
Without sounding an alarm,
The test results tell you nothing at all,
This is where it has to start.
When the AC hum inside your sleepy head,
Drowns the startup chime inside your heart,
Technology is there to cure yourself,
This is where it has to start.
The Northern Lights are just a band for hire,
Playing class reunions without end.
The test results tell you nothing at all...
Technology is there to cure yourself...
A dusty cartridge from the VCs is on the way to see old friends,
This is where it has to start.
The buttons on my phone are worn thin
I don't think that I knew the chaos I was getting in.
But I've broken all my promises to you
I've broken all my promises to you.
Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this so easily?
You make it hard to smile because
You make it hard to breathe
Why do you do this to me?
A phrasing that's a single tear,
Iis harder than I ever feared
And you were left feeling so alone.
Because these days aren't easy
Like they have been once before
These days aren't easy anymore.
Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this so easily?
You make it hard to smile because
You make it hard to breathe
Why do you do this to me?
To me, to me, to me...
I should've known this wasn't real
And fought it off and fought to feel
What matters most? Everything
That you feel while listening to every word that I sing.
I promise you I will bring you home
I will bring you home.
Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this so easily?
You make it hard to smile because
You make it hard to breathe
Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this so easily?
You make it hard to smile because
You make it hard to breathe
Why do you do this to me?
To me, to me, to me...
The snow in Montana was three feet high
The lady at the counter said: There ain't no flights
And so he called her on the telephone
He said: I'll rent a car and I'll drive home.
And she said: I'll wait for you
Like I did last year
At Christmas time with your family here
And your truck broke down out in San Antone
And the gifts stayed wrapped until you got home
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you.
Now he's on his cell phone in a Coupe Deville
Talkin' to the one he loves and always will
His heart is breakin' 'cause she's there alone
Her heart is achin' 'cause she wants him home
She says: I'll wait for you like in '68
When our child was due, but I said, he'll have to wait
Until his dad gets here and stands by my side
Remember, Dear, our son's first cry
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you.
He didn't stop all day to eat a bite
And he finally got there around midnight
The doctor said, she's in a better place
She said to give this you this note just in case.
And it said, I'll wait for you at Heaven's gate
Oh, I don't care how long it takes
And I'll tell Saint Pete I can't come in
Without my love and my best friend
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you.
P.S. I love you, too
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you...
The wall breaks on the phone if at all, if you call. 
A hole from which to see your head, 
If words are dead. 
Some things always stay the same. 
How you looked wet from all the rain. 
Like lavender the smell of your hair, 
Silly errs postponing your despair. 
And I'll wait, I'll wait. 
Take a ticket to my own fate. 
Maybe I'm too late.
And this wall breaks on the phone it at all, if you call.
A hole from which to see your head, 
If words are dead.
Some things always stay the same. 
How you looked wet from all the rain. 
Some things always stay the same.
Everyone has their obsession
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
They hold high their prized possession
That defines the meaning of their lives
You are mine
There are objects of affection
That can mesmerize the soul
There is always one addiction
That just can not be controlled
You are mine
Everyone has their obsession
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
They hold high their prized possession
They hold high their prized possession
You are mine
The day you went away
You had to screw me over
I guess you didn't know
All the stuff you left me with
Is way too much to handle
But I guess you don't care
You don't need to preach
You don't have to love me, all the time
Whatever on earth possessed you
To make this bold decision
I guess you don't need me
While whispering those words
I cried like a baby
Hoping you would care
You don't need to preach
You don't have to love me, all the time
You don't have to preach
All the time
Now you're gone
I wonder why you left me here
I think about it on and on and on and on and on again
I know you're never coming back
I hope that you can hear me
I'm waiting to hear from you
Until I do
You're gone away
I'm left alone
A part of me is gone
And I'm not moving on
So wait for me
I know the day will come
I'll meet you there
No matter where life takes me to
I'll meet you there
And even if I need you here
I'll meet you there
I wish I could have told you
The things I kept inside
But now I guess it's just too late
So many things remind me of you
I hope that you can hear me
I miss you
This is goodbye
One last time
You're gone away
I'm left alone
A part of me is gone
And I'm not moving on
So wait for me
I know the day will come
I'll meet you there
No matter where life takes me to
I'll meet you there
And even if I need you here
I'll meet you there
(X's 2)
And where I go you'll be there with me
Forever you'll be right here with me
I'll meet you there
No matter where life takes me to
I'll meet you there
And even if I need you
I'll meet you there
(X's 2)
Oh wake me please when this is over
Oh when the ice is melted away
And the hunger returns
I will be the same but older
And maybe twice the bear that I thought I was
Where have you been?
And what have you done?
I've been under the ground
Reading prayers from this old book I found
Under the ground
Saving it up
And spending it all
On moving pictures
Silent films
Moving pictures
Silent films
Oh is this the dream I've been saving?
Oh where the heart beats slower and slower
To almost nothing
Almost nothing
Almost nothing
I took it for love
Or at least something beautiful
Out there in the spotlight
But turned around softly
Turned around squinting
And saw that it was headlights
And then the truth
The truth was unbearable
Oh and imminent
Bearing down on these two shadow animals
Caught painting a dotted line
Caught painting a dotted line
Caught painting a dotted line
Where have you been?
And what have you done?
I've been under the ground
Reading prayers from this old book I found
Under the ground
Saving it up
And spending it all
On moving pictures
Silent films
Moving pictures
Silent films
Something suddenly unclear
Someone suddenly my fear
My eyes demand like broken eaves
The ladle over spills on eaves
If you once knew
How I loved you
And my bruise-colored eyes peeled
Every image to your face and heel
And if you're happy I am, too
And if you're sleeping I'm with you
But you love someone else
But you want to be with someone else
And I can't believe how dumb I sound
And I put my face over the ground
(Repeat)
Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would
And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
To that voice of reason inside my head telling me that we're no good
But tonight I'm gonna give it one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
Tomorrow I'll be stronger
I'm not gonna break down and call you up when my heart cries out for you
And tomorrow, you won't believe it
But when I pass your house, I won't stop no matter how bad I want to
But tonight I'm gonna give it one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow
Baby when we're good, you know we're great
But there's too much bad for us to think
That there's anything worth trying to save
But tonight I'm gonna give it one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
Tomorrow, I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would
Born into race and nation
Accept family and obligation
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen
Embrace tradition and occupation
Cull memory for assimilation
Secure for future generations
Secure for future generations
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen
Laying in this cold field
Waiting for the call
Feeling right here in this uniform
I think I got them all
Academic or street education
Obtain degree in annihilation
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen
I'm not a citizen, I'm not a citizen
Laying down in chambers
Waiting for the call
Seen your kind so many times
You got no chance at all
Laid out immobile
Hoping for that call
It's in my mouth
Under my skin sodium pentathol
Sodium pentathol
Sodium pentathol
Your body's warm but you are not
You give a little not a lot
You coup your love until we kiss
You're all I want but not like this
I'm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here
It's only your shadow, never yourself
It's only your shadow, nobody else
It's only your shadow, filling the room
Arriving too late, and leaving too soon
And leaving too soon...
Your body gives but then holds back
The sun is bright, the sky is black
Can only be another sign
I cannot keep what isn't mine
You left and it lingers on
But you, you were almost gone
It's only your shadow, never yourself
It's only your shadow, nobody else
It's only your shadow, filling the room
Arriving too late, and leaving too soon
And leaving too soon...
I cannot tell if you mean what you say
You say it so loud, but you sound far away
Maybe I had just a glimpse of your soul
Or was that your shadow I saw on the wall
I'm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here
It's only your shadow, never yourself
It's only your shadow, nobody else
It's only your shadow, filling the room
Arriving too late
No, no, no
It's only your shadow
It's only your shadow, nobody else
It's only your shadow
Arriving too late and leaving too soon
It's only your shadow
Go
One, two, three, four
Rejoice, rejoice, God's ears are stitches
Oh rejoice, his eyes are big X's
Oh rejoice, his arms are burning witches
Oh rejoice, his hands perform hexes
Rejoice despite the fact this world will hurt you
And rejoice despite the fact this world will kill you
And rejoice despite the fact this world will tear you to shreds
Rejoice because you're trying your best
And rejoice, the bed you sleep in is burning
Oh rejoice, the sky's fucking falling
Oh rejoice, the world we know is turning
Oh rejoice, your father's been calling
Rejoice although this world will devastate you
And rejoice although this world will penetrate you
And rejoice although you will not survive
Rejoice you'll never make it out alive
And rejoice, your hair it smells like burning hair
Oh rejoice, your nails all got chewed off
Oh rejoice, and holy fuck you're bleeding there
Oh rejoice, you burned your whole beard off
Rejoice despite the fact this world will hurt you
And rejoice despite the fact this world will kill you
And rejoice despite the fact this world will tear you to shreds
Rejoice because you're trying your best
Since you're gone, I sat at home
Wonder why no I'll never be free
But the thought of you
Goin' with another guy
No, it could never be me
You took a ring and pawned our love away
What can I say, I am left behind
So I take a drink, another cigarette
I can't forget that you once were mine
What can I say?
I guess it wasn't meant to be
Now you're gone
It's just, your love is like a drug
It's been so long
Your folks have bet you gone
I know that you're alive inside
So I hope and pray you won't throw this love away
I just wish that you still were mine
You're my
You're my
You're my baby baby baby baby baby
You're my baby baby baby baby baby
Yeah yeah
Oh-oh
It was the summer 2001
All before the drama begun
When we first met
I seen you sitting out on your steps
You was broke down crying a mess
So I interfered
I asked what's the reason for tears
I was wishing you could tell me your fears
But I had to start with ya name
You told me how ya man playin' games
So I said that it was time for a change
And you just laughed
But it looked like you ain't laughed in while
I was glad I could give you a smile
Then we both blushed
But really girl it ain't no rush
I was thinking that maybe we can discuss
A future for us
Cause homeboy just got you crushed
You need to leave that clown in the dust
Trust
I just wanna talk
I'm thinking I can give you a call
And we can pick it up
Where we left off
I'll holla tomorrow
Girl I understand you loyal to ya man
And that's all right aww baby
But that don't change the fact
That you fight and you stay crying every night Oh baby
Girl you got to let him know
You can't live like this no more
Aww baby
Can't you see
Together you and me could be so special baby
Our feelings get greater
A million days later
Talking all night "please stay up" but
Here comes ya ex
Returned with that drama and stress
All the nonsense that you just left but yet
You accept and go back to try it again
Then return with a broken heart
That I gotta mend
That's unfair
I've only been your lover and friend
And homey there he just front and pretend
But you don't care
The life he leads is unsafe
I would never place my hands to your face
But still I chase
Cat and mouse
First you kick him out
Then you at his house
What is that about
I can't figure you out
Even your friend said I was better
But you listen to them never like "uh-uh whatever"
So the next time he hurt you again
You already knew where you should've been
And that's with me
Girl I understand you loyal to ya man
And that's all right aww baby
But that don't change the fact
That you fight and you stay crying every night Oh baby
Girl you got to let him know
You can't live like this no more
Aww baby
Can't you see
Together you and me could be so special baby
All the times 2way me
Telling me that you miss me
Wanting me to come over and keep you busy
Remember that
Now that you gone
It's been kinda hard
Can't think, can't sleep
Can't do nothing at all
Just tell me why you had to go back
See you ain't have to go through that (u ain't have to go through that)
My baby
You could've been here right by my side
Me and you at the park taking walks outside
But Instead, I keep on having these dreams
Waiting for my phone to ring
My baby
Wishing that it would be you
But I know that that wont come true
My baby
Girl I understand you loyal to ya man
And that's all right aww baby
But that don't change the fact
That you fight and you stay crying every night Oh baby
Girl you got to let him know
You can't live like this no more
Aww baby
Can't you see
Together you and me could be so special baby
Instrumental
Ran into you yesterday
Memories rushed through my brain
Its starting to hit me
Now you're not with me
I realize I made a mistake
I thought that I needed some space
But I just let love go to waste
It's so crystal clear now
That I need you here now
I gotta get you back today
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
Showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time Ill take the chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me
I hit the bar every night
Looking to score a good time
It's not like I planned it
Left empty handed
'Cause I'm still alone in my mind
Now what will it take to feel right
Can I come see you tonight
Is there someone new now
What can I do now
'Cause I need you back by my side
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
Showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time Ill take the chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me
Last time I wasn't sure.
This time I will give you more
I'm more mature
Ill show you
Last time I didn't know
I messed up let her let you go
I need you, don't say no
Laying alone in this room
All that is missing is you
Pick up the phone
Wont you come home
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I' m showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time Ill take the chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me
All of me
The silence keeps it easy
Keeps you safe for the moment.
As you're walking away
Your foot steps get louder.
All you needed was time
But now time will destroy us.
It will all be over, and here we are
We're stuck inside this salted earth together.
You'll pierce my lungs
My limbs go numb
As my colors fade out.
You watch me bleed.
You watch me bleed.
I gave you everything to die with a smile
All you wanted was to live for a while
You took everything but it left you empty
You can't replace me, you can't.
It's almost over, and here we are
We're stuck inside this salted earth together.
You'll pierce my lungs
My limbs go numb
As my colors fade out.
You watch me bleed.
You watch me bleed.
It will all be over, and here we are
We'll die inside this salted earth together.
You'll pierce my lungs
My limbs go numb
As my colors fade out.
You watch me bleed.
You watch me bleed.
You watch me bleed.
You watch me bleed.
Watch me bleed.
And he's mean talking beanstalking icey man
My feet are walking over him
My sneakers in his hand
And with a picket for a knife
And a rocket to depart in
My life had barely started since you jumped all my heart
And now we're lazy
Lazy ooh lazy
In a galaxy of stars with nothing in the middle
'Cept the planet that we own and its playing 2nd fiddle
And we're playing 2nd fiddle
And we're bogged down in a delta of glee
My mouth has sprung wide open
We got tickets they were free
And can you keep sleeping metaphysical girl
Since the stars predicted something new would reconnect our worlds
And now we're lazy
Can we grow out?
And he's mean talking beanstalking icey man
My feet are walking over him
My sneakers in his hand
And with a picket for a knife
And a rocket to depart in
My life had barely started since you jumped all on my heart
Staring at my picture book
She looks like Mary, Queen of Scots
She seemed very regal to me
Just goes to show how wrong you can be
I'm gonna stop wastin' my time
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
My castle, kids and home
I thought she was Mary, Queen of Scots
I tried so very hard
Shows just how wrong you can be
I'm gonna stop wasting time
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
...
Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug, yeah, I've had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You're all vampires, so here
You can have my heart (My heart, my heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, my heart)
My heart (My heart, my heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, my heart)
The world's a funeral, I run with ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin and bone
They kick the chair but we, we helped tie the rope
(My heart, my heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, my heart)
My heart (My heart, my heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, my heart)
So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now there's no way back
You must have made some kind of mistake
I asked for death but instead I'm awake
The Devil told me: "No room for cheats"
I thought I sold my soul but he kept the receipt
So leave the light on, I'm coming home
It's getting darker but I carry on
The sun don't shine but it never did
And when it rains it fucking pours, but I think I like it
And you know that I'm in love with the mess
I think I like it
So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now there's no way back
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now there's no way back
So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now there's no way back
I've hardly been outside my room in days,
'Cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays.
The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away,
And it was then I realized that conscience never fades.
When you're young you have this image of your life:
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife.
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross,
And if you happen to you wake completely lost.
But I will fight for you, be sure that
I will fight until we're the special two once again.
And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands will not be taught to hold another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
And we could only see each other, we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
I remember someone old once said to me:
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell,
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell.
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face?
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place.
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now,
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not
Let you down 'cause we were the special two, and will be again.
And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's
'Cause we're the special two.
I step outside my mind's eyes for a minute.
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease,
Or something that could ease the pain.
But nothing cures the hurt you bring on by yourself,
Just remembering, just remembering how we were
And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together,
These hands would not be taught to hold another's,
We were the special two.
And we could only see each other we'd bleed together,
These arms would not be taught to need another's
'Cause we're the special two.
What did you think
I would do at this moment?
When you're standing before me
With tears in your eyes,
Trying to tell me that you
Have found you another
And you just don't love me no more.
What did you think
I would say at this moment?
When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me.
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you?
'Cause you just don't love me no more.
Did you think I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you?
Oh, come on, you know me too well
And how can I hurt you,
When darling I love you
And you know I would never hurt you
No, no, no!
What did you think
I would give at this moment?
If you'd just stay, I'd subtract
Twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees,
I'd kiss the ground that you walk on,
If I could just hold you again.
I'd fall down on my knees,
Kiss the ground that you walk on, baby,
If I could just hold you,
If I could just hold you,
I would fall down, down on my knees,
Oh, God, please...
Let me hold you, let me hold you again.
Woooooh, Woooooh.
I'm gonna miss you girl,
I'm gonna miss you girl.
I can see the tears in your eyes, baby
Babe, I know,
You know I'm down on my knees
What do you think I would do, baby?
Did you think I could hurt you?
Who has dressed you in strange clothes of sand
Who has taken you far from my land
Who has said that my sayings were wrong
And who will say that I stayed much too long?
Clothes of sand have covered yor face
Given you meaning but taken my place
So make your way on down to the sea
Something has taken you so far from me.
Does it now seem worth all the colour of skies
To see the earth through painted eyes
To look through panes of shaded glass
See the stains of winter's grass.
Can you now return to from where you came
Try to burn your changing name
Or with silver spoons and coloured light
Will you worship moons in winter's night.
Clothes of sand have covered your face
Given you meaning but taken my place
So make your way on down to the sea
Something has taken you so far from me.
Daddy, please hear this song that I sing
In your heart there's a spark that just screams for a lover to bring
A child to your chest that could lay as you sleep
And love all you have left like your boy used to be
Long ago, wrapped in sheets warm and wet
Blister please with those wings in your spine
Love to be with a brother of mine, how he'd love to find
Your tongue in his teeth in a struggle to find
Secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight
Sounding only at night as you sleep
And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying
As your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet
Rings of flowers 'round your eyes and I'll love you
For the rest of your life when you're ready
Brother, see we are one in the same
And you left with your head filled with flames and you watched as your brains
Fell out through your teeth, push the pieces in place, make your smile sweet to see
Don't you take this away, I'm still wanting my face on your cheek
And when we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place where some holy spectacle lies
When we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life
Two-headed boy, she is all you could need
She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires
And retire to sheets safe and clean
But don't hate her when she gets up to leave
This song is for the rats
Who hurled themselves into the ocean
When they saw that the explosives in the cargo hold
Were just about to blow
This song is for the soil
That's toxic clear down to the bedrock
Where no thing of consequence can grow
Drop your seeds there, let them go
Let them all go
Let 'em all go
This song is for the people
Who tell their families that they're sorry
For things they can't
And won't feel sorry for
And once there was a desk
And now it's in a storage locker somewhere
And this song is for the stick pins and the cottons
I left in the top drawer
Let 'em all go
Let 'em all go
I wanna sing one for the cars
That are right now headed silent down the highway
And it's dark and there is nobody driving
And something has got to give
I saw you waiting by the roadside
You didn't know that I was watching
Now you know
Let it all go
Let 'em all go
Let it all go
I took the supermarket flowers from the window sill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, "Hallelujah
You're home"
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, "Hallelujah
You're home"
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back he said, "Hallelujah
You're home"
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away
 
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away
 
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
 
Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away (I know, I know, I know, I know, I know)
Anytime she goes away (I know, I know, I know, I know, I know)
Anytime she goes away (I know, I know, I know, I know, I know)
Anytime she goes away (I know, I know, I know, I know, I know)
Anytime she goes away (I know, I know, I know, I know, I know)
I took you to the train
Stupid shit you just play
I took the pictures in my head
You look like a skeleton, a little dressy thing
You just didn't care
You're all getting drunk instead
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
I love you though
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
Well, don't you know
The state of what you've got?
It's a dizzy hot and just damn forgot
Stay well away from trouble that you caused
Using all your strength
To keep the world at an arm's length
And I get upset that something was lost
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
I love you though
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
Well, don't you know
I'm a glad reflection of you
I can't make corrections for you
You have to help to patch things up
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
I love you though
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
Well, don't you know?
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
I love you though
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
Well, don't you know?
No
And so it's begun 
This is year one 
The birth of a child in the form of a man 
Wrapped in towel 
Passed out on the floor 
These drunken hours -- graces deflowered 
Cast down by an angel 
She used to kiss his weeping eyes 
Depressed in her bosom 
Tears roll off her nipple 
Sweet baby, don't cry... 
Your tears are only alibis 
To prove you still feel -- 
You only feel sorry for yourself 
Well, get on that cross 
That's all you're good for... 
And thusly it ends 
Depression seeps in on a lonely messiah 
Now he drinks with the lepers 
Losing a limb, his better half 
A glass once half full 
A head hung half-mast 
He claims he's the victim 
Strangled by the nine-to-five 
And a pattern of stillness 
That haunted this still life 
Your tears are only alibis 
To prove you still feel 
You only feel sorry for yourself 
And that's how you thrive 
Your sorrow's your goldmine 
So write some sad song about me 
Screaming your agonies, playing the saint 
The Martyr...
The Martyr...
The Martyr...
The Martyr...
The Martyr...
Uh huh...
So you trying to do what they did
Your friends that turn to liquid
And got lost in the sea
And now you're drowning me
With your talk of four leaf clovers
You turn to rocks and omen
To beat the ambient harm
But it's bruising your karma
Oh I wish my arms were wider
I wish that I could hide you
So you can rest and repair
Without the blanket of sorrow
The thick and the grey
Your blanket of woe
So heavy and stained
And it only weighs you down
So you thought that getting sober
Would mean your life was over
I don't think it's that bad
I don't think it's that sad
Just you sleep a little baby
Leave the world alone and later
If you wake up alive
That old blanket of sorrow
Could be feathers and down
Your blanket of woe
Would leave you alone
And I can love you till you drown
Come to me let's drown
Come baby let's drown
In feathers and down
At dead of night, when strangers roam
The streets in search of anyone who'll take them home
I lie alone, the clock strikes three
And anyone who wanted to could contact me
At dead of night, 'til break of day
Endless thoughts and questions keep me awake
It's much too late
Where've you been?
Who've you seen?
You didn't phone when you said you would!
Do you lie?
Do you try
To keep in touch? You know you could
I've tried to see your point of view
But could not hear or see
For jealousy
I never knew time passed so slow
I wish I'd never met you, or that I could bear to let you go
At dead of night, 'til break of day
Endless thoughts and questions keep me awake
It's much too late
Where've you been?
Who've you seen?
You didn't phone when you said you would!
Do you lie?
Do you try
To keep in touch? You know you could
I've tried to see your point of view
But could not hear or see
For jealousy
Where've you been?
Who've you seen?
You didn't phone when you said you would!
Do you lie?
Do you try
To keep in touch? You know you could
I've tried to see your point of view
But could not hear or see
For jealousy
Where've you been?
Who've you seen?
You didn't phone when you said you would!
Do you lie?
Do you try
To keep in touch? You know you could
I've tried to see your point of view
But could not hear or see
For jealousy
Where've you been?
Who've you seen?
You didn't phone when you said you would!
Do you lie?
Do you try
To keep in touch? You know you could
I've tried to see your point of view
But could not hear or see
For jealousy
I never knew 'til I met you

Baby thinks he's dying
Lost inside his bedroom
Mommy won't stop crying
And daddy's always working
There's no going back
There's no going back
There's no going back
On this one
Baby wakes up with the sun
While everyone is sleeping
He thinks he's going crazy
But this could be the big one
There's no going back
There's no going back
There's no going back
Sleeping with ghosts
It's such a lonely experience
The stars are out tonight
Only they can hear you breathing
You're so like a rose
You're so like a rose
You're so like a rose
I wish you could stay here
Arise oh brother mountain
Our hooves hammering your coils
The rivers carve out your hollows
With tears from me
Return to me
Return to me my love
Oh my love
Be still oh rusting river
Unlock her name from your grass
Unburden the pressures of fathoms
Of tears from me
Return to me
Return to me my love
O my love
O my love
Return to the clouds
Return in the caves
Return over valleys
O my love
O my love
O my love
Johnny's daddy, was takin' him fishin', when he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate, holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled, said we can't leave her behind
Son I know you don't want her to go, but someday you'll change your mind
And Johnny said
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson, take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as, long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please, don't take the girl
Same old boy, same sweet girl, ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in, front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun, grabbed her by the arm
Said if you do what I tell you to there, won't be any harm
And Johnny said
Take my money, take my wallet, take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me, here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please, don't take the girl
Same old boy, same sweet girl, five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she, says it's time to go
Doctor says the baby's fine, but you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast and, Johnny hit his knees
And there he prayed
Take the very, breath you gave me, take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me, make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God please, don't take the girl
Johnny's daddy was taking him fishin'
When he was eight years old
Run me out again
You that I'm tired
You know that I'm ill
But it don't matter 'cause
I know that you will
Run me out again
I am the wilderness locked in a cage
I am a growing force you kept in place
I am a tree reaching for the sun
Please don't hold me down
Please don't hold me down
I am a rolling wave without the motion
A glass of water longing for the ocean
I am an asphalt flower breaking free but you keep stopping me
Release me
Release me
I am the rain that's coming down on you
That you shielded yourself from with a roof
I am the fire burning desperately but you're controlling me
Release me
Release me
I can't believe your thinking
Save everyone, inside you
Take everything
Fake everything
Save everything
About me
All of you, all right
Just because, I want to know
Do you still come last night clear eyes pale
You never got there even though you say you will
Sorry now that you've fallen from my eyes
That's the truth
Why are you telling me about everything
Why tell me about anything
You're just waiting for her to come apart
You're just waiting for her
Take everything
Fake everything
Save everything
Waking up zeroed in on medicine
Am I waking up at all today?
Seeing lights, feeling pain, there's my cure on ice
I can walk but I will crawl there
I will crawl there
Sitting straight, feeling faint, an exhausted smile
Screens my words but I will hear them
Here's a phrase that we all know, but I can't make sense
I don't know words but I will hear them
I still hear them
Never ran away for the sake of scars
Tried not to move but she was armed
And shots were fired
Now a hole in the head of this wounded liar
Never had a drink that I didn't like
Got a taste of you, threw up all night
I got more sick
With every sour second rate kiss
Everything I never would miss again
Waking up, I'm zeroed in on medicine
Am I waking up at all today?
I'm eeing lights, feeling pain, there's my cure on ice
I can walk but I will crawl there
I will crawl there
Never ran away for the sake of scars
Tried not to move but she was armed
And shots were fired
Now there's a hole in the head of this wounded liar
Never had a drink that I didn't like
Got a taste of you, threw up all night
I got more sick
With every sour second rate kiss
Everything I never would miss again
Now I don't know, now I don't know
I don't know who your boyfriend is
In a dark room we fight, make up for our love.
I've been thinking, thinking about you, about us.
And we're moving slow, our hearts beat so fast.
I've been dreaming, dreaming about you, about us.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head, oh.
I was speaking soft, see the pain in your eyes
I've been feeling, feeling for you, my love.
And our bodies are tired, our shadows will dance
I've been aching, aching for you, my love.
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head, oh.
My love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be
Hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves
And I'm complicated, you won't get me I've trouble
Understanding myself, understanding myself
And my love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be
Hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves
And I'm complicated, you won't get me I've trouble
Understanding myself, understanding myself
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head is a jungle, jungle
My head, oh, oh, oh, oh oh...
Daddy, please hear this song that I sing
In your heart there's a spark that just screams for a lover to bring
A child to your chest that could lay as you sleep
And love all you have left like your boy used to be
Long ago, wrapped in sheets warm and wet
Blister please with those wings in your spine
Love to be with a brother of mine, how he'd love to find
Your tongue in his teeth in a struggle to find
Secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight
Sounding only at night as you sleep
And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying
As your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet
Rings of flowers 'round your eyes and I'll love you
For the rest of your life when you're ready
Brother, see we are one in the same
And you left with your head filled with flames and you watched as your brains
Fell out through your teeth, push the pieces in place, make your smile sweet to see
Don't you take this away, I'm still wanting my face on your cheek
And when we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place where some holy spectacle lies
When we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life
Two-headed boy, she is all you could need
She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires
And retire to sheets safe and clean
But don't hate her when she gets up to leave
I'll write you a letter tomorrow
Tonight, I can't hold a pen
Someone's got a stamp that I can borrow
I promise not to blow the address again
Lights that flash in the evening
Through a crack in the drapes
Jesus rides beside me
He never buys any smokes
Hurry up, hurry up, ain't you had enough of this stuff
Ashtray floors, dirty clothes and filthy jokes
See you're high and lonesome
Try and try and try
Lights that flash in the evening
Through a hole in the drapes
I'll be home when I'm sleeping
I can't hardly wait
I can't wait
Hardly wait
I can't wait
Hardly wait
I can't wait
Hardly wait
I can't wait
Hardly wait
I can't wait
Hardly wait
You got in so late it's Sunday morning
Saying that you were leaving, letting go
But where did we go wrong? Oh
And now you say you're leaving California
Got to head back east and want to leave tonight
Pack your things and go, oh
But if you run away I won't be all right
Even if the sun crashes into us I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can feel your light, stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go
Pick up all the pieces, fight to hold on
Put them back together, do it all for love
Never let it go, oh yeah
'Cause I don't need a reason just to hold you
Wipe all of your tears and look you in the eyes
Oh, oh, baby please don't go, oh yeah
But if you run away I won't be all right
Even if the sun crashes into us I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can feel your light, stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go
Now you say you're leaving California
If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
You've dreamed a thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
Two points for honesty
It must make you sad to know that nobody cares at all
I want to be where I've never been before
I want to be there and then I'd understand
Know I'm right and do it right, could I get to be like that
I don't know what I don't know with nothin' more to gain
Will I get better or stay the same
I find I always move too slowly
Can't lift a finger, can't change my mind
I never knew till someone told me that...
If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
You've dreamed a thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
Two points for honesty
It must make you sad to know that nobody cares at all
And all the people who've seen it all before
And all the people who really understand
Know they're right, and have done it right, could I get to be like that
I don't know what I don't know, it's harder everyday
Can't lift a finger, can't hurt a fly
I've found I always move too slowly
One thing's for certain, I'm insecure
I never knew till someone told me that...
If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
You've dreamed of thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
Two points for honesty
It must make you sad to know that, nobody cares at all
Nobody cares at all
They never care at all...
Oh my baby baby I love you more than I can tell
I don't think I can live without you
And I know that I never will
Oh my baby baby I want you so it scares me to death
I can't say anymore than "I love you"
Everything else is a waste of breath
I want you
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
I want you
Your fingernails go dragging down the wall
Be careful darling you might fall
I want you
I woke up and one of us was crying
I want you
You said "Young man I do believe you're dying"
I want you
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days
I want you
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways
I want you
Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget
I want you
Since when were you so generous and inarticulate
I want you
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for
I want you
It's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing
It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing
I want you
He tossed some tatty compliment your way
I want you
And you were fool enough to love it when he said
"I want you"
I want you
The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark
It scares you witless
But in time you see things clear and stark
I want you
Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop
I want you
I'm afraid I won't know where to stop
I want you
I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you
I want you
I want to know the things you did that we do too
I want you
I want to hear he pleases you more than I do
I want you
I might as well be useless for all it means to you
I want you
Did you call his name out as he held you down
I want you
Oh no my darling not with that clown
I want you
I want you
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
I want you
No-one who wants you could want you more
I want you
I want you
I want you
Every night when I go off to bed and when I wake up
I want you
I'm going to say it once again 'til I instill it
I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it
I want you
I want you
I want you
Brad Paisley:
She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart; he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night
Both:
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said 'I'll love her 'til I die'
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
Alison Krauss:
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
Until the night
Both:
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
Today I saw my father standing in the graveyard
Looking very somber looking for his mom
When he finally found her he said that it was different
Everything is different nothing's really changed
My brother would remember sitting in the hallway
Waiting for my father both of us were scared
When the doorknob turned we took off for the stairway
Looking for some cover trying to get away
A guide dog had to serve the role that you would not let
The mother of your children every really play
The office was a dungeon where you hid your fears of
What would really happen if no one ever came
I wonder if you blamed yourself for when she left you
By closing up the garage door and turning on the car
Your father must have lost it your sister couldn't help you
But dad if you were lonely you had no where to turn
Of father can't you see the pieces that have fallen on the ground
When you and mom decided nothing could be saved inside this house
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
Last night I had a dream that I was in the graveyard
Looking at my father buried in the ground
I'd swear that I could hear him tell me he was sorry
He told me he was sorry and everything has changed
Contrast and compare
Between the busy ones and the ones who don't care
Until there is no one
That you really know
So I drift through these days
Of appointments and promises made
They all end up broken
And quickly replaced
Weeks are slow, days drag on
Even practice and parties seem long
But I find myself going
I guess there is nothing to do, oh well
Group of kids, lines of cars
More will show up after the bars close
There's this boredom that drowns everything
Bottles break, music plays
Conversations competing for space
I look for a corner or a quieter room
There's no heat in this house
I can't breathe with these words in my mouth
But I'm not going to say them
Yeah, I've made that mistake before
On the stairs, she grabs my arm
Says what's up, where've you been, is something wrong?
I try to just smile
And say everything's fine
Well she tossed all night like a raging sea
Woke up and climbed from the suicide machine
With her Spanish candles and her Persian poems
Stuck on the rocks inside Opus 40 stoned
And scratching her wrists in the pouring rain
She collapses down upon the ocean floor
Again
Tears in waves, minds on fire
Nights alone by your side
Tears in waves, minds on fire
Nights alone by your side
Catskilled mansions, buried dreams
"I'm alive" she cried
"But I don't know what it means"
But somewhere out there across the moonlit sands
There's a line drawn, like the lines on her own hand
And slamming her eyes, locking the door
She collapses down upon the ocean floor
Again
Tears in waves, minds on fire
Nights alone by your side
Tears in waves, minds on fire
Nights alone by your side
Poor girl, no Ma
Nothing much to speak of but a rough diamond
Sleep now and your angels will come, dear
Poor Matilda,
Handcuffed hard to the wheel
And steering wildly
Through loves fields, so blindly
Forever only takes its toll on some
But, tonight you're sleeping alone
Without him
Tonight you're sleeping alone
Without him
And everything went up in smoke
Like wildflowers
Wildflowers, dear
Poor girl, lonely 
Shuffles through the parade
Of a sleepless circus promenade 
Hold on, dear
Poor girl, no Ma
Sister steals her a coat
For the windless breezes
Sleep now and Jesus will come, dear
Forever only takes its toll on some
But, tonight you're sleeping alone
Without him
Tonight you're sleeping alone
Without him
And everything went up in smoke
Like wildflowers
Wildflowers, dear
Since you're gone there is an empty space
Since you're gone the world is not the same
I go back to the places we've been
Feels like you're still there
I live all those moments again
Wishing you were here
Since you're gone there is a lonely heart
Since you're gone nothing is like it was
There are memories all over the place
Bringing it back all so clear
Remember all of those days
Wishing you were here
All those lonely nights, lonely nights
Lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights
I got to fight for you, yes I do
All those lonely nights, lonely nights
Lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights
I got to fight for you, yes I do
Yes, I do
Since you're gone there is a heart that bleed
Since you're gone I'm not the man I used to be
I follow your steps in the snow
Traces disappear
We know what we've lost when it's gone
I'm wishing you were here
All those lonely nights, lonely nights
Lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights
I got to fight for you, yes I do
All those lonely nights, lonely nights
Lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights
I got to fight for you, yes I do
Yes, I do
I go back to the places we've been
Feels like you're still there
I live all those moments again
Wishing you were here
All those lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights...
Always be careful
When you abuse the one you love
The hour or the day, no one can tell
But one day goodbye will be farewell
And you will never see the one you love again
You will never see the one you love again
I have been thinking, what, with my final brain cell
How time grips you, sliming, in its spell
And before you know, goodbye will be farewell
And you will never see the one you love again
And the smiling children tell you that you smell
Well, just look at me
A savage Beast, I've got nothing to sell
And when I die, I want to go to Hell
And that's when goodbye should be farewell
One day goodbye will be farewell
So grab me while we still have the time
Tonight, when I came home from work, hurt
Tonight, when I came home from work
There he, unforeseen
Sat in my kitchen, buttering himself a bread and the cat was on his knee and smiled at me
Tonight, when I came home from work
Tonight, when I came home from work
There he, unforeseen
Passed the guitar and said I battered my car right now, won't you please give me your tune
We had change of the moon
We had change of the moon
Tonight, when I came home from work
Tonight, when I came home from work
Tonight, when I came home from work
There he, unforeseen
Changed in an easy chair
And said what's that sorrow you bear and I could tell him he understood
He gently took my arm
He listened to my tears till dawn
I dedicate this song to you
Tonight
We had change of the moon
We had change of the moon
Tonight, when I came home from work
Tonight, when I came home from work
Tonight, tonight
Tonight
And I cried all night
You created a stream and it flows forever
It's made of dreams that didn't come true
And I'm sorry, there's nothing more that I can do
When we get together
Take apart my fantasy 
And when we are done
We'll work on you
It's sweet, lie motionless just staring at the ceiling
With your back turned up against the wall
And now I clearly see 
Straight to the back of my skull
And I've been shivering all night long
And my skin is clear and you can see what I'm thinking
I'm thinking hard about all the things I've been dreaming
I've been dreaming about you and only you
Turn the land into waste
And bury it in parking lots
And I'm constantly turned off
By the look of the clock
And it's turning in hours
And I got nothing to look forward to
'Cause I killed all the flowers
And that cold wind will blow
Tear the skin off your nose and you've got nothing to be grateful for 
It's your list of wishes
It's some dirty dishes and you wanted more
And you got less, and it hurt
Oh but it could be worse
Yeah, things could be so much worse
Shadows are falling and I'm running out of breath
Keep me in your heart for a while
If I leave you it doesn't mean I love you any less
Keep me in your heart for a while
When you get up in the morning and you see that crazy sun
Keep me in your heart for a while
There's a train leaving nightly called, "When all is said and done"
Keep me in your heart for a while
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lo
Keep me in your heart for a while
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lo
Keep me in your heart for a while
Sometimes when you're doing simple things around the house
Maybe you'll think of me and smile
You know I'm tied to you like the buttons on your blouse
Keep me in your heart for a while
Hold me in your thoughts, take me to your dreams
Touch me as I fall into view
And when the winter comes, keep the fires lit
And I will be right next you
Engine drivers headed north to Pleasant Street
Keep me in your heart for a while
These wheels keep turning but they're running out of steam
Keep me in your heart for a while
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lo
Keep me in your heart for a while
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lo
Keep me in your heart for a while
Keep me in your heart for a while
Looking out on my roof last night
Woken up from a dream
I saw a typhoon coming in close
Bringing the clouds down to the sea
Making the world look gray and alone
Taking all light from my view
Keeping everyone in
And keeping me here with you
Around you now
I can't sleep no more, baby
Around you still
Don't want to leave yet
Woken up from a dream last night
Somewhere lost in war
I couldn't feel my feet or hands
I didn't feel right anymore
I knew there I'd die alone
With no one to reach to
But an angel came down
And brought me back to you
I'd rather leave
This world forever, baby
Than let life go
The way it's going
Watching an old fight film last night
Ray Mancini and Duk Koo Kim
The boy from Seoul was hanging on good
But the pounding took to him
And there in the square he lay alone
Without face, without crown
And the angel who looked upon him
She never came down
You never know
What day is gonna pick you, baby
Out of the air
Out of nowhere
Come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known
Oh, come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known
Oh, come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known
Come to me once more, my love
Show me love I've never known
Oh, sing to me once more, my love
Words from your younger years
Oh, sing to me once more, my love
Words from your younger years
Oh, sing to me once more, my love
Words from your younger years
Oh, sing to me once more, my love
Words from your younger years
Come to me once more, my love
Instrumental
Deep in
Quick sand 
You dive in
At the shallow end 
You break your
Neck and 
You're never ever gonna get up again 
The glass house that you lived in 
Is deep in the quickening 
Angels might call by 
But fools they rush in 
Bring some peace to your mind
For today is a new day 
Here in my hand 
Time is just sand 
Fine lines of love and hate 
There on your face 
But I look at this way 
In the next seven days 
In the next
It might just change 
How can I write 
The story that 
Went and wrote itself 
Down on paperback 
Called "the foutain of know thyself"
It's a lonely book 
Still upon the shelf 
It'll be all smiles 
And we'll rise and ride 
On the waves of a sinking feeling 
Bring some peace to your mind
For today is a new day 
Happy people don't give into 
Happy people don't give into 
That sinking feeling 
It'll be all smiles 
And we'll rise and we'll sail 
It'll be all smiles 
And we'll rise and we'll sail 
On the waves
It'll be all smiles 
And we'll rise and we'll sail 
On the waves
Of a sinking feeling
It's not so much a storm
But just a cloud that lives inside of me
He doesn't stir so easily these days
But when he wakes he goes the distance
In a marathon of days too long
Open containers that sing songs
You'll never dream again
But you can pray
I guess we only settle in to what we know
I guess we always settle in and we know
That there is comfort in a world
Where darkness is the only thing we see, and cold
Is all we have to breathe
Where affectations keep us company
Where the lies we tell to the eyes that roll in doubt
Are somehow out of our control
It's not about the scars
But more the crowds that walk all over me
They don't give up too easily these days
But when they break they go to pieces
Fall apart right here in Northside bars
Under a sky that knows no stars
You'll never shine again
But you will stay
I guess we only settle in to what we know
I guess we always settle in, and we know
That there is comfort in a world
Where darkness is the only thing we see, and cold
Is all we have to breathe
Where affectations keep us company
Where the lies we tell to the eyes that roll in doubt
Are somehow out of our control
That there is comfort in a world
Where darkness is the only thing we see, and cold
Is all we have to breathe
Where affectations keep us company
Where the lies we tell to the eyes that roll in doubt
Are somehow out of our control
We lost control
She lives in a bungalow
She kills me with rose garden thorns
She waits for me
My love is unusual
It's painted with roses and thorns
With her I'm complete
She lives by the wall and waits by the door
She walks in the sun to me
Visions of Mexico seduce me
It goes to my head so carefully
Memories of candles and incense
And all of these things remember these?
She comforts me when the candles blow out
The cake has grown mold but the memories are sweet
The laughter's all gone but the memories are mine
The Mexican princess is out of my life

This is our last goodbye
Now you should be holding me
Punkrock t-shirt, black cap and tattoo
The first things I noticed about you
Now you should be holding me
Now you should be holding me
Highlights, clear view on the vista -
Stars so close you can reach out and kiss one.
Bright waves roll easy and still,
Sparklin' and deep,
Rude and sweet.
Dream what you like, but you dare not sleep
The lights on the riverbank, they just much reach.
How much lessons did they teach
For the bounty that they seek?
Angels over each and each
As the heavens just increase.
And the mountains surrender,
Final call,
The one on the only, the all for all.
All gone and it goes on and on,
And when it's done on-ing it's just on some more.
Majestic and lonely, magnetic, raw;
...Wholesome...
Magic wave fresher than all's, yes y'alls.
And on and on and on...
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all, feel free y'all, it's unique y'all.
What it do, what it is, what it be y'all?
Fuck money, live up and get free y'all.
Yes yes y'all to the beat y'all.
Numerous and luminous ... in the reservoir.

Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
Like a worm on the hook
Like a knight from some old-fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee
And if I have been unkind
I hope that you will just let it go by
And if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you
Like a baby stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
He said to me: "You must not ask for so much"
And the pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried to me: "Hey, why not ask for more?"
Like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
Saturday, 600 miles
Lie between, the two of us
And telephones, they can't replace
Me with you, face to face.
You gotta tell me its true
That you feel the same
I'm so much better when
I say you're name
Let me be with you tonight
Everything will be just fine
With you tonight
When Streetlights kissed, upon your lips
My jealous eyes, saw all of it
Losing sleep, we learned to be
Me with you, you with me
You gotta tell me its true
That you feel the same
I'm so much better when
I say you're name
She is starting to live her life from the inside out
Sound of failure calls her name, she's decided to hear it out
So go tell Britney and go tell Gwen
She's not trying to go against all them
'Cause she's too scared, and she, she can't pretend
To understand where it begins or ends or what it means to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let them go on, let them go on
Standing there in the graveyard while the moon sprays it's fireworks in your hair
The sound of failure calls her name, she's decided to hear it out
So go tell Britney and go tell Gwen
She's not trying to go against all them
'Cause she's too scared, and she, she can't pretend
To understand where it begins or ends or what it means to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let them go on, let them go on
Where it begins or ends, what it means to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let them go on, let them go on
Where it begins or ends, what it means to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let them go on, let them go on
Where it begins or ends, what it means to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let them go on, let them go on
She doesn't know where it will take her
And she's going into the unknown
After the show you walked right past
Arms reached out for your autograph
And as you flashed your backstage pass
I caught your eye with a camera's flash
When the band came out they stood behind you
Cymbals crashed, the lights went blue
You stood alone in the halo's haze
Shiny guitar hung on gold lamé
And you, you were the lonely one
You were the lonely one
When you perform it's so intense
When the critics pan I write in your defense
I understand I'm just a fan
I'm just a fan
When I get home, I turn off the alarm
I've checked the phone, no messages on
I play the ones from yesterday
I play you're song just to hear you say that
You, you're the lonely one
You are the lonely one
You, you're the lonely one
You are the lonely one
In the longest of nights, stir him at your breast
In silence row him, row him
On the bleakest of morns he'll break at your rocks
And weeping, row-row
In the longest of nights, stir him at your breast
In silence row him, row him
On the bleakest of morns he'll break at your rocks
And weeping, row-row
No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying
I feel estranged every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I want to fly in your silver ship
Let Jesus hang and Buddha sit
It's on now
The days are long now
The ups and the sundowns
And a twisting mind
If I got to go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors
Always changing sides
They were friends of mine
Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagined freedom
All the rest is predictable
You can say you're the first to know
Bought a mantra to concentrate
Car alarm or hissing snake
I know now
How it's gonna turn out
You've got to calm down
Or I'll lose my place
Got to get to the center
Got to get to the concert
Run off with a dancer
Gonna celebrate
We'll welcome the New Age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky
See now a star is born
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you want to cry?
Precious friend of mine
Will I know when it's finally done?
This whole life is a hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying to be
Well, you shouldn't doctor yourself
Well, I pictured somebody else
Someone that looks like
What I look like
Would you say that one of your dreams
Got in you and ripped out the seams?
That's what I'd say
That's what I'd say
He was a sucker for your double-dose
Motherfucker turned white as a ghost
Don't you say hi
Don't you say hi
With a broken sink for a face
And a head that just takes up space
He's not half right
He's not half right
It's already half past
And it won't last
I was sticking up for my friend
When there's nothing much to defend
It's a lost fight
It's a lost fight
'Cause when I talk to you on the phone
Well, it's just like being alone
It's not half right
It's not half right
Suddenly the night has grown colder.
The god of love preparing to depart.
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder,
They slip between the sentries of the heart.
Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure,
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine;
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine.
It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving,
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust -
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving.
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost.
Even though she sleeps upon your satin;
Even though she wakes you with a kiss.
Do not say the moment was imagined;
Do not stoop to strategies like this.
As someone long prepared for this to happen,
Go firmly to the window. Drink it in.
Exquisite music. Alexandra laughing.
Your firm commitments tangible again.
And you who had the honor of her evening,
And by that honor had your own restored -
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving;
Alexandra leaving with her lord.
Even though she sleeps upon your satin;
Even though she wakes you with a kiss.
Do not say the moment was imagined;
Do not stoop to strategies like this.
As someone long prepared for the occasion;
In full command of every plan you wrecked -
Do not choose a coward's explanation
That hides behind the cause and the effect.
And you who were bewildered by a meaning;
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed -
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving.
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost.
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving.
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost.
Oh my heart can't carry much more
It's really, really aching and sore
My heart don't care anymore
I really can't bear more
My hands don't work like before
I shiver and I scrape at your door
My heart can't carry much more
But you couldn't care less
Could you
Your face don't look like before
It's really not like yours anymore
Your eyes don't like me no more
They quiver and they shift to the floor
My heart don't beat like before
It's never been this slow
No my blood don't flow anymore
And you couldn't care less
Could you
Could we stop and sleep for a spell
We can turn this ditch into a well
And send that old devil back to hell
But we don't care do we
Baby let's stop and sleep for a spell
We can turn this ditch into a well
And send that old devil back to hell
Your back's not straight like before
You really shouldn't carry me no more
I'm much too heavy for you
I'm really quite a mess, yes
We just don't care anymore
We're crooked and were cut to the core
We're just not there anymore
But we really don't care do we
No, we couldn't care less
We couldn't care less
Could we?
The rain falls hard on a humdrum town
This town has dragged you down
Oh, the rain falls hard on a humdrum town
This town has dragged you down
Oh, no
And everybody's got to live their life
And God knows I've got to live mine
God knows I've got to live mine
William, William it was really nothing
William, William it was really nothing
It was your life
How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say:
"Oh!
Would you like to marry me?
And if you like you can buy the ring"
She doesn't care about anything
"Would you like to marry me?
And if you like you can buy the ring"
I don't dream about anyone - except myself
Oh, William, William it was really nothing
William, William
Hold me up, hold me down
Leave me in the withering pines
Steal my love, steal my kisses
Take 'em to the bartering lines
Ten cents up, two bucks down
Ship it out and turn it into fuel
Three bucks shy
Leave it on the table till somebody else with moneys got a use
Spinnin' so hard I can't stand
Shadow of a shadowy man
Hold me up hold my hand
The treasures that she misses make the man
Ten cents up, two bucks down
Ship it out and turn it into fuel
Three bucks shy
Leave it on the table till somebody else with moneys got a use
So hold me up, tie me down
Leave me in the withering pines
Steal my love, steal my kisses
Evaluate the differences in life
Ten cents up, two bucks down
Ship it out and turn it into fuel
Three bucks shy
Leave it on the table till somebody else with moneys got a use
Repeat
Today I stumbled from my bed
With thunder crashing in my head
My pillow still wet
From last night tears
And as I think of giving up
A voice inside my coffee-cup
Kept crying out
Ringing in my ears
Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
Why are children always first
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
It's cruel, somehow
It just don't seem right
'Cause ev'ry time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so
I wonder will it be the same tonight
Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
Keep yo' hands in the air, 'cause we gon' take you there
And I know it ain't fair, but we just don't care...
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me, c'mon!)
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me
This is the song for Baby Birch
Oh I will never know you
And at the back of what we've done
There is that knowledge of you
Well I wish we could take every path
I could spend a hundred years adoring you
Yes, I wish we could take every path
Because you know I hated to close the door on you
Do you remember staring up at the stars
So far away in their bulletproof cars?
When we heard the rushing, slow intake
Of the dark, dark water and the engine breaks
And I said, "How about them engine breaks?
And if I should die before I wake
Will you keep an eye on Baby Birch?
Because I'd hate to see her make the same mistake"
When it was dark, I called and you came
When it was dark, I saw shapes
When I see stars, I feel in your hand
And I see stars and I reel again
Well mercy me, I'll be goddamned
It's been a long, long time since I last saw you
And I have never known the plan
It's been a long, long time, how are you?
Your eyes are green, your hair is gold
Your hair is black, your eyes are blue
I closed the ranks, and I doubled back
But, you know I hated to close the doggone door on you
We take a walk along the dirty lake
Hear the goose cussing at me over her eggs
You poor little cousin, I don't want your dregs
A little baby fussing over my legs
There is a blacksmith and there is a shepherd and there is a butcher-boy
And there is a barber, who's cutting and cutting away at my only joy
I saw a rabbit as slick as a knife and as pale as a candlestick
And I had thought it'd be harder to do but I caught her, and skinned her quick
Held her there, kicking and mewling, upended, unspooling, unsung and blue
Told her, "Wherever you go, little runaway bunny, I will find you"
And then she ran as they're liable to do
Be at peace baby and be gone
Be at peace baby and be gone
Tuna
Rubber
A little blubber in my igloo, yeah
And I knew you
Pigtails and all
Girls when they fall
And they said Marianne killed herself
And I said, "Not a chance. Not a chance."
Don't you love the girls, ladies
Babes, old bags who say
She was so pretty
Why, why, why
Why did she crawl down in the old deep ravine?
Come on pigtails, girls and all those sailors
Get your bags and hold down
Won't you just hold down, hold down
'Cause Ed is watching my every sound
I said they're watching my every sound
The weasel squeaks
Faster than a seven day week
I said Timmy and that purple Monkey
Are all down at Bobby's house
Making themselves
Pesters and lesters and jesters
And my traitors of kind
And I'm just having thoughts I said
I'm just having thoughts of
Having thoughts
Having
Marianne
She could outrun the fastest slug
She could
I'm just having thoughts of Marianne
Quickest girl in the frying pan
I'm just having thoughts of Marianne
She was cold and all alone (do be do be do do),
Hadn't been there long and didn't know what to say.
So she sat in the corner of the room (do be do be do do),
She figured if she didn't move no one would notice her.
Underneath a winters' sky,
Her eyes were bright, tonight would be the night.
A boy spotted her from afar (do be do be do do),
He too understood and felt her pain,
Unsure of what to do (do be do be do do),
I'm lacking in imagination he said hello.
Underneath a winters' sky,
Her eyes were bright, tonight he finds her.
Underneath a winters' moon,
The last we saw on, how we came too soon.
Underneath a winters sky,
Her eyes were bright, tonight he finds her,
Underneath a winters' moon, The last we saw on, how we came too soon.
Why you turned out the way you did
That thunderstorm's still crashing in your cranium
Find that all these funny faces look the same
I know who's to blame, but I swore I wouldn't say
It's time that I got moving on
As you're still burning the dress you wore to senior prom
Try to forget how you've been touched
I loved you so I told you, but it didn't matter much
And I'm trying to figure out
What you're all about
These days I don't have much to say to you
And I've been drunker than a skunk
Ever since the day I left you
With your darkest secret safely packed away 
Up in my steamer trunk
Why I turned out the way I did
Someone somewhere dropped me on my cranium
I'm sorry, could you repeat what you just said?
My short term memory is gone, but my long term's far from dead
I'm trying to figure out
What you're all about these days
I don't have much to say to you
And I've been drunker than a skunk
Ever since the day I left you
With your darkest secret safely packed away 
Up in my steamer trunk
In my steamer trunk
And I'm trying to figure out
What you're all about
These days I don't have much to say to you
And I've been swearing like a sailor
Since the day that I left her
With her darkest secret safely packed away 
Up in my steamer trunk
Trying to remember
But my feelings can?�t know for sure
Try to reach out
But it?�s gone
Lucky stars in your eyes
I am walking the cow
I really don?�t know how I came here
I really don?�t know why I?�m staying here
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I am walking the cow
Tried to point my finger
But the wind keeps blowin??me around
In circles, circles
Lucky stars in your eyes
I am walking the cow
I really don?�t know what I have to fear
I really don?�t know why I have to care
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I am walking the cow
Lucky stars
I am a mirror, with no reflection
I am a razor, without my blade
I am the daylight when the moons shines no
Who will want to make my sandcastle that's already made
I feel so useless, do you
Speak to an ear deaf to my voice
Look through your fear, you're still blind to my way
I reach to hold you, but I don't feel you there, do you
Even I realise I'm here am I just wasting away?
No wasting away
Living, inside you play
I feel so useless, do you
I feel so useless, do you
My dying prayer, sealed in a scream
Unwelcome care, and a conscious dream
I am your whore, without a name
I climb to fall, to begin again, to begin again
I am an arrow, with no direction
My life your tarot, and my picture your fate
I'm your becoming, so I'll always be nothing
If I ever break away from you that day forth,
You'll be living
My hate
Oh god help his fate
I'll watch you, watch you suffocate
I feel so useless, do you
I feel so useless, do you
I feel so useless, do you
I feel so useless, do you
I could drag you from the ocean,
I could pull you from the fire
And when you're standing in the shadow
I could open up the sky
And I could give you my devotion
Until the end of time
And you will never be forgotten
With me at your side
'Cause I don't need this life
I just need...
I've got nothing left to live for
Got no reason yet to die
But when I'm standing in the gallows
I'll be staring at the sky
Because no matter where they take me
In death I will survive
And I will never forgotten
With you by my side
And I don't need this life
I just need...
Somebody to die for
Somebody to cry for
When I'm lonely
When I'm standing in the fire
I will look him in the eye
And I will let the devil know
That I was brave enough to die
And there's no Hell that he can show me
That's deeper than my pride
'Cause I will never be forgotten
Forever I'll fight
And I don't need this life
But I need...
Somebody to die for
Somebody to cry for
When I'm lonely
And I don't need this life
I just need...
Somebody to die for
Somebody to cry for
When I'm lonely
Don't go gentle into the good night
Rage on against the dying light
Maybe again
He will be alone
Guess we're equally damaged
Find your name
Do it all the same equally
Signal when you can't breathe no more
Say you were me
Then you could see the view
You'll know we are equally damaged
Don't be a fool, make it easier
You'll learn to say when
Signal if you can't say, "no more"
Oh, don't cross your finger
Sundays will never change
They keep on coming
You'll be a freak
And I'll keep you company...
I wonder how you sleep
I wonder what you think of me
If I could go back,
Would you have ever been with me?
I want you to be uneased
I want you to remember
I want you to believe in me
I want you on my side
Come on and lay it down
I've always been with you
Here and now
Give all that's within you
Be my savior
And I'll be your downfall
Here we go again
Ashamed of bein' broken in
We're gettin' off track
I wanna get you back again
I want you to trouble me
I wanted you to linger
I want you to agree with me
I want so much so bad
Come on and lay it down
I've always been with you
Here and now
Give all that's within you
Be my savior
And I'll be your downfall
Yeah, be my savior
(Only love can save us now
Come lay me down
Only love can save us now)
I'll be your downfall
(Our love can save us now
Love save me now)
Lay it down 
I've always been with you
Hear me now
With all that's within you
Be my savior
And I'll be your downfall
Now I'm back on my own
Hear my feet, they are made of stone
And I'll make you go where I go
Well, hell, you, can I take you home?
Now, I'm coming home, on my back
Kissin' me, your lips painted black
Saying, "Woah oh oh
Lemme be your downfall
Woah oh oh
Lemme be your downfall, baby."
I need a new direction to get me around.
You don't have protection as you're coming down.
Light my white candle keep me safe.
It'll put that smile back on my face. ya.
Have you made up your mind?
It's the only way.
Have you made it up? Have you made it up?
I admire the time that you take.
Have you made it up? Have you made it up?
I still think we should meditate.
I need a good luck charm to give me good luck.
I need a good alarm to wake me up.
Obie wan and yoda will keep me safe.
They'll put that smile back on my face. ya.
Have you made up your mind?
It's the only way.
Have you made it up? Have you made it up?
I admire the time that you take.
Have you made it up? Have you made it up?
You don't tell me about what's going on.
Fucking make up your mind, stop dragging it on.
They're only words, they don't hurt.
We can't even look into our eyes.
We're not the same inside.
We can let it change our lives can braid.
We're constantly afraid.
We can't even look into our eyes.
We're not the same inside.
Go sing your song, try something new.
I hope you find what's right for you.
Have you made it up? Have you made it up?
Have you made up your mind?
It's the only way.
Have you made it up? Have you made it up?
I admire the time that you take.
Have you made it up? Have you made it up?
I still think we should meditate.
If you're going out with someone new
I'm going out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk
But I'd much rather be somewhere with you
Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
You said pick me up at three a.m.
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go
Somewhere with you, yeah
I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you
Like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car, out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear
I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go
I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high, 'cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you
If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you
Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
You said pick me up at three a.m.
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go
I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you
Somewhere with you, I'm somewhere with you
Somewhere with you
Somewhere with you
Somewhere with you
The words have been drained from this pencil
Sweet words that I want to give you
And I can't sleep
I need to tell you
Goodnight
When we're together, I feel perfect
When I'm pulled away from you, I fall apart
All you say is sacred to me
Your eyes are so blue
I can't look away
As we lay in the stillness
You whisper to me
Amy, marry me
Promise you'll stay with me
Oh you don't have to ask me
You know you're all that I live for
You know I'd die just to hold you
Stay with you
Somehow I'll show you
That you are my night sky
I've always been right behind you
Now I'll always be right beside you
So many nights I cried myself to sleep
Now that you love me, I love myself
I never thought I would say this
I never thought there'd be
You
Lying on the shady grass
Afternoon, there's always something happening
Friends go floating gently by
I'm listening to a song inside my head
Although the summer's past, those mythic dreams would never last
Do I care anymore?
And if it makes you sad, remember all the things you have
That can't be bought
Recollection brings me back
Sad to think it was just a fantasy
We'd already accepted that
Which many others struggled to believe
And though it makes no sense, I know there are no accidents
I have no fear anymore
And if it makes you sad to give up dreams you've always had
That can't be bought
It just can't be fought
Looking back at '91, reflecting on those things we could have
Said and done
This dancing lights across a crowd remind us of another town
That's dead and gone
It's just dead and gone
It's just dead and gone
It's just dead and gone
Take me to that summer past
Tell me, is it really worth remembering?
I realize that music then
Was really just a song inside my head
And though this fun has past, those mythic dreams are meant to last
Have no fear anymore
And if it makes you cry, look ahead, dry your eyes
It can be done
Yes, it can be done
Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
Ain't no use in you trying
If you don't love me
Baby
Ain't no use in you trying
If you don't, if you don't
If you don't, if you don't love me
Ain't nothing I can do
Maybe I didn't realize
The way I loved the way you moved
Till I moved so far away
I couldn't see you anymore
And maybe all those secret times
Didn't seem so bad until I knew
All of my little secrets
Weren't all that secret anymore
Maybe it's all right
I mean, I went and found the modern world
But I miss the way life was
When you were my girl
I know I never noticed then
Just what it was I had
Up until I lost you,
And man, did I lose you
Ain't that the way it always goes?
And I know you are gonna be just fine
You know they say it's better
To have loved and to lose it
Than to never ever know it
Easy come and easy go, whatever
Maybe it's all right,
I mean, I went and found the modern world
But I miss the way life was
When you were my girl
I remember the times we spent together
All those drives, we had a million questions
All about our lives
And when we got to New York everything felt right
I wish you were here with me,
Tonight
I remember the days we spent together,
Were not enough, it used to feel like dreaming
Except we always woke up,
Never thought not having you here now
Would hurt so much
Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you
I can just look up
And know the stars are
Holding you, holding you, holding you
Tonight
I remember the time you told me
About when you were eight
And all those things you said that night
That just couldn't wait
I remember the car you were last seen in
And the games we would play
All the times we spilled our coffees
And stayed out way too late
I remember the time you sat and told me
About your Jesus, and how not to look back
Even if no one believes us
When it hurts so bad, sometimes
Not having you here
Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you
I can just look up
And know the stars are
Holding you, holding you, holding you
Tonight
I say
Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you
I can just look up
And know the stars are
Holding you, holding you, holding you
Tonight
Got up before dawn
Went down to the racetrack
Riding with the windows down
Shortly after your first heart attack
You parked behind the paddock
Cracking asphalt underfoot
Coming up through the cracks
Pale green things, pale green things
We watched the horses run their workouts
You held your stopwatch in your left hand
And a racing form beneath your arm
Casting your gaze way out to no man's land
Sometimes I'll meet you out there
Lonely and frightened
Flicking my tongue out at the wet leaves
Pale green things, pale green things
My sister called at 3 AM
Just last December
She told me how you'd died at last, at last
And that morning at the racetrack was one thing I remembered
I turned it over in my mind
Like a living Chinese finger trap
Seaweed and Indiana saw grass
Pale green things, pale green things
I take a step outside
And I breath the air
And I slam the door
And I'm on my way
I won't lay no blame
I won't call you names
'Cause I've made my break
And I won't look back
I've turned my back
On those endless games
I'm all through with ties
I'm all tired of tears
I'm a happy man
Don't it look that way
Shakin' dust from my shoes
There's a road ahead
And there's no way back home (no way back home)
Oh but I have to say
Leavin' home ain't easy
Oh I never thought it would be easy
Leavin' on your own
Oh is the main thing calling me back
Leavin' home ain't easy
On the one you're leavin' home
Stay my love my love please stay
Stray my love what's wrong my love?
What's right my love?
Oh leavin' home ain't easy
I thought how could I think of leavin'
Leavin' on your own
Still tryin' to persuade me that
Leavin' home ain't necessarily the only way
Leavin' home ain't easy
But may be the only way
Your eyes are just like black spiders
Your hair and dress in ribbons
Babycakes
In despair or incoherent, nothing in between
China white, my bride tonight
Smiling on the tiles
Bring that minute back
We never get so close as when the sunward flight begins
I share it all with you
Powder blue, oh
Stumble through the crowds together
They're trying to ignore us
That's okay
I'm proud to be the one you hold when the shakes begin
Sallow-skinned, starry-eyed
Blessed in our sin
Bring that minute back
We never get so close to death, makes you so alive
I share it all with you
Powder blue, oh
Yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Bring that minute back
We'll never get so close as when the sunward flight begins
I share it all with you
Powder blue, oh

As a man I ain't never been much for sunny days
I'm as calm as a fruit stand in New York and maybe as strange
But when the color goes out of my eyes it's usually the change
But damn Sam I love a woman that rains
Clear as a bell and sound as an old engineer
Clear as a bell and sound as an old engineer
With talented breezes that blow off your hat with a sneer
As a man I've never been much for talking to
I'm as open as the door in her house that leads to her room
And when the color goes out of my eyes she's usually too
But damn Sam I love a woman that's blue
As a man I ain't never been much for sunny days
I'm as calm as a fruit stand in New York and maybe as strange
But when the color goes out of my eyes it's usually the change
But damn Sam I love a woman that rains
Shake me, shake me
Skyscraper
Send me your position 
It's getting lonely down here 
Things I've been up to lately 
Have kept me from seeing clear 
Why do you keep on running 
This love is fading way too fast 
All the stars are burning (for you) 
But none of them is going to last 
So stop chasing the past 
As soon as the storm is over 
And all the fog is clear 
As soon as the storm is over 
I've promised to send out for you 
As soon as the storm is over
As soon as the storm is over
As soon as the storm is over
As soon as the storm is over
Several times, over several days
I wasn't blind but
I acted that way
Causing you pain
And now I have to explain
That the empty feeling turns from black to blue
I can't believe this never happens to you
I see it on the TV and
I laugh out loud
But it's the way I feel right now
Cooler than me
My confidence high
Reset the scene
No way to deny it
Finally I won
And then I was on top
As (That?) the empty feeling turns from black to blue
I can't believe this never happens to you
I see it on the TV and
I laugh out loud
But lt's the way I feel right now
As (That?) the empty feeling turns from black to blue
I can't believe this never happens to you
I see it on the TV and
I laugh out loud
But lt's the way I feel right now
(Repeat to end)
What's up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinkin' 'bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put 'em in a letter
And it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother, how's your little brother,
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line
To the story of me and you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that still remain after you were gone
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
Like a silly joke, or somethin' on the TV
Boy it ain't easy
When I hear our song
I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind
Turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you
Did you know I kept all of your pictures
Don't have the strength to part with them yet
Oh no
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things a girl can never forget
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you
So, you're leaving, aren't you?
I knew it when you said just then
When you told me you were leaving
That's when I definitely knew
But if you're trying to break my heart
Your plan is flawed from the start
You can't break my heart, it's liquid
It melted when I met you
And as you turn around to leave
Don't turn back to me
Don't turn around and see if I'm crying
I'm not crying
I'm not crying
It's just been raining on my face
And if you think you see some tear tracks down my cheeks
Please, please, don't tell my mates
I'm not crying
No, I'm not crying
And if I am crying
It's not 'cause of you
It's because I'm thinking about a friend of mine who you don't know who is dying
That's right, dying
These aren't tears of sadness because you're leaving me
I've just been cutting onions
I'm making a lasagna
For one
Oh, I'm not crying
No
There's just a little bit of dust in my eye
That's from the path that you made when you said your goodbye
I'm not weeping because you won't be here to hold my hand
For your information, there's an inflammation in my tear gland
I'm not upset because you left me this way
My eyes are just a little sweaty today
They've been looking around
They're like searching for you
They've been looking for you
Even though I told them not to
These aren't tears of sadness
They're tears of joy
I'm just laughing
Ha ha ha-ha ha
I'm sitting at this table called love
Staring down at the irony of life
How come we've reached this fork in the road
And yet it cuts like a knife?
I'm not cryyyyyyyyying
I'm not cryyyyyyyyying
I'm not cry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-ying
Like so many girls, Jenny Wren could sing
But a broken heart took her song away
Like the other girls, Jenny Wren took wing
She could see the world and its foolish ways
How we spend our days, casting love aside
Losing sight of life, day by day
She saw poverty breaking up her home
Wounded warriors took her song away
But the day will come, Jenny Wren will sing
When this broken world mends its foolish ways
Then we'll spend our days catching up on life
All because of you, Jenny Wren
You saw who we are, Jenny Wren
Ground down, I know that you'll feel fine
If you let me in
Hand in hand, I'll show you the way
Our life, is always on the line
If we just begin
How I hope I'll suit you someday
I am the spring, love is blossoming
You take the fall in sacrifice
I'll cheer you up, fill your empty cup
And we can sup on summer skies
Nervous, I'm knocking on your door
Will you let me in?
Face to face, I've something to say
Stranger, we should be intertwined
Like it's always been
Yes, I know I'll suit you someday
I am the spring, love is blossoming
You take the fall in sacrifice
I'll cheer you up, fill your empty cup
And we can sup on summer skies
I am the spring, love is blossoming
I'll take the fall, fall for you
Your quiet eyes
Your mouth that never tells lies
You've got one hour
It's time you told your story.
18 alone,
In love with the answer phone
And too afraid, you're too afraid to fall for anything
And too afraid, much too afraid to sing.
I won't pretend, that I can't see the end,
But its far away, it's in the distance.
We'll find a place.
There isn't room for two of us.
The minutes drag, then there's a world between us,
And I'm too afraid, much too afraid to fall for anything
And I'm too afraid, much too afraid to sing
To sing.
We all come to an end,
And we all end together
We all end together
Jackie left on a cold, dark night
Telling me he'd be home,
He sailed the sea for a hundred years
And left me all alone.
Now I've been dead for twenty years
I've been washing the sand
With my ghostly tears
Searching the shores for my
Jackie ooh.
And I remember the day
That the young man came
Said your Jackie's gone
He's lost in the rain
And I ran to the beach
(Laid me down)
You're all wrong, I said
As they stared to the sand,
That man knows the sea
Like the back of his hand,
He'll be back sometime
Laughing at you.
I've been waiting all this time,
For my man to come
Take his hand in mine
And lead me away to unseen shores.
I've been washing the sand
With my salty tears
Searching the shores these long years
And I walked the sea forevermore
Till I find my Jackie ooh,
Jackie ooh,
Jackie ooh,
Jackie ooh-ooh-ooh.
I'm like a child looking off on the horizon
I'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens
Oh, I'm still alive
I'm like a soldier coming home for the first time
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine
Oh, I'm still alive
Am I bleeding?
Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
My way to you
I'm like a junkie tying off for the last time
I'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime
Oh, I'm still alive
I'm like a son that was raised without a father
I'm like a mother barely keeping it together
Oh, I'm still alive
Am I bleeding?
Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, away, away
As I walked out on the ledge
Are you scared to death to live?
I've been running all my life
Just to find a home that's for the restless
And the truth that's in the message
Making my way, away, away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way, away
My way to you

Who would have thought that you could hurt me
The way you've done it
So deliberate so determined
Since you have been gone
I bite my nails for days and hours
And question my own questions on and on
Tell me now, tell me now
Why you're so far away
When I'm still so close
You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
You said you would love me until you die
As far as I know you're still alive
Baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
I tried so hard to be attentive
To all you wanted always supportive always patient
What did I do wrong?
I'm wondering for days and hours
It's clear, it isn't here where you belong
Anyhow, Anyhow
I wish you both all of best
I hope you get along
You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
You said you would love me until you die
As far as I know you're still alive
Baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive the woman's heart
You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
You said you would love me until you die
As far as I know you're still alive
Baby
You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive the woman's heart
Open heart, open heart, it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart,
Open heart, open heart, it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
It's a shame that it had to be this way
It's not enough to say I'm sorry
It's not enough to say I'm sorry
Maybe I'm to blame
Or maybe were the same
But either way I can't breathe
Either way I can't breathe
All I had to say is goodbye
We're better off this way
We're better off this way
I'm alive but I'm losing all my drive
Cause everything were been through
And everything about you
Seemed to be a lie
A guiltless twisted lie
It made me learn to hate you
Or hate myself for letting it pass by
All I had to say is goodbye
We're better off this way
We're better off this way
All I had to say is goodbye
We're better off this way
We're better off this way
And every, everything isn't only
What it seemed so hold these
Words that you never told me
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
Goodbye
Bye
Take my pain away
Tear it out
Tell me I was wrong
Tell me I was wrong
Take my pain away
Tear it out
Tell me I was wrong
Tell me I was wrong
Take my pain away
Tear it out
Tell me I was wrong
Tell me I was wrong
(Repeat until fade)
Everything makes me nervous
And nothing feels good for no reason
Waking up, it's rarely worth it
The same dark dread every morning
Senior year here in Mahwah
A new world just around the corner
Leave me behind, let me stagnate
In a fortress of solitude
Smoking's been okay so far
But I need something that works faster
So all I want for Christmas
Is no feelings, no feelings now and never again
There is a faceplate all brown and red that stretches across my mouth
It's worn for protection, nobody gets in and nobody gets out
I used to look myself in the mirror at the end of every day
But I took the one thing that made me beautiful and I threw it away
I was a river, I was a tall tree, I was a volcano
But now I'm asleep on top of a mountain, I've been covered in snow
Yes, I have surrendered what made me human and all that I thought was true
And now there's a robot that lives in my brain and he tells me what to do
And I can do nothing without his permission, that wasn't part of the plan
So now in Rock Ridge pharmacy I will be waiting for my man
But there is another down in a dungeon who never gave up the fight
And he'll be forever screaming, sometimes I hear him say, on a quiet night, he says
"You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser now"
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser
You will always be a loser now
And that's okay
I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
I was never told about the sorrow
And how can you mend a broken heart
How can you stop the rain from falling down
Tell me, how can you stop the sun from shining
What makes the world go round
And how can you mend this broken man, yeah
How can a loser ever win
Somebody, please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
But we could never see tomorrow
Would you believe that no one, no one ever told us about the sorrow
So how can you mend a broken heart
Remind me, how can you stop the rain from falling down
Baby, how can you stop that ol' sun from shining
What makes the world go round
And sometimes I have to say, yeah
Say la, la, la...
Tell me, help me mend my, my broken heart
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
Live again, baby
How can you mend this broken man, yeah
Somebody tell me, how can a loser ever win
Baby, help me mend my, this ol' broken heart
I think I, I know I, I believe I, I feel like I gotta
I feel like I want to live again
How can you mend this broken heart
Somebody please tell me, how can you stop the rain from falling down
Although my clothes are all wet, tell me
How can you mend my, please help me mend my broken heart
I think I, I believe I
I got a feeling that I want to live, live and live
I'll be back tomorrow, that is if you're here
And you promise to keep it between you and me
It's all just a dream, man, it's all just a dream
I've been up half the night, so get off it or leave
We're singing a song, we don't care if we're wrong
Have a drink on each other and call it a day
You're callin' me back, when the money is gone
That's all and for us, that's as good as it got
It's four in the morning, the bars are unloading
I go to the window and put down the shade
You're callin' me back, yeah, but that was no good
I got tired of it day after day, after day
So hang on, Siobhan, you're a mystery to me
But you don't hear me askin' around
So hang on, we're comin' on soon
It's so hard to get through to you
Hang on, we're comin' on soon
We're waiting to hear it from you
Hang on, hang on
Last night I dreamed that I was a child out where the pines grow wild and tall
I was trying to make it home through the forest before the darkness falls
I heard the wind rustling through the trees and ghostly voices rose from the fields
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
With the devil snappin' at my heels
I broke through the trees, and there in the night
My father's house stood shining hard and bright the branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms
I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts
I got dressed, and to that house I did ride from out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch a woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
I told her my story, and who I'd come for
She said "I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore"
My father's house shines hard and bright it stands like a beacon calling me in the night
Calling and calling, so cold and alone
Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
Hey 
I didn't go to work for a month, I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
I haven't hung out with anyone, if I did I'd have nothing to say
I didn't feel angry or depressed, I didn't feel anything at all
I didn't want to go to bed and I didn't want to stay up late
When you're living your life, well, that's the price you'll pay
Whenever I breathe out, you're breathing it in
Whenever I speak out, you take it all in
Whenever I breathe out, you're breathing it in
Whenever I speak out, you take it all in
Our feelings are positive, negative, positive, negative
I believe there's positive, negative, positive, negative
The seasons are positive, negative, positive, negative
Whenever I breathe out, you're breathing it in
Whenever I speak out, you take it all in
Whenever I breathe out, you're breathing it in
Whenever I speak out, you take it all in
I didn't go to work for a month, I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
I haven't hung out with anyone, if I did I'd have nothing to say
I bruise like a peach
I mumble when I speak
I'm in the gutter
Lookin' at the stars
I've always been in love with you
I look tough enough
But if you hold me up to the light
You can see my broken heart
I've always been in love with you
They're just paper cuts
I'll sellotape them up
And bandage them with cotton wool and glue
Paper cuts
I shouldn't beat myself up
Over little things the way I do
Nothing stays the same
I wish I could remain the color
Of the cherry blossom tree
I've always been in love with you
I always used to leave before I went to sleep
But now I just pass out watching TV
I've always been in love with you
They're just paper cuts
I'll sellotape them up
And bandage them
With cotton wool and glue
They're just paper cuts
I shouldn't beat myself up
Over little things the way I do
Just be careful when you shine
Because if you throw a light
On something magical
It disappears
Paper cuts
I'll sellotape them up
And bandage them
With cotton wool and glue
They're just paper cuts
I shouldn't beat myself up
Over little things the way I do
I bruise like a peach
I mumble when I speak
I'm in the gutter
Lookin' at my scars
I've always been in love with
I thought that my first love would be my wife
But in junior high she moved away from here
I thought Johnny would always be my best friend
I haven't talked to him, in 15 years
Back when I had those fights with my old man
I never thought he'd be... an old man
And I didn't know, all those years ago
How the years would go flying by
Thought I knew it all
But I was wrong
And I didn't know it at the time
I never thought good jobs were hard to find
Till I let my pride cost me one
I never thought my whole life would change
Till I heard the doctor say, I had a son
I never really thought that I was lost
Till I heard my dying mother sing Old Rugged Cross
And I didn't know, all those years ago
How the years would go flying by
Thought I knew it all
But I was wrong
And I didn't know, I didn't know it at the time
Oh, I Thought I knew it all
Oh, But I was wrong
And I didn't know, I didn't know it at the time
I didn't know, didn't know, didn't know
I didn't know
Oogie waits for just another day
Drags his bones to see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers grey
Oh, they slip away
Once a time they nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away
Don't forget to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world in war torn
How I wonder where you are
Oh-ooh
Sailing over Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are
Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982
The joke we always knew
What'sa matter with you
C'mon, let's go
Slip away
Don't forget to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world inwar torn
How I wonder where you are
Oh-ooh
Sailing over Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are
If I lay my head down
I will see you in my dream
Wearing that polka-dot dress
And sitting by the stream
Leaning in to hear you
You will whisper in my ear
And everything I need to know
I finally hear
I wish I could remember
But my selective memory won't let me
When I was a baby
We would go out to the park
And sit out in the fountain
Splashing 'round until it's dark
The days go on forever
When you only know that much
And everything you need to know
Is answered with one touch
I wish could remember
But my selective memory won't let me
Instrumental
Eyes like a car crash
I know I shouldn't look but I can't turn away
Body like a whiplash
Salt my wounds but I can't heal the way I feel about you
I watch you like a hawk
I watch you like I'm gonna tear you limb from limb
Will the hunger ever stop?
Can we simply starve this sin?
That little kiss you stole; it held my heart and soul
And like a deer in the headlights, I meet my fate
Don't try to fight the storm; you'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you
And on my deathbed, all I'll see is you
The life may leave my lungs
But my heart will stay with you
That little kiss you stole; it held my heart and soul
And like a ghost in the silence, I disappear
Don't try to fight the storm; you'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you
(The waves will pull us under)
Tides will bring me back to you
(The waves will pull us under)
Tides will bring me back to you
(The waves will pull us under)
Tides will bring me back to you
Tides will bring me back to you
That little kiss you stole; it held my heart and soul
And like a ghost in the silence, I disappear
Don't try to fight the storm; you'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you
That little kiss you stole; it held my heart and soul
And like a deer in the headlights, I meet my fate
Don't try to fight the storm; you'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you
Car is parked, bags are packed, but what kind of heart doesn't look back
At the comfortable glow from the porch, the one I will still call yours?
All those words came undone and now I'm not the only one
Facing the ghosts that decide if the fire inside still burns
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again
Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth
And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view
Hang my head, break my heart built from all I have torn apart
And my burden to bear is a love I can't carry anymore
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
It hurts to be here
I only wanted love from you
It hurts to be here
What am I gonna do?
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again
Jessica, wake up
Jessica, wake up
It's February again
We must get older
So wake up
I can't write a song for you
I'm out of melodies
I can't write a song for you
But I am asking please
Jessica, wake up
Jessica, wake up
It's February again
It's February again
We must get older now
So please wake up
We must get older now
So please wake up
Walking a fine line between wrong and right
And I know...
There is a part of me that I try to hide
But I can't win
And I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside
Now I am calling
Hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody
To believe in something
And I won't fear this
When I am falling
We all need somebody
That can mend... These broken bones
Caught in the confines of the simple life
And I am...
Holding my head high in the rising tide
And I can't win
And I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside
Now I am calling
Hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody
To believe in something
And I won't fear this
When I am falling
We all need somebody
That can mend... These broken bones
But Oh
Yeah
I'm not coming home now
I know...
I'm so far away
So far from home
I'm not coming home now
I know...
I'm so far away
I'm so far away
And I can't win
And I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Now I am calling
Hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody
To believe in something
And I won't fear this
When I am falling
We all need somebody
That can mend... These broken bones
And I can't win
And I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside
And I can't win
And I can't fight
I keep holding on too tight
Running away from the world outside
It is a gift I know
A moment of bliss that we hold
A firecracker flash of light then on
To the next plan soul remain
Come along if you dare
It's gonna be that you're scared
Lovely life I thank you
For the reason to see the pain through
Light a candle for the dead
The wick is burning returning what we have
It's who we are
We'll reach you if you're
Beyond the furthest star
Don't give up the fight to stay alive
And even if
You have to
Find the reason of another's pain
If they lose you
If not for your self
Then those around who care
Like I do
One day you'll see the clear blue
Beyond the gray sky
Beyond the gray sky
Beyond the gray sky
Light a candle...
The wick...
It's who we are...
One day you'll see the clear blue
Beyond the gray sky
Beyond the gray sky
Beyond the gray sky
I can't believe you didn't call
What made you want to end it all
Wasn't there something I should have tried
To help you see beyond the gray sky
All the words that we have to say
They don't leave when the moment comes
We know we have to wait
As the days go on and the places fade away
To dirt and to dust, it all fades away
And the waiting is the hardest thing to take
In an moment more before we break
If you have to let it go
And these dreams keep you awake
If you have to let it go
Walk away
In the shapes we want to see
Don't leave another piece that this puzzle needs
And the waiting is the hardest thing to take
In an moment more before we break
If you have to let it go
And these dreams keep you awake
If you have to let it go
Walk away
And the waiting is the hardest thing to take
In an moment more before we break
If you have to let it go
And these dreams keep you awake
If you have to let it go
Walk away
If you have to let it go
And these dreams keep you awake
If you have to let it go
Walk away (walk away)
If you have to let it go
And these dreams keep you awake
If you have to let it go
Walk away (walk away)
Gray light, new day leaks through the window
An old soul song comes on the alarm clock radio
We walked the 40 blocks to the middle
Of the place we heard that everything would be
And there were barricades to keep us off the street
But the crowd kept pushing forward
Till they swallowed the police
Yeah they went wild
Yeah they went wild
Yeah they went wild
Yeah they went wild
We left before the dust had time to settle
And all the broken glass swept off the avenue
And all the way home held your camera like a Bible
Just wishing so bad that it held some kind of truth
And I stood nervous next to you, in the dark room
You dropped the paper in my water
And it all begins to bloom
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild
And just when I get so lonesome, I can't speak
I see some flowers on a hillside
Like a wall of new TV's
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild
I fell asleep last Saturday
Underneath polluted skies
I walked alone on those Jersey nights, and I
Saw the boardwalk start to fall
The emptiness starts to drown
The quiet corners off this town, and I--
Late last night, I made my plans
It was the only thing I felt I could do
Said goodbye, to my best friend
Sometimes there's no one left to tell you the truth
It's gonna kill me... The rest of my life
Let me apologize while I'm still alive
I know it's time to face all of my past mistakes
It's gonna kill me for the rest of my life
This is my all time low
Somehow it feels so familiar
Somehow it seems so familiar
I feel like letting go
And every second that goes by
I'm screaming out for a second try
Said goodbye, to my best friend
Sometimes there's no one left to tell me the truth
It's gonna kill me... The rest of my life
Let me apologize while I'm still alive
I know it's time to face all of my past mistakes
I've got to live with them rest of my life
This is the mess I've made
These are the words I can't erase
This is my life support, shutting down, for the final time
And it twists like a blade
And kills me for the rest of my life
If you won't forgive me
The rest of my life
Let me apologize while I'm still alive
I know it's time to face all of my past mistakes
It's gonna kill me for the rest of my life...
Your little feet
Your sharp teeth
The way the light hits your eyes
Your scrappy fur
Your fists
The light from the Lord that shines inside
Inside of me
Inside of me
Something is growing
Something is glowing
Someone is showing
Sing a song for the new breed
Inside of me
Your deep growl
Your high whine
The uneven way that you move
Your pure heart
Your love
The Lord made you to prove something
Inside of me
Inside of me
Something is growing
Something is glowing
Someone is showing
Sing a song for the new breed
I could be right
Then you'd be right too
It weighs too much this time
My hands are broken
She'll disappear again
Before we've spoken
The night we took that year
In Black Leaf Falls
All of the trees were bare
Next to the dance hall
I saw you outside
The bathroom stalls
You were just standing there
Out in the hall
You leaned your hip against
Against the wall
I'd love you anywhere
But Black Leaf Falls
Her perfume was so
I smell it still
I put her leaf upon
The window sill
I found it there today
Its color gone
It's in the water now
It's been too too long
I saw you outside
The bathroom stall
You were just standing there
Out in the hall
You leaned your hip against
Against the wall
I'd love you anywhere
But Black Leaf Falls
I'll fall asleep tonight
See where they take me
Fly with the maple seeds
See if she wakes me
I saw you outside
The bathroom stalls
You were just standing there
Out in the hall
You turned your eyes to me
I felt it all
I'd love you anywhere
But Black Leaf Falls
Oh, Black Leaf Falls
The giant of Illinois
Died of a blister on its toe
After walking all day through the first winter's snow
Throwing bits of stale bread
To the last speck of dawn
He never even felt his shoe fill with blood
Delirious with pain
His bedroom walls began to glow
And he felt himself floating up to falling snow
And the sky was a woman's arms
And the sky was a woman's arms
A boy and dog with a clubbed foot
Sat next to him on his tomb
Once upon a summer's day they went walking to the woods
They spotted a sleeping swan
On the banks of a muddy stream
They stoned it with rocks till it collapsed in the reeds
They laid out on the grass
Full with chocolate and lemonade
And underneath it all, the giant was afraid
And the sky was a woman's arms
Oh, the sky was a woman's arms
And the sky was a woman's arms
I will return here one day
And dig up my bones from the clay
I buried nails and strings and hair
And that old tooth I believe was a bear's
I held my hand in the fire
It burned me down to the wires
Blood suckers hide beneath my bed
And black fumes of skin so gently bled
I slept with a cat on my breast
Slowing my heart stealing my breath
At sunrise the monkeys will fly
And leave me with pennies in my eyes
I will return here one day
And dig up my bones from the clay
I buried nails and string and hair
And that old tooth I believe was a bear's
At sunrise the monkeys will fly
And leave me with pennies in my eyes
Cold was the night, and hard was the ground
They found her in a small grove of trees
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found
She's too young to be out
On the street.
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for
Georgia Lee?
Ida said she couldn't keep Georgia
From dropping out of school
I was doing the best that I could
But she kept runnin' away from this world
These children are so hard to raise good
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for
Georgia Lee?
Close your eyes and count to ten
I will go and hide but then
Be sure to find me. I want you to find me
And we'll play all over
We will play all over again
There's a toad in the witch grass
There's a crow in the corn
Wild flowers on a cross by the road
And somewhere a baby is crying
For her mom
As the hills turn from green back
To gold
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for
Georgia Lee?
I'm not the table you can come and lay your cup down on now
I'm not the shoulder for a bag, don't wanna carry your heavy load
I'm not the road that you think when you lookin' for a short cut
I ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on, I ain't nobody's crutch
I ain't the money man, which your money man, you ain't lookin' at me
I'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son, you ain't lookin' at free
I ain't the dish rag, to come clean up, all the shit that ya dish out
Ain't got no check for em, if you checkin' in
Mothafucka check this out
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do till its gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
But what can I do if I do till its gone
I'm not the the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now
I'm not the new kid, on the block
That you can just follow and push around
I'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found
This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
I'm not a bus ride, you can hop inside, and just roll away clean
Like the wheel on the wagon you wanna break
Because I hold up the weight for the team
I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck
That your scheming to check out
Unless your looking to check out (Shot, shot, shot)
What a mess now (C'mon)
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do till its gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
But what can I do if I do till its gone
I jump to the sky for my people
I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
When you come around and telling me I changed
Dam right I fucking changed
When there's fuckin' change in my pocket
Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden
I went from shoppin' without nothin'
To goin' shoppin' for my cousins
Now that the cops know that I'm buzzin'
They wanna drop me in the oven
Pull me over just to say "I'm a fan"
Hip-hop, gotta love it, fuck it
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do till its gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
But what can I do if I do till its gone
Choking on the thought of leaving
Drinking to keep from sobbing
4pm, 4 dollar pints
The SFO, the time and price
With all my happiness aborted 
The PA painfully starts boarding
I sink deep, 30 thousand feet 
Into my window seat electric chair
And I was drinking you goodbye
A heart floats in the bay
From sour home Chicago
I hear it beating far away
And there's no telling what I'll do
If I don't return to you
Hopeful thoughts of soon returning
Can't put out my stomach burning
Plastic wings and plastic smiles
Unsalted peanuts to stretch my miles
Choking on the thought of leaving
Drinking to keep from heaving
5 PM 5 dollar pints
Hell bound Airlines, time and price
And I was drinking you goodbye
A heart floats in the bay
From sour home Chicago
I hear it beating far away
And there's no telling what I'll do
If I don't return to you
I was drinking you goodbye
A heart floats in the bay
From sour home Chicago
I hear it beating far away
There's no telling what I'll do
If I don't return to you
Instrumental
Flash flood, you got too comfortable
So I showed you who's really in control
You gave all of your savings to the poor
Lightning on the river and you're shivering
With your fishing pole
Same night you bought a ring and you proposed
You never really know what you can't really see
I'll be there, I'll be there
You made it out alive, oh what a relief
I'll be there, I'll be there
Earthquake in your pajamas huddled in doorways
While your house is swaying
Blue blood pumping like a hunter's fist
I love the shape your faces make
"Oh my, thank you for keeping me safe"
Even though you know it don't always go that way
You never really know what you can't really see
I'll be there, I'll be there
You made it out alive, oh what a relief
I'll be there, I'll be there
Everything will be explained
Your wild guess, everything will be explained
Go ahead, everything will be explained
Your wild guess, everything will be explained
I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Me
Me
I've seen you a couple of times
Guess I've seen you three times
Walking circles around me
When you stand in front of my eyes
I'll make sure I'll look
I'll make sure I'll look
I'll make sure I'll look
Away
Away, away
Away
She's like a little Chinese
She is Chinese
Maybe it would be nicer if I search out
The names
She comes around you and me
And when you stand in front of my eyes
I will look
I will look
I will look
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
She looks in distress
She looks impressive
When she is dancing her little home dance on me
Roll, roll, roll away, away, away, away
If you were here beside me instead of in New York
If the curve of you was curved on me
I'd tell you that I loved you before I even knew you
Because I loved the simple thought of you
If our hearts are never broken and there's no joy in the mending
There's so much this hurt can teach us both
And there's distance and there's silence, your words have never left me
They're the prayer that I say every day.
Come on, come out, come here, come here.
Come on, come out, come here, come here.
Come on, come out, come here, come here.
Come on, come out, come here, come here.
The lone neon lights and the heat of the ocean
And the fire that was starting to spark
I miss it all, from the love to the lightning
And the lack of it snaps, me in two.
If you were here beside me instead of in New York
Of the arms you said you'd never leave
I'd tell you that it's simple and it was only ever thus
There is nowhere else that I belong.
Come on, come out, come here, come here.
Come on, come out, come here, come here.
Come on, come out, come here, come here.
Come on, come out, come here, come here.
The lone neon lights and the heat of the ocean
And the fire that was starting to spark
I miss it all from the love to the lightning
And the lack of it snaps, me in two
Just give me a sign, there's an end with a beginning
To the quiet chaos driving me back
The lone neon lights and the warmth of the ocean
And the fire that was starting to go out.
Deep within the corners of my mind
I keep a memory of your face
And I only pull it out
When I long for your embrace
Deep within the corners of my mind
I'm haunted by your smile
As it promises me joy
Like a journey to a tropic aisle
It's not hard to see
What you do to me is like a page right out of Ernest Hemingway
Though I try to fight
All the words you write
Leave me standing in the starring role in some tragic lovers play
But deep within the corners of my mind
I'm praying secretly
That eventually in time
There'll be a place for you
And me
I should have forgotten you long ago
But you're in every song I know
Whining and pining is wrong and so
On and so forth, of course of course
But no, you can't have a divorce
I haven't seen you in ages
But it's not as bleak as it seems
We still dance on whirling stages
In my Busby Berkeley dreams
The tears have stained all the pages
Of my True Romance magazines
We still dance in my outrageously beautiful
Busby Berkeley dreams
And now you want to leave me for good
I refuse to believe you could
You forget we're not made of wood
Well, darling you may do your worst
Because you'll have to kill me first
I haven't seen you in ages
But it's not as bleak as it seems
We still dance on whirling stages
In my Busby Berkeley dreams
The tears have stained all the pages
Of my True Romance magazines
We still dance in my outrageously beautiful
Busby Berkeley dreams
I haven't seen you in ages
But it's not as bleak as it seems
We still dance on whirling stages
In my Busby Berkeley dreams
The tears have stained all the pages
Of my True Romance magazines
We still dance in my outrageously beautiful
Busby Berkeley dreams
Do you think it's dangerous
To have Busby Berkeley dreams?
Can you tell me softly
How you always haunt me?
Can you help me? Hold me
Come to me now, slowly
You caress me smoothly
Calm my fears and soothe me
Move your hands across me
Take my worries from me
I will sacrifice
I will sacrifice
All I have in life
To clear my conscience
I will sacrifice
I will sacrifice
All I have in life
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Can you filll me solely
Deeper still and wholly?
With your understanding
And your arms around me?
Can you help me? Hold me
Whisper to me softly
Move your hands across me
Take my worries from me
I will sacrifice
I will sacrifice
All I have in life
To clear my conscience
I will sacrifice
I will sacrifice
All I have in life
Sacrifice, sacrifice
I will sacrifice
Will sacrifice
Will sacrifice
Will sacrifice
I will sacrifice
I will sacrifice
All I have in life
To clear my conscience
I will sacrifice
I will sacrifice
All I have in life
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
The streets are empty.
Inside it's warm.
His hands are shaking.
They locked the door.
A voice is calling,
Asking to get in.
All he wanted was a toy.
All he needed was a gentle heart
To lead him through the dark
When his dreams are running wild.
Boy and the ghost,
Fire's not burning.
The lights went out,
The lights went out.
Big family dinner,
The untold pain.
Their eyes are sparkling
On his frozen face.
Angel's calling,
Asking to get in.
All he wanted was a toy.
All he needed was a gentle heart
To lead him through the dark
When there's nowhere left to fall.
Boy and the ghost.
His eyes are burning.
The lights went out.
The dream is on.
Wake up, wake up:
There's an angel in the snow.
Look up, look up:
It's a frightened dead boy,
With so much hate,
Such bad dreams.
He could have seen.
The toy's the key,
But no one saw,
No one saw.
All he wanted was a toy;
All he needed was a beating heart
To lead him through the dark.
Boy and the ghost.
Despero, solitas, debilis, desolo.
Despero, solitas, debilis, desolo.
When there's nowhere left to fall, nowhere to hide.
The silence is hurting.
Inside it's cold.
Sleep or die.
Nowhere to go,
Nowhere to hide.
His light went out.
Hold me now,
'Cause I couldn't even if I tried.
It's over now,
I guess it really is my time.
I don't wanna go,
But it's time I gotta say goodbye.
So hold me now,
'Cause this'll be our last time.
I'm slowing down,
And I don't think that I can fight.
I know somehow,
You'll find a way to live your life.
Remember just to live
Every day like it's your last.
And hold me now,
'Cause I think it's time for me to pass.
I don't want to die,
I don't know why,
This kind of fate was meant for me.
You gotta be strong,
Gotta move on,
It's not how it was supposed to be.
And what do I say?
It was never supposed to end up this way.
What do I have to do?
Was supposed to grow old with you.
But that ain't gonna happen.
No that ain't gonna happen.
Hold me now,
'Cause the time I've got's running out.
Now tears allowed,
Even though we've become without.
I just wanna feel
Your head laying on my chest.
So hold me now,
As I take my last breath.
I don't want to die,
I don't know why,
This kind of fate was meant for me.
You gotta be strong,
Gotta move on,
It's not how it was supposed to be.
And what do I say?
It was never supposed to end up this way.
What do I have to do?
Was supposed to grow old with you.
But that ain't gonna happen.
No that ain't gonna happen.
So ambition cut you down 
Ain't a love as perfect 
Everybody knows it 
Something drove you down 
Something as good 
Something new 
Somebody good 
Our ambition cuts us down 
There's not a love that's perfect 
But I, I live in hope 
Somebody good 
Somebody new 
Something as good 
Something that's mine 
Ain't a love that's perfect 
Everybody knows it 
Ambition cuts us down
This is a song about Susan
This is a song about the girl next door
This is a song about the everyday occurrences that make me feel like letting go
Yes, I think we got a problem
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
This is a song about Susan
Yeah, this is a song about the way things are
This is a song about the scary things you see from the corner of your eye
Don't you wonder why we never talk about the future
Yeah, we never talk about the past anymore
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody even wants to know
I guess the honeymoon is over
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
(Nah Nah)
(Nah Nah)
Ooh, I remember we could talk about anything
I remember when we used to want to hang out
I remember we could talk about anything
I remember when we used to want to hang out
I remember we could talk about anything
I remember when we used to want to hang out
I remember when we used to want to hang out
I remember we could talk about anything
I remember, I remember, I remember
Yeah, we never talk about the future
Oh, we never talk about the past anymore
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody needs to know
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)
So much for the afterglow
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)
So much for the afterglow
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)
So much for the afterglow
(Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh)
Yes I guess we need the drama
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
Yeah, so much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
So much for the afterglow
Sits down by the fire
Ease his worried mind
If only I could try
Reach the light inside
Feels so hard to say
Chase his fears away
Know that I won't try
Catch his dreams today
Fading everything to black and blue
You look a lot like you'd
Shatter in the blink of an eye
But you keep sailing right on through
Every time you say you're learning
You just look a lot like me
Pale under the blistering sky
White and red, black and blue
You've been waiting a long time
You've been waiting a long time
To fall down on your knees
Cut your hands
Cut yourself until you bleed
But fall asleep next to me
Wait for everyone to go away
And in a dimly lit
Room where you've got nothing to hide
Say your goodbyes
Tell yourself we'll read
A note that says, "I'm sorry everyone.
I'm tired of feeling nothing, goodbye."
Wash your face, dry your eyes, oh
'Cause you've been waiting a long time
You've been waiting a long, long time
To fall down on your knees
Cut your hands
Cut yourself until you bleed
But fall asleep next to me
And have a dream I'm falling down
On my face, I scrape my knees
I scrape my hands until they bleed
'Cause you're fast asleep next to me
Next to me, next to me, next to me
There's nothing you can say
Nothing you can do
There's nothing in between
You know the truth
Nothing left to face
There's nothing left to lose
Nothing takes your place...
When they say you're not that strong
You're not that weak
It's not your fault
And when you climb
Up to your hill
Up to your place
I hope you're well
There's nothing left to prove
There's nothing I won't do
There's nothing like the pain
I feel for you
Nothing left to hide
Nothing left to fear
I am always here...
When they say you're not that strong
You're not that weak
It's not your fault
And when you climb
Up to your hill
Up to your place
I hope you're well
What you want
What you lost
What you had
What is gone is over
What you got
What you love
What you need
What you have is real
It's not enough,
It's not enough,
It's not enough,
It's not enough
I'm sorry,
It's not enough,
It's not enough,
It's not enough,
It's not enough
When they say you're not that strong
You're not that weak
It's not your fault
And when you climb
Up to your hill
Up to your place
I hope you're well
It's not enough
No, it's not enough
It's not enough
Instrumental
This is the film close to the third act and the misery
This isn't rain, you rapist werewolves
This is God pissing down on you
Don't worry, you won't die alone 
I'll break off my own arms and
Sharpen my bones and stab you once for each time I thought of you 
Trying to take something you'll never be good enough
To even look upon
 
It's better to push something when it's slipping
Than to risk being dragged down
If you want to hit bottom
Don't bother taking me with you
And I won't answer if you call
I'm two heartbeats ahead in Hell
Trying to break your fall
 
This isn't a mob, I won't need to change 
To change the names
Everyone around you has murdered someone's something sacred
There isn't one nail without dirt under it 
There isn't any "white cotton panties" 
That aren't soaked and stained red 
 
It's better to push something when it's slipping
Than to risk being dragged down
If you want to hit bottom
And I won't answer if you call
I'm two heartbeats ahead in Hell
Trying to break your fall
 
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
Mmmmm Hmmm Mhmhmmm
If You can take away all my love
What do I need you for?
You can take away all these words
There's no meaning anymore
You can take away everything leave me lying on the floor
All those sorrys, we can't go back to the start
You can't fix me, I'm torn apart
I wanna run away from love
This time I have had enough
Everytime I feel your touch,
I'm broken
Shattered all the pieces apart
Never thought I'd fall so hard
I'm putting back together my heart,
I'm broken
You can take these photographs,
Watch them fade away
You can throw away all these letters
I don't care about what they say
All those sorrys, there's a million reasons why
You can't mend me, don't even try
I wanna run away from love
This time I have had enough
Everytime I feel your touch,
I'm broken
Shattered all the pieces apart
Never thought I'd fall so hard
I'm putting back together my heart,
I'm broken
I know it's gonna take some time
To finally realize
I got nothing left inside
Nothing to hide
I'm broken, I'm broken
I'm broken, I'm broken
Inside
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Save me!
I wanna run away from love
This time I have had enough
Everytime I feel your touch,
I'm broken
Shattered all the pieces apart
Never thought I'd fall so hard
I'm putting back together my heart,
I'm broken
Outside it's summer, indoors it's cool
It's just after 3pm, I see kids leaving school
Policeman are walking, walking in lines
Tight side by side
A young boy's died
15 years old, slow walking alone
They stole his phone, he never got home
Three boys in hoods
A warm summer's day
Stuck him and killed him and then ran away
Now there's red spray paint slashed on the wall
R.I.P. Baby, we love you from all
Just that one moment, ended their days
Outside my house on Daisy Lane...
We picked our way down to the beach
Watching the waves dragging out of our reach
Tangling tails, like a sodden sheet
Dangling entrails from the gut of the sea
Hoarding our meals, alfalfa and rolls
Trying not to catch the cold eye of the gulls
I hope Mother Nature has not overheard
Though she doles out hurt like a puking bird
We stayed for the winter
No-one told us about the laws of the land
I hold my own, but you with your hunger
You, on the other hand make yourself known
And when we were found I know we both grieved
My heart made the sound of snow falling from eaves
You and me, Bess, we was as thick as thieves
So I swore, nonetheless, up and down, it was only me
So they took me away and after some time
Studying my case must have made up their minds
By the time you realized I was dying
Must have been too late, I believe you were not lying
It is the day, I wake with my ears cocked up like a gun
Like every day, of course
Yanked by my wrists to the sugar-front courtyard
Now tell me, what have I done?
Seems I have stolen a horse and I step to the gallows
Who do you think that you are?
Arching your hooves like a crane
In the shallow gutter that lines the boulevards
Crowded with folks who just
Stare as I hang, it's all the same
Kindness comes over me, what was your name?
It makes no difference, I'm glad that you came
Forever, I'll listen to your glad neighing
You're up with the sunrise
And down when the work's been done
With excellence industry
Diligence naturally
I would like to be you
Just for a few habit forming years
Laziness cuts me like fine cutlery
I need a miracle someone to help me help myself
Sweet Jesus I need you
Forgive me this sin
Not hookers or heroin gambling or gin
It sounds so ridiculous but I just can't lick this
Weeds blow tall on a broken train track
Ruth B. draws we're fixin' to get high
Maybe we'll hit the bluffs and find ourselves the same old rum
But everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this town is pitiful
And I'll be gettin' out as soon as I can fly
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
The hopped up boys are lookin' for their trouble
The knocked up girls, well they've all got their share
Ruth seems out of her mind, swears she won't give in this time
But everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same this town is pitiful
And I'll be gettin' out as soon as I can fly
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
But everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this town's gone pitiful
And I'll be gettin' out as soon as I can fly
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
'Cuz nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we do it our way
All these words I just don't say
'Cuz nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do, no
Never cared for what they know, no
But I know
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
'Cuz nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do, no
Never cared for what they know, no
Never cared for what they do, no
But I know
Trust I seek but I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
'Cuz nothing else matters, oh
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
'Cuz nothing else matters
'Cuz nothing else matters
Instrumental
I want to be still
I want to walk into your grave
Where I can shelter in peace
Until all our cares have blown away - yeah
Let the whole world fall away
And fall into my arms
Stay with me
I don't know how long we've got left
And so I'm asking you
To forgive me
I learn as I go
To float far away
Into silence
And just watch your face
And find some kind of grace
In that quiet bliss
Can I stay and say nothing at all, at all.
Where will we go when we get old
When the bustle and the noise
Get too frightening
When each and every angry word
Is banished to the past
That's when I think...
We'll learn as we go
To float far away
Into silence
And I'll watch your face
And find patience and grace
In each line there
Work each day, all for nothing at all, at all.
The few words I say they mean nothing at all, at all.
Will you walk into the grave with me
Will you leave this empty world
Soft and wistful
To sink into the dark, dark earth
And never reappear would be blissful
To float far away
Into eternal space
And God's silence
Where I'll watch your face
And find patience and grace
In each line there
Drift away into nothing at all, at all.
Find the grace to be nothing at all, at all.
Fade away and end up nothing at all.
At all, at all, at all.
Sag mir was ist bloß um uns geschehn
Du scheinst mir auf einmal völlig fremd zu sein
Warum geht's mir nich mehr gut
Wenn ich in deinen Armen liege
Ist es egal geworden was mit uns passiert
Wo willst du hin ich kann dich kaum noch sehn
Unsre Eitelkeit stellt sich uns in den Weg
Wollten wir nich alles wagen haben wir uns vielleicht verraten
Ich hab geglaubt wir könnten echt alles ertragen
Symphonie
Und jetzt wird es still um uns
Denn wir stehn hier im Regen haben nichts mehr zu geben
Und es ist besser wenn du gehst
Denn es ist Zeit
Sich ein zu gestehn dass es nicht geht
Es gibt nichts mehr zu reden denn wenn es regnet
Ist es besser aufzugeben
Und es verdichtet sich die Stille über uns
Ich versteh nich ein Wort mehr aus deinem Mund
Haben wir zu viel versucht warum konnten wir's nicht ahnen
Es wird nicht leicht sein das alles einzusehn
Symphonie
Und jetzt wird es still um uns
Denn wir stehn hier im Regen haben uns nichts mehr zu geben
Und es ist besser wenn du gehst
Denn es ist Zeit
Sich ein zu gestehn dass es nicht geht
Es gibt nichts mehr zu reden denn wenn es regnet
Ist es besser aufzugeben
Irgendwo sind wir gescheitert
Und so wie's ist so geht's nich weiter
Das Ende ist schon lang geschrieben
Und das war unsre...
Symphonie
Und jetzt wird es still um uns
Denn wir stehn hier im Regen haben uns nichts mehr zu geben
Und es ist besser wenn du gehst
Denn es ist Zeit
Sich ein zu gestehn dass es nicht geht
Es gibt nichts mehr zu reden denn wenn es regnet
Ist es besser aufzugeben
The perfect taste that leaves your mouth
The vodka tongue that spits it out
Violate me, January victim
All my life I've wasted for this
Violate me, show me your religion
All my time I've waited
Simple girl, simple girl
I need you in the world, my simple girl
And so the kiss became the cold
After the crash and my cosmetic lows
You resurrect me, stand me to attention
Take my voices, learn to love them
You're the Christmas promising the Summer
All my life I've waited
Simple girl, simple girl
I need you in the world, my simple girl
Simple girl, my simple girl
My simple girl, my simple girl
My simple girl, my simple girl
I need you in the world
Want you in the world
I walked around my good intentions
And found that there were none
I blamed my father for the wasted years
We hardly talked
I never thought I would forget this hate
Then a phone call made me realize
I'm wrong
And if I don't make it known that
I loved you all along
Just like sunny days that
We ignore because
We're all dumb and jaded
And I hope to God I figure out
What's wrong
I walked around my room
Not thinking
Just sinking in this box
I blame myself for being too much
Like somebody else
I never thought I would just
Bend this way
Then a phone call made me realize
I'm wrong
And if I don't make it known that
I loved you all along
Just like sunny days that
We ignore because
We're all dumb and jaded
And I hope to God I figure out
What's wrong
I will leave behind all of my clothes
I wore when I was with you
All I need's my railroad boots
And my leather jacket
As I say goodbye to Ruby's arms
Although my heart is breaking
I will steal away out through your blinds
For soon you will be waking
The morning light has washed your face
And everything is turning blue now
Hold on to your pillow case
There's nothing I can do now
As I say goodbye to Ruby's arms
You'll find another soldier
And I swear to God by Christmas time
There'll be someone else to hold you
The only thing I'm taking is
The scarf off of your clothesline
I'll hurry past your chest of drawers
And your broken wind chimes
As I say goodbye
I'll say goodbye
Say goodbye to Ruby's arms
I will feel my way down the darkened hall
And out into the morning
The hobos at the freightyards
Have kept their fires burning
So Jesus Christ, this goddamn rain
Will someone put me on a train
I'll never kiss your lips again
Or break your heart
As I say goodbye
I'll say goodbye
Say goodbye to Ruby's arms
Was always waiting for the crush
The car to drive right through the shops
To call in sick and late at work
And take a holiday
Was always tangled up in knots
To keep myself from speaking up
But no one's listening anyway
Just trying to bribe me
And if it's alright
Then what are we doing here?
And if it's alright
This place is gassed by fear
And if it's alright
I'll tell you cos you never understand
And if it's alright I'll beg you
'Cause I'm a begging kind of man
Today I wrote a bad cheque
Packed a bag and took a jet
And no one's looking anyway
I hope you miss me
(Sometimes I think maybe I'm making a big mistake)
It's funny that way, you can get used
To the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself
Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father I have sinned
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself
Oh Father, if you never wanted to live that way
If you never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?
Oh Father, if you never wanted to live that way
If you never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?
Maybe someday
When I look back I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself
Where the Iceman's mule is parked outside the bar
Where a man with missing fingers plays a strange guitar
And the German dwarf dances the butcher's son
And tonight a little rain never hurt no one
Where they're dancing on the roof and the ceiling's coming down
And I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
And a little trouble makes it worth the going
And a little rain never hurt no one
Oh, the world is round and so I'll go around
You must risk something that matters
Oh, my hands are strong, I'll take any man here
If it's worth the going, it's worth the ride
She was 15 years old and she'd never seen the ocean
She climbed into a van with a vagabond
And the last thing she said was "I love you, mom"
And a little rain never hurt no one
And a little rain never hurt no one
My heart became a drunken runt
On the day I sunk in this shunt
To tap me clean of all the wonder
And the sorrow I have seen since I left my home
My home on the old Milk Lake
Where the darkness does fall so fast, it feels like some kind of mistake
Just like they told you it would
Just like the Tulgey Wood
When I came into my land
I did not understand
Neither dry rot or the burn pile
Or the bark-beetle or the dry well
Or the black bear
But there is another who is a little older
When I broke my bone, he carried me up from the riverside
To spend my life in spitting distance of the love that I have known
I must stay here, in an endless eventide
And if you come and see me, you will upset the order
You cannot come and see me, for I set myself apart
But when you come and see me in California
You cross the border of my heart
Well, I have sown untidy furrows across my soul, but I am still a coward
Content to see my garden grow so sweet and full of someone else's flowers
Sometimes, I can almost feel the power
Sometimes I am so in love with you
Like a little clock that trembles on the edge of the hour
Only ever calling out, "Cuckoo"
When I called you, you little one
In a bad way, did you love me? Do you spite me?
Time will tell if I can be well
And rise to meet you rightly
While moving across my land
Brandishing themselves like a burning branch
Advance the tallow-colored walleyed deer
Quiet as gondoliers
While I wait all night, for you in California
Watching the fox pick off my goldfish from their sorry golden state
And I am no longer afraid of anything
Save the life that here awaits
I don't belong to anyone, my heart is heavy as an oil drum
And I don't want to be alone, my heart is yellow as an ear of corn
And I have torn my soul apart from pulling artlessly with fool commands
Some nights, I just never go to sleep at all and I stand
Shaking in my doorway like a sentinel, all alone
Bracing like the bow upon a ship and fully abandoning
Any thought of anywhere but home, my home
Sometimes I can almost feel the power
And I do love you
Is it only timing that has made it such a dark hour?
Only ever chiming out, "Cuckoo"?
My heart, I wear you down, I know
Gotta think straight, keep a clean plate
Keep from wearing down
If I lose my head, just where am I going to lay it?
For it has half-ruined me to be hanging around
Here, among the daphne blooming out of the big brown
I am native to it, but I'm overgrown
I have choked my roots on the earth, as rich as roe
Here, down in California
Guess I think I feel alright
You come circling through the light
The skyline, baby, is bright tonight
One more perfect rendezvous
Sundown paints the shadows through
The daylight aiming on what we do
It looks like darkness to me, oh
Drifting down into Miami
Miami
Can I say?
I wish that this weather would never leave
It just gets hard to believe
That God sent this angel to watch over me
'Cause my angel, she don't receive my calls
She says I'm too dumb to fuck
Too dumb to fight, too dumb to save
Well, maybe I don't need no angel at all
It looks like darkness to me, oh
Drifting down into Miami
She could pull the sun right through me, oh
Coming down into Miami
Miami
Make a circle in the sand
Make a halo with your hands
Make a place for you to land
The bus is runnin', it's time to leave
The summer's gone, so are we
So come on baby, let's go shut it down
In New Orleans
Come on, baby
Let's go shut it down in New Orleans
Oh yeah, come on baby, come on baby
Let's go shut it down in New Orleans
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go shut it down in New Orleans
Oh yeah, come on baby, come on baby
Let's go shut it down
Believe me when I tell you
I will try to understand
Believe me when I tell you
I could never kill a man
But to know that another man's holding you tight
Hurts me, little darling
Through the morning, through the night
The bond has been broken
The promise you gave
The words that were spoken
I cannot be your slave
But to know that the trust you had in me is gone
Hurts me, little darling
Through the nighttime, through the dawn
I dreamed just last night
You were there by my side
Your sweet loving tenderness
Easing my pride
But then I awoke dear and found you not there
It was just my old memory of how much I care
Believe me when I tell you
I will try to understand
Believe me when I tell you
I could never kill a man
But to know that another man's holding you tight
Hurts me little, darling
Through the morning, through the night
Ich kann nicht mehr seh'n
Trau nicht mehr meinen Augen
Kann kaum noch glauben
Gefühle haben sich gedreht
Ich bin viel zu träge
Um aufzugeben
Es wär' auch zu früh
Weil immer was geht
Wir waren verschwor'n
Wär'n füreinander gestorben
Haben den Regen gebogen
Uns Vertrauen gelieh'n
Wir haben versucht
Auf der Schussfahrt zu wenden
Nichts war zu spät
Aber vieles zu früh
Wir haben uns geschoben
Durch alle Gezeiten
Haben uns verzettelt
Uns verzweifelt geliebt
Wir haben die Wahrheit
So gut es ging verlogen
Es war ein Stück vom Himmel
Dass es dich gibt...
Du hast jeden Raum
Mit Sonne geflutet
Hast jeden Verdruss
Ins Gegenteil verkehrt
Nordisch nobel
Deine sanftmütige Güte
Dein unbändiger Stolz
Das Leben ist nicht fair
Den Film getanzt
In einem silbernen Raum
Vom goldenen Balkon
Die Unendlichkeit bestaunt
Heillos versunken, trunken
Und alles war erlaubt
Zusammen im Zeitraffer
Mittsommernachtstraum
Du hast jeden Raum
Mit Sonne geflutet
Hast jeden Verdruss
Ins Gegenteil verkehrt
Nordisch nobel
Deine sanftmütige Güte
Dein unbändiger Stolz
Das Leben ist nicht fair
Dein sicherer Gang
Deine wahren Gedichte
Deine heitere Würde
Dein unerschütterliches Geschick
Du hast der Fügung
Deine Stirn geboten
Hast ihn nie verraten
Deinen Plan vom Glück
Deinen Plan vom Glück
Ich gehe nicht weg
Hab' meine Frist verlängert
Neue Zeitreise
Offene Welt
Habe dich sicher
In meiner Seele
Ich trage dich bei mir
Bis der Vorhang fällt
Ich trag dich bei mir
Bis der Vorhang fällt
Shadows all around you as you surface from the dark
Emerging from the gentle grip of night's unfolding arms
Darkness, darkness everywhere, do you feel alone?
The subtle grace of gravity, the heavy weight of stone
You don't see what you possess, a beauty calm and clear
It floods the sky and blurs the darkness like a chandelier
All the light that you possess is skewed by lakes and seas
The shattered surface, so imperfect, is all that you believe
I will bring a mirror, so silver, so exact
So precise and so pristine, a perfect pane of glass
I will set the mirror up to face the blackened sky
You will see your beauty every morning that you rise
Slow is the memory
And I can picture her standing right in front of me
Said that I'm behaving badly
Kinda driving her crazy
I know she wants me
I remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugarcane
And sit on top of me, yelling out my f name
Until I'm empty
I know she wants me
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to ya
Cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax 
You know you want me
All the time and everywhere
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to ya cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
Cause sometimes I don't know what to do 
I'm scared and standing right in front of you
And pray our pain subsides
Can't bear the stare of your teary eyes
I know you feel like it's hard to stay
In fact you may just want to run away
Now all that I can really say is baby, oh
Deep down you know that
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to ya cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
I've already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to ya cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drown in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
Mama, take this badge off o' me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
I feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
And when I asked for a separate room
It was late at night and we'd been driving since noon
But if I'd known how that would sound to you
I would have stayed in your bed
For the rest of my life
Just to prove I was right
That it's harder to be friends than lovers
And you shouldn't try to mix the two
'Cause if you do it and you're still unhappy
Then you know that the problem is you
And it's true that I stole your lighter
And it's also true that I lost the map
But when you said that I wasn't worth talking to
I had to take your word on that
But if you'd known how that would sound to me
You would have taken it back
And boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Burned it up and thrown it away
You put in my hand a loaded gun
And then told me not to fire it
When you did the things you said were up to me
And then accused me of trying to fuck it up
But you've never been a waste of my time
It's never been a drag
So take a deep breath and count back from ten
And maybe you'll be all right
And the license said you had to stick around until I was dead
But if you're tired of looking at my face, I guess I already am
But you've never been a waste of my time
It's never been a drag
So take a deep breath and count back from ten
And maybe you'll be all right
Your grand dad left home for the circus
He was young just like me,
With hope to explore
He married a girl in Virginia
She could swing the trapeze,
They could sleep on the floor
Your mother was born in December,
On the one sunny day that winter gave up
With warm summer eyes that flickered like fireflies,
And she stared at the world
So why do you leave these stories unfinished,
My Cheshire cat doorstop with tears in your eyes?
And why do you look when you've already found it?
And what did you find that would leave you walking by?
She was raised in a New England village
Then she moved to LA with her firefly stare,
And you loved sunset strip when it sparkled
You grew up and you sparkled, but why don't you care?
And why do you leave these stories unfinished,
My Cheshire cat doorstop with tears in your eyes?
And why do you look when you've already found me?
And what did you find that would leave you walking by?
And these nights I get high just from breathing
When I lie here with you I'm sure that I'm real
Like that firework over the freeway
I could stay here all day but that's not how you feel
So why do you leave these questions unanswered?
The circus awaits and you're already gone
My Cheshire cat doorstop with fear in your smile,
What makes it so easy for you to be walking by?
And what did I do that you can't seem to want me?
And why do we lie here and whisper goodbyes?
Where can I go that your pictures won't haunt me?
What makes it so easy for you to be walking by?
Walking by
Greed's all gone now, there's no question
And I can see you push your hair behind your ears
Regain your balance
Doesn't matter where she is tonight
Or with whoever she spends her time
If these arms were meant to hold her
They were never meant to hold her so tight
For the love of that girl
Greed's all gone now, the panic subsides
When I could run, pulling arms to love her
Try to put myself on on the inside
For the love of that girl
Tears swell, you don't know why
For the love of that girl
They never fall, they can never run dry
For the love of that girl
Promise is never over, never questioned it needed reply
But she could breathe deep into my neck
Let me know I'm just on the outside
Greed's all gone now, there's no question
And I can see you push your hair behind your ears
Regain your balance
Doesn't matter where she is tonight
Or with whoever she spends her time
If these arms were meant to hold her
They were never meant to hold her so tight
I had a brother once
He drowned in a bathtub
Before he'd ever learned how to talk
And I don't know what his name was
But my mother does
I heard her say it once
Padraic my prince, I have all but died
From the sheer weight of my shame
You cried but no one came
And the water filled your tiny lungs
Appear, my dear, and cry for me
Six years ago today
That I laid you in your grave
Your sweet young skin was shining then too
So tonight to celebrate I will...
I will poison myself
Another coughing, shaking fit in a bathroom
That is spinning
And I close the door
And I rest my head on the tile floor
Sickness and sleep turning me cold
I'm still not sure
Is there some better place I could be heading towards?
Where the selfishly sick and self-absorbed...
Are welcome
I saw the future once
I was drunk in a phone booth
My eyes were wet and red
But I could not tell what was said
And through the screams of the traffic
Voices carried
Saying I'm sorry
On a day so gray it's black inside
Watching churches on TV
In a coma you don't dream
You just hope that someone sits with you
Babies turn blue when they're ignored
Like the sky on summer days
Before you turn and walk away
It has changed you
So tonight to compensate I will...
I will poison myself
Another coughing, shaking fit in a bathroom
That is spinning
So is it goodbye?
Is it time to set you free?
Is it time to let it fly?
Is it time to let it bleed?
We used to take turns
To cover up the pain
Deep below it burns
And the feeling still remains
You're gonna find someone new
I really hope you do
'Cause I love you
And the sun will come on through
It's gonna shine for you
'Cause I adore you
Yes we gave it a try
But maybe for too long
Out of every sorrow
Another day will dawn
You're gonna find someone new
I really hope you do
'Cause I love you
And the sun will come on through
It's gonna shine for you
'Cause I adore you
And the road travels on
But I'm still near you
In my life, like a song
I will still hear you
Still
You're gonna find someone new
I really hope you do
'Cause I love you
You're gonna find someone new
I really hope you do
'Cause I love you
And the sun will come on through
It's gonna shine for you
'Cause I adore you
Sun will shine for you
Sun will shine for you
'Cause I adore you
Sun will shine for you
Sun will shine for you
'Cause I adore you
Sun will shine for you
Sun will shine for you
'Cause I adore you
Sun will shine for you
Sun will shine for you
'Cause I adore you
I can't wait for long my darling
All I have to keep me strong
All I have will go
And I move on
And I move on
And I am aching
And I'm aching
I can't wait for long, I'm sorry
All I have has left me gone
I can't stay for long, I'm sorry
All that's left me kept me strong
All I have will go
And I move on
And I move on
And I'm aching
And I am aching
And I move on
And I'm aching
Down by your side
I watch the dreary light
It illuminates your sleeping skin
I reach my cold arm across the bed
You make no move
You never do
Own these dire nights
Own their seething lies
Own my damage
Own my sears
They paint a broken life's
Shattered art
And time won't turn
My wretched world
To stand in your shadow is to be home
I took some time away for understanding
Of what brought us here today
Oh, you'll be the end of me
I'm never happy like we were happy
I'm never sad like we were sad
Oh, you'll be the end of me
You know me all too well
And I can't suppress the memories
You're gone and I can tell
That I've lost more than you'll ever see
Don't say that it's not fair
That you're not the person you wanna be
'Cause oh, you'll be the end of me
I know I wasn't perfect, but I kept trying
Till I forgot why I stayed
Oh, you'll be the end of me
Yeah, we lost all meanin', we lost the magic
So good luck to you on your way
Oh, you'll be the end of me
You know me all too well
And I can't suppress the memories
You're gone and I can tell
That I've lost more than you'll ever see
Don't say that it's not fair
That you're not the person you wanna be
'Cause oh, you'll be the end of me
(You'll be the end of me)
I get it, no, I get it
Gave more than I took back, oh well (So back away)
I get it, no, I get it
Can't help those who don't wanna be helped
You know me all too well
And I can't suppress the memories
You're gone and I can tell
That I've lost more than you'll ever see
Don't say that it's not fair
That you're not the person you wanna be
'Cause oh, you'll be the end of me
(You'll be the end of me)
Dust devil swept you away
It's still not real
Ash, and urn, and silence
Talk to me
Dust devil swept you away
My recollections are
All that's left of you
Swirl and sway without me
Dust devil swept you away
Whirling, playful dancing about you
What's left of you is
Ash and urn and this silent horizon
Dust devil swept you away
It's still not real
Ash and urn and silence
Dust devil swept you away
My recollections are all that's left of you
Swirl and sway without me
Dust devil swept you away
Whirling, playful dancing
What's left of you is
Ash and urn and this silent horizon
Swirl and sway without me
Dust devil swept you away
Whirling, playful dancing about you
What's left of you is
Ash and urn and this silent
(Aundrea)
Lately, I've been tryin' to fight whatever's pulling us under
It's got a hold & really making me wonder
What it takes to get through
I gotta stick with you, my baby.
Baby tell me?
Maybe I'm foolishly overreacting
But being without you I can't imagine
It's just to close to the heart
And I won't stand it if were broken apart.
Chorus: (Group)
Do you hear me?
Baby you gotta believe in the things that make you & me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you I got ya back now
When the chips are down
It seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
Just know that I am by your side
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes,
I'm gonna stay down & Ride For You baby.
(Dawn)
We've been cutting it close with the backwards & forwards
It's rocking the boat; we gotta get control of this
Let's take it back to 3 years ago
When you said that we could make it through whatever, ever.
And to me it sounded like you meant forever, ever
Leaving was not an option baby never, never
Now don't you believe in a love that's worth a fight
In you is everything that I'm missing.
So give us a chance.
Chorus: (Group)
Do you hear me?
Baby you gotta believe in the things that make you & me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you I got ya back now
When the chips are down
It seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
Just know that I am by your side
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes,
I'm gonna stay down & Ride For You baby.
Don't you dare tell me we gotta let it go...
We been on top for too long just to let it go under
I don't wanna hear that
I just can't hear that
And know
Wherever you wanna take me
I'll go
I been with you for too long to start over with another
I know that you hear me
Just tell me you hear me.
Chorus: (Group)
Do you hear me?
Baby you gotta believe in the things that make you & me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you I got ya back now
When the chips are down
It seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
Just know that I am by your side
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes,
I'm gonna stay down & Ride For You baby.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
(Group)
I'm gonna stay down & Ride For You baby.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
(Group)
I'm gonna stay down & Ride For You baby.
Heard your name the other day, it's been a long, long time
Ancient history, some would say, another state of mind
You smell of memory felt-tipped electric child
She takes a plastic pill, she plays the weatherman
She screams "Religion kills more than it saves you, man"
She painted filigrees, she was the acid queen
She claims society is just a fever dream
Now you live in the trees and salty seas tripping out in the blue skies
You shut the door on everything too busy getting high
And me, just another dream theory lost inside your eyes
She's not in your history books, lost her mind and kept her looks
Down beneath the radar screen, she's lit up like gasoline
Been throught a million kicks looking for the one that sticks
Never would've known it then, I might not see her again
Top hats and tails for thrills, red lips and famous hands
Sidelong and glancing still in tiny dancer land
We kissed, time slipped, hard edged, tight lipped
See you some time, ask me if I care
Karen, miss communication, Karen, Karen
Ooh
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standing here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn
The taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
Ooh
There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, let me kiss you
Then close your eyes and I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say
Oh kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
I'm leaving on a jet plane
Leaving on a jet plane
Leaving on a jet plane
Leaving on a jet plane
Leaving on a jet plane
Leaving on a jet plane
Leaving on a jet plane
Leaving on a jet plane
Leaving on a jet plane ...
If the wild bird could speak
He'd tell of places you have been
He's been in my dreams
And he knows all the ways of the wind
Polly, come home again
Spread your wings to the wind
I felt much of the pain
As it begins
Dreams cover much time
Still they leave blind the will to begin
I searched for you there
And now look for you from within
Polly, come home again
Spread your wings to the wind
I felt much of the pain
As it begins
Polly, come home again
Spread your wings to the wind
I felt much of the pain
As it begins
The night has fallen down the staircase
And I, for one, have felt its bruises
Equilbrium; inebriated
Our social graces have been displaced
As we sink deeper into the drink
The volume increases...
Night time resurrects fault lines
Silent wars -- rumble somewhere below
The surfaces verses...
The surfaces verses...
The shoe is dropped, lungs explode
Shards of words of a shattered voice
And there's still a hole where the phone was thrown
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...
The moon is rising, a revolution
I close my eyes and the room is spinning
You're screaming:
"Sweetie, the moon has raped me --
It has left its seeds like a tomb inside me
So I must learn to abort these feelings
This romance is bleeding..."
Night time triggers the land mines
Bedroom wounds -- lovers like brigadiers
Marching two by two...
Marching two by two...
A soldier's down
Flood gates burst
I've said some things I wish you'd never heard
Like, "There's still a hole where the phone was thrown."
It's growing as we speak
And it's sucking us both in
A vacuum of sorrow to swallow up the day
Stone cold
Stone cold
You see me standing
But I'm dyin' on the floor
Stone cold
Stone cold
Maybe if I don't cry
I won't feel anymore
Stone cold
Baby
God knows I try to feel
Happy for you
Know that I am
Even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart
We'll make it through
If happy is her
I'm happy for you
Stone cold
Stone cold
You're dancing with her
While I'm staring at my phone
Stone cold
Stone cold
I was your amber
But now she's your shade of gold
Stone cold
Baby
God knows I try to feel
Happy for you
Know that I am
Even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart
We'll make it through
If happy is her
I'm happy for you
Don't wanna be stone cold
Stone
I wish I could mean this but here's my goodbye
I'm happy for you
Know that I am
Even if I can't understand
If happy is her
If happy is her
I'm happy for you
We used to have fun
Now all we do is fight
We know something's wrong
It's clear something hear ain't right
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
This time next year, we'll be no more, yeah
Talk about tomorrow, girl
It's only gonna end in tears, baby yeah
Our time is borrowed, girl
All we got left's right here
We used to talk
Now all we do is shout, oh yeah
Our heads full of thoughts
We could both do without
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
This time next year, we'll be no more, oh yeah
Talk about tomorrow, girl
It's only gonna end in tears, baby yeah
Our time is borrowed, girl
All we got left's right here, mm mm yeah
All we do is try
Try to make it all okay, baby yeah
We both know it's a waste of time
Things are never gonna change, mm mm
We both know we're hanging on here
But no one's gonna say it
So we'll just carry on like always
Acting like nothing's wrong, yeah
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
This time next year, we'll be no more, yeah
Talk about tomorrow, girl
It's only gonna end in tears, baby yeah
Our time is borrowed, girl
All we got left's right here, mm mm yeah
All we do is try
Try to make it all okay, baby yeah
We both know it's a waste of time
Things are never gonna change, ooh ooh
They ain't gonna change
No no
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
This time next year, we'll be no more
When I wake up, well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you.
And when I go out, yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you.
And when I come home, yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's coming home to you.
And when I'm dreamin', well I know I'm gonna dream
I'm gonna dream about the time when I'm with you.
But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
Just to be the man who walked 1000 miles
To fall down at your door
When I'm workin', yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's workin' hard for you.
And when the money comes in for the work I do
I'll pass along every cent of it to you.
And when I'm lonely, well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you.
And if I grow old, well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you.
But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
Just to be the man who walked 1000 miles
To fall down at your door
But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
Just to be the man who walked 1000 miles
To fall down at your door
When I wake up, well I hope I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's waking up to you.
And when I'm dreamin', well I know I'm gonna dream
I'm gonna dream about the time I had with you.
Once I was a soldier
And I fought on foreign sands for you
Once I was a hunter
And I brought home fresh meat for you
Once I was a lover
And I searched behind your eyes for you
And soon there'll be another
To tell you I was just a lie
And sometimes I wonder
Just for a while
Will you remember me
And though you have forgotten
All of our rubbish dreams
I find myself searching
Through the ashes of our ruins
For the days when we smiled
And the hours that ran wild
With the magic of our eyes
And the silence of our words
And sometimes I wonder
Just for a while
Will you remember me
You've been my golden best friend
And now with post-demise at hand
I can't go to you for consolation
'Cause we're off limits during this transition
This grief overwhelms me
It burns in my stomach
And I can't stop bumping into things
I thought we'd be simple together
I thought we'd be happy together
Thought we'd be limitless together
I thought we'd be precious together
But I was sadly mistaken
You've been my soulmate and then some
I remembered you the moment I met you
With you I knew god's face was handsome
With you I saw fun and expansion
This loss is numbing me it pierces my chest
And I can't stop dropping everything
I thought we'd be sexy together
Thought we'd be evolving together
I thought we'd have children together
I thought we'd be family together
But I was sadly mistaken
If I had a bill for all the philosophies I shared
If I had a penny for all the possibilities I presented
If I had a dime for every hand thrown up in the air
My wealth would render this no less severe
I thought we'd be genius together
I thought we'd be healing together
I thought we'd be growing together
Thought we'd be adventurous together
But I was sadly mistaken
Thought we'd be exploring together
Thought we'd be inspired together
I thought we'd be flying together
Thought we'd be on fire together
But I was sadly mistaken
Thank you for this bitter knowledge
Guardian angels who left me stranded
It was worth it, feeling abandoned
Makes one hardened but
What has happened to love?
You got me writing lyrics on postcards
Then in the evenings looking at stars
But the brightest of the planets is Mars
What has happened to love?
So I will opt for the big white limo
Vanity fairgrounds and rebel angels
You can't be trusted with feathers so hollow
Your heaven's invention, steel-eyed vampires of love
You see over me
I'll never know 
What you have shown to other eyes
Go or go ahead and surprise me
Say you've lead the way to a mirage
Go or go ahead and just try me
What has happened to love?
What has happened to love?	
What has happened to love?
Nowhere's now here smelling of junipers
Fell off the hay bales I'm over the rainbows
But oh Medusa kiss me and crucify
This unholy notion of the mythic power of love
Look in her eyes
Look in her eyes
Forget about the ones that are cryin'
Look in her eyes
Look in her eyes
Forget about the ones that are cryin'
Go or go ahead
Go or go ahead
Go or go ahead
And surprise me
Go or go ahead
Go or go ahead
Go or go ahead
And just try me
What has happened to love?
So long 
My friend 
There must always 
Be an end 
But all our love 
And life 
And song 
Carries on 
I carry it on 
Now the lightships 
Are guiding you 
Over the sea 
And the lightships 
Are sailing you 
Away from me 
Over the edge of the world 
The edge of the world 
Over the edge 
But I carry you on 
I carry you on 
And I carry on
What the hell is your name?
And can you explain this mess?
It seems you're playing a game
Where you only know how to take out the best
'Cause if assholes could fly
This place would be busier than O'Hare
There's proof in the sky
It's as thick as our skulls yet it's thinner than air
I have something to say
If the chip off your shoulder should fall to your chest
Get it off right away
'Cause if you don't, then it won't be in peace that you rest
It's just a matter of time
That we all go away to a better place, I'm told
It all sounds well and fine
But without you around I feel nothing but cold
And I now have nothing
But your heartbeat in my head
And a photograph of my traveling friend
What the fuck is your name?
And can you explain this mess?
It seems you're playing a game
Where you only know how to take out the best
'Cause if assholes could fly
This place would be busier than O'Hare
There's proof in the sky
It's as thin as our skulls yet it's thicker than air
And I now have nothing
But your heartbeat in my head
And a photograph of my traveling friend
And I became nothing when I found you were dead
When I found out I'd never see you again
And all the time they took talking in circles
To get them off the hook would take miracle workers
We're nowhere near prepared, there's no way of knowing
Why don't they just admit they're scared, cause its already showing
And I now have nothing
But your heartbeat in my head
And a photograph of my traveling friend
And I became nothing when I found you were dead
When I found out I'd never see you again
When will this winter end?
The snow's been fallin' for months
The town all dressed in white
And my skin is burning from the wind
Our coats aren't in disguise
And are soaked from the morning light
My burial, I can't succeed
Frozen and paralyzed
All winter...
Ooh...
All winter...
Ooh...
Waiting for some thin' to break.
Left my heart out to bake.
Nothing there in my glass.
Wasn't air meant to last.
Hope in my past.
Hope in my past.
Hope in my past.
{Play verse chords}
All the way down to the lake,
(Found the lake was wet).
How much more could I take,
(Better yet).
Walked back home to my place,
(Tired of getting high).
Guess I don't wanna die.
Hope in my past.
Hope in my past.
Hope in my past.
Hope in my past.
Hope in my past.
Hope in my past.
Waiting for some thin' to break.
Left my heart out to bake.
Slipped my mind that I could use my brain.
I'll stay up all night and crash on the plane.
Ship without a rudder's like a ship without a rudder's like a
Ship without a rudder.
Ship without a rudder's like a ship without a rudder's like a
Ship without a rudder's like a ship without a rudder's like a ship without a
Rudder's like a ship without a rudder's like a ship without a rudder.

I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
They hurt so that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it... four years down the drain
Oh how I wish things would of happened so differently
I try'd to save us so many times but still you couldn't see
U kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again
And now you tryin' to tell me that ur sorry
And ur tryin' to come back home
Ur tellin' me you really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
But baby i
Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
U keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight and say the things
That hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try don't wanna try I 'bout just had enough it's been a rough road
Baby just let it go
Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love
U and I had many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
But all of that just seems so far away from me
Had to wake up face reality
It all just seem to good to be true after all you put me through
And now you tryin' to tell me that ur sorry
And you tryin' to come back home
U tellin' me that you really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
But baby i
Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
U keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight and say the things
That hurt too bad to when we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try don't wanna try I bout just had enough it's been a rough road
Baby just let it go
Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love
(..Fading into beat)
(Don't wanna try don't wanna try)
(Don't wanna try no more)
(Don't wanna try don't wanna try... ooh)
(Don't wanna try don't wanna try)
(Don't wanna try no more)
(Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more ooh)
Acoustic guitar
I'm gonna make you a star
Get your picture all over the world
Acoustic guitar
You can have your own car
Just bring me back my girl
She always loved the sound of your strum
You made her think, maybe, I wasn't so dumb
She tends to faint at the sound of a drum
'Cause she's folk, so play it, maybe she'll come
Acoustic guitar, how lovely you are
With your inlays of mother of pearl
Be a good guitar and you could go far
Just bring me back my girl
She always said that you were the one
That could make her move her cute little bum
You understand where she's coming from
Which I obviously don't, or she wouldn't be gone
Acoustic guitar, if you think I play hard
Well you could've belonged to Steve Earle
Or Charo or GWAR, I could sell you tomorrow
So bring me back my girl
You'd better bring me back my girl
I don't like to wait too long
To wait too long, wait too long
Bring it on and bring it strong
Bring it baby
I feel the pain and it feels good
I knew it would
Your heart burns through
I feel the pain and I cry out
I cry out
I need you
I need you
Babe, boy I'm gonna drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen
Baby I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
Boy I'm going up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah you're to blame
Baby I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
I want to keep burning
I want to keep burning
I want to keep burning
Baby I'm a house on fire
I want to keep burning
I want to keep burning
I want to keep burning
Baby I'm a house on fire
So take me to the heavens now
As we burn down, as we are found
Take me to the heavens now
My heart screams out
I need you
I need you
Babe, boy I'm gonna drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen
Baby I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
Boy I'm going up in flames
And you're to blame

Our unsleepable friend gets the message on an ill-wind
"All your friends and your foes
Would rather die than have to touch you"
To say the least
Oh, truly disappointed
Truly, truly, truly
Drank too much and then said too much
And there's nowhere to go but down
Young boy, I wanna help you
See these lines?
Truly disappointed
Truly, truly, truly
Don't talk to me, no
About people who are "nice"
'Cause I have spent my whole life
In ruins
Because of people who were "nice"
Oh, this world may lack style, I know
Each bud must blossom and grow
Young girl, one day you will be old
But the thing is I love you now
This is the last song I will ever sing
No, I've changed my mind again
Goodnight and thank you
Instrumental
After twelve long slow years gone by
You're still the only one
I cried when I saw you
Don't cry
I can find you when I can
I cried when I found you
?
Almost dead
Half dead
On my heart, I'll bear the shame
No prayer can ease the pain
No one will love you
No one will love you the way I do
No one will love you, love you like I do
And there's no escape
Just countless mistakes
No one will love you
No one will love you the way I do
No one will love you, love you like I do
It will never be the same
Witness trust fade away
No one will love you
No one will love you the way I do
No one will love you, love you like I do
No one will love you
No one will love the way I do
No one will love you, love you like I do
Love you like I do
Sometimes I walk around town looking at faces
Wonderin why their bodies go to silly places.
Walkin' past the carpet mills looking in and takin' stills,
Your ass it draws me in like a Bermuda highway.
Oh, don't carve me out! Don't let your silly dreams,
Fall in between the crack of the bed and the wall.
Two times I fell asleep in a dirty basement
Snoozing in cobwebs and the cement.
Sometimes I wonder why that meek guy got all the fame,
Maybe I'm to blame for his short bitter fucked up life.
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
'Cause you know that I can't trust myself with my 3 a.m. shadow
I'd rather fuel a fantasy than deal with this alone
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down
I wanna hold hands with you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna get close to you
'Cause your hands and lips still know their way around
And I know I like to draw that line when it starts to get too real
But the less time that I spend with you
The less you need to heal
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down
If you don't mind
I'll walk that line
Stuck on the bridge between us
Grey areas
And expectations
But I'm not the one if we're honest, yeah
But I wanna sleep next to you
And I wanna come home to you
I wanna hold hands with you
I wanna be close to you
But I wanna sleep next to you
And that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
So come over now and talk me down
You never hear me talk about one day getting out
Why put a new address on the same old loneliness
Everybody knows where that is
We built that house of his
And when he's not home
Someone else you know always is
If Heaven's really coming back
I hope it has a heart attack
When they see how dangerous it is for guys like that
The night has always known when it's time to get going
When it's really been so long that it starts showing
It's always had that ghost who always almost
Tells me the Secret
How there's really no difference in who he was once
And who he's become
Everything you hated me for... Honey there was so much more
I just didn't get busted
But I'm not looking for an easy way out
This whole life it's been about
Try and try and try
And try and try and try
To be simple again
Winter has come for me, can't carry on.
The chains to my life are strong, but soon they'll be gone.
I'll spread my wings one more time.
Is it a dream?
All the ones I've loved calling out my name.
The sun warms my face.
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.
In my heart I know, I can let go.
In the end I will find some peace inside.
New wings are growing tonight.
Is it a dream?
All the ones I've loved calling out my name.
The sun warms my face.
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.
As I am soaring I'm one with the wind.
I am longing to see you again, it's been so long.
We will be together again.
Is it a dream?
All the ones I've loved calling out my name.
The sun warms my face.
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.
Instrumental
You are true honeymoon child
Conceived on an island in the sun
Heels tugging the white sand
Loved and adored from day one
Raised in a wild space
Between two hearts
With the vines climb trees towards the light
Running naked, dragging a kite
Or dressed on a stream
You bring up the soft side in everyone
We gather like ravens
On a rusty side
Just to watch
Such a little dove
Just to watch
Such a little dove
Fly away
Mr. bones from town said he saw you the other day
He said you changed but he wouldn't say how
Well it can always turn
Yeah, it can always turn
A wind can always turn
She buys a new dress for the party
She always looks good in red
Turns around in front of the mirror
And disappears inside of her head
She wonders if he'll even remember
She asked him in a casual way
Just in case he didn't want to go with her
In that event, she knew just what she would say
She thought of maybe asking a girlfriend
Even though she only has one or two
She's always done much better with boys anyway
So who needs girlfriends?
Pacing nervous 'cross the floor of her bedroom
Gripping tight the phone in her hand
Fighting back the rush of emotions
And dreaming of just having a man
It's a long walk and the music is loud
She sees an old friend as she walks through the crowd
Puts on her best smile
But underneath it, she's a broken girl
But it's a long walk and the music is loud
She sees an old friend as she walks through the crowd
Puts on her best smile
But she will always be a broken girl
She struggles with an awful decision
Stay at home or walk in alone
Her mother does her best to console her
Her father doesn't know what to say
Puts on her makeup, puts on the new dress
Holds her head high, then gets in the car
Tells herself that no one will notice
Assuming she could make it that far
On the way, she imagines reactions
Cupped hands whispering into ears
Secretly hoping that he'll be there watching
And she's also hoping he won't
Walking tentative alone up the driveway
Sees some people smoking off to the side
She stops and waits until they go back in
Crosses her fingers and follows behind
It's a long walk and the music is loud
She sees an old friend as she walks through the crowd
Puts on her best smile
But underneath it, she's a broken girl
It's a long walk and the music is loud
She sees an old friend as she walks through the crowd
Puts on her best smile
But she will always be a broken girl
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
He'll never get you, he will never understand
He'll never get you, you can find a better man
This might be the time to break down
This might be the time to break down
This might be the time to break down
This might be the time to break down
This might be the time to break down
Hush child, don't make a sound
Beyond the ridge to the left, you asked me what I want
Between the trees and cicadas singing round the pond
I've spent an hour with you, should I want anything else?
One grinning wink like the neon on a liquor store
We were 16, maybe less, maybe a little more
I walked home smiling, I finally had a story to tell
And though an autumn time lullaby
Sang our newborn love to sleep
My brother told me he saw you there
In the woods one Christmas Eve, waiting
I met my wife at a party when I drank too much
My son is married and tells me we don't talk enough
Call it predictable, yesterday my dream was of you
Beyond the ridge to the west, the sun had left the sky
Between the trees and the pond, you put your hand in mine
Said, "Time has bridled us both, but I remember you too"
And though an autumn time lullaby
Sang our newborn love to sleep
I dreamt I traveled and found you there
In the woods one Christmas Eve, waiting
Let me go
Let me go
Let me seek the answers that I need to know
Let me find a way
Let me walk away
Through the undertow
Please let me go
Let me fly
Let me fly
Let me rise against that blood red velvet sky
Let me chase it all
Break my wings and fall
Probably survive
So let me fly
Let me fly
Let me run
Let me run
Let me ride the crest of chance into the sun
You were always there
But you may lose me here
Now love me if you dare
And let me run
I'm alive
And I am true to my heart now
I am I
But why must truth always make me die?
Let me break
Let me bleed
Let me tear myself apart I need to breathe
Let me lose my way
Let me walk astray
Maybe to proceed
Just let me bleed
Let me drain
Let me die
Let me break the things I love I need to cry
Let me burn it all
Let me take my fall
Through the cleansing fire
Now let me die
Let me die
Let me out
Let me fade into that pitch-black velvet night
So sad her eyes 
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes 
As it began
On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The white queen walks
And the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair
Heeding unheard 
Pleading one word
So sad her eyes 
She cannot see
How did thee fare what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no words could make
So still I wait
My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's forevermore that I wait
Dear friend goodbye
No tears in my eyes
So sad it ends as it began
I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in Period One
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see your face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
I saw you talking to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen
But I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
I used to work in a record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off the hardwood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in L.A
That seems to be where
Everybody else ends up these days
But I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
And I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
If you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
Thought that maybe we'd fall in love over the phone
Thought that maybe I'd really love bein' alone
Everybody but Heaven knows how I was wrong
Oh Lord, what have I done to myself
What have I done to myself
In this vicious world
Such a vicious world
There isn't anything you can do
In this vicious world
Suckin' on the ice makin' eyes all by myself
Didn't realize you were so top of the shelf
Just you wait and see when you turn, turn 23
Oh Lord, what have I done to myself
What have I done to myself
In this vicious world
Such a vicious world
There isn't anything you can do
In this vicious world
Such a vicious world
There isn't anything you can do
In this vicious world
There isn't anything you can do
In this vicious world
Among the trees and by the river
Lying there, my darling shivers
In her sleep she dreams of winter
Whiter than her breast.
I feel her heart move through her chest
Warm and steady as she rests.
Hear water ebbing with her breath
Lulling me to sleep.
Light from a source unseen reflected
By the moon on rocks collected
Near our bodies unexpected
Pulls us from out dreams.
We turn onto our backs and see
A streak of light above the trees
And lie here on our bed of leaves
Listening to each other breathe.
And here in the sky
Lights flash before our eyes
And I feel your warm hand
Slipping into mine
And we lay and we wonder
When will I come around?
Do I know what you are feeling now?
This morning we drove out of town
Into the hills and looking down
Saw the ocean all around
As far as we could see.
Continued on into the clouds
A burst of rain, brief and loud
To silent mountains, tall and proud
Here is where we lay.
And here in the sky
Lights flash before our eyes
And I feel your warm hand
Slipping into mine
And we lay and we wonder
When will I come around?
Do I know what you are feeling
Here on neutral ground?
Walking down Brick Lane, feeling blue.
Winds blowing lightly and I picture you.
Sweet Sunday morning, with nothing to do.
Love is like a dream, when it's just me and you.
Open my window, sing me a song.
Baby can't you see that this is where I belong
With your hand in my hand, still feel the love
Really wish that we could go back to the way that it was.
They say if it doesn't kill you it'll make you stronger.
Oh, but I can't be without you any longer.
Everytime I let it go, baby it's you.
Nothing compares to you.
Nothing compares to you.
Sweet Sunday morning, all by myself.
Hard love what we've done, when with anyone else.
Watch my mascara dripping down.
Baby how did we end up like this? Where are you now?
They say if it doesn't kill you it'll make you stronger.
Oh, but I can't be without you any longer.
Everytime I let it go, baby it's you.
Nothing compares to you.
Nothing compares to you.
I'm running fast, as fast as I can, to get you back, just to get you back again.
I can not wait, I can not wait, if we can be, we can be us again.
I cry at night, cry at night, I'll cry for all the words, all the words I didn't say.
Sweet Sundays, sweet Sundays.
They say if it doesn't kill you it'll make you stronger.
Oh, but I can't be without you any longer.
Everytime I let it go, baby it's you.
Nothing compares to you.
Nothing compares to you.
Hello helicopter, are you here to stay?
Bodies rest in motion, fighting night and day
Well it's kill or be killed
And one day we'll get the best of them
Hello helicopter, will you be my friend?
Will you take me away?
Hello helicopter, have you heard the news?
No one gives a shit about the things they do
We all waste and consume, destroy and ruin everything we touch
It's easy not to think when you're not told that much
I'm not saying anything you haven't heard before
I'm just trying to understand the way we are
Hello helicopter, are you lost out there?
Swimming through the garbage dump that fills the air
In several more years no one will care
They'll be rich and dead
So let somebody else devise a cure for it 
I'm not saying anything you haven't heard before
I'm just trying to understand the way we are
Nobody seems to care
Nobody ever learns
Hello helicopter, are you here to stay?
Bodies rest in motion, fighting night and day
Well it's kill or be killed 
And one day we'll get the best of them
Hello helicopter, are you listening?
Nobody seems to care
Nobody ever learns
Are we ever going to get it right?
Are we ever going to start making sense
And stop pretending that we care?
Are we ever going to get it right?
Are we ever going to start making sense
And stop pretending that we care?
Are we ever going to get it right?
Are we ever going to start making sense
And stop pretending...
Hello helicopter, are you here to stay?
Bodies rest in motion, fighting night and day
Well it's kill or be killed 
And one day we'll get the best of them
Hello helicopter, are you listening?
Isn't it a pity, isn't it a shame?
How we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain
How we take each other's love
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?
Some things take so long
But how do I explain?
When not too many people
Can see we're all the same?
And because of all their tears
Their eyes can't hope to see
The beauty that surrounds them
Now, isn't it a pity?
Isn't it a pity, oh, isn't it a shame?
How we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain
How we take each other's love
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Now, isn't it a pity?
She was calling around to find half an hour.
She walked right into my mirror.
Says she's here to waste time I said "That's fine."
Listen, to thyself be true, to thyself be true
Every thread, every hair re-arranged to resemble
You could have her, detective daughter copy,
Please don't be me.
There are so many skirts under the table,
None of these long legs are mine.
She calls around finds me crying,
Wish I were capable of lying sometimes.
Hide out
Love is hell, hell is love.
Hell is asking to be loved.
Hide out and then run when no one's looking.
She's still calling around to find half an hour.
She'll always have a place in my mirror,
But she's got no more time, now she wants mine.
But I'm all out too.
To thyself be true
To thyself be true
To thyself be true
To thyself be true
Sure, it's no big deal
Will you comfort me in my time of need
Can you take away the pain of hurtful deeds
'Cause when we need it most there's no rain at all
And the dust just settles right there on the feed
Will you say to me a little rain's gonna come
When the sky can't offer none to me
'Cause I will come for you
When my days are through
And I'll let your smile just off and carry me
'Cause when the calm comes down
I take the truck on into town
And buy whatever we can't seem to grow
I work these hands to bleed 'cause I got mouths to feed
And 15 dollars hid above the stove
Will you say to me a little rain's gonna come
When the sky can't offer none to me
'Cause I will come for you
When my days are through
And I'll let your smile just off and carry me
Cause it ain't like it was on back in those days
When everyone would offer up a hand
These old bones are worn
I've grown tired some
And I know my time is surely gonna come
Will you comfort me in my time of need
Can you take away the pain of hurtful deeds
'Cause I will comfort you when my days are through
And Ill let your smile just off and carry me
Lord we married young and stayed where we came from
And gave those children everything we had
Will you stay with me in my time of need
Though it seems we had such little time for us
Will you say to me a little rain's gonna come
When the sky can't offer none to me
'Cause I will come for you
When my days are through
And I'll let your smile just off and carry me
Sing a sad song in a lonely place
Try to put a word in for me
It's been so long since I found a space
You'd better put in two or three
We as people are just walking round
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground
What we don't see, well it can't be real
What we don't touch we cannot feel
Where we're living in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
And we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong, so we don't ask why
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day
If you're needing something I can give
I know I'd help you if I can
If you're honest and you say that you did
You know that I would give you my hand
Or a sad song in a lonely place
I'll try to put a word in for you
Need a shoulder? Well if that's the case
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do
Where we're living in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
When we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong, so we don't ask why
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
(Throwing it all away)
(Throwing it all away)
(Throwing it all away)
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
You're throwing it all away at the end of the day
That night he found the key
To decode you, Tokyo
Between warm sake
And street light caught in falling snow
Holding each word he spoke,
Her hands filled up full
The quiet voice she gave him
Translates by tone
They laughed throughout their talking
With every round
Words come into meaning
And when I left your place
Gave me your plastic bird
You won it at the festival
Well I broke both legs off
And then I broke its nose
And left it on First Avenue
And when I left your place
Gave me your plastic bird
You won it at the festival
Well I broke both legs off
And then I smashed its nose
And left it on First Avenue
My old heart, it's been thirteen hours
Too much of you my friend, my dear, and now I cower
Looking at you, looking at you
Oh shit, I'll go cook myself a brew
Love it, oh sometimes at least I fall
Put it up too much to call home sometimes
Well, I dance the two step look at you swing
Not sure what I mean, don't know what I sing
I just dance on the harpsichord string
Move it down when you're coming up
Lose it down when your tip toe dancing
Enhancing all the pressure prancing
All around this place every night and
Day when we were in the rat race
Shouting back to the oldest people
Chat at the bartender in the cold top steeples
Like no screaming
My dear they will dry off your cheeks
And never been down the factor too much of
That can bring you right down to tragedy more oh me
Losing myself in this race
You see me, see me, see me, see me, seeing me
See me, see me
What's in my liberty?
In a hectic test a no one protest
In you when imp so damn scared
Live for the life and the love I need
And the lead in the life 'cause I never play fair
My old heart, it's been thirteen hours
Too much of you my friend, my dear, and now I cower
Looking at you, looking at you
Oh shit, I'll go cook myself a brew
I got my own way home, I got my own keys
So why you looking at me like you're a lady
I got my own kindsa groovy
Smoking too much and drinking
You bring yourself down in pain
Bdbbyebdbdyebdbyebdye
For the love of the living and the live cut free
She's all on the floor while I drink whiskey
And look to the corner think about me
All about me, never yourself
'Cause your walk with a pelvis, white boy Elvis
Dance around this floor much quicker than you
Look at this, look at the boys dancing
Think there impressing, but they ain't do shit
I'm on groove from the grooving losing as I use ya
As I go moving crying the tears
Not for myself and not for you honey have no fear
And now I break to the floor when the old piano comes crashing
Sometimes I'm not sure what I'm gonna do but I ain't here for more
I take my last match with desperate passions and a few up facts
My old heart, it's been thirteen hours
Too much of you my friend, my dear, and now I cower
Looking at you, looking at you
Oh shit, I'll go cook myself a brew
My old heart, it's been thirteen hours
Too much of you my friend, my dear, and now I cower
Looking at you, looking at you
Oh shit, I'll go cook myself a brew
My old heart, it's been thirteen hours
Too much of you my friend, my dear, and now I cower
Looking at you, looking at you
Oh shit, I'll go cook myself a brew
Love it, oh sometimes at least I fall
Put it up too much to call home
Sometimes
This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say
Don't look back, keep your head held high
Don't ask them why, because life is short
And before you know, you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well, that's too much to ask
This used to be my playground (used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say
No regrets
But I wish that you were here with me
Well then, there's hope yet
I can see your face in our secret place
You're not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)
This used to be my playground (used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy
This used to be our playground (used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me
This used to be our playground (used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me
Oh, je voudrais tant que tu te souviennes
Cette chanson était la tienne
C'était ta préférée, je crois
Qu'elle est de Prévert et Kosma
Et chaque fois, les feuilles mortes
Te rappellent à mon souvenir
Jour après jour, les amours mortes
N'en finissent pas de mourir
Avec d'autres bien sûr je m'abandonne
Mais leur chanson est monotone
Et peu à peu je m'indiffère
? cela il n'est rien a faire
Car chaque fois, les feuilles mortes
Te rappellent à mon souvenir
Jour après jour, les amours mortes
N'en finissent pas de mourir
Peut-on jamais savoir par où commence
Et quand finit l'indifférence
Passe l'automne, vienne l'hiver
Et que la chanson de Prévert
Cette chanson, Les Feuilles mortes,
S'efface de mon souvenir
Et ce jour-là, mes amours mortes
En auront fini de mourir
You could say I knew it all along,
That you were all I wanted to know.
The pain has made you grow strong.
The scars inside have made you beautiful.
Stop breathing for me you said.
It's your right to shun dependence.
When you shun.
When you're scared to accept
Someone to share your regrets.
When you're aching,
You go it alone.
When you want to,
You take what you need to make you whole.
I know it's not easy.
I know I can't feel what you feel
Trust just don't come easy
Cause to trust is to depend.
You could say I knew it all along,
That you were all I wanted to know.
The pain has made you grow strong.
The scars inside have made you beautiful.
Stop breathing for me you said.
It's your right to shun dependence.
And when you shun.
And you're scared to accept
Someone to share your regrets.
I know it's not easy.
I know I can't feel what you feel
And trust just don't come easy
Cause to trust is to depend
And who wants to give up that part of them?
You know you can have it if you want to.
I'll find you,
Unrelated, cultivated.
When you wake up incubated in me,
You're free to leave if you
Knew it all along
I hear you talk about your family life
I wish I knew just what that means
I guess my mother never loved my dad
And now I wear it on my sleeve
My sister called me just the other day
It felt so good to hear her voice
My problem is I don't have much to say
I guess she doesn't have a choice
And I'm sorry
Look at me
I'm so pathetic
I can't believe
I'm just an addict
I never needed anyone to help me
I'm begging you
To please come save me from myself
Save Me from my...
My mother's always tried to change herself
She never learned to let things be
She doesn't know how bad she messed me up
Cause now she seems so fake to me
But I love her
Look at me
I'm so pathetic
I can't believe
I'm just an addict
I never needed anyone to help me
I'm begging you
To please come save me from myself
Save Me from myself
If you push me but I won't fall
I've been program to take it all
And shove it way down inside
Like my father
Like my father
I'm so pathetic
I can't believe
I'm just an addict
I try to be (I never needed anyone to help me)
I'm failing at it (I'm begging you)
Life to Me (To please come save me from myself)
Is just a habit (Save Me from myself)
I hear you talk about your family life
I wish I knew just what that means
You've been lying in bed for a week now
Wondering how long it'll take
You haven't spoken or looked at her in all that time
It's the easiest line you could break
She's been going about her business as usual
Always with that melancholy smile
But you were too busy looking into your affairs
To see those tiny tears in her eyes
Tiny tears make up an ocean
Tiny tears make up a sea
Let them pour out, pour out all over
Don't let them pour all over me
How can you hurt someone so much your supposed to care for
Someone you said you'd always be there for
But when that water breaks you know you're gonna cry, cry
When those tears start rolling you'll be back
Tiny tears...
You've been thinking about the time, you've been dreading it
But now it seems that moment has arrived
She's at the edge of the bed, she gets in
But it's hard to turn the opposite way tonight
Tiny tears...
You told me you loved me
I know where and when
Come sunrise, surprise surprise
The joke's on me again
I know you don't love me
You know I don't care
Keep it hidden better
Did I say the world was fair?
I thought I was just the guy
For you and it would never end
I thought we were supposed to be
Like glue
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend
Love or not I've always got
Ten guys on whom I can depend
And if you're not mine
One less is nine; get wise
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend
I just hope you're happy
Stringing me along
While you're stringing
I'm here singing
This, my saddest song
I wish I could see you
I wish I could sleep
Should I freak out? Should I seek out
Someone I could keep?
I thought I was just the guy
For you and it would never end
I thought we were supposed to be
Like glue
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend
Love or not I've always got
Ten guys on whom I can depend
And if you're not mine
One less is nine; get wise
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend
I wanted you tonight
I walked around alot
Wishing you were here
To keep me from sleeping
With anyone who might
Want me, or even not
Some guys have a beer
And they'll do anything
Anything
Anything...
I thought I was just the guy
For you and it would never end (Thought you were my boyfriend...)
I thought we were supposed to be
Like glue
I thought you were my boyfriend (Thought you were my boyfriend...)
I thought you were my boyfriend
Love or not I've always got
Ten guys on whom I can depend (Thought you were my boyfriend...)
And if you're not mine
One less is nine; get wise
I thought you were my boyfriend (Thought you were my boyfriend...)
I thought you were my boyfriend...
I thought I was just the guy
For you and it would never end (Thought you were my boyfriend...)
I thought we were supposed to be
Like glue
Take everything away
This gnarled, weird face
This ripe swollen shape
I want blank
I want frozen lake
I want deep space
Tuck the whole thing
In the body of a violin
String it up on a fence
Cover it with semen
I am done
I am done with it
Don't
Sing me that song
It
Will only prolong
This
Instrumental
Just three miles from the rest stop
And she slams on the brakes
She said I tried to be but I'm not
So could you please collect your things
I don't want to be cold
I don't want to be cruel
But I gotta find more than what's happening with you
And if you would open up the door
She said while you were sleeping
I was listening to the radio and wondering what you're dreaming
When it came to mind that I didn't care
And I thought hell if it's over
Well I had better end it quick or I could lose my nerve
Are you listening? Can you hear me?
Have you forgotten?
Just three miles from the rest stop
And my mouth's to dry to rage
The light was shining from the radio
I could barely see her face
But she knew all the words that I never had said
She knew the crumpled up promise of this broken down man
As I opened up the door, she said
While you were sleeping
I was listening to the radio and wondering what you're dreaming
When it came to mind that I didn't care
And I thought hell if it's over
Then I had better end it quick or I could lose my nerve
Are you listening? Can you hear me?
While you were sleeping
I was listening to the radio and wondering what you're dreaming
When it came to mind that I didn't care
So I thought hell if it's over
Well I had better end it quick or I could lose all my nerve
Are you listening? Can you hear me?
While you were sleeping
I was listening to the radio and wondering what you're dreaming
When it came to mind that I didn't care
I thought hell if it's over
Well I had better end it quick or I could lose all my nerve
Are you listening? Can you hear me?
﻿When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here, oh oh
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start
I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science
Science and progress
Could not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh when I rush to the start
Running in circles
Chasing tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start
When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired-unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent
Silent
This is my final fit, my final bellyache
With...
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Such a pretty house and
Such a pretty garden
No alarms and no surprises (let me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises (let me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises, please (let me out of here)
Love of mine
Someday you will die
But I'll be close behind
I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light
Or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for the hint of the spark
If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
And Catholic school
As vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised
By a lady in black
And I held my tongue
As she told me "Son
Fear is the heart of love"
So I never went back
If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
You and me
Have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms
If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
And I'll follow you into the dark
Step one: you say, "We need to talk"
He walks, you say, "Sit down, it's just a talk"
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life
Oh no, I see
A spider web, it's tangled up with me
And I lost my head
The thought of all the stupid things I'd said
Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
The thought of all the stupid things I'd done
I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm
Oh no, I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
Here am I in my little bubble
Singing I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away but I remember everything
What have I become, my sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
I will let you down, I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear
You are someone else, I am still right here
What have I become, my sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
I will let you down,  I will make you hurt
If I could start again, a million miles away
I would keep myself, I would find a way
Her green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time
Come on skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in this moment this order's tall
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different "kind"
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines
Come on skinny love, what happened here
Suckled on the hope in light brassiere
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted?
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?
Hello there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight
Don't waste your time on me
You're already the voice inside my head
(I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me
You're already the voice inside my head
(I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me
You're already the voice inside my head
(I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head
(I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me
You're already the voice inside my head 
(I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me
You're already the voice inside my head
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
Such a lonely day, and it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life
Such a lonely day should be banned
It's a day that I can't stand
The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life
Such a lonely day shouldn't exist
It's a day that I'll never miss
Such a lonely day, and it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life
And if you go, I want to go with you
And if you die, I want to die with you
Take your hand and walk away
The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life
Such a lonely day, and it's mine
It's a day that I'm glad I survived
Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass, seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are
As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends
Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again, like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends
Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are
As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends
Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass, twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you 
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah...
You and me
We used to be together
Every day together always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe
This could be the end
It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real
Well, I don't want to know
Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Old memories
They can be inviting
But some are altogether mighty
Frightening
As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands
I sit and cry
Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts (no, no, no)
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
It's all ending
I gotta stop pretending who we are
You and me
I can see us dying
Are we?
Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts (no, no)
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts!
I know what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't speak,
Don't speak,
Don't speak, oh
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
I know you're good,
I know you're good,
I know you're real good, oh
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
Don't, don't, uh-huh
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush
Don't tell me tell me 'cause it hurts
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush
Don't tell me tell me 'cause it hurts
Hush, hush, darlin'
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go, I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go, I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Me
Me
Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape
We escape
Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all Hell
Breaks loose
Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone
Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill
You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom
Choke you
Now we are one
In everlasting peace
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
Well, I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well, it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well, your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well, maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?
My life is brilliant
My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel
With a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you
Oh, can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never found our way
Regardless of what they say
How can it feel, this wrong
From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong
Storm... in the morning light
I feel
No more can I say
Frozen to myself
I got nobody on my side
And surely that ain't right
And surely that ain't right
Oh, can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never found our way
Regardless of what they say
How can it feel, this wrong
From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong
How can it feel, this wrong
From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong
Oh, can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never found our way
Regardless of what they say
How can it feel, this wrong
From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong
I'm coming up only to hold you under
And coming up only to show you're wrong
And to know you is hard; we wonder...
To know you all wrong; we warn
Really too late to call
So we wait for morning
To wake you is all we got
To know me as hardly golden
Is to know me all wrong, they warn
At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral
At every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
At every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
I'm coming up only to show you're down for
And coming up only to show you're wrong
To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn
For they don't have trees to hang upon
At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral
At every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
Every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven
Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please
Beyond the door, there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven
Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
I am my mother's only one
It's enough
I wear my garment so it shows
Now you know
Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon
I am my mother on the wall
With us all
I move in water, shore to shore
Nothing's more
Only love is all maroon
Lapping lakes like leery loons
Leaving rope burns, reddish ruse
Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon
Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again
And fade out
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again
And fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again
And fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love
Why? Who, me? Why?
Feet, don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks
Every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates
They'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on the Friday night
Can you make it feel like home
If I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you honey
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Try'na take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
(We were born, we were born) We were born to die
(We were born, we were born) We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So, don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
(We were born, we were born) We were born to die
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
(We were born, we were born to die)
I'll sing it one last time for you
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done
And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here
Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say
To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbyes
I nearly do
Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say
Slower, slower
We don't have time for that
All I want is to find an easier way
To get out of our little heads
Have heart, my dear
We're bound to be afraid
Even if it's just for a few days
Making up for all this mess
Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I traced the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom, this is not her fault
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone
I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I'd survived
I can't wait till I get home
To pass the time in my room alone
When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape, my videotape
Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
And I have it all here
In red, blue, green
Red, blue, green
You are my center
When I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
This is my way of saying goodbye
'Cause I can't do it face to face
I'm talking to you before
No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been
The most perfect day I've ever seen
Disarm you with a smile
And cut you like you want me to
Cut that little child
Inside of me and such a part of you
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn
I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my choice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you, my love
I send this smile over to you
Disarm you with a smile
And leave you like they left me here
To wither in denial
The bitterness of one who's left alone
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn
I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
What I choose is my voice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you, my love
I send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
That there, that's not me
I go where I please
I walk through walls, I float down the Liffey
I'm not here, this isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here
In a little while I'll be gone
The moment's already passed, yeah, it's gone
And I'm not here, this isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here
Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes
I'm not here, this isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here
A warning sign, I missed the good part then I realized
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses
Come on in, I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign
When the truth is I miss you
Yeah, the truth is that I miss you so
A warning sign, you came back to haunt me and I realized
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover
Come on in, I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign
When the truth is I miss you
Yeah, the truth is that I miss you so
And I'm tired, I should not have let you go
So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
Jumped in the river, what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and future
And we all went to heaven in a little rowboat
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
Jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and future
And we all went to heaven in a little rowboat
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
Where are we?
What the hell is going on?
The dust has only just begun to fall
Crop circles in the carpet
Sinking feeling
Spin me 'round again
And rub my eyes
This can't be happening
When busy streets amess with 
People would stop to hold 
Their heads heavy
Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
All those years
They were here first
Oily marks appear on walls
Where pleasure moments hung before
The takeover 
The sweeping insensitivity 
Of this
Still life
Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines (oh, you won't catch me around here)
Blood and tears
They were here first
Mmm whatcha say? 
Mmm that you only meant well? Well, of course you did
Mmm whatcha say?
Mmm that it's all for the best? Of course it is
Mmm whatcha say?
Mmm that it's just what we need? You decided this
whatcha say?
Mmm what did you say?
Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Mid-sweet talk newspaper word cut-outs (paper word cut outs)
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you (I don't believe you)
You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit
(Hide and Seek) Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth 
Mid-sweet talk newspaper word cut-outs
(Hide and Seek) Speak no feeling no I don't believe you
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit (You don't care a bit)
(Hide and Seek) No, no, you don't care a bit 
Uh, uh, you don't care a bit
(Hide and Seek) Mm, mm, you don't care a bit 
You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit
Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You'll say, "Oh, sing one you know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah that's what I'll do
I say, "Oh"
I say, "Oh"
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold onto
That's what I'll do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh, yeah I will, yeah I will
Yes I will
I said, "Oh"
I cry, "Oh"
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
Sing it out
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable, not drinking too much
Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease, eating well
No more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient better driver
A safer car, baby smiling in backseat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
No paranoia, careful to all animals
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends
Enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank hole in wall
Favours for favours, fond but not in love
Charity standing orders, on Sundays ring road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate, nothing so childish
At a better pace, slower and more calculated
No chance of escape, now self-employed
Concerned but powerless
An empowered and informed member of society
Pragmatism not idealism
Will not cry in public, less chance of illness
Tyres that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat, a good memory
Still cries at a good film, still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat tied to a stick that's driven into frozen winter shit
The ability to laugh at weakness
Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig in a cage on antibiotics
Summer don't know me no more
He got mad, tiresome
Summer don't know me
He just left me low in myself
'Cause I too know love from you that
Just died, yeah
I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Don't stop the buck when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see
Money won't get there
Ten years past and now you'll flee
If you do that
I'll be strong
To find you
I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
When your day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on
Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes
Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (Hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (Hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on
'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Don't throw your hand, oh no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you are not alone
If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much of this life to hang on
Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes
So hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on (no, no, no, no, no)
Hold on, hold on (ahh)
Hold on, hold on (no, no, no, no, no)
Everybody hurts (no, no, no, no, no)
(Oh no, no, no)
You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
I have to go, I have to go
Your hair was long when we first met
Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of wonderbread
And went right back to bed
And the history books forgot about us
And the Bible didn't mention us
And the Bible didn't mention us
Not even once
You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads
But they're just old light, they're just old light
Your hair was long when we first met
Samson came to my bed
Told me that my hair was red
He told me I was beautiful
And came into my bed
Oh, I cut his hair myself one night
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
And he told me that I'd done alright
And kissed me till the morning light, the morning light
And he kissed me till the morning light
Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of wonderbread
And went right back to bed
Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down
Yeah, we couldn't destroy a single one
And history books forgot about us
And the Bible didn't mention us
Not even once
You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first
Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
Still a little hard to say what's going on
There's still a little bit of your ghost, your witness
Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed
You step a little closer each day
That I can't say what's going on
Stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to lie
Life, it taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannonball
There's still a little bit of your song in my ear
There's still a little bit of your words I long to hear
You step a little closer to me
So close that I can't see what's going on
Stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to lie
Life taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannon
Stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to cry
So come on courage, teach me to be shy
'Cause it's not hard to fall
And I don't want to scare her
It's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna lose
It's not hard to grow
When you know that you just don't know
Story of my life
Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
Our love,
His trust.
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this, anymore
Ooh.
Anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
A murderer
No, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just a perfect day
Drink sangria in the park
And then later, when it gets dark
We go home
Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
Then later a movie, too
And then home
Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on
Just a perfect day
Problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own
It's such fun
Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone good
Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
Why does my heart feel so bad?

Spoken
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.
Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright
It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom
Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright
And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies' neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (ha ha)
What if there was no light
Nothing wrong, nothing right
What if there was no time?
And no reason or rhyme?
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?
What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?
Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try?
Ooh, that's right
Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
But that's the risk that you take
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life?
That you don't want me there by your side?
Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
How can you know it when you don't even try?
Ooh, that's right
Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
You know that darkness always turns into light
Ooh, that's right
He said, I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
He said, I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls
Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
And do back the things it did to you in return
He said, I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh and I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They said start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on
Said, I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside me baby, watch the orange glow
Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry
But you just sit down there and you wonder why
So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Oh to the head
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on
So meet me by the bridge
Oh meet me by the lane
When am I gonna see
That pretty face again?
Oh meet me on the road
Meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
A rush of blood to the head
Ooh
Ooh
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far
Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you
Because of you
Come on, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And if I, oh if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole
Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear, I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole
But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern
Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath
And time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
Oh, it's no cause for concern
Stuck on the end
Of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge
Tied to a noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge
Tied to a noose
And you came along
And you cut me loose
You came along
And you cut me loose
You came along
And you cut me loose
Throw it all away
Let's lose ourselves
'Cause there's no one left for us to blame
It's a shame we're all dying
And do you think you deserve your freedom?
How could you send us so far away from home
When you know damn well that this is wrong
I would still lay down my life for you
And do you think you deserve your freedom?
No, I don't think you do
There's no justice in the world
There's no justice in the world
And there never was
Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end, before we'd begun
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind, but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you
I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
I am a dreamer and when I wake
You can't break my spirit, it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bear my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow
White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die
All around me are familiar faces
Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow
And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very mad world
Mad world
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And I feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me, what's my lesson?
Look right through me, look right through me
And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very mad world
Mad world
Enlarging your world
Mad world
I wanna live life, never be cruel
I wanna live life, be good to you
I wanna fly, never come down
And live my life, and have friends around
We never change, do we? No, no... We never learn, do we?
So I wanna live in a wooden house
I wanna live life, always be true
I wanna live life, and be good to you
I wanna fly, and never come down
And I live my life, and have friends around
We never change, do we? No, no... We never learned to leave
So I wanna live in a wooden house
Making more friends would be easy
Oh and I don't have a show to say, yes, and I sin every single day
We never change, do we? We never learned to leave
So, I wanna live in a wooden house
Making more friends would be easy
I wanna live where the sun comes out
Don't kid yourself 
And don't fool yourself 
This love's too good to last 
And I'm too old to dream 
Don't grow up too fast 
And don't embrace the past 
This life's too good to last 
And I'm too young to care 
Don't kid yourself 
And don't fool yourself 
This life could be the last 
And we're too young to see
And when I see you, I really see you upside down
But my brain knows better, it picks you up and turns you around
Turns you around
Turns you around
If you feel discouraged when there's a lack of color here
Please don't worry lover, it's really bursting at the seams
From absorbing everything
The spectrum's A to Z
(Ahh, ahh)
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This is fact not fiction for the first time in years
And all the girls in every girlie magazine can't make me feel any less alone
I'm reaching for the phone
To call at 7:03
And on your machine I slur a plea for you to come home
But I know it's too late 
And I should have given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay 
Given you a reason to stay
This is fact not fiction for the first time in years
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not'a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her? I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry.
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too; that shit was phat!
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, "No"
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you twenty-four/seven
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no-one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together, too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans:
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass!
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air Tonight"?
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning?
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim; shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now - Oh, shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dogg; c'mon, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other!
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think of it, his name was... it was you!
Damn...
I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, "Where you been?"
He said, "Ask anything"
Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
The early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
Why'd you have to wait
To find me, to find me?
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing all the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
Is there anything I can do for you, dear?
Is there anyone I could call?
No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering
'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
'Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
'Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah
It's looking like a limb torn off
Or all together just taken apart
Or wheeling through an endless fog
We are the ever-living ghost of what once was
But no one
Is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do
And anything to make you smile
It is a better side of you to admire
But they should never take so long
Just to be over this, back to another one
And no one
Is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do
And someone, they could have warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams
And now it's tumbling down
Yeah, anything to make you smile
You are the ever-living ghost of what once was
They never wanna hear you say
That you'd be better off, or you like it that way
And no one
Is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do
But someone, they should have warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams
And now it's tumbling down
Leave me out with the waste, this is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place to be thinking of you
It's the wrong time for somebody new
It's a small crime and I've got no excuse
And is that alright with you?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
That alright with you?
If you don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it?
That alright with you?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
That alright with you? With you?
Leave me out with the waste, this is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place to be cheating on you
It's the wrong time, she's pulling me through
It's a small crime and I've got no excuse
And is that alright? (Yeah)
Give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright? (Yeah)
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it?
Is that alright with you?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright?
Is that alright with you?
That alright? (Yeah)
Give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright? (Yeah)
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it?
Is that alright? (Yeah)
Give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright?
Is that alright with you?
Is that alright? (Yeah)
Is that alright? (Yeah)
Is that alright? (Yeah)
Is that alright?
Is that alright?
Is that alright with you?
No...
You could be happy, I won't know
But you weren't happy the day I watched you go
And all the things that I wish I had not said
Are played in loops 'til it's madness in my head
Is it too late to remind you how we were
And not our last days of silence, screaming, blur
Most of what I remember makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walking out the door
You could be happy, I hope you are
You made me happier than I've been by far
Somehow everything I own smells of you
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true
Do the things that you always wanted to
Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do
More than anything I want to see you grow
Take a glorious bite out of the whole world
Hold up
Hold on
Don't be scared
You'll never change what's been and gone
May your smile (May your smile)
Shine on (Shine on)
Don't be scared (Don't be scared)
Your destiny may keep you warm
'Cause all of the stars are fading away
Just try not to worry, you'll see them someday
Take what you need and be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Get up (Get up)
Come on (Come on)
Why're you scared? (I'm not scared)
You'll never change what's been and gone
'Cause all of the stars are fading away
Just try not to worry, you'll see them someday
Take what you need and be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
'Cause all of the stars are fading away
Just try not to worry, you'll see them someday
Just take what you need and be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
We're all of us stars, we're fading away
Just try not to worry, you'll see us someday
Just take what you need and be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
I'll wait here
You're crazy
Those vicious streets are filled with strays
You should've never gone to Hollywood
They find you
Two-time you
Say you're the best they've ever seen
You should've never trusted Hollywood
I wrote you
And told you
You were the biggest fish out here
You should've never gone to Hollywood
They take you
And make you
They look at you in disgusting ways
You should've never trusted Hollywood
I was standing on the wall
Feeling ten feet tall
All you maggots
Smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard
This is my front page
This is my new age
All you bitches put your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
All you maggots
Smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard
All you bitches put your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
Phony people come to pray
Look at all of them beg to stay
Phony people come to pray
(The lines in the letter said
"We have gone to Hackensack") 
Look at all of them beg to stay
Phony people come to pray
All you maggots
Smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard
All you maggots
Smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard
All you maggots
Smoking fags out there on Hollywood Boulevard
You should've never trusted Hollywood
You should've never gone to Hollywood
All you bitches put your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
You should've never trusted Hollywood
Doo, doo, doo doo
I believe in you and me
I'm coming to find you
If it takes me all night
Wrong until you make it right
And I won't forget you
At least I'll try
And run
And run
Tonight
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
(Alright, alright)
(Alright)
(Alright)
(Alright)
La la la la, oh ho
I wasn't shopping for a doll
To say the least, I'd thought I'd seen them all
Then you took me by surprise
I'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
I never knew, I never knew
So take your suitcase, 'cause I don't mind
And, babydoll, I meant it
Every time
You don't need to compromise
I'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
I never knew, I never knew
But it's alright
(Alright)
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Alright
And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time
And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes
And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time
And so it is
The colder water
The blower's daughter
The pupil in denial
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes
(Lisa Hannigan)
Did I say that I loathe you?
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind?
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind
My mind... my mind
'Til I find somebody new
Once I wanted to be the greatest
No wind or waterfall could stall me
And then came the rush of the flood
Stars at night turned deep to dust
Melt me down
Into big black armour
Leave no trace of grace
Just in your honour
Lower me down
To culprit south
Make 'em wash
A space in town
For the lead
And the dregs of my bed
I've been sleeping
Lower me down
Pin me in
Secure the grounds
For the later parade
Once I wanted to be the greatest
Two fists of solid rock
With brains that could explain
Any feeling
Lower me down
Pin me in
Secure the grounds
For the lead
And the dregs of my bed
I've been sleeping
For the later parade
Once I wanted to be the greatest
No wind or waterfall could stall me
And then came the rush of the flood
The stars at night turned deep to dust
I know I can't take one more step towards you
'Cause all that's waiting is regret
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most
I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time
And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?
I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms
I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time
And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?
It took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back, you don't get to get me back
And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, don't come back at all
And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
Don't come back to me, don't come back at all
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
And it came to me then
That every plan
Is a tiny prayer to Father Time
As I stared at my shoes in the ICU
That reeked of piss and 4-Oh-9
And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself
That I'd already taken too much today
As each descending peak on the LCD
Took you a little farther away from me
Away from me
Amongst the vending machines and year-old magazines
In a place where we only say goodbye
It stung like a violent wind
That our memories depend
On a faulty camera in our minds
And I knew that you were a truth
I would rather lose
Than to have never lain beside at all
And I looked around
At all the eyes on the ground
As the TV entertained itself
'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just nervous pacers bracing for bad news
Then the nurse comes round
And everyone lifts their head
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said:
"Love is watching someone die."
So who's gonna watch you die?
So who's gonna watch you die?
So who's gonna watch you die?
The Atlantic was born today
And I'll tell you how
The clouds above opened up
And let it out
I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
When the water filled every hole
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean
Making islands where no islands should go
Oh no
Most people were overjoyed
They took to their boats
I thought it less like a lake
And more like a moat
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door
Have been silenced forevermore
And the distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
It seems farther than ever before
Oh no
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
So come on, come on
So come on, come on
So come on, come on
So come on, come on
When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love
If it does not exist, but darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
Well, maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, ohh
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life
Someday my pain
Someday my pain will mark you
Harness your blame
Harness your blame and walk through
With the wild wolves around you
In the morning, I'll call you
Send it farther on
Solace my game
Solace my game, it stars you
Swing wide your crane
Swing wide your crane and run me through
And the story's all over you
In the morning I'll call you
Can't you find a clue
When your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
Don't bother me
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
Ah, ah
Someday my pain
Someday my pain
Someday my pain
Someday my pain
You are one of God's mistakes
You crying, tragic waste of skin
I'm well aware of how it aches
And you still won't let me in
Now I'm breaking down your door
To try and save your swollen face
Though I don't like you anymore
You lying, trying waste of space
Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those
Blessed with lucky sevens
And the voice that made me cry
My, oh my
You were mother nature's son
Someone to whom I could relate
Your needle and your damage done
Remains a sordid twist of fate
Now I'm trying to wake you up
To pull you from the liquid sky
'Cause if I don't we'll both end up
With just your song to say goodbye
My, oh my
A song to say goodbye
A song to say goodbye
A song to say
Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those
Blessed with lucky sevens
And the voice that made me cry
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
Take a breath, take it deep
Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
And I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger...)
Say a prayer to yourself
He says close your eyes, sometimes it helps
And then I get, a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
I, I'm terrified but I'm not leaving (No No)
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger...)
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become? My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become? My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way
You may tire of me as our December sun is setting
'Cause I'm not who I used to be 
No longer easy on the eyes
But these wrinkles masterfully disguise 
The youthful boy below
Who turned your way and saw 
Something he was not looking for
Both a beginning and an end 
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize 
When he catches his reflection on accident 
On the back of a motor bike 
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight 
Leaving everything behind 
But even at our swiftest speed
We couldn't break from the concrete 
In the city where we still reside 
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn
For the sea like navy men 
'Cause now we say goodnight
From our own separate sides
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed
You may tire of me as our December sun is setting
'Cause I'm not who I used to be
Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue, you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Under haunted skies I see you
Ooh, where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue, you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
When the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
Standing on my own two feet
I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Turning tables, yeah
Turning, oh...
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby, where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
He said, "Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do."
But he's a fool
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
All the flowers that you planted mama, in the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Come into my life
Regress into a dream
We will hide
And build a new reality
Draw another picture
Of the life you could have had
Follow your instincts
And choose the other path
You should never be afraid
You're protected from trouble and pain
Why, why is this a crisis
In your eyes again?
Come to be
How did it come to be
Tied to a railroad
No love to set us free
Watch our souls fade away
And our bodies crumbling
Don't be afraid
I will take the blow for you
And I've had recurring nightmares
That I was loved for who I am
And missed the opportunity
To be a better man
It doesn't hurt me
You want to feel how it feels?
You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
You want to hear about the deal I'm making?
You
(If I only could, be running up that hill)
You and me
(If I only could, be running up that hill)
And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, ooh
You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder
And there's a thunder in our hearts, baby
There's so much hate for the ones we love
Tell me we both matter, don't we?
You
(If I only could, be running up that hill)
You and me
(If I only could, be running up that hill)
You and me, won't be unhappy
(If I only could, be running up that hill)
And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, ooh
C'mon, baby
C'mon, c'mon, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon, angel
C'mon, c'mon, darling
Let's exchange the experience, ooh
And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems
And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
I find the map and draw a straight line
Over rivers, farms, and state lines
The distance from me to where you'd be
It's only finger-lengths that I see
I touch the place
Where I'd find your face
My fingers in creases
Of distant dark places
I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science
Their words, mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me
I'm miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground, and I
I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms
After I have travelled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weeping
A joy you can't keep in
I'm miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground, and I
I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms
I'm miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground, and I
I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms
You could be my unintended
Choice to live my life extended
You could be the one I'll always love
You could be the one who listens
To my deepest inquisitions
You could be the one I'll always love
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken
Pieces of the life I had before
First there was the one who challenged
All my dreams and all my balance
She could never be as good as you
You could be my unintended
Choice to live my life extended
You should be the one I'll always love
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken
Pieces of the life I had before
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken
Pieces of the life I had before
Before you
I like the peace in the backseat
I don't have to drive, I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside and I can fall asleep
My family tree's losing all its leaves
Crashing towards the driver's seat
The lightning bolt made enough heat
To melt the street beneath your feet
Alice died in the night
I've been learning to drive my whole life
I've been learning
I like the peace in the backseat
I don't have to drive, I don't have to speak
I only can watch the countryside
Alice died in the night
I've been learning to drive my whole life
I've been learning how
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
Been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
You see, my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
Still ain't got a job
Now I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
We might kiss
When we are alone
When nobody's watchin'
We might take it home
We might make out
When nobody's there
It's not that we're scared
It's just that it's delicate
So why'd you fill my sorrows
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why'd you sing hallelujah
If it means nothin' to ya?
Why'd you sing with me at all?
We might live
Like never before
When there's nothin' to give
Well, how can we ask for more?
We might make love
In some sacred place
That look on your face
Is delicate
So why'd you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place that you've known?
And why'd you sing hallelujah
If it means nothin' to ya?
Why'd you sing with me at all?
Why'd you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place that you've known?
And why'd you sing hallelujah
If it means nothin' to ya?
Why'd you sing with me at all?
I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd
Need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
All the words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay, I miss you
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
And when you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
And when you're gone
All the words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay, I miss you
We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were, Yeah-Yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know!
Everything I do I'd give my heart and soul!
I can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me! Yeah-Eh!
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
And when you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
And when you're gone
All the words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day
And make it okay, I miss you, MMM
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door
But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
(Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Repress and restrain
Steal the pressure and the pain
Wash the blood off your hands
This time she won't understand
Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
No one knows who's in control
You're working so hard
And you're never in charge
Your death creates success
Rebuild and suppress
Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
No one knows who's in control
Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control
This place is a prison
These people aren't your friends
Inhaling thrills through twenty dollar bills
And the tumblers are drained and then flooded
Again and again. 
There's guards at the onramps
Armed to the teeth
And you may case the grounds
From the Cascades to Puget Sound
But you are not permitted to leave. 
I know there's a big world out there
Like the one that I saw on the screen
In my living room late last night
It was almost too bright to see. 
And I know that it's not a party
If it happens every night
Pretending there's glamor and candelabra
When you're drinking by candlelight. 
And what does it take
To get a drink in this place?
What does it take?
How long must I wait?
And what does it take
To get a drink in this place?
What does it take?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today
Ooh-hoo, ooohooo
I would hold you in my arms, I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done, forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do to hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you but I know you won't be there
Ohoho, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you
Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye
When it comes to this, oh
Would you tell me I was wrong, would you help me understand?
Are you looking down upon me, are you proud of who I am?
There's nothing I wouldn't do to have just one more chance
To look into your eyes and see you looking back
Ohoho, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself, ohoho
If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away
Ohoho, it's dangerous, it's so out of line
To try to turn back time
I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
'Cause I love you
I will always love you
I am colorblind
Coffee black and egg white
Pull me out from inside
I am ready
I am ready
I am ready
I am
Taffy stuck and tongue tied
Stutter shook and uptight
Pull me out from inside
I am ready
I am ready
I am ready
I am fine
I am covered in skin
No one gets to come in
Pull me out from inside
I am folded
And unfolded
And unfolding
I am colorblind
Coffee black and egg white
Pull me out from inside
I am ready
I am ready
I am ready
I am fine
I am fine
I am fine
It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dying breath
Of this love that we've been working on
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's gonna come and save you
We pulled too many false alarms
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch because you can
You'll try to hit me just hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
Cause you can't understand
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Go cry about it, why don't you?
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Don't you think we oughta know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Drink up, baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do
You won't but you might
The potential you'll be that you'll never see
The promises you'll only make
Drink up with me now and forget all about
The pressure of days, do what I say
And I'll make you okay and drive them away
The images stuck in your head
People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
They push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still
Drink up, baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again, between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest, where I like you the best
And keep the things you forgot
People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
They push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still
This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over
Just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for
More than you'll ever know
This is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face
Why can't we overcome this wall
Baby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at all
Kiss me
Please kiss me
But kiss me out of desire, babe
And not consolation
You know it makes me so angry
'Cause I know that in time
I'll only make you cry
This is our last goodbye
Did you say "No, this can't happen to me"
And did you rush to your phone to call?
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind saying
"Maybe... you didn't know him at all"
You didn't know him at all
You didn't know
The bells out in the church tower chime
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memory
Offer signs that it's over
It's over
I'm standin' on the bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothin' but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening, but there's no sound
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?
It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you, mm
I'm lookin' for a place
I'm searchin' for a face
Is anybody here I know?
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?
It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you, yeah yeah
Oh, why is everything so confusing?
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah??
It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you, oh, I'm with you
I'm with you
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Drifting and floating and fading away
Porcelain
Do you smell like a girl when you smile
Can you bear not to share with your child
Drifting and floating and fading away
Little lune
All day
Little lune
Porcelain
Do you carry the moon in your womb
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Drifting and floating and fading away
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Nodding and melting and fading away
Little lune
All day
Little lune x2
Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel so happy
But mostly you just make me mad
Baby, you just make me mad
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Thought of you as my mountaintop
Thought of you as my peak
Thought of you as everything
I've had but couldn't keep
I've had but couldn't keep
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in the mirror
I put in front of me
I put in front of me
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Skip a life completely, stuff it in a cup
She said, money is like us in time
It lies but can't stand up
Down for you is up
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
It was good what we did yesterday
And I'd do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
World was on fire and no-one could save me but you
Strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No, I don't wanna fall in love (This girl is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love (This girl is only gonna break your heart)
With you
With you
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
What a wicked game to play
To make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say
You never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you
No, I don't wanna fall in love (This girl is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love (This girl is only gonna break your heart)
With you
World was on fire and no-one could save me but you
Strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No, I don't wanna fall in love (This girl is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love (This girl is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
No, I (This girl is only gonna break your heart)
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
Nobody loves no-one
Don't hold yourself like that
You'll hurt your knees
I kissed your mouth and back
But that's all I need
Don't build your world around volcanoes melt you down
What I am to you is not real
What I am to you you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask for the sea
Don't throw yourself like that
In front of me
I kissed your mouth your back
Is that all you need?
Don't drag my love around volcanoes melt me down
What I am to you is not real
What I am to you you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask for what I give to you
Is just what I'm going through
This is nothing new
No no just another phase of finding what I really need
Is what makes me bleed
And like a new disease she's still too young to treat
Volcanoes melt me down
She's still too young
I kissed your mouth
You do not need me
I was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
Saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
Oh, brother, are you gonna leave me wasting away
On the streets of Philadelphia?
I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of Philadelphia
Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I, my friend
And my clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin
The night has fallen and I'm lying awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me, brother, with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the streets of Philadelphia?
Dead men lying on the bottom of the grave
Wondering, when savior comes, is he gonna be saved
Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die
They were crying when their sons left
God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope
He's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left
All young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth
He's never going home
Young men standing on the top of their own graves
Wondering, when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies
Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die
They were crying when their sons left
God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope
He's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left
All young men must go
He's come so far to find no truth
He's never going home
Welcome to the soldier side
Where there's no one here but me
People all grow up to die
There is no one here but me
Welcome to the soldier side
There is no one here but me
People on the soldier side
There is no one here but me
Many's the time I ran with you down
The rainy roads of our old town
Many, the lives we lived in each day
And buried altogether
Don't laugh at me
Don't look away
You'll follow me back with the sun in your eyes
And on your own
Bedshaped
And legs of stone
You'll knock on my door
And up we'll go
In white light
I don't think so
But what do I know?
What do I know?
I know
I know you think I'm holding you down
And I've fallen by the wayside now
And I don't understand the same things as you
But I do
Don't laugh at me
Don't look away
You'll follow me back with the sun in your eyes
And on your own
Bedshaped
And legs of stone
You'll knock on my door
And up we'll go
In white light
I don't think so
But what do I know?
What do I know?
I know
Oh, and up we'll go
In white light
I don't think so
But what do I know?
What do I know?
I know
They love me like I was a brother
They protect me, listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream
I call up my friend, the good angel
But she's out with her answerphone
She says that she'd love to come help but
The sea would electrocute us all
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream
If you think that you're strong enough (nice dream)
If you think you belong enough (nice dream)
If you think that you're strong enough (nice dream)
If you think you belong enough (nice dream)
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream, nice dream
Walk in silence
Don't walk away
In silence
See the danger
Always danger
Endless talking
Life rebuilding
Don't walk away
Walk in silence
Don't turn away
In silence
Your confusion
My illusion
Worn like a mask of self-hate
Confronts and then dies
Don't walk away
People like you
Find it easy
Aching to see
Walking on air
Hunting by the rivers through the streets
Every corner abandoned too soon
Set down with due care
Don't walk away
In silence
Don't walk away
Jim Adkins
There's no one in town I know
You gave us someplace to go
I never said thank you for that
I thought I might get one more chance
What would you think of me now
So lucky, so strong, so proud?
I never said thank you for that
Now I'll never have a chance
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
So what would you think of me now?
Jim Adkins & Rachel Haden (w/ RH subdued)
So lucky, so strong, so proud
I never said thank you for that
Now I'll never have a chance
Jim Adkins & Rachel Haden (w/ RH subdued)
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
Rachel Haden
May angels lead you in
Jim Adkins
May angels lead you in
Rachel Haden
May angels lead you in
Jim Adkins & Rachel Haden
May angels lead you in
Jim Adkins
And if you were with me tonight
I'd sing to you just one more time
A song for a heart so big
God wouldn't let it live
Jim Adkins & Rachel Haden
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
Wednesday morning at five o'clock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the back door key
Stepping outside she is free
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye bye)
For so many years
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
"Daddy, our baby's gone"
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye bye)
For so many years
Friday morning at nine o'clock
She is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
She (What did we do that was wrong?)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye bye)
For so many years
She's leaving home
Bye bye
I have a problem that I can not explain
I have no reason why it should've been so plain
I have no questions but I sure have excuse
I lack the reasons why I should be so confused
I know how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know how I feel when I'm around you
Around you
Left a message, but it ain't a bit of use
I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce
Today you saw, you saw me, you explained 
Playing the show and running down the plane
I know how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know how I feel when I'm around you
I, I know how I feel when I'm around you
I, don't know how I feel when I'm around you
Around you
I, I know how I feel when I'm around you
I, don't know how I feel when I'm around you
I, I know how I feel when I'm around you
I, don't know how I feel when I'm around you...
Around you
Around you
Around you
Around you...
I'm sorry
Two words I always think 
After you're gone
When I realize I was acting all wrong
So selfish
Two words that could describe
Oh, actions of mine 
When patience is in short supply
We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
Oh we, we could hold each other tight
Tonight
We're so helpless
We're slaves to our impulses
We're afraid of our emotions
No one, knows where the shore is
We're divided by the ocean
And the only thing I know is
The answer it isn't for us
No the answer isn't for us
I'm sorry
Two words I always think 
After you're gone
When I realize I was acting all wrong
We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
No we, we could, we could hold each other tight
Tonight...
Tonight...
Tonight...
Tonight...
Playground school bell rings again
Rain clouds come to play again
Has no one told you she's not breathing?
Hello I'm your mind giving you
Someone to talk to
Hello
If I smile and don't believe
Soon I know I'll wake from this dream
Don't try to fix me I'm not broken
Hello I'm the lie living for you so you can hide
Don't cry
Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping
Hello I'm still here
All that's left of yesterday
I had seven faces
Thought I knew which one to wear
I'm sick of spending these lonely nights
Training myself not to care
The subway is a porno
The pavements, they are a mess
I know you've supported me for a long time
Somehow I'm not impressed
But New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life)
Subway, she is a porno
And the pavements they are a mess
I know you've supported me for a long time
Somehow I'm not impressed
It's up to me now
Turn on the bright lights
Oh, it's up to me now
Turn on the bright lights
New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life)
It's up to me now
(Got to be some more change in my life)
Turn on the bright lights
(Got to be some more change in my life)
Oh, it's up to me now
(Got to be some more change in my life)
Turn on the bright lights
(Got to be some more change in my life)
Oh where oh where, can my baby be
The Lord took her, away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget, the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I, heard last
Oh where oh where, can my baby be
The Lord took her, away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave, this world
When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people, standin' all around
Somethin' warm, flowin' through my eyes
But somehow, I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
Hold me darlin', for a little while
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love, that I knew I had missed
Well now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love my life, that night
Oh where oh where, can my baby be
The Lord took her, away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave, this world
Ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh uh
Wish I was too dead to cry?
My self-affliction fades
Stones to throw at my Creator
Masochists to which I cater
You don't need to bother
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go till it bleeds
Wish I was too dead to care?
If indeed, I cared at all
Never had a voice to protest
So you fed me shit to digest
I wish I had a reason, my flaws are open season
For this I gave up trying, one good turn deserves my dying
You don't need to bother
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go till it bleeds
Wish I'd died instead of lived?
A zombie hides my face
Shell, forgotten with its memories
Diaries left with cryptic entries
And you don't need to bother
I don't need to be (I don't need to be)
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go till it bleeds
You don't need to bother
I don't need to be, yeah (I don't need to be)
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on (once I hold on)
I'll never live down my deceit
I don't know your face no more
Or feel the touch that I adore
I don't know your face no more
It's just a place I'm looking for
We might as well be strangers in another town
We might as well be living in a different world
We might as well...
We might as well...
We might as well...
I don't know your thoughts these days
We're strangers in an empty space
I don't understand your heart
It's easier to be apart
We might as well be strangers in another town
We might as well be living in another time
We might as well...
We might as well...
We might as well be strangers! Be strangers
For all I know of you now...
For all I know of you now...
For all I know of you now...
For all I know...
Your day breaks
Your mind aches
You find that all her words
Of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up
She makes up
She takes her time
And doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You want her
You need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You stay home
She goes out
She says that long ago
She knew someone
But now he's gone
She doesn't need him
Your day breaks
Your mind aches
There will be times
When all the things she said
Will fill your head
You won't forget her
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
There is a house built out of stone
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
This is a place where I don't feel alone
This is a place where I feel at home
And I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you
And now, it's time
To leave and turn to dust
Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed its knees
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Held on as tightly as you held onto me
Held on as tightly as you held onto me
And I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you
And now, it's time
To leave and turn to dust
And you, you bring me to my knees, again
All the times, that I could beg you please, in vain
All the times, when I felt insecure, for you
And I leave, my burdens at the door
But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you
All the times, that I felt like this won't end
It's for you, and I taste what I could never have
It was from you, all the times that I've cried
My intentions, were full of pride
But I waste, more time than anyone
But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you
All the times, that I've cried
All this wasted, it's all inside
And I feel, all this pain
I stuffed it down, it's back again
And I lie, here in bed
All alone, I can't mend
But I feel, tomorrow will be okay
But I'm on the outside, and I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
Inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you
Take my photo off the wall
If it just won't sing for you
'Cause all that's left has gone away
And there's nothing there for you to prove
Oh, look what you've done
You've made a fool of everyone
Oh well, it seems like such fun
Until you lose what you had won
Give me back my point of view
'Cause I just can't think for you
I can hardly hear you say
What should I do, well, you choose
Oh, look what you've done
You've made a fool of everyone
Oh well, it seems like such fun
Until you lose what you had won
Oh, look what you've done
You've made a fool of everyone
A fool of everyone
A fool of everyone
Take my photo off the wall
If it just won't sing for you
'Cause all that's left has gone away
And there's nothing there for you to do
Oh, look what you've done
You've made a fool of everyone
Oh well, it seems like such fun
Until you lose what you had won
Oh, look what you've done
You've made a fool of everyone
A fool of everyone
A fool of everyone
Two, three, four
Goldenrod and the 4H stone
The things I brought you
When I found out you had cancer of the bone
Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car into the Navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry
In the morning, through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade
I could see what you were reading
All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth
Tuesday night at the Bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens
I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse
In the morning, at the top of the stairs
When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared
All the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you
Sunday night, when I cleaned the house
I found the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of your mother
On the floor, at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom
In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window
In the morning, in the winter shade
On the first of March, on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing
All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications when I see His face
In the morning in the window
All the glory when He took our place
But He took my shoulders and He shook my face
And He takes and He takes and He takes
It's a mystery to me
We have a greed with which we have agreed
And you think you have to want more than you need
Until you have it all, you won't be free
Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me
When you want more than you have, you think you need
And when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed
I think I need to find a bigger place
'Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space
Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, crazy indeed
Hope you're not lonely without me
There's those thinking more or less, less is more
But if less is more, how you keepin' score?
Means for every point you make your level drops
Kinda like you're startin' from the top
And you can't do that
Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, crazy indeed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, have mercy on me
I hope you're not angry if I disagree
Society, you're crazy indeed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Come with me my love
To the sea
The sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you
Do you remember
When we met?
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you
Come with me my love
To the sea 
The sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you
He said "Son, have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say if I said that you could?
Just carry this gun, you'll even get paid."
I said "That sounds pretty good."
Black leather boots
Spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair but it looked alright
We marched and we sang
We all became friends
As we learned how to fight
A hero of war
Yeah that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust
I kicked in the door
I yelled my commands
The children, they cried
But I got my man
We took him away
A bag over his face
From his family and his friends
They took off his clothes
They pissed in his hands
I told them to stop
But then I joined in
We beat him with guns
And batons not just once
But again and again
A hero of war
Yeah that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust
She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop
I begged her to stay
But she pressed on
So I lifted my gun
And I fired away
And the shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand
That the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow
A hero of war
Is that what they see
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the only flag I trust
He said, "Son, have you seen the world?
Well what would you say, if I said that you could?"
Threw you the obvious
And you flew with it on your back
A name in your recollection
Down among a million same
Difficult not to feel a little bit
Disappointed and passed over
When I look right through
To see you naked, but oblivious
And you don't see me
But I threw you the obvious
Just to see if there's more behind
The eyes of a fallen angel
Eyes of a tragedy
Here I am expecting just a little bit
Too much from the wounded
But I see, see through it all
See through, see you
'Cause I threw you the obvious
To see what occurs behind
The eyes of a fallen angel
Eyes of a tragedy
Oh well
Oh well
Apparently nothing
Apparently nothing at all
You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't see me, you don't
You don't, you don't see me at all
I know that it is freezing, but I think we have to walk
I keep waving at the taxis, they keep turning their lights off
But Julie knows a party at some actor's westside loft
Supplies are endless in the evening, by the morning they'll be gone
When everything is lonely, I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper, have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit
And I know you have a heavy heart, I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it, yeah
But me I'm not a gamble, you can count on me to split
The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning won't exist
You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
Just keep going to the bathroom, always say you'll be right back
Well it takes one to know one, kid I think you got it bad
What's so easy in the evening, by the morning's such a drag
I've got a flask inside my pocket, we can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious, I will try and do the same
Well, we might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
But what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane
And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
The reasons all have run away, but the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live
'Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never is
It was so simple in the moonlight, now it's so complicated
It was so simple in the moonlight
So simple in the moonlight
So simple in the moonlight
It must be your skin I'm sinkin' in
It must be for real, 'cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind; it's not my kind
It's not my time, to wonder why
Everything gone white, everything's grey
Now you're here, now you're away
I don't want this; remember that
I'll never forget, where you're at
Don't let the days go by
Glycerine, glycerine
I'm never alone; I'm alone all the time
Are you at one, or do you lie?
We live in a wheel, where everyone steals
But when we rise, it's like strawberry fields
If I treated you bad, you'd bruise my face
Couldn't love you more; you've got a beautiful taste
Don't let the days go by
Could have been easier on you
I couldn't change, though I wanted to
Should have been easier by three
Our old friend, fear, and you, and me
Glycerine, glycerine
Don't let the days go by, glycerine
Don't let the days go by
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Glycerine, glycerine
Oh, glycerine, glycerine
Bad moon whine again
Bad moon whine again
As she falls around me
I needed you more, we wanted us less
Could not kiss, just regress
It might just be clear, simple, and plain
Well that's just fine; that's just one of my names
Don't let the days go by
Could have been easier on you, you, you
Glycerine, glycerine
Glycerine, glycerine
This is the moment that you know
That you told her that you loved her, but you don't
You touch her skin and then you think
That she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me
Yeah, she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me
I spent two weeks in Silver Lake
The California sun cascading down my face
There was a girl with light brown streaks
And she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me
Yeah, she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me
I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
As we moved together in the dark
And all the friends that I was telling
All the playful misspellings and every bite I made that left a mark
Then tiny vessels oozed into your neck
And formed the bruises that you said you didn't want to fade
But they did and so did I that day
All I see are dark gray clouds
In the distance, moving closer with every hour
So when you ask, "Is something wrong?"
I think, "You're damn right there is, but we can't talk about it now
No, we can't talk about it now."
So one last touch and then you'll go
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more
But it was vile and it was cheap
And you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me 
Yeah, you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah, you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me
He deals the cards as a meditation 
And those he plays never suspect 
He doesn't play for the money he wins 
He doesn't play for respect 
He deals the cards to find the answer 
The sacred geometry of chance 
The hidden law of a probable outcome 
The numbers lead a dance 
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier 
I know that the clubs are weapons of war 
I know that diamonds mean money for this art 
But that's not the shape of my heart 
He may play the jack of diamonds 
He may lay the queen of spades 
He may conceal a king in his hand 
While the memory of it fades 
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier 
I know that the clubs are weapons of war 
I know that diamonds mean money for this art 
But that's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape
The shape of my heart
And if I told you that I loved you 
You'd maybe think there's something wrong 
I'm not a man of too many faces 
The mask I wear is one 
Those who speak know nothing 
And find out to their cost 
Like those who curse their luck in too many places 
And those who fear are lost 
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier 
I know that the clubs are weapons of war 
I know that diamonds mean money for this art 
But that's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape
The shape of my heart
All this talk of getting old
It's getting me down, my love
Like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown
This time I'm coming down
And I hope you're thinking of me
As you lay down on your side
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again
But I know I'm on a losing streak
As I pass down my old street
And if you wanna show, then just let me know
And I'll sing in your ear again
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again
'Cause baby, ooh
If Heaven calls, I'm coming too
Just like you said
You leave my life, I'm better off dead
All this talk of getting old
It's getting me down, my love
Like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown
This time I'm coming down
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again
'Cause baby, ooh
If Heaven calls, I'm coming too
Just like you said
If you leave my life, I'm better off dead
But if you wanna show, then just let me know
And I'll sing in your ear again
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, woah
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, woah
Never coming down now, never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
Never coming down now, never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
Never coming down now, never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
Never coming down now, never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
Never coming down now, never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
Someone's always comin' around here trailing some new kill
Says "I've seen your picture on a hundred-dollar bill"
What's a game of chance to you to him is one of real skill
So glad to meet you, Angeles
Picking up the ticket shows there's money to be made
Go on, lose the gamble. That's the history of the trade
Did you add up all the cards left to play to zero
And sign up with evil, Angeles?
Don't start me tryin' now, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
'Cause I'm all over it, Angeles
I can make you satisfied in everything you do
All your secret wishes could right now be coming true
And be forever with my poison arms around you
No one's gonna fool around with us, no one's gonna fool around with us
So glad to meet you, Angeles
Your sorry eyes
They cut through bone
They make it hard
To leave you alone
Leave you here
Wearing your wounds
Waving your guns
At somebody new
Baby, you're lost
Baby, you're lost
Baby, you're a lost cause
There's too many people
You used to know
They see you coming
They see you go
They know your secrets
And you know theirs
This town is crazy
Nobody cares
Baby, you're lost
Baby, you're lost
Baby, you're a lost cause
I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
Fighting for a lost cause
There's a place where you are going
You ain't never been before
There's no one laughing at your back now
No one standing at your door
Is that what you thought love was for?
Baby, you're lost
Baby, you're lost
Baby, you're a lost cause
I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
Fighting for a lost cause
My insides all turned to ash
So slow
And blew away as I collapsed
So cold
A black wind took them away
From sight
And held the darkness over day
That night
And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
I used to be my own protection
But not now
'Cause my path has lost direction
Somehow
A black wind took you away
From sight
And held the darkness over day
That night
And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder
As they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
So now you're gone
And I was wrong
I never knew what it was like
To be alone
On a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day
(I used to be my own protection)
On a Valentine's day
(But not now)
On a Valentine's day
('Cause my mind has lost direction)
On a Valentine's day
(Somehow)
On a Valentine's day
(I used to be my own protection)
On a Valentine's day
(But not now)
On a Valentine's day
('Cause my mind has lost direction)
On a Valentine's day
(Somehow).
I roll the window down
And then begin to breathe in
The darkest country road
And the strong scent of evergreen
From the passenger seat as
You are driving me home 
Then looking upwards
I strain my eyes and try
To tell the difference between
Shooting stars and satellites 
From the passenger seat as
You are driving me home 
Do they collide?
I ask and you smile
With my feet on the dash
The world doesn't matter
When you feel embarrassed
Then I'll be your pride
When you need directions
Then I'll be the guide
For all time
For all time
So glad to see you well
Overcome and completely silent now
With heaven's help
You've cast your demons out
And not to pull your halo down
Around your neck and tug you off your cloud
But I'm more than just a little curious
How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends
To the dead
To the dead
Recall the deeds as if they're all
Someone else's atrocious stories
Now, you stand reborn before us all
So glad to see you well
And not to pull your halo down
Around your neck and tug you to the ground
But I'm more than just a little curious
How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends
To the dead
To the dead
With your halo slippin' down
Your halo slippin'
Your halo slippin' down
Your halo slippin' down
Your halo slippin' down
(But I'm more than just a little curious)
(How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends)
Your halo slippin' down
(But I'm more than just a little curious)
(How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends)
Your halo slippin' down
(But I'm more than just a little curious)
(How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends)
Your halo slippin' down
(But I'm more than just a little curious)
(How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends)
Your halo slippin' down
Your halo slippin' down
To choke you now
Please don't let this turn into something it's not
I can only give you everything I've got
I can't be as sorry as you think I should
But I still love you more than anyone else could
All that I keep thinking throughout this whole flight
Is it could take my whole damn life to make this right
This splintered mast I'm holding on won't save me long
Because I know fine well that what I did was wrong
The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
The first kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I have ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was "love"
We have got through so much worse than this before
What's so different this time that you can't ignore?
You say it is much more than just my last mistake
And we should spend some time apart for both our sakes
The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
The first kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I have ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was "love"
The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
The first kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I have ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was "love"
And I don't know where to look
My words just break and melt
Please just save me from this darkness
Please just save me from this darkness
And I don't know where to look
My words just break and melt
Please just save me from this darkness
Please just save me from this darkness
Let's go for a drive and see the town tonight
There's nothing to do but I don't mind when I'm with you
This town's so strange, they built it to change
And while we're sleeping all the streets get rearranged
And my old friends, we were so different then
Before your war against the suburbs began, before it began
And now the music divides us into tribes, 
You grew your hair, so I grew mine
You said the past won't rest until we jump the fence and leave it behind
And my old friends, I can remember when
You cut your hair, we never saw you again
Now the cities we live in could be distant stars
And I search for you in every passing car
The night's so long, yeah, the night's so long
I've been living in the shadows of your song
Living in the shadows of your song
In the suburbs I, I learned to drive
And you told me we would never survive
So grab your mother's keys, we leave tonight
You started a war that you can't win
They keep erasing all the streets, we grew up in
Now the music divides us into tribes
You choose your side, I'll choose my side
All my old friends, they don't know me now
Oh, all my old friends are staring through me now
Oh, all my old friends, they don't know me now
All my old friends, they don't know me now
All my old friends, wait
Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fly to the side
No one gets hurt
You've done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent
Will you say when I'm gone away
My lover came to me and we'd lay
In rooms unfamiliar but until now
Oh oh oh oh, until now
Oh oh oh oh, until now
Will you say to them when I'm gone
I loved your son for his sturdy arms
We both learned to cradle then live without
Oh oh oh oh, live without
Oh oh oh oh, live without
Will you say when I'm gone away
Your father's body was judgment day
We both dove and rose to the riverside
Oh oh oh oh, riverside
Oh oh oh oh, riverside
Will you say to me when I'm gone
Your face has faded but lingers on
'Cause light strikes a deal with each coming night
Oh oh oh oh, coming night
Oh oh oh oh, coming night
Oh oh oh oh, coming night
Oh oh oh oh, coming night
I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who's still around the morning after
We broke up a month ago and I grew up; I didn't know I'd be around the morning after
It's always been "Wait and see"; a happy day, and then you pay, and feel like shit the morning after
But now I feel changed around, and instead of falling down I'm standing up the morning after
Situations get fucked up and turned around sooner or later
I could be another fool or an exception to the rule. You tell me the morning after
Crooked spin can't come to rest. I'm damaged bad at best. She'll decide what she wants
I'll probably be the last to know; no one says until it shows. See how it is
They want you or they don't say yes
I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who's still around the morning after
I am outside and I've been waiting for the sun
With my wide eyes, I've seen worlds that don't belong
My mouth is dry with words I cannot verbalize
Tell me why we live like this
Keep me safe inside your arms like towers, tower over me
Yeah, 'cause we are broken
What must we do to restore our innocence?
And all the promise we adored
Give us life again 'cause we just wanna be whole
Lock the doors 'cause I'd like to capture this voice
It came to me tonight, so everyone will have a choice
And under red lights, I'll show myself it wasn't forged
We're at war, we live like this
Keep me safe inside your arms like towers, tower over me
'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore our innocence?
And all the promise we adored
Give us life again 'cause we just wanna be whole
Tower over me, tower over me
And I'll take the truth at any cost
'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore our innocence?
And all the promise we adored
Give us life again 'cause we just wanna be whole
Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty
And weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight
In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness
Oh this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees
In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
Notice me, take my hand 
Why are we strangers when 
Our love is strong 
Why carry on without me? 
Every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, it's haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 
I make believe that you are here 
It's the only way I see clear 
What have I done? 
You seem to move on easy 
And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 
I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song's my sorry 
At night, I pray 
That soon your face will fade away 
And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage, for what resembles rage again
So if you love me let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me unto my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me, that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight
So save your breath I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go
Oh oh
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago, if you still care don't ever let me know
If you still care don't ever let me know
Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
The photograph on the dashboard taken years ago
Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
Still it's so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight
Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
The recklessness in water
They cannot see me naked
These things they go away
Replaced by every day
Nightswimming
Remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit around the fairest sun?
The bright tide forever drawn
Could not describe nightswimming
You, I thought I knew you
You, I cannot judge
You, I thought you knew me
This one laughing quietly
Underneath my breath
Nightswimming
The photograph reflects
Every street light a reminder
Nightswimming
Deserves a quiet night
Deserves a quiet night
This one's called 'Stella was a diver and she is always down'
When she walks down the street
She knows there's people watching
The building fronts are just fronts
To hide the people watching her
She once fell through the street
Down a manhole in that bad way
The underground drip
Was just like her scuba day
Days
Daze
Days
Daze
Days
She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She was all right but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
She was all right, 'cause the sea was so tight
Airtight
She broke away, broke away
She broke away, broke away
She broke away, broke away
She broke away
She hides in no place
She hides in no way
She hides in no place
She hides in no way
At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
Her caresses caressed by fingers
And fat blue serpent swells
Stella
Stella
Oh, Stella
Stella I love you
Stella I love you
Stella I love you
She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She was all right but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
She was all right, yeah the sea was so tight
Airtight
She broke away, broke away
She broke away, broke away
She broke away, broke away
She broke away
Well, she was my catatonic sex-toy-love-joy-diver
Well, she was my catatonic sex-toy-love-drug-diver
She went down down down there into the sea
And she went down down down there, down there for me, right on
Oh yeah, right on, so good
Oh yeah, right on, so good
Oh yeah
There's something that's invisible
There's some things you can't hide
Try to detect you when I'm sleeping
In a wave you say goodbye
There's something that's invisible
There's some things you can't hide
Try to detect you while I'm sleeping
In a wave you say goodbye
Will you put my hands away?
Will you be my man?
Serve it up, don't wait
Let's see about this ham
Oh, what happened?
Oh, what happened?
Homespun desperation's knowing
Inside, your cover's always blown
Well I couldn't tell you
Why she felt that way, she felt it, every day
And I couldn't help her
I just watched her make, the same mistakes again
What's wrong what's wrong, now
Too many too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside
Open your eyes (Open your eyes)
And look outside, find the reasons why (Find the reasons why)
You've been rejected (You've been rejected)
And now you can't find, what you've left behind
Be strong be strong, now
Too many too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside
Her feeling she hides, her dreams she can't find
She's losing her mind, she's fallen behind
She can't find her place, she's losing her faith
She's fallen from grace, she's all over the place (Yeah yeah)
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside
She's lost inside, lost inside
She's lost inside, lost inside
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Won't you look down upon me Jesus
You gotta help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought they would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Been walkin' my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
Whoa, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things comin' my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you
Fire and rain, now
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though God knows you have mine
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know,
And I know, and I know, and I don't know
I know I'm not the only one
Why would he come back through the park?
You thought that you saw him, but no you did not
It's not him who come across the sea to surprise you
Not him who would know where in London to find you
With sadness so real that it populates
The city and leaves you homeless again
Steam from a cup and snow on the path
The seasons have changed from the present to past
The past
The past
Turns whole to half
The past
Why would he come back through the park?
You thought that you saw him, but no you did not
Who can be sure of anything through
The distance that keeps you 
From knowing the truth
Why would you think your boy could become
The man who could make you sure he was the one?
The one...
My one...
My one...
All I know is that you're so nice
You're the nicest thing I've seen
I wish that we could give it a go
See if we could be something
I wish I was your favourite girl
I wish you thought I was the reason you are in the world
I wish my smile was your favourite kind of smile
I wish the way that I dressed was your favourite kind of style
I wish you couldn't figure me out
But you'd always wanna know what I was about
I wish you'd hold my hand when I was upset
I wish you'd never forget the look on my face when we first met
I wish you had a favourite beauty spot that you loved secretly
'Cause it was on a hidden bit that nobody else could see
Basically, I wish that you loved me
I wish that you needed me
I wish that you knew when I said two sugars, actually I meant three
I wish that without me your heart would break
I wish that without me you'd be spending the rest of your nights awake
I wish that without me you couldn't eat
I wish I was the last thing on your mind before you went to sleep
Look, all I know is that you're the nicest thing I've ever seen
And I wish that we could see if we could be something
Yeah I wish that we could see if we could be something
I think you can do much better than me
After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
While looking through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were looking for
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
Wish I never would've said it's over
And I can't pretend I won't think about you when I'm older
'Cause we never really had our closure
This can't be the end
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
(And I think you should know this)
(You deserve much better than me)
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who
We used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk
About myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
(Outside)
At least I can say that I've tried
(I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Anymore
Hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
(Outside)
At least I can say that I've tried
(I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together
Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
Can't get no love without sacrifice
If anything should happen, I guess I wish you well
A little bit of heaven but a little bit of hell
This is the hardest story that I've ever told
No hope or love or glory
Happy ending's gone forever more
I feel as if I'm wastin'
And I'm wastin' everyday
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together
Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
I can get to my sleep, I can think that we just carried on
This is the hardest story that I've ever told
No hope or love or glory
Happy ending's gone forever more
I feel as if I'm wastin'
And I'm wastin' everyday
This is the way you left me (Oh, I feel as if I'm wastin')
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love (And I'm wastin' everyday)
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
Little bit of love
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
Little bit of love
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
Little bit of love, love, I feel as if I'm wastin'
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
And I'm wastin' everyday, hey, hey, hey
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love...)
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
To live the rest of our life
But not together
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
To live the rest of our life
But not together
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Step out the front door like a ghost into the fog
Where no one notices the contrast of white on white
And in between the moon and you, angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right
Well I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again, where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying, through the door I hear her crying
Why? I don't know
Round here, we always stand up straight
Round here, something radiates
Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walked along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous
Round here, we're carving out our names
Round here, we all look the same
Round here, we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
Round here, she's slipping though my hands
Oh, sleeping children better run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning
She says, it's only in my head
She says, shhh, I know, it's only in my head
But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says, man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?
Then she looks up at the building
Says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something
Round here, she's always on my mind
Round here, hey man, I got lots of time
Round here, we're never sent to bed early
And nobody makes us wait
Round here, we stay up very, very, very, very late
I... I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
Oh, you catch me if I'm falling
You catch me if I'm falling
You catch me 'cause I'm falling down on you
I said I'm under the gun, round here
Oh man, I said I'm under the gun, round here
And I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
Why do I have to fly over every town up and down the line?
I'll die in the clouds above and you that I defend I do not love
I wake up, it's a bad dream, no one on my side
I was fighting, but I just feel too tired to be fighting
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
Where will I meet my fate?
Baby, I'm a man and I was born to hate
And when will I meet my end?
In a better time you could be my friend
I wake up, it's a bad dream, no one on my side
I was fighting, but I just feel too tired to be fighting
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
Wouldn't mind it if you were by my side
But you're long gone, yeah you're long gone now
Where do we go?
I don't even know my strange old face
And I'm thinking about those days
And I'm thinking about those days
I wake up, it's a bad dream, no one on my side
I was fighting, but I just feel too tired to be fighting
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
Wouldn't mind it if you were by my side
But you're long gone, yeah you're long gone now
Yeah
Park the car at the side of the road
You should know
Time's tide will smother you
And I will too
When you laugh about people
Who feel so very lonely
Their only desire is to die
Well, I'm afraid
It doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
But that joke isn't funny anymore
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
More than you'll ever know
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
It was dark as I drove the point home
And on cold leather seats
Well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my face, after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
Sorrow found me when I was young
Sorrow waited, sorrow won
Sorrow, they put me on the pill
It's in my honey, it's in my milk
Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
'Cause I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you
Sorrow's my body on the waves
Sorrow's a girl inside my cake
I live in a city sorrow built
It's in my honey, it's in my milk
Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
'Cause I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you
Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
'Cause I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you
I was feeling sad
Can't help looking back
Highways flew by
Run, run away
No sense of time
Like you to stay
Want to keep you inside
Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize
Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize
I was feeling sad
Can't help looking back
Highways flew by
Run, run away
No sense of time
Like you to stay
Want to keep you inside
All along, not so strong without these open arms
Hold on tight
All along, not that strong without these open arms
Lie beside
All along, not so strong without these open arms
Lie beside
Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize
Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said
I know it's over still I cling
I don't know where else I can go, mother
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Although she needs you more than she loves you
And I know it's over
Still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
It's over, it's over, it's over
I know it's over
And it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know because tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they are in each other's arms"
It's so easy to laugh
It's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's over, over, over
It's so easy to laugh
It's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
It's over, over, over
Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love
Not tonight my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Ohh oh-oh-oh-oh ohh-oh-oh
Round and round and round and round and round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fool
They don't like him
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Ohhhh
Round and round and round and round and
Ohhhh
The sea's evaporating
Though it comes as no surprise
These clouds we're seeing
They're explosions in the sky
It seems it's written
But we can't read between the line
Hush
It's okay
Dry your eye
Dry your eye
Soul mate dry your eye
Dry your eye
Soul mate dry your eye
'Cause soul mates never die
This one world vision
Turns us into compromise
What good's religion
When it's each other we despise?
Damn the government
Damn their killing
Damn their lies
Hush
It's okay
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Soul mate dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Soul mate dry your eyes
Soul mates never die
Soul mates never die
Never die
Soul mates never die
Never die
Soul mates never die
Soul mates never die
Soul mates never die
Soul mates never die
Ich werde in die Tannen gehen
Dahin wo ich sie zuletzt gesehen
Doch der Abend wirft ein Tuch aufs Land
und auf die Wege hinterm Waldesrand
Und der Wald er steht so schwarz und leer
Weh mir, oh weh
Und die Vögel singen nicht mehr 
Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein
Ohne dich
Mit dir bin ich auch allein
Ohne dich
Ohne dich zähl ich die Stunden ohne dich
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden
Lohnen nicht
Auf den Ästen in den Gräben
Ist es nun still und ohne Leben
Und das Atmen fällt mir ach so schwer
Weh mir, oh weh
Und die Vögel singen nicht mehr
Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein
Ohne dich
Mit dir bin ich auch allein
Ohne dich
Ohne dich zähl ich die Stunden ohne dich
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden
Lohnen nicht ohne dich
Ohne dich!
Und das Atmen fällt mir ach so schwer
Weh mir, oh weh
Und die Vögel singen nicht mehr
Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein
Ohne dich
Mit dir bin ich auch allein
Ohne dich
Ohne dich zähl ich die Stunden ohne dich
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden
Lohnen nicht ohne dich
Ohne dich!
Ohne dich!
Ohne dich!
Ohne dich!
Ohne dich!
Ohne dich!
Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide
I'll take it by your side
Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide
I'll take it by your side
Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies
I'll take it by your side
Oversaturation curls the skin and tans the hide
I'll take it by your side
Tick tock
Tick tock
Tick tock
Tick tick
Tick
Tick
Tick tock
Tick
I'm unclean, a libertine
And every time you vent your spleen
I seem to lose the power of speech
You're slipping slowly from my reach
You grow me like an evergreen
You've never seen the lonely me at all
I
Take the plan, spin it sideways
I
Fall
Without you I'm nothing
Without you I'm nothing
Without you I'm nothing
Without you I'm nothing
Take the plan, spin it sideways
Without you I'm nothing at all
Older chests reveal themselves
Like a crack in a wall
Starting small, and grow in time
And we all seem to need the help
Of someone else
To mend that shelf
Too many books
Read me your favorite line
Papa went to other lands
And he found someone who understands
The ticking, and the western man's need to cry
He came back the other day
You know, some things in life may change
And some things they stay the same
Like time, there's always time
On my mind
So pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time
Older gents sit on the fence
With their cap in hand
Looking grand
They watch their city change
Children scream, or so it seems,
Louder than before
Out of doors, and into stores with bigger names
Mama tried to wash their faces
But these kids they lost their graces
And daddy lost at the races too many times
She broke down the other day
You know, some things in life may change
But some things they stay the same
Like time, there's always time
On my mind
So pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time
Time, there's always time
On my mind
Pass me by, I'll be fine
Just give me time
Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind
Images
You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
Clever trick
Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me
Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Shoulda known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do
We walked along a crowded street
You took my hand and danced with me
Images
And when you left you kissed my lips
You told me you would never, never forget
These images
Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me
Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Shoulda known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do
I cannot go to the ocean
I cannot drive the streets at night
I cannot wake up in the morning
Without you on my mind
So you're gone and I'm haunted
And I'll bet you are just fine
Did I make it that easy to walk
Right in and out of my life
Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be
So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Shoulda known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do
I lost myself on a cool damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you
Lilac wine 
Is sweet and heady
Like my love
Lilac wine 
I feel unsteady
Like my love
Listen to me 
I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she 
Coming to me
Nearly here
Lilac wine 
Is sweet and heady
Where's my love
Lilac wine 
I feel unsteady,
Where's my love
Listen to me 
Why is everything so hazy
Isn't that she 
Or am I just going crazy, dear?
Lilac wine 
I feel unready for my love
Feel unready
For my love
When you're dreaming with a broken heart 
The waking up is the hardest part
You roll out of bed and down on your knees
And for the moment you can hardly breathe
Wondering
Was she really here?
Is she standing in my room?
No she's not
'Cause she's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
When you're dreaming with a broken heart
The giving up is the hardest part
She takes you in with her crying eyes
Then all at once, you have to say goodbye
Wondering
Could you stay, my love?
And will you wake up by my side?
No she can't
'Cause she's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Now do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
And would you get them if I did?
No you won't
'Cause you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
When you're dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part
Broken this fragile thing now
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
And I've thrown my words all around
But I can't, I can't give you a reason
I feel so broken up (So broken up)
And I give up (I give up)
I just want to tell you so you know
Here I go, scream my lungs out, try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one
Made my mistakes, let you down
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long
Ran my whole life in the ground
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone
And something's breaking up (Breaking up)
I feel like giving up (Like giving up)
I won't walk out until you know
Here I go, scream my lungs out, try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one
Here I go, so dishonestly
Leave a note for you, my only one
And I know, you can see right through me, so let me go
And you will find someone
Here I go, scream my lungs out, try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one, no one like you
You are my only, my only one
My only one
My only one
My only one
You are my only, my only one
You can't resist her
She's in your bones
She is your marrow and your ride home
You can't avoid her
She's in the air (In the air)
In between molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide
Only in dreams, we see what it means
Reach out our hands, hold on to hers
But when we wake, it's all been erased
And so it seems only in dreams
You walk up to her
Ask her to dance
She says, "Hey, baby, I just might take the chance"
You say it's a good thing
That you float in the air
That way there's no way, I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces
Only in dreams, we see what it means
Reach out our hands, hold on to hers
But when we wake, it's all been erased
And so it seems only in dreams
Only in dreams, only in dreams
Only in dreams, only in dreams
Only in dreams, only in dreams
When I was young, younger than before
I never saw the truth hanging from the door
And now I'm older, see it face to face
And now I'm older, gotta get up, clean the place
And I was green, greener than the hill
Where flowers grew and the sun shone still
Now I'm darker than the deepest sea
Just hand me down, give me a place to be
And I was strong, strong in the sun
I thought I'd see when day was done
Now I'm weaker than the palest blue
Oh, so weak in this need for you
I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this the fourth the fifth
The minor fall the major lift
The baffled King composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Maybe I've been here before
I know this room I have walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
There was a time you let me know
What's real and going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
His father was a drinker
And his mother cried in bed
Folding John Wayne's T-shirts
When the swingset hit his head
The neighbors they adored him
For his humor and his conversation
Look underneath the house there
Find the few living things rotting fast
In their sleep of the dead
Twenty-seven people, even more
They were boys with their cars
Summer jobs, oh my God
Oh, are you one of them?
He dressed up like a clown for them
With his face paint white and red
And on his best behavior
In a dark room on the bed, he kissed them all
He'd kill ten thousand people
With the sleight of his hand
Running far, running fast to the dead
He took off all their clothes for them
He put a cloth on their lips
Quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth
And in my best behavior, I am really just like him
Look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid
Sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep
I'm tired and I, I want to go to bed
Sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep
And then leave me alone
Don't try to wake me in the morning
'Cause I will be gone
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I will feel so glad to go
Sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep
I don't want to wake up on my own anymore
Sing to me, sing to me
I don't want to wake up on my own anymore
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I really want to go
There is another world
There is a better world
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well
Bye
Bye
Bye
How I wish I could surrender my soul
Shed the clothes that become my skin
See the liar that burns within my needing
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold
How I wish I had screamed out loud
Instead I've found no meaning
I guess it's time I run far, far away, find comfort in pain
All pleasures the same, it just keeps me from trouble
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble
It's more than just words, it's just tears and rain
How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind
Hold memory close at hand
Help me understand the years
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell
How I wish I would save my soul
I'm so cold from fear
I guess it's time I run far, far away, find comfort in pain
All pleasures the same, it just keeps me from trouble
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble
Far, far away, find comfort in pain
All pleasures the same, it just keeps me from trouble
It's more than just words, it's just tears and rain
Tears and rain
Tears and rain
Far, far away, find comfort in pain
All pleasures the same, it just keeps me from trouble
It's more than just words, it's just tears and rain
Sometimes I find myself sittin' back and reminiscing
Especially when I have to watch other people kissing
And I remember when you started callin' me your Mrs
All the play fighting, all the flirtatious disses
I tell you sad stories about my childhood
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt
Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too
The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but it's so true
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
That things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend
So come on, tell me, is this the end?
Drinkin' tea in bed, watching DVDs
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
And you could tell that I was nervous so you held my hand
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
There's no one in the world who could replace you
Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of me and you
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you feel the same way too
The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but it's so true
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
That things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend
So come on, tell me, is this the end?
Looking out the door I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water
And maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind so you'll never know
I'm broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight?
Child, you know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run
Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
Much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really,
He has no one
So I'll wait for you, love
And I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return
Oh, will I ever learn?
Oh, lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns for a sleep that won't ever come
It's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over, all my riches for her smiles when I've slept so soft against her
It's never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over, she is the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Oh, but maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong
Oh, lover, you should've come over
Yes, I feel too young to hold on
And much to old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb and blind to see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
Oh, love, well I've waited for you
Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late
Your hand on his arm, haystack charm around your neck
Strung out and thin, callin' some friend, tryin'a cash some check
He's acting dumb, that's what you've come to expect
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
He's wearing your clothes, head down to toes a reaction to you
You say you know what he did, but you idiot kid, you don't have a clue
Sometimes they just get caught in the eye you're pulling him through
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Now on the bus, nearly touching this dirty retreat
Fallin' out, 6th and Powell, a dead sweat in my teeth
Gonna walk, walk, walk four more blocks plus the one in my brain
Down, downstairs to the man, he's gonna make it all okay
I can't beat myself, I can't beat myself and I don't want to talk
I'm taking the cure so I can be quiet wherever I want
So leave me alone, you ought to be proud that I'm getting good marks
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
In the light of the sun
Is there anyone?
Oh, it has begun
Oh dear, you look so lost
Eyes are red and tears are shed
This world you must have crossed
You said you don't know me
And you don't even care
Oh yeah
You said you don't know me
And you don't wear my chains
Oh yeah
Essential yet appealed
Carry all your thoughts
Across an open field
When flowers gaze at you
They're not the only ones
Who cry when they see you
You said you don't know me
And you don't even care
Oh yeah
We said you don't know me
And you don't wear my chains
Oh yeah
She said I think I'll go to Boston
I think I'll start a new life
I think I'll start it over
Where no one knows my name
I'll get out of California
I'm tired of the weather
Think I'll get a lover
And fly him out to Spain
I think I'll go to Boston
I think that I'm just tired
I think I need a new town
To leave this all behind
I think I need a sunrise
I'm tired of the sunset
I hear it's nice in the summer
Some snow would be nice
Oh yeah
You don't know me
And you don't even care
Oh yeah
Boston
Where no one knows my name
Where no one knows my name
Where no one knows my name
Yeah
Boston
Where no one knows my name
Nothing unusual, nothing strange 
Close to nothing at all 
The same old scenario, the same old rain 
And there's no explosions here 
Then something unusual, something strange 
Comes from nothing at all 
I saw a spaceship fly by your window 
Did you see it disappear? 
Amie come sit on my wall 
And read me the story of "O"
And tell it like you still believe 
That the end of the century 
Brings a change for you and me 
Nothing unusual, nothing's changed 
Just a little older that's all 
You know when you've found it, 
There's something I've learned 
'Cause you feel it when they take it away 
Something unusual, something strange 
Comes from nothing at all 
But I'm not a miracle and you're not a saint 
Just another soldier on the road to nowhere 
Amie come sit on my wall 
And read me the story of "O" 
And tell it like you still believe 
That the end of the century 
Brings a change for you and me 
And Amie come sit on my wall 
And read me the story of "O" 
And tell it like you still believe 
That the end of the century 
Brings a change for you and me
I want to
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floating upon the surface for the birds
The birds
The birds
You want me
Fucking well come and find me
I'll be waiting
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches and nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
You want me
Well come on and break the door down
You want me
Fucking come on and break the door down
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
Took a drive into the sprawl
To find the house where we used to stay
Couldn't read the number in the dark
You said, "Let's save it for another day"
Took a drive into the sprawl
To find the places we used to play
It was the loneliest day of my life
You're talking at me but I'm still far away
Let's take a drive through the sprawl
Through these towns they built to change
But then you said, the emotions are dead
It's no wonder that you feel so strange
Cops shone their lights on the reflectors of our bikes
Said, "Do you kids know what time it is?"
Well sir, it's the first time I've felt like something is mine
Like I have something to give...
The last defender of the sprawl said, "Well, where do you kids live?"
Well sir, if you only knew, what the answer is worth
Been searching every corner of the earth
Have no fear
For when I'm alone
I'll be better off 
Than I was before
I've got this light
I'll be around to grow
Who I was before
I cannot recall
Long nights allow 
Me to feel I'm falling
I am falling
The lights go out
Let me feel I'm falling
I am falling 
Safely to the ground
I'll take this soul 
That's inside me now
Like a brand new friend
I'll forever know
I've got this life 
And the will to show
I will always be 
Better than before
Long nights allow 
Me to feel I'm falling
I am falling
The lights go out
Let me feel I'm falling
I am falling 
Safely to the ground
When I see your smile
Tears run down my face
I can't replace
And now that I'm stronger I've figured out
How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul
And I know I'll find deep inside me
I can be the one
I will never let you fall (let you fall)
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all (through it all)
Even if saving you sends me to heaven
It's okay
It's okay
It's okay
Seasons are changing
And waves are crashing and stars are falling
All for us
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter
I can show you I'll be the one
I will never let you fall (let you fall)
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all (through it all)
Even if saving you sends me to heaven
'Cause you're my, you're my
My true love, my whole world
Please don't throw that away
'Cause I'm here for you
Please don't walk away
And please tell me you'll stay
Yeah... whoa... stay... whoa... oh...
Use me as you will
Pull my strings just for a thrill
And I know I'll be ok
Though my skies are turning grey (grey...)
I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heaven
I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heaven
(I will never let you fall...)
Your flirts finds me out
Teases the crack in me
Smittens me with hope
Possibly maybe, possibly maybe, possibly maybe.
As much as I definitely enjoy solitude
I wouldn't mind perhaps
Spending little time with you
Sometimes, sometimes
Possibly maybe probably love,
Possibly maybe probably love
Uncertainty excites me
Baby
Who knows what's going to happen?
Lottery or car crash
Or you'll join a cult
Probably maybe, possibly love
Probably maybe, possibly love
Possibly
Mon petit vulcan
You're eruptions and disasters
I keep calm
Admiring your lava
I keep calm
Possibly maybe probably love
Possibly maybe probably love
Electric shocks
I love them
With you dozen a day
But after a while I wonder
Where's that love you promised me?
Where is it?
Possibly maybe probably love
Possibly maybe probably love
How can you offer me love like that?
My heart's burned
How can you offer me love like that?
I'm exhausted
Leave me alone
Possibly maybe,
Possibly maybe,
Possibly maybe.
Since we broke up
I'm using lipstick again
I suck my tongue
In remembrance of you
Possibly maybe, possibly maybe
Possibly maybe, possibly maybe
Possibly maybe, possibly maybe
Don't hurt me
Don't haunt me
Don't hurt me
Don't haunt me
Gather up the lost and the sold (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
Gather up the pitiful (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
What seems impossible (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
I think I have had my fill (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
I think I should give up the ghost (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
Good times for a change
See, the luck I've had
Can make a good man turn bad
So please, please, please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me get what I want
This time
Haven't had a dream in a long time
See, the life I've had
Can make a good man bad
So for once in my life
Let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time
While you are away, my heart comes undone;
Slowly unravels, in a ball of yarn...
The devil collects it, with a grin;
Our love, in a ball of yarn...
He'll never return it... (So when you come back, we'll have to make new love...)
He'll never return it... (When you come back, we'll have to make new love...)
While you are away, my heart comes undone;
Slowly unravels, in a ball of yarn...
The devil collects it, with a grin;
Our love, our love, in a ball of yarn...
He'll never return it... (When you come back, we'll have to make new love...)
He'll never return it... (When you come back, we'll have to make new love...)
Oh, he'll, he'll never return it... (When you come back, we'll have to make new love...)
He'll never return it... (When you come back, we'll have to make new love...)
Does it go from east to west, ya?
Body free and a body less, ya
Come again just to start a-fresh and
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime
Dropping in, coming through the mesh, ya
Checking in just to get it blessed, ya
Hard to leave when it's picturesque
Find a form that's free to roam
(Ah) Where you come from?
(Ah) Where you going?
(Ah) Where you come from?
(Ah) Where you going?
Do it all then it all again, ya
Make it up and you make a friend, ya
Paddle on, just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas
Take a chance on a 'recommend', ya
Hard as hell just to comprehend, ya
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze
(Ah) Where you come from?
(Ah) Where you going?
(Ah) Where you come from?
(Ah) Where you going?
We all want to tell her
Tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen
Best I've ever seen
We all want to kiss her
Tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen
Best I've ever...
I know you said you don't believe
In God, do you still disagree?
Now that it's time for you to leave
G.L.O.R.I.A. is love
My friend
My friend
My friend
(Ooh) Your stylish mess of silver hair
(The love) A woman of your kind is rare
(My love) Your uniform returns to air
(My love) G.L.O.R.I.A. is love (ooh)
(The love) My friend
(My love) My friend
(My love) My friend
(Ooh) And now it's time for you to go
(The love) You taught me most of what I know
(My love) Where would I be without you, Glo?
(My love) G.L.O.R.I.A. is love (ooh)
(The love) My friend
(My love) My friend
(My love) My friend
(Ooh) I see you standing by the sea
(The love) The waves you made will always be
(My love) A kiss goodbye before you leave
(My love) G.L.O.R.I.A. is love
My friend
My friend
My friend
Cold, cold water surrounds me now
And all I've got is your hand
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Or am I lost?
Love one's daughter
Allow me that
And I can't let go of your hand
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Or am I lost?
Cold, cold water surrounds me now
And all I've got is your hand
Lord, can you hear me?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me?
Or am I lost?
Am I lost with you?
Instrumental
Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
"Daddy, look what I made.", dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?"
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"You're making mommy cry, why? Why is mommy crying?"
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time.
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine."
She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
"Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya."
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right," and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
60,000 people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
"Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,"
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
"You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin.
I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone."
But baby wait, "It's too late dad, you made the choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us."
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream "Die Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
Don't walk the plank like I did
You will be dispensed with
When you've become inconvenient
Upon Harrowdown Hill
Near where you used to go to school
That's where I am
That's where I'm lying down
Did I fall or was I pushed?
Did I fall or was I pushed?
Then where's the blood?
Then where's the blood?
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
To make it all right
So dry your eyes
We think the same things at the same time
We just can't do anything about it
We think the same things at the same time
We just can't do anything about it
So don't ask me
Ask the ministry
So don't ask me
Ask the ministry
We think the same things at the same time
There are so many of us
So you can't count
Can you see me when I'm running?
Can you see me when I'm running?
Away from them
Away from them
I can't take their pressure
No one cares if you live or die
They just want me gone
They want me gone
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
To make it all right
So dry your eyes
We think the same things at the same time
We just can't do anything about it
We think the same things at the same time
There are too many of us
So you can't
There are too many of us
So you can't count
It has me led to the backroom
Harrowdown Hill
It has me led to the backroom
Harrowdown Hill
It was a slippery slippery slippery slope
It was a slippery slippery slippery slope
I feel me slipping in and out of consciousness
I feel me slipping in and out of consciousness
I feel me
Bear paws and rascal power
Watching us in your garage
Big girl, you ate the neighbor
The nova is over
Wake up and play
By the radio
Make room for Clara's bare feet
The lover, a Martian
Tick tock, they're waiting for the meteor
This clock is opening another door
Lots of love, just keep it comin'
Making something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know how to say
Look at what I love today
These are the best that I
Lots of love, just keep it comin'
Making something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know what to say
Look at what I lost today
These are the things that I
Blood flowers in the kitchen
Signing off and winding down
This Martian ends her mission
The nova is over
She caught the ball
By the mission bell
Chase lizards, bark at donkeys
The lover, a Martian
Let's bow our heads
And let the trumpets blow
Our girl is gone
God bless her little soul
Lots of love, just keep it comin'
Making something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I
Lots of love, just keep it comin'
Making something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know what to say
Look at what I lost today
These are the things that I
She's got sword in case
Though this is not her lord in case
The one who can't afford to face her image is restored to grace
Disappeared, no trace
Musky tear, suitcase
The downturn, brave little burn cub
Bear careless, turnip snare rampages
Pitch color pages
Down and out, but not in Vegas
Disembarks and disengages
No loft
Sweet pink canary cages
Plummet pop, dew skin, fortitude for the sniffing black noses
That snort and allude to dangling trinkets
That mimic the dirt cough go drink it's
It's for you
Blue battered naval down slip kisses
Delivered by duck muscles and bottle-nosed grifters
Arrive in time to catch the late show
It's a beehive barrel race
A she-hive stare and chase 
Wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters
Into the new morning milk blanket
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny
Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay
Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesterday's fallen freckles away
No I'm not colorblind
I know the world is black and white
I try to keep an open mind
But I just can't sleep on this tonight
Stop this train
I want to get off
And go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?
Don't know how else to say it
I don't want to see my parents go
One generation's length away
From finding life out on my own
Stop this train
I want to get off
And go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?
So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find a way to say that life has just begun
Had a talk with my old man
Said "Help me understand"
He said "turn sixty-eight"
"You'll re-negotiate"
"Don't stop this train
Don't for a minute change the place you're in
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John, honestly we'll never stop this train"
Once in a while, when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And you're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
Till you cry when you're driving away in the dark
Singing
Stop this train
I want to get off
And go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
'Cause now I see I'll never stop this train
Trudging slowly over wet sand,
Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen
This is the coastal town,
That they forgot to close down
Armageddon, come Armageddon
Come Armageddon, come
Everyday is like Sunday,
Everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade, etch a postcard:
"How I dearly wish I was not here"
In this seaside town,
That they forgot to bomb
Come, come, come nuclear bomb
Everyday is like Sunday,
Everyday is silent and grey.
Trudging back over pebbles and sand,
And a strange dust lands on your hands,
And on your face,
On your face, on your face, on your face...
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
Share some grease-tea with me
Everyday is silent and grey.
Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
it's tearing up inside of me
Every day, every hour
I wish that I
Was bulletproof
Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it
Was bulletproof
Was bulletproof
So pay me money, take a shot
Lead-fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
Bulletproof
Through the wall he threw me
I know he'd never hurt me
Daddy watch me sleeping
I've been praying for you silently
Daddy's love makes me whole
Without him I'm insecure
The only girl he'd ever love
Is one that smells so pure
Two ravens in the old oak tree and
One for you and one for me and
Bluebells in the late December
I see signs now all the time
The last time we slept together
There was something that was not there
You never wanted to alarm me
But I'm the one that's drowning now
I could sleep forever these days
'Cause in my dreams I see you again
But this time fleshed out full face
In your confirmation dress
It was so like you to visit me to
Let me know you were okay
It was so like you to visit me
Always worried about someone else
At your funeral I was so upset
So, so upset
In your life you were larger than this
Statuesque, statuesque
I see signs now all the time
That you're not dead, you're sleeping
I'd believe in anything
That brings you back home to me
Your softly spoken words
Release my whole desire
Undenied, totally
And so bare is my heart
I can't hide
And so where does my heart
Belong
Beneath your tender touch
My senses can't divide
Oh so strong
My desire
For so bare is my heart
I can't hide
And so where does my heart
Belong
Now that I've found you
And seen behind those eyes
How can I carry on?
For so bare is my heart
I can't hide
And so where does my heart
Belong
Belong, belong, belong
The call to arms was never true
Time to imbibe, here's to you
I'll tell you stories bruised and blue
Of drum machines and landslides
Just one more round before we're through
More psychedelic yuppie flu
It's such a silly thing to do
And now we're stuck on rewind...
Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And rob their houses
The call to arms was never true
Let's take a ride and push it through
Suspended animation glue
Blame it on apartheid
Let's spend the night in Jimmy Choo's
I'll give you coats and cheap shampoo
I'll give you nothing else to do
And now we're stuck on rewind
Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And Rob their houses
Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And rob their houses
The call to arms was never true
I'm medicated, how are you?
Let's take a dive swim right through
Sophisticated points of view
Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And Rob their houses
Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And rob their houses
If I could tear you from the ceiling 
And guarantee a source divine 
Rid you of possessions fleeting 
Remain your funny valentine 
Don't go and leave me 
And please don't drive me blind 
Don't go and leave me 
And please don't drive me blind 
If I could tear you from the ceiling 
I know best have tried 
I'd fill your every breath with meaning 
And find a place we both could hide 
Don't go and leave me 
And please don't drive me blind 
Don't go and leave me 
And please don't drive me blind 
You don't believe me 
But you do this every time 
Please don't drive me blind 
Please don't drive me blind
I know you're broken 
I know you're broken 
I know you're broken 
If I could tear you from the ceiling 
I'd freeze us both in time 
And find a brand new way of seeing 
Your eyes forever glued to mine 
Don't go and leave me 
And please don't drive me blind 
Don't go and leave me 
And please don't drive me blind 
Please don't drive me blind 
Please don't drive me blind 
Please don't drive me blind 
Please don't drive me blind
You got wires going in
You got wires coming out of your skin
You got tears making tracks
I've got tears that are scared of the facts
Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I see Christmas lights reflect in your eyes
You got wires going in
You got wires coming out of your skin
There's dry blood on your wrist
Your dry blood on my fingertip
Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
First night of your life, curled up on your own
Looking at you now you would never know
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
All right
Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I see Christmas lights reflect in your eyes
Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
First night of your life, curled up on your own
Looking at you now you would never know
I had tender feelings that you made hard
But it's your heart, not mine, that's scarred
So when I go home I'll be happy to go
You're just somebody that I used to know
You don't need my help anymore
It's all now to you, there ain't no before
Now that you're big enough to run your own show
You're just somebody that I used to know
I watched you deal in a dying day
And throw a living past away
So you can be sure that you're in control
You're just somebody that I used to know
I know you don't think you did me wrong
And I can't stay this mad for long
Keeping ahold of what you just let go
You're just somebody that I used to know
I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl
Remember when you lost your shit
And drove the car into the garden?
You got out and said I'm sorry
To the vines and no one saw it
I need my girl
I need my girl
I'm under the gun again
I know I was a 45-percenter then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl
There're some things that I should never
Laugh about in front of family
I tried to call you from the party
It's full of punks and cannonballers
I need my girl
I need my girl
I'm under the gun again
I know I was a 45-percenter then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
"I think it's dark and it looks like rain", you said
"And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world", you said
"And it's so cold, it's like the cold like you were dead"
Then you smiled for a second
"I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain", you said
"And it's all running out like it's the end of the world", you said
"It's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead"
Then you smiled for a second
Sometimes you make me feel like I am living at the edge of the world
Like I am living at the edge of the world
"It's just the way I smile", you said
You think your days are uneventful
And no one ever thinks about you
She goes her own way
She goes her own way
You think your days are ordinary
And no one ever thinks about you
But we're all the same
And she can hardly breathe without you
She says she has no time for you now
She says she has no time
Well, think about the lonely people
Or think about the day she found you
Or lie to yourself
And see it all dissolve around you
She says she has no time for you now
She says she has no time for you now
She says she has no time
Lonely people tumble downwards
And my heart opens up to you
When she says she has no time for you now
She says she has no time for you now
She says she has no time
Can I hold you one last time
To fight the feeling that is growing in my mind
I know I did us both all so wrong
I know I'm not always all that strong
A-b-c-d-e-f and -g
Oh that reminds me of when we were free
Before life began to tear us apart
Remember those classes when we thought we were so smart
Ooh
Ooh
We were lovers in every way
Left school together, went back to my place
Now I can hardly remember her face
Before I met her I was... sad
Ooh
Ooh
And can I hold you one last time
To fight this feeling that is growing in my mind
I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had
The chance to
I stopped my rambling
I don't do too much gambling these days
These days
These days I seem to think about
How all the changes came about my way
And I wonder if I'd see another
Highway
I had a lover
I don't think I'll risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song
It's just that I've been losing
So long
La la la la la
La la
I'd stop my dreaming
I won't do too much scheming these days
These days
These days I sit on corner stones
And count the time in quarter turns to ten
Please don't confront me with my failures
I had not forgotten them
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
This is my December
This is my snow covered home
This is my December
This is me all alone
(And I)
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
(And I)
Take back all the things I said to make you feel like that
(And I)
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
(And I)
Take back all the things that I said to you
And I'd
Give it all away, just to have somewhere to go to 
Give it all away, to have someone to come home to 
This is my December
These are my snow covered dreams
This is me pretending
This is all I need
(And I)
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
(And I)
Take back all the things I said to make you feel like that
(And I)
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
(And I)
Take back all the things that I said to you
And I'd
Give it all away, just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away, to have someone to come home to
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
Give it all away, just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away, to have someone to come home to
Give it all away, just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away, to have someone to come home to
A long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leaving
And the days go by so fast
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think that I could be forgiven
Wish you would
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, yeah
The smell of hospitals in winter
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters but no pearls
All at once you look across a crowded room
To see the way that light attaches to a girl
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California
Think you should
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, yeah, yeah
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after 2 a.m.
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself
To hold on to these moments as they pass
And it's one more day up in the canyon
And it's one more night in Hollywood
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean
I guess I should
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, yeah, oh
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, yeah, oh
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I wish that I had known in that first minute we met
The unpayable debt that I owed you
'Cause you'd been abused by that bone that refused you
And you hired me to make up for that
Walking in that room when you had tubes in your arms
Those singing morphine alarms out of tune
Kept you sleeping and even, and I didn't believe them
When they called you a hurricane thunderclap
When I was checking vitals I suggested a smile
You didn't talk for awhile, you were freezing
You said you hated my tone, it made you feel so alone
And so you told me I ought to be leaving
But something kept me standing by that hospital bed
I should have quit, but instead, I took care of you
You made me sleep and uneven, and I didn't believe them
When they told me that there was no saving you
It's four in the morning, the end of December
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening
I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
You're living for nothing now
I hope you're keeping some kind of record
Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?
Ah, the last time we saw you, you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train
And you came home without Lili Marlene
And you treated my woman
To a flake of your life
And when she came back
She was nobody's wife
Well, I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well, I see Jane's awake
She sends her regards
And what can I tell you, my brother, my killer
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you
I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way
If you ever come by here
For Jane or for me
Your enemy is sleeping
And his woman is free
Yes, and thanks
For the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good so I never tried
And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Sincerely, L. Cohen
Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me
And all the time you were tellin' me lies
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, own me nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me
Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
With you
Right till the end Ooh
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's about to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
Or just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
On lonely nights I start to fade
On lonely nights I start to fade
Her love's a thousand miles away
Her love's a thousand miles away
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Memories made in the coldest winter
It's four AM and I can't sleep
It's four AM and I can't sleep
Her love is all that I can see
Her love is all that I can see
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Memories made in the coldest winter, winter
Winter, oh
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
If spring can take the snow away
If spring can take the snow away
Can it melt away all our mistakes?
Can it melt away all our mistakes?
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, I won't ever love again
Never again
If it makes you less sad
I will die by your hand
I hope you find out what you want
I already know what I am
And if it makes you less sad
We'll start talking again
You can tell me how vile
I already know that I am
I'll grow old
Start acting my age
I'll be a brand new day
In a life that you hate
A crown of gold
A heart that's harder than stone
And it hurts a whole lot
But it's missed when it's gone
Call me a safe bet
I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive
Only hoping as time goes you can forget
If it makes you less sad
I'll move out of the state
You can keep to yourself
I'll keep out of your way
And if it makes you less sad
I'll take your pictures all down
Every picture you paint
I will paint myself out
It's cold as a tomb
And it's dark in your room
When I sneak to your bed
To pour salt in your wounds
So call it quits
Or get a grip
You say you wanted a solution
But you just wanted to be missed
Call me a safe bet
I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive
Only hoping as time goes you can forget
So you can forget
You can forget
You are calm and reposed
It lets your beauty unfold
Pale white like the skin stretched over your bones
Spring keeps you ever close
You are second hand smoke
You are so fragile and thin
Standing trial for your sins
Holding on to yourself the best you can
You are the smell before rain
You are the blood in my veins
Call me a safe bet
I'm betting I'm not
I'm glad that you can forgive
Only hoping as time goes you can forget
He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
Started making his way past two in the morning
He hasn't been sober for days
Leaning now into the breeze
Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
They had breakfast together
But two eggs don't last
Like the feeling of what he needs
Now this place seems familiar to him
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Left him dying to get in
Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me
Even though she doesn't believe in love
He's determined to call her bluff
Who could deny these butterflies?
They're filling his gut
Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
He pleads though he tries
But he's only denied
Now he's dying to get inside
Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me
As the neighbors said she moved away
Funny how it rained all day
I didn't think much of it then
But it's starting to all make sense
Oh, I can see now
That all of these clouds are
Following me in my desperate endeavor
To find my whoever
Wherever she may be
I'm not coming back (forgive me)
I've done something so terrible
I'm terrified to speak
(I'm not calling, I'm not calling)
But you'd expect that from me
I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt
Now the rain is just
(You're driving me crazy, I'm)
Washing you out of my hair
And out of my mind
I'm keeping an eye on the world
From so many thousands of feet off the ground
I'm over you now
I'm at home in the clouds
And towering over your head
Well I guess I'll go home now
I guess I'll go home now
I guess I'll go home now
I guess I'll go home
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere, I would have followed you, oh
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something
I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like you need
And wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just don't leave
Don't leave
Did we create a modern myth?
Did we imagine half of it
Would happen in a thought from now?
Save yourself, save yourself
The secret is out
The secret is out
To buy the truth and sell a lie
The last mistake before you die
So don't forget to breathe tonight
Tonight's the last to say goodbye
The secret is out
The secret is out
The secret is out
The secret is out
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye
I should know who I am by now
I walk, the record stands somehow
Thinking of winter
Your name is the splinter inside me
While I wait
I remember the sound
Of your November downtown
And I remember the truth
A warm December with you
But I don't have to make this mistake
And I don't have to stay this way
If only I would wait
The walk has all been cleared by now
Your voice is all I hear somehow
Calling out winter
Your voice is the splinter inside me
While I wait
I remember the sound
Of your November downtown
And I remember the truth
A warm December with you
But I don't have to make this mistake
And I don't have to stay this way
If only I would wait
I could have lost myself
In rough blue waters in your eyes
And I miss you still
I remember the sound
Of your November downtown
And I remember the truth
A warm December with you
But I don't have to make this mistake
And I don't have to stay this way
If only I would wait
All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man I'm sure
When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side
But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you
Ooh oh
So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens
But If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody
Ooh
If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
All I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you
Ooh
Speak to me in a language I can hear
Humor me before I have to go
Deep in thought I forgive everyone
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
I know I can't be late
Supper's waiting on the table
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
So I pull my collar up and face the cold
On my own
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
The sun is out and up and down again
I know I'll make it
Love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
And you can make it last forever
You can make it last forever
You can make it last
And for a moment I lose myself
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
I've journeyed here and there and back again
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
Mysteries not ready to reveal
Your sympathies I'm ready to return
I'll make the effort
Love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Tomorrow's just an excuse
Tomorrow's just an excuse
And you can make it last forever
You can make it last forever
You can make it last forever you
Forever you
6 AM, day after Christmas
I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold, car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping, I am numb
Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
They're not home to find us out
And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
They call her name at seven-thirty
I pace around the parking lot
And I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got
Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for
Now she's feeling more alone
Than she ever has before
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
As weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine
They told me, "Son, it's time to tell the truth."
And she broke down and I broke down
'Cause I was tired of lying
Driving back to her apartment
For the moment, we're alone
Yeah, she's alone and I'm alone
Now I know it
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart
Take back that sad word, "goodbye"
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me
Oh, un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt that you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many, many nights
Oh, un-break my, un-break my heart, oh baby
Come back and say you love me
Un-break my heart, sweet darlin'
Without you I just can't go on
(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Tell me you love me) Can't go on, ooh
(Un-break my)
(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Tell me you love me)
(Un-break my)
(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Tell me you love me)
(Un-break my)
(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Tell me you love me)
(Un-break my)
(Fade)
Hey, dad, look at me
Think back and talk to me
Did I grow up according to plan?
And do you think I'm wasting my time
Doing things I wanna do?
But it hurts when you disapprove all along
And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
Can't pretend that I'm all right
And you can't change me
'Cause we lost it all, nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late, and we can't go back
I'm sorry I can't be perfect
I try not to think, about the pain I feel inside
Did you know you used to be my hero?
All the days you spent with me, now seem so far away
And it feels like you don't care anymore
And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
I can't stand another fight
And nothing's alright
'Cause we lost it all, and nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late, and we can't go back
I'm sorry I can't be perfect
Nothing's gonna change the things that you said
And nothing's gonna make this right again (Right again)
Please don't turn your back, I
Can't believe it's hard just to talk to you
But you don't understand (You don't understand)
'Cause we lost it all, and nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late, and we can't go back
I'm sorry I can't be perfect
'Cause we lost it all, and nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late, and we can't go back
I'm sorry I can't be perfect
Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face
The kind you'd find on someone that could save
If they don't put me away
Well, it'll be a miracle
Do you believe you're missing out
And everything good is happenin' somewhere else?
But with nobody in your bed
The night's hard to get through
And I will die all alone
And when I arrive, I won't know anyone
Well, Jesus Christ, I'm alone again
So what did you do those three days you were dead?
'Cause this problem's gonna last
More than the weekend
Well, Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die
I'm a little bit scared of what comes after
Do I get the gold chariot?
Do I float through the ceiling?
Do I divide and pull apart?
'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark
And this ship went down in sight of land
And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands?
I know you'll come in the night like a thief
(I know this song)
But I've had some time alone, to hone my lying technique
(Breathe Eve, save that one)
I know you think that I'm someone you can trust
(Eve, you're wrong, love)
But I'm scared I'll get scared, and I swear I'll try to never give up
(Everyone now)
So do you think that we could work out a sign?
So I'll know it's you and that it's over, so I won't even try
(They're all on file)
I know you're coming for the people like me
(One two three)
But we all got wood and nails
We tore down that hatin' factory
Yeah, we all got wood and nails
We tore down that hatin' factory
Yeah, we all got wood and nails
And we sleep inside of this machine
(Sorry)
Let it die, and get out of my mind;
We don't see eye to eye, or hear ear to ear...
Don't you wish that we could forget that kiss
And see this for what it is? 
That we're not in love...
The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start...
It was hard to tell just how I felt,
To not recognize myself...
I started to fade (away... away... away...)
And after all, it won't take long to fall (in love...)
Now I know what I don't want;
I learned that with you...
The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start...
The tragedy starts from the very first spark;
Losing your mind for the sake of your heart...
The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start...
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
I see my vision burn, I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
These streets we travel on will undergo our same lost past
I found you here, now please just stay for a while
I can move on with you around
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
I'd do anything for a smile, holding you till our time is done
We both know the day will come, but I don't want to leave you
I see my vision burn, I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
(A melody, a memory, or just one picture)
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
Newborn life replacing all of us, changing this fable we live in
No longer needed here so where do we go?
Will you take a journey tonight, follow me past the walls of death?
But girl, what if there is no eternal life?
I see my vision burn, I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
(A melody, a memory, or just one picture)
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
Its empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real
So, what if I never hold you, yeah, or kiss your lips again? Whoa
So I never want to leave you and the memories of us to see
I beg don't leave me
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
Its empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real
(Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day)
(Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day)
I stand here alone
Falling away from you, no chance to get back home
I stand here alone
Falling away from you, no chance to get back home
Ten times removed, I forget about where it all began
Bastard son of a bastard son of a wild eyed child of the sun
And right as rain, I'm not the same but I feel the same, I feel nothing
Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends
I forget to forget, nothing is important
Holding back the fool again
I sensed my loss before I even learned to talk
And I remember my birthdays
Empty party afternoons won't come back
Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends
I forget to forget, nothing is important
Holding back the fool again
I forget to forget me
I forget to forget, you see
Nothing is important to me
I knew my loss before I even learned to speak
And all along I knew it was wrong
But I played along with my birthday song
Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends
I forget to forget, nothing is important
Holding back the fool again
I sucked the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost?
I was dropped from
Moonbeams
And sailed on shooting stars
Maybe you'll
Be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood
You'll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line 
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find 
While I recall all the words you spoke to me 
Can't help but wish that I was there 
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah 
Dear God the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away 
We all need that person 
Who can be true to you 
But I left her when I found her 
And now I wish I'd stayed 
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired 
I'm missing you again, oh no 
Once again 
There's nothing here for me 
On this barren road 
There's no one here 
While the city sleeps 
And all the shops are closed 
Can't help but think of 
The times I've had with you 
Pictures and some memories 
Will have to help me through
Oh yeah 
Dear God the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need that person
Who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again, oh no
Once again
Some search, never finding a way
Before long, they waste away
I found you, something told me to stay
I gave in, to selfish ways
And how I miss someone to hold
When hope begins to fade
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find
Dear God the only thing I ask of you
Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away
We all need the person
Who can be true to you
I left her when I found her
And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again, oh no
Once again
Last night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm
Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm
So tell me how long
Before the last one?
And tell me how long
Before the right one?
This story is old
I know, but it goes on
This story is old
I know, but it goes on
It goes on
It's over
You don't have to tell me
I hope you're with someone
Who makes you feel safe in your sleep
Being tonight
I won't kill myself trying to stay in your life
I got no distance left to run
When you see me
Please turn your back and walk away
I don't want to see you
'Cause I know the dreams that you keep
That's where we meet
When you're coming down think of me
I got no distance left to run
It's over
I knew it would end this way
I hope you're with someone
Who makes you feel that this life is a life
One that settles down stays around
Spends more time with you
I got no distance left to run
I'm coming home
So cold
Home
Leave me dreaming on the bed
See you right back here tomorrow for the next round
Keep this scene inside your head
As the bruises turn to yellow
The swelling goes down
And if you're ever around
In the city or the suburbs of this town
Be sure to come around
I'll be wallowing in sorrow
Wearing a frown
Like Pierrot the Clown
Saw you crashing round the bay
Never seen you act so shallow
Or look so brown
Remember all the things you'd say
How your promises rang hollow
As you threw me to the ground
And if you're ever around
In the backstreets or the alleys of this town
Be sure to come around
I'll be wallowing in pity
And wearing a frown
Like Pierrot the Clown
When I dream I dream of your lips
When I dream I dream of your kiss
When I dream I dream of your fists
Your fists... Your fists
Leave me bleeding on the bed
See you right back here tomorrow for the next round
Keep this scene inside your head
As the bruises turn to yellow
The swelling goes down
And if you're ever around
In the city or the suburbs of this town
Be sure to come around
I'll be wallowing in sorrow
And wearing a frown
Like Pierrot the Clown
Like Pierrot the Clown
Like Pierrot the Clown
Like Pierrot the Clown
Like Pierrot the Clown
Wish I were with you, but I couldn't stay
Every direction leads me away
Pray for tomorrow, but for today
All I want
Is to be home
Stand in the mirror, you look the same
Just looking for shelter from the cold and the pain
Someone to cover, safe from the rain
And all I want
Is to be home
The echoes and silence, patience and grace
All of these moments I'll never replace
No fear of my heart, absence of faith
All I want
Is to be home
People I've loved, I have no regrets
Some I remember, some I forget
Some of them living, some of them dead
All I want
Is to be home.
I had a feeling once
That you and I
Could tell each other everything
For two months
But even without hope
With truth on our side
When you turn away from me
It's not right
I think you're a Contra
I think you're a Contra
I think you're a Contra
I think you're a Contra
My revolution thoughts
Your little lies of desire
I wanna trace 'em to the source
And the wire
But it's not useful now
Since we both made up our minds
You're gonna watch out for yourself
And so will I
I think you're a Contra
I think that you lie
Don't call me a Contra
'Til you've tried
You wanted good schools and friends with pools
You're not a Contra
You wanted rock 'n' roll, complete control
Well, I don't know
Never pick sides, never choose between two
But I just wanted you, I just wanted you
Said, "Never pick sides, never choose between two"
But I just wanted you, I just wanted you
I think you're a Contra
I think that you lie
Don't call me a Contra
'Til you've tried
It's like forgetting the words to your favorite song
You can't believe it, you were always singing along
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember, you try to feel the beat
Eet, eet eet
Eet, eet eet
You spend half of your life trying to fall behind
You're using your headphones to drown out your mind
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember, you try to move your feet
Eet, eet eet
Eet, eet eet
Someone's deciding whether or not to steal
He opens a window just to feel the chill
He hears that outside, a small boy just started to cry
'Cause it's his turn but his brother won't let him try
It's like forgetting the words to your favorite song
You can't believe it, you were always singing along
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember, you try to move your feet
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember, you try to feel the beat-t-t-t-t-t-t
Summer in the city
Means cleavage, cleavage, cleavage
And I start to miss you
Baby, sometimes
I've been staying up and
Drinking in the late night establishment
Telling strangers
Personal things
Summer in the city
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely
So I went
To a protest
Just to rub up
Against strangers
And I did feel like coming, but I also felt like crying
It doesn't seem so
Worth it right now
And the castrated ones
Stand in the corner, smoking
They want to feel the bulges in their pants start to rise
At the sight of a beautiful woman, they feel nothing but
But anger, her skin makes them sick in the night
Nauseous, nauseous, nauseous
Summer in the city
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely
I've been hallucinating you, babe
At the backs of other women
And I tap
On their shoulder
And they turn around, smiling, but
There's no recognition in their eyes
Oh, summer in the city
Means cleavage, cleavage, cleavage
And don't get me wrong, dear
In general, I
Think I'm doing quite
Fine
It's just, when it's summer in the city, and you're
Long gone from the city
I start to miss you
Baby, sometimes
When it's summer in the city
And you're, you're so long gone from the city
I start to miss you
Baby, sometimes
Ooh
I start to miss you
Baby, sometimes
Ooh, I
Start to miss you
Baby
Sometimes
This vacation's useless, these white pills aren't kind
I've given a lot of thought on this 13 hour drive
I miss the grinded concrete where we sat past 8 or 9
And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
I've given a lot of thought to the nights we used to have
The days have come and gone, our lives went by so fast
I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
Where I laid and told you but you swear you loved me more
Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me?
Will I shake this off, pretend it's all okay?
That there's someone out there who feels just like me?
There is
Those notes you wrote me, I've kept them all
I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall
With every single letter, in every single word
There will be a hidden message about a boy that loves a girl
Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me?
Will I shake this off, pretend it's all okay?
That there's someone out there who feels just like me?
There is
Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight, will you think of me?
Will I shake this off, pretend it's all okay?
That there's someone out there who feels just like me?
Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight, will you think of me?
Will I shake this off, pretend it's all okay?
That there's someone out there who feels just like me?
There is
Put your hands on the wheel
Let the golden age begin
Let the window down
Feel the moonlight on your skin
Desert wind
Cool your aching head
The weight of the world
Drift away instead
Oh (ooh)
These days I barely get by
I don't even try
It's a treacherous road
With a desolated view
There's distant lights
But here they're far and few
(Ooh) The sun don't shine
Even when it's day
(Ooh) You gotta drive all night
Just to feel like you're okay
Oh (ooh)
These days I barely get by
I don't even try
I don't even try
Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done
The brightest flame burns quickest."
That's what I heard her say
A son's heart's sewed to mother
But I must find my way
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Yeah, still
Rebel, my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what I said is done
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
Yeah, I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah, yeah
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Oh-whoa
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Cheers darlin'
Here's to you and your lover boy
Cheers darlin'
I got years to wait around for you
Cheers darlin'
I've got your wedding bells in my ear
Cheers darlin'
You give me three cigarettes 
To smoke my tears away
And I die when you mention his name
And I lied, I should have kissed you
When we were running in the rains
What am I, darlin'?
A whisper in your ear?
A piece of your cake?
What am I, darlin'?
The boy you can fear?
Or your biggest mistake?
Cheers darlin'
Here's to you and your lover man
Cheers darlin'
I just hang around and eat from a can
Cheers darlin'
I got a ribbon of green on my guitar
Cheers darlin'
I got a beauty queen
To sit not very far from here
I die when he comes around
To take you home
I'm too shy, I should have kissed you 
When we were alone
What am I, darlin'?
A whisper in your ear?
A piece of your cake?
What am I, darlin'?
The boy you can fear?
Or your biggest mistake?
What am I?
What am I, darlin'?
I got years to wait around for you
Never thought you'd make me perspire. Never thought I'd do you the same
Never thought I'd fill with desire. Never thought I'd feel so ashamed
Me and the dragon can chase all the pain away
So before I end my day. Remember
My sweet prince, you are the one. My sweet prince, you are the one
Never thought I'd have to retire. Never thought I'd have to abstain
Never thought all this could backfire. Close up the hole in my vein
Me and my valuable friend can fix all the pain away
So before I end my day, remember
My sweet prince, you are the one. My sweet prince, you are the one
You are the one. You are the one. You are the one. You are the one
Never thought I'd get any higher. Never thought you'd fuck with my brain
Never thought all this could expire. Never thought you'd go break the chain
Me and you baby used to flush all the pain away
So before I end my day, remember
My sweet prince, you are the one. My sweet prince, you are the one
You are the one. You are the one. You are the one. You are the one
You are the one. You are the one. You are the one. You are the one
My sweet prince. My sweet prince
Waking up I see that everything is okay
The first time in my life and now it's so great
Slowing down I look around and I am so amazed
I think about the little things that make life great
I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling
This innocence is brilliance
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
I found a place so safe, not a single tear
The first time in my life and now it's so clear
Feel calm, I belong, I'm so happy here
It's so strong and now I let myself be sincere
I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling
This innocence is brilliance
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful it makes you want to cry
It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful it makes you want to cry
It's so beautiful it makes you want to cry
This innocence is brilliant (it makes you want to cry)
This innocence is brilliant
Please don't go away
'Cause I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by (it's so beautiful it makes you want to cry)
This innocence is brilliant (it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful)
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now (it makes me want to cry)
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
I don't mind where you come from, as long as you come to me
But I don't like illusions, I can't see, them clearly
I don't care no I wouldn't dare, to fix the twist in you
You've shown me eventually, what you'll do
I don't mind, I don't care
As long as you're here
Go ahead tell me you'll leave again, you'll just come back runnin'
Holdin' your scarred heart in hand, it's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are, if you take me for everything
Do it all over again, it's all the same
Hours slide and days go by, till you decide to come
However long you stay, is all that I am
I don't mind, I don't care
As long as you're here
Go ahead tell me you'll leave again, you'll just come back runnin'
Holdin' your scarred heart in hand, it's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are, if you take me for everything
Do it all over again, it's always the same
Go ahead say it, you're leavin', you'll just come back runnin'
Holdin' your scarred heart in hand, it's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are, if you take me for everything
Do it all over again, it's all the same
As heard in some live (non-album) versions
Verse 2:
Hours slide and days go by, till you decide to come
And in between it always seems too long (All of a sudden)
And I have the skill yeah I have the will, to breathe you in while I can
However long you stay, is all that I am
Verse 3:
Wrong or right, black or white
If I close my eyes, it's all the same
In my life, the compromise
I close my eyes, it's all the same
I remember it well, the first time that I saw
Your head 'round the door 
'Cause mine stopped working
I remember it well, there was wet in your hair
I was stood in the stair 
And time stopped moving
I want you here tonight, I want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
I want you here tonight, want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down
I remember it well, taxied out of the storm
To watch you perform 
And my ships were sailing
I remember it well, I was stood in your line
And your mouth, your mouth, your mind
Want you here tonight, want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
I want you here tonight, want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down
'Cept you my love
'Cept you my love
Come all ye lost
Dive into moss 
And hope that my sanity covers the cost
To remove the stain of my love
Paper maché
Come all ye reborn
Blow off my horn
I'm driving real hard
This is love, this is porn
God would forgive me
But I, I whip myself scorn, scorn
And I wanna hear what you have to say about me
Hear if you're gonna live without me
I wanna hear what you want
I remember December
And I wanna hear what you have to say about me
Hear if you're gonna live without me
I wanna hear what you want
What the hell do you want?
Hope there's someone
Who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?
Hope there's someone
Who'll set my heart free
Nice to hold when I'm tired
There's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed
How can I fall asleep at night?
How will I rest my head?
Oh I'm scared of the middle place
Between light and nowhere
I don't want to be the one
Left in there, left in there
There's a man on the horizon
Wish that I'd go to bed
If I fall to his feet tonight
Will allow rest my head?
So here's hoping I will not drown
Or paralyze in light
And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed
Hope there's someone
Who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?
Hope there's someone
Who'll set my heart free
Nice to hold when I'm tired
Please don't go crazy if I tell you the truth
No, you don't know what happened and you never will
If you don't listen to me while I talk to the wall
This blanket is freezing, it's been out in the hall
Where you've had me for hours 'til I'm sure what I want
But darling, I want the same thing that I wanted before
So sweetheart, tell me what's up, I won't stop
No way
Please keep your hands down, and stop raising your voice
It's hardly what I'd be doing if you gave me a choice
It's a simple suggestion, can you give me some time?
So just say yes or no, why can't you shoulder the blame?
'Cause both my shoulders are heavy from the weight of us both
You're a big boy now, so let's not talk about growth
You've not heard a single word I have said...
Oh, my god
Please take it easy it can't all be my fault
I haven't made half the mistakes that you've listed so far
Baby, let me explain something, it's all down to drugs
At least I remember taking them and not a lot else
It seems I've stepped over lines you've drawn again and again
But if the ecsasty's in, the wit is definitely out
Dr. Jekyll is wrestlin' Hyde for my pride
I have seen peace
I have seen pain
Resting on the shoulders
Of your name
Do you see the truth
Through all their lies
Do you see the world
Through troubled eyes
And if you want to
Talk about it anymore
Lie here on the floor
And cry on my shoulder
I'm a friend
I have seen birth
I have seen death
Lived to see a lovers
Final breath
Do you see my guilt
Should I feel fright
Is the fire of hesitation
Burning bright
And if you want to
Talk about it once again
On you I depend
I'll cry on your shoulder
You're a friend
You and I have been through many things
I'll hold on to your heart
I wouldn't cry for anything
But don't go tearing your life apart
I have seen fear
I have seen faith
Seen the look of anger
On your face
And if you want to
Talk about what will be
Come and sit with me
And cry on my shoulder
I'm a friend
And if you want to
Talk about it anymore
Lie here on the floor
And cry on my shoulder
Once again
Cry on my shoulder
I'm a friend
It's the disease of the age
It's the disease that we crave
Alone at the end of the rave
We catch the last bus home
Corporate America wakes
Coffee republic and cakes
We open the latch on the gate
Of the hole that we call our home
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Protect me protect me
Maybe we're victims of fate
Remember when we'd celebrate
We'd drink and get high until late
And now we're all alone
Wedding bells ain't gonna chime
With both of us guilty of crime
And both of us sentenced to time
And now we're all alone
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Protect me protect me
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Protect me protect me
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Protect me protect me
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Protect me protect me
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Protect me protect me
Album version
I still recall the taste of your tears
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head till I don't wanna sleep anymore
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
This thing is slowly taking me apart
Gray would be the color if I had a heart
Come on and tell me
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
In this place it seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same
Everywhere I look you're all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be
Come on and tell me
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go way
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
I just want something I can never have
Still
I still recall the taste of your tears
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head 'til I don't want to sleep anymore
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
This thing is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color if I had a heart
Come on tell me
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
In this place it seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now

Everywhere I look you're all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be
Come on tell me

Natural Born Killers
Let me tell you something; this is the 1990's. Alright?
In this day and age, a man has to have choices
A man has to have a little bit of variety
What are you talking about, variety? Hostages?
You want to fuck some other women, now?
Is that what you're talking about, Mickey?
Why'd you pick me up?
Why'd you take me out of my fucking house and kill my parents with me?
Ain't you committed to me?
Where are we fucking going?
Just relax, alright?
It's me, your lover
Not some demon, not your father
Alright, relax
No, you're not my fucking lover
You're not my fucking
You've been loving me?
You've been fucking loving me? Huh?
You've been loving me real...
I still recall the taste of your tears
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head 'til I don't want to sleep anymore
You make this all go away, you make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing, I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away, you make this all go away
I just want something, I just want something I can never have
It's been a long, long, long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you?
It took a long, long, long time
Now, I'm so happy I found you
How I love you
So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh, oh
Now I can see you, be you
How can I ever misplace you?
How I want you
Oh, I love you
You know that I need you
Oh, I love you
Oh
I don't know you
But I want you
All the more for that
Words fall through me
And always fool me
And I can't react
And games that never amount
To more than they're meant
Will play themselves out
Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice
You've made it now
Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I can't go back
And moods that take me and erase me
And I'm painted black
Well you have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won
Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice
You've made it now
Falling slowly sing your melody
I'll sing along
I played my cards too late
Now you're gone
I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast
Is taking me home
I'm cuddling close
To blankets and sheets
But you're not alone, and you're not discreet
Make sure I know who's taking you home
I'm reading your note over again
And there's not a word that I comprehend
Except when you signed it
I will love you always and forever
Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere, with anyone
Making out
I'm missing your laugh
How did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you're pretending
I'm cuddling close
To blankets and sheets
And I am alone
In my defeat
I wish I knew you were safely at home
I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast is taking me home
Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere, with anyone
Making out
Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear
Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear
Your hair is everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear
Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear
I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth
Went over the sea,
What did I find?
A thousand crystal towers
A hundred emerald cities
And the hand of the watchman
In the night sky
Points to my beloved
A knight in crystal armour??
And I tried to hold him
I tried for the cream
I?�ll make a suit of colours
To stop the blinding mirrors
Sew a cape of rainbow
Stifle up the beam
With the perfect armour
With the perfect dream??
To be made of glass!
When two suns are shining
The battle becomes blinding
To be made of glass!
But we?�re light and light and light
and light and light!
And from two suns spinning
At two different speeds
Was born a hot white diamond
Burning through the rainbow
Flames fell into orbit
To hold eternally
Two heavenly spirits
That just wouldn?�t see
To be made of glass!
When two suns are shining
The battle becomes blinding
To be made of glass!
But we?�re light and light and light
and light and light!
Hey, oh
Hey, oh oh oh
Hey, oh
Hey, oh oh oh
Hey, oh
Hey oh oh oh
Darling stop confusing me
With your wishful thinking
Hopeful embraces
Don't you understand?
I have to go through this
I belong to here where no-one cares and no-one loves
No light no air to live in
A place called hate
The city of death
I play dead
It stops the hurting
I play dead
And the hurt stops
It's sometimes just like sleeping
Curling up inside my private tortures
I nestle into pain
Hug suffering
Caress every ache
I play dead
It stops the hurting
Lost again, broken and weary
Unable to find my way
Tail in hand, dizzy and clearly
Unable to just let this go
I am surrendering
To gravity and the unknown
Catch me, heal me
Lift me back up to the sun
I choose to live
I fell again like a baby
Unable to stand on my own
Tail in hand, dizzy and clearly
Unable to just let this go
I am surrendering
To gravity and the unknown
Catch me, heal me
Lift me back up to the sun
I choose to live
I choose to live
I choose to live
Catch me, heal me
Lift me back up to the sun
Help me survive the bottom
Calm these hands before they
Snare another pill and
Drive another nail down
Another needy hole
Please, release me
I am surrendering
To gravity and the unknown
Catch me, heal me
Lift me back up to the sun
I choose to live
I choose to live
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel, comes out, just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth, all this time, 'cause I honestly believed in, you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should have known, I should have known
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around
Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes, and never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love, you had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around
And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted, but I'm so sorry
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday, who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Try and catch me now oh-oh
It's too late, to catch me now
I open my eyes 
I try to see but I'm blinded by the white light 
I can't remember how 
I can't remember why 
I'm lying here tonight 
And I can't stand the pain 
And I can't make it go away 
No I can't stand the pain 
How could this happen to me 
I've made my mistakes 
I've got no where to run 
The night goes on 
As I'm fading away 
I'm sick of this life 
I just wanna scream 
How could this happen to me 
Everybody's screaming 
I try to make a sound but no one hears me 
I'm slipping off the edge 
I'm hanging by a thread 
I wanna start this over again 
So I try to hold onto a time when nothing mattered 
And I can't explain what happened 
And I can't erase the things that I've done 
No I can't 
How could this happen to me 
I've made my mistakes 
I've got no where to run 
The night goes on 
As I'm fading away 
I'm sick of this life 
I just wanna scream 
How could this happen to me 
I've made my mistakes 
I've got no where to run 
The night goes on 
As I'm fading away 
I'm sick of this life 
I just wanna scream 
How could this happen to me
The best thing about life is knowing you should be here
The best thing about life is knowing you should be here
The best thing about life is knowing you should be here
The best thing about life is knowing you should be here
The best thing about life is knowing you should be here
The best thing about life is knowing you should be here
Cocaine flame in my bloodstream
Sold my coat when I hit Spokane
Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes
In the early morning rain
Lately my hands, they don't feel like mine
My eyes been stung with dust, I'm blind
Held you in my arms one time
Lost you just the same
Jolene
I ain't about to go straight
It's too late
I found myself face down in the ditch
Booze in my hair, blood on my lips
A picture of you, holding a picture of me
In the pocket of my blue jeans
Still don't know what love means
Still don't know what love means
Jolene
Ah, la, la, la, la, la
Jolene
Been so long since I seen your face
Or felt a part of this human race
I've been living out of this here
Suitcase for way too long
A man needs something he can hold onto
A nine pound hammer or a woman like you
Either one of them things will do
Jolene
I ain't about to go straight
It's too late
I found myself face down in the ditch
Booze in my hair, blood on my lips
A picture of you holding a picture of me
In the pocket of my blue jeans
Still don't know what love means
Still don't know what love means
Jolene
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Jolene
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Jolene
How cruel is the golden rule? 
When the lives we lived are only golden-plated 
And I knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for me 
Though I carried karats for everyone to see 
And I saw God cry in the reflection of my enemies 
And all the lovers with no time for me 
And all of the mothers raise their babies 
To stay away from me 
Tongues on the sockets of electric dreams 
Where the sewage of youth drown the spark of my teens 
And I knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for me (Too heavy for me) 
Though I carried karats for everyone to see 
(Everyone to see) 
And I saw God cry in the reflection of my enemies 
And all the lovers with no time for me 
And all of the mothers raise their babies 
To stay away from me 
And pray they don't grow up to be
So we're alone again 
I wish it were over 
We seem to never end 
Only get closer 
To the point where I can take no more 
The clouds in your eyes 
Down your face they pour 
Won't you be the new one? Burn to shine 
I take the blue ones every time 
Walk me down your broken line 
All you have to do is cry 
Yes, all you have to do is cry 
Hush, my baby, now 
Your talking is just noise and won't lay me down 
Amongst your toys in a room where I can take no more 
The clouds in your eyes 
Down your face they pour 
Won't you be the new one? Burn to shine 
I take the blue ones every time 
Walk me down your broken line 
All you have to do is cry 
Yes all you have to do is cry 
Photographs and brightly colored paper 
Are your mask you wear in this caper 
That is our life 
We walk right into the strife 
And a tear from your eye brings me home 
Won't you be the new one? Burn to shine 
I take the blue ones every time 
Walk me down your broken line 
All you have to do is cry
In the morning I awake and I couldn't remember
What is love and what is hate, the calculations error
Oh-oh-oh-oh... What is love and what is hate?
And why does it matter? Is to love just a waste?
And how can it matter? Oh-oh-oh-oh... Oh-oh-oh-oh...
As the dawn began to break, I had to surrender
The universe will have it's way, too powerful to master
Oh-oh-oh-oh... What is love and what is hate?
And why does it matter? Is to love just a waste?
And how can it matter? Oh-oh-oh-oh...

I have called you children, I have called you son
What is there to answer if I'm the only one?
Morning comes in Paradise, morning comes in light
Still I must obey, still I must invite
If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do
If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you
I was dressed embarrassment
I was dressed in wine
If you had a part of me, will you take your time?
Even if I come back, even if I die
Is there some idea to replace my life?
Like a father to impress
Like a mother's mourning dress
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you
I have called you preacher, I have called you son
If you have a father or if you haven't one
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
Is it cruel or kind not to speak my mind
And to lie to you, rather than hurt you?
Well, I'll confess all of my sins after several large gins
But still I'll hide from you, hide what's inside from you
And alarm bells ring when you say your heart still sings
When you're with me, oh, won't you please forgive me
I no longer hear the music
Oh no, no, no, no, no
And all the memories of the pubs, and the clubs, and the drugs, and the tubs
We shared together, they'll stay with me forever
But all the highs, and the lows, and the to's, and the fro's
They left me dizzy, oh, won't you please forgive me
I no longer hear the music
Oh no, no, no, no
Well, I no longer hear the Music when the lights go out
Love goes cold in the shades of doubt
The strange face in my mind is all too clear
Music when the lights come on
The girl I thought I knew has gone
And with her my heart, it disappeared
Well, I no longer hear the music
Oh no, no, no
All the memories of the fights and nights under blue lights, all the kites
We flew together, love thought they'll fly forever
But all the highs, and the lows, and the to's, and the fro's
They left me dizzy, Won't you forgive me
I no longer hear the music
I no longer hear the music
I no longer hear the music when the lights go out
Love goes cold in the shades of doubt
The strange face in my mind is all too clear
Music when the lights come on
The girl I thought I knew has gone
And with her my heart, it disappeared
I no longer hear the music
Oh no, no
I no longer hear the music
Lady sing the blues so well
As if she mean it
As if it's hell down here
In the smoke-filled world
Where the jokes are cold
They don't laugh at jokes
They laugh at tragedies
Corner street societies
But they believe her
They never leave her
While she sings she make them feel things
She says, I can sing this song so blue
That you will cry in spite of you
Little wet tears on your baby's shoulder
Little wet tears on your baby's shoulder
And I have walked these streets so long
There ain't nothing right, there ain't nothing wrong
But the little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
The little wet tears on your baby's shoulder
Lady lights a cigarette, puffs away, no regret
Takes a look around, no regrets, no regrets
Stretches out like branches of a poplar tree
She says, I'm free
Sings so soft as if she'll break, says
I can sing this song so blue
That you will cry in spite of you
Little wet tears on your baby's shoulder
Little wet tears on your baby's shoulder
I have walked these streets so long
There ain't nothing right, nothing wrong
But the little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
The little wet tears on your baby's shoulder
But on this stage
I've learned to fly
Learned to sing
And learned to cry
Little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
Little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
But now it's time
To say goodbye
Some might laugh
But I will surely cry
Little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
Little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
Lady lights a cigarette
Puffs away, and winter comes
And she forgets
Trouble is her only friend
And he's back again
Makes her body older than it really is
And she says it's high time she went away
No one's got much to say in this town
Trouble is the only way is down, down, down
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
For the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
If she had wings she would fly away
And another day God will give her some
Trouble is the only way is down, down, down
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
For the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
And they were all born pretty in New York City tonight
And someone's little girl is taken from the world tonight
Under the stars and stripes
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
For the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
As strong as you were
Tender you go
I'm watching you breathing
For the last time
A song for your heart
But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do
It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder: getting up, getting dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do
(Not seeing that loving you)
That's what I was tryin' to do
Hold onto love
That is what I do
Now that I've found you
And from above
Everything's stinking
They're not around you
And in the night
I could be helpless
I could be lonely
Sleeping without you
And in the day
Everything's complex
There's nothing simple
When I'm not around you
But I miss you when you're gone
That is what I do
Hey, baby
And it's going to carry on
That is what I knew
Hey, baby
Hold onto my hands
I feel I'm sinking
Sinking without you
And to my mind
Everything's stinking
Stinking without you
And in the night
I could be helpless
I could be lonely
Sleeping without you
And in the day
Everything's complex
There's nothing simple
When I'm not around you
But I miss you when you're gone
That is what I do
Hey, baby
And it's going to carry on
That is what I knew
Hey, baby
Hey, baby
Hey, baby
I will lay me down
In a bunker underground
I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants, sitting ducks
I will rise up
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes
Ooh
Every time the day darkens down and goes away pictures open in my head of me and you
Silent and cliché, all the things we did and didn't say covered up by what we did and didn't do
Going through every out I used to cop to make the repetition stop. What was I supposed to say?
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Now I never leave my zone, we're both alone, I'm going home
I wish I'd never seen your face
In the tower above the earth, 
There is a view that reaches far 
Where we see the universe, 
I see the fire, I see the end. 
Seven miles above the earth, 
There is Emmanuel of mothers. 
With his sword, with his robe, 
He comes dividing man from brothers. 
In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel. 
In the powers of the earth, we wait until it rips and rips. 
In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel. 
Oh my mother, she betrayed us, but my father loved and bathed us. 
Still I go to the deepest grave, 
Where I go to sleep alone
I swear that I can go on forever again
Please let me know that my one bad day will end
I will go down as your lover, your friend
Give me your lips and with one kiss we begin
Are you afraid of being alone
'Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
'Cause I am, I'm lost without you
I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you
I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
Where are you now I can hear footsteps I'm dreaming
And if you will, keep me from waking to believe this
Are you afraid of being alone
'Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
'Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of being alone
'Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
'Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of being alone
'Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
'Cause I am, I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
I am wasted, losing time
I'm a foolish, fragile spine
I want all that is not mine
I want him but we're not right
In the darkness I will meet my creators
And they will all agree, that I'm a suffocator
I should go now quietly
For my bones have found a place to lie down and sleep
Where all my layers can become reeds
All my limbs can become trees
All my children can become me
What a mess I leave
To follow
To follow
To follow
To follow
In the darkness I will meet my creators
They will all agree, I'm a suffocator
Suffocator
Suffocator
Oh no
I'm sorry if I smothered you
I'm sorry if I smothered you
I sometimes wish I'd stayed inside
My mother
Never to come out
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
She said, "Some days I feel like shit"
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long
And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home
Come back home, you know the place where you used to live
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once and a while
Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
I came down over the sleepy mountains where
Our wide toes plunged into the weeping shale to tear
Our skin up off from the bottom, leaves our ankles bare
Don't just wander back and forth and leave it
Build it into pinnacles and shrines of some
Some ghastly predicament of mine you'll find
Leaves us plastered to a bed of hairs
With me all coiled up near the bottom with my chest unbearded
Oh but dear the sky is low
Gather up its harm in gauze with grateful arms
Oh but dear the sky is low
Gather up its harm in gauze with grateful arms
Oh but dear the sky is low
Watch fluent sea men rig their rudders so they'll
Graze it with their wind arrows
Tis in the fathoms that they brush below
Oh my dreams come back to me, back to me, back to
All my wrinkles, build on me, build on me, build on
Oh but dear the sky is low
Gather up its harm in gauze with grateful arms
Oh but dear the sky is low
Gather up its harm in gauze with grateful arms
Drag him out your window, dragging out the dead
Singing "I miss you", snakes and ladders
Flip the lid, out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck, kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps, takes all your credit cards
Get up, get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face
Take it with the love it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the tax man
Let me back
Let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
Walking like giant cranes
And with my X-ray eyes I strip you naked
In a tight little world
And are you on the list?
Stepford wives, who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers
Investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers
City boys in first class don't know they're born little
Someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job, someone always does
I wish you'd get up, get over
Get up, get over
Turn your tape off
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
So I'm just going oh
When you walk without ease on these
Streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
It lasted twenty years, seven months and twenty-seven days
And I never, ever
Had no one ever
Now I'm outside your house
I'm alone
And I'm outside your house
I'd hate to intrude
Oh, I'm alone
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
And I never, never, oh
Had no one ever
I never had no one ever
I never had no, no one ever
Had no one never
Never
No
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back
I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had
You're all I had
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself talking to the moon.
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too.
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh oh oh
I'm feeling like I'm famous
The talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back
Oh
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself talking to the moon.
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too.
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Ah, ah, ah
Do you ever hear me calling?
(Ah, ah, ah)
Oh oh oh oh oh
'Cause every night I'm talking to the moon
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh oh oh
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
He used to call me D.N.
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back
Reminded me of when we were kids
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence
He used to call me poison
Like I was poison ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up
He hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that
Loving him was never enough
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence
We could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on earth
I would do anything for you, babe
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold-like lemonade
I love you the first time
I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa
Comprende mis white lines
'Cause I'm your jazz singer
And you're my cult leader
I love you forever
I love you forever
With his ultraviolence (Lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (In my linen and curls)
Ultraviolence (Lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (Riviera girls)
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence
You could see me reaching
So why couldn't you have met me halfway
You could see me bleeding
But you could not put pressure on the wound
You only think about yourself
You only think about yourself
You'd better bend before I go
On the first train to Mexico
You could see me breathing
But you still kept your hand over my mouth
You could feel me seething
But you just turned your nose up in the air, oh
You only think about yourself
You only think about yourself
You'd better bend before I go
On the first train to Mexico, ooh
You only think about yourself
You only think about yourself
You'd better bend before I go
On the first train to Mexico
(1, 2, 3, 4)
I'm going away for a while
But I'll be back, don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible
You see I'm trying to find my place
But it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes
And run from them, from them with no direction
Run from them, from them with no conviction
'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Traveling endlessly
Don't need no roads
In fact, they follow me
And we just go in circles
But now I'm told that this is life
And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it
Will someone care to classify
A broken heart and twisted minds?
So I can find someone to rely on
And run to them, to them, full speed ahead
Oh, you are not useless, we are just
Misguided ghosts
Traveling endlessly
The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away
And there's no one road
And we should not be the same
But I'm just a ghost
And still they echo me
They echo me in circles
Rick James:
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya
Rick James and James Brown:
Look at ya, look at ya (Ladies and gentlemen)
Look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya (Ladies and gentlemen)
Kanye West:
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs, that'll never take work off
Baby I got a plan, run away fast as you can
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at
And I always find, yeah I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs, that'll never take work off
Baby I got a plan, run away fast as you can
Kanye West and Rick James:
Run away from me baby, run away
Run away from me baby, run away (Look at ya)
Man I'm 'bout to get crazy, just run away
This is my plan, run away as fast as you can
Run away from me baby, run away
Run away from me baby, run away (Look at ya)
Man I'm 'bout to get crazy, why can't she just, run away? (Look at ya)
Baby I got a plan, run away as fast as you can
Pusha T:
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I, I, I, I did it, all right, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P
Kanye West:
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
'Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'mma manage
If one day you just up and leave
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs, that'll never take work off
Baby I got a plan, run away fast as you can
Cue the pianos
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most

You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Over here
Come slowly
Come slowly to me
I've been waiting
Patient
Patiently
I didn't get it 
But now I can see
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
There are children standing here
Arms outstretched into the sky
Tears drying on their face
He has been here
Brothers lie in shallow graves
Fathers lost without a trace
A nation blind to their disgrace
Since he has been here
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
Only sadness
Houses burnt beyond repair
The smell of death is in the air
A woman weeping in despair says
He has been here
Tracer lighting up the sky
It's another family's turn to die
A child afraid to even cry out says
He has been here
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
There are children standing here
Arms outstretched into the sky
But no one asks the question why
He has been here
Old men kneel to accept their fate
Wives and daughters cut and raped
A generation drenched in hate says
He has been here
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
And I see no bravery, no bravery
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
Only sadness
And it's all in how you mix the two 
And it starts just where the light exists 
It's a feeling that you cannot miss 
And it burns a hole 
Through everyone that feels it 
Well, you're never gonna find it 
If you're looking for it 
Won't come your way, yeah 
Well, you'll never find it 
If you're looking for it 
Should've done something
But I've done it enough
By the way your hands were shaking
Rather waste some time with you
And you never would have thought in the end
How amazing it feels just to live again
It's a feeling that you cannot miss
It burns a hole through everyone that feels it
Well, you're never gonna find it
If you're looking for it
Won't come your way, yeah
Well, you'll never find it
If you're looking for it (looking for it)
Should've done something
But I've done it enough
By the way your hands were shaking
Rather waste some time with you
Should've said something 
But I've said it enough 
By the way my words were fading 
Rather waste some time with you (time with you)
(Waste some time with you)
Should've done something 
But I've done it enough 
By the way your hands were shaking 
Rather waste my time with you 
Should've said something 
But I've said it enough 
By the way my words were fading
Rather waste my time with you 
Should've done something
But I've done it enough
By the way my hands were shaking
Rather waste some time with you
(Waste some time with you)
Waste some time with you
Losing the star without a sky
Losing the reasons why
You're losing the calling that you've been faking
And I'm not kidding
It's damned if you don't and it's damned if you do
Be true, 'cause they'll lock you up in a sad, sad zoo
Oh, hidy-hidy-hiding, whatcha trying to prove?
By hidy-hidy-hiding
You're not worth a thing
Sew your fortunes on a string
And hold them up to the light
Blue smoke will take
A very violent flight
And you will be changed and everything
And you will be
In a very sad, sad zoo
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see you
How selfish of you
To believe in all the meaning of all the bad dreaming
Metal heart, you're not hiding
Metal heart, you're not worth a thing
Metal heart, you're not hiding
Metal heart, you're not worth a thing
You're not worth a thing
You're not worth a thing
As logic stands
You couldn't meet a man
Who's from the future
But logic broke
As he appeared, he spoke
About the future
"We're not gonna make it"
He explained how the end will come
You and me were never meant to be
Part of the future
All we have is now
All we've ever had is now
All we have is now
All we've ever had is now
I noticed that
He had a watch and hat
That looked familiar
He was me
From a dimension torn free
Of the future
"We're not gonna make it"
He explained how the end will come
You and me were never meant to be
Part of the future
All we have is now
All we've ever had is now
All we have is now
All we've ever had is now
All we have is now
Well, you're just across the street, looks a mile to my feet
I want to go to you
Funny how I'm nervous still, I've always been the easy kill
I guess I always will
Could it be that everything goes 'round by chance? (chance)
Or only one way that it was always meant to be? (be)
You kill me, you always know the perfect thing to say (hey hey, hey hey)
I know what I should do but I just can't walk away
I can picture your face well from the bar in my hotel
I wish I'd go to you
I pick up, put down the phone, like your favorite Heatmiser song goes
It's just like being alone
Oh god, please don't tell me this has been in vain (vain)
I need answers for what all the waiting I've done means (means)
You kill me, you've got some nerve but can't face your mistakes (hey hey, hey hey)
I know what I should do but I just can't turn away
Away, away
So go on love, leave while there's still hope for escape
Gotta take what you can these days
There's so much ahead
And so much regret
I know what you want to say (I know what you want to say)
I know it but can't help feeling differently
I loved you and I should have said it
But tell me just what has it ever meant?
I can't help it, baby, this is who I am (am)
(Sorry) Sorry, but I can't just go turn off how I feel (feel)
You kill me, you build me up but just to watch me break (hey hey, hey hey)
I know what I should do but I just can't walk away
Poison oak some boyhood bravery
When a telephone was a tin can on a string
And I fell asleep with you still talking to me
You said you weren't afraid to die
In Polaroids you were dressed in women's clothes
Were you made ashamed? Why'd you lock them in a drawer?
Well, I don't think that I ever loved you more
Than when you turned away, when you slammed the door
When you stole the car and drove towards Mexico
And you wrote bad checks, just to fill your arm
I was young enough, I still believed in war
Well, let the poets cry themselves to sleep
And all their tearful words will turn back into steam
But me I'm a single cell on a serpent's tongue
There's a muddy field where a garden was
And I'm glad you got away but I'm still stuck out here
My clothes are soaking wet from your brother's tears
And I never thought this life was possible
You're the yellow bird that I've been waiting for
The end of paralysis, I was a statuette
Now I'm drunk as hell on a piano bench
And when I press the keys it all gets reversed
The sound of loneliness makes me happier
We're not the same, dear
As we used to be
The seasons have changed 
And so have we
There was little we could say 
And even less that we could do
To stop the ice from getting thinner 
Under me and you
We buried our love 
In the wintery grave
A lump in the snow 
Was all that remained
Though we stayed by its side 
As the days turned to weeks
And the ice kept getting thinner 
With every word that we'd speak
And when the spring arrived
We were taken by surprise
When the floes under our feet
Bled into the sea
And nothing was left for you and me
We're not the same, dear
And it seems to me
There's nowhere we can go 
With nothing underneath
Then it saddens me to say 
What we both knew was true
That the ice was getting thinner 
Under me and you
The ice was getting thinner 
Under me and you
And I wanna believe you
When you tell me that it will be okay
Ya, I try to believe you
But I don't
When you say that it's gonna be
It always turns out to be a different way
I try to believe you
Not today, today, today, today, today
I don't know how I'll feel
Tomorrow (tomorrow)
Tomorrow (tomorrow)
I don't know what to say
Tomorrow (tomorrow)
Tomorrow is a different day
It's always been up to you
It's turning around, it's up to me
I'm gonna do what I have to do
Just don't
Give me a little time
Leave me alone a little while
Maybe it's not too late
Not today, today, today, today, today
I don't know how I feel
Tomorrow (tomorrow)
Tomorrow (tomorrow)
I don't know what to say
Tomorrow (tomorrow)
Tomorrow is a different day
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
And I know I'm not ready
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Maybe tomorrow
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
I'm not ready
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Maybe tomorrow
And I wanna believe you
When you tell me that it will be okay
Ya, I try to believe you
Not today, today, today, today, today
Tomorrow it may change
Tomorrow it may change
Tomorrow it may change
Tomorrow it may change...
All I know
Is everything is not as it's sold
But the more I grow the less I know
And I have lived so many lives
Though I'm not old
And the more I see, the less I grow
The fewer the seeds the more I sow
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is...
Try
Try
I wish I hadn't seen all of the realness
And all the real people
Are really not real at all
The more I learn, the more I learn
The more I cry, the more I cry
As I say goodbye to the way of life
I thought I had designed for me
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
I'm all I'll ever be
But all I can do is...
Try
Ohoh try, try, try
All of the moments that already passed
We'll try to go back and make them last
All of the things we want each other to be
We never will be
We never will be
And that's wonderful
And that's life
And that's you, baby
This is me, baby
And we are, we are
We are, we are, we are, we are
Free
In our love
We are...
Free in our love
Incompatible, it don't matter though
'Cause someone's bound to hear my cry
Speak out if you do
You're not easy to find
Is it possible Mr. Loveable
Is already in my life?
Right in front of me
Or maybe you're in disguise
Who doesn't long for someone to hold
Who knows how to love you without being told
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
If there's a soulmate for everyone
Here we are again, circles never end
How do I find the perfect fit
There's enough for everyone
But I'm still waiting in line
Who doesn't long for someone to hold
Who knows how to love you without being told
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
If there's a soulmate for everyone
If there's a soulmate for everyone
Most relationships seem so transitory
They're all good but not the permanent one
Who doesn't long for someone to hold
Who knows how to love you without being told
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
If there's a soulmate for everyone
Who doesn't long for someone to hold
Who knows how to love you without being told
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
If there's a soulmate for everyone
If there's a soulmate for everyone
No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one's laughing at God when they're starving or freezing or so very poor
No one laughs at God when the doctor calls after some routine tests
No one's laughing at God when it's gotten real late
And their kid's not back from that party yet
No one laughs at God when their airplane starts to uncontrollably shake
No one's laughing at God when they see the one they love
Hand in hand with someone else and they hope that they're mistaken
No one laughs at God when the cops knock on their door
And they say 'We've got some bad news, sir'
No one's laughing at God when there's a famine, fire or flood
But God can be funny
At a cocktail party when listening to a good God-themed joke
Or when the crazies say 'He hates us'
And they get so red in the head you think they're 'bout to choke
God can be funny
When told he'll give you money if you just pray the right way
And when presented like a genie who does magic like Houdini
Or grants wishes like Jiminy Cricket and Santa Claus
God can be so hilarious
Ha ha
Ha ha
No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one's laughing at God when they've lost all they've got and they don't know what for
No one laughs at God on the day they realize
That the last sight they'll ever see is a pair of hateful eyes
No one's laughing at God when they're saying their goodbyes
But God can be funny
At a cocktail party when listening to a good God-themed joke
Or when the crazies say 'He hates us'
And they get so red in the head you think they're 'bout to choke
God can be funny
When told he'll give you money if you just pray the right way
And when presented like a genie who does magic like Houdini
Or grants wishes like Jiminy Cricket and Santa Claus
God can be so hilarious
No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one laughing at God in a hospital
No one's laughing at God in a war
No one's laughing at God when they're starving or freezing or so very poor
No one's laughing at God
No one's laughing at God
No one's laughing at God
We're all laughing with God
You left me hanging from a thread 
We once swung from together
I lick my wounds
But I can't ever see them getting better
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
Her hair was pressed against her face
Her eyes were red with anger
Enraged by things unsaid 
And empty beds and bad behavior
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged, ohh
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right, yeah
Oh, the room was silent 
As we all tried so hard to remember
The way it feels to be alive
The day that he first met her
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
You make me think of someone wonderful
But I can't place her
I wake up every morning 
Wishing one more time to face her
Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged, ohh
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right
So much to love, so much to learn
But I won't be there to teach you
Oh, I know I can be close
But I'll try my best to reach you
I'm so sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right, yeah
Ohh...
I woke up today in London
As the plane was touching down
And all I could think about was Monday
Maybe I'd be back around
If this keeps me away much longer
I don't know what I would do
You've got to understand it's a hard life
That I'm going through
And when the night falls in around me
And I don't think I'll make it through
I'll use your light to guide the way
'Cause all I think about is you
L.A. is getting kind of crazy
And New York is getting kind of cold
I keep my head from getting lazy
I just can't wait to get back home
And all these days I spend away
I'll make up for this I swear
I need your love to hold me up
When it's all to much to bear
And when the night falls in around me
And I don't think I'll make it through
I'll use your light to guide the way
'Cause all I think about is you
And all these days I spend away
I'll make up for this I swear
I need your love to hold me up
When it's all to much to bear
And when the night falls in around me
And I don't think I'll make it through
I'll use your light to guide the way
All I think about is you
Today
You were far away
And I
Didn't ask you why
What could I say
I was far away
You just walked away
And I just watched you
What could I say
How close am I
To losing you
Tonight
You just close your eyes
And I just watch you
Slip away
How close am I
To losing you
Hey, are you awake, yeah, I'm right here
Well, can I ask you
About today
How close am I
To losing you
How close am I
To losing
Together we cry, together we cry
Together we cry, together we cry
Jenny was a poor girl living in a rich world
Named her baby Hope when she was just fourteen
She was hoping for a better world for this little girl
But the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
When she gets that call, Hope's too far gone
Her baby's on the way, with nothing left inside
Together we cry, together we cry
What about the junk head? Could have gone the whole way
Lighting up the stage trying to get a deal
Now he's lighting up the wrong way, something for the pain
Man, you wanna see this kid, he was so fucking unreal
When he gets that call, he's too far gone
To get it together to sing one song
They won't hear, tonight, the words of a lullaby
Together we cry, yeah, yeah
Together we cry, whoa
Together we cry, oh, we cry, we cry, oh, we cry, we cry
Together we cry, oh, oh
Oh, Mary's ambitious, she wanna be a politician
She been dreaming about it since she was a girl
She thought that she'd be the one who could change the world
Always trying to pave the way for women in a man's world
But life happened, house, kids, two cars, husband hits the jar
Cheques that don't go very far now
Now she in it, can't change it, she keeps her mind on her wages
The only rattling cages are her own
Together we cry
Together we cry
There's so much sad, gonna flood the ocean
We're all in tears for the world is broken
Together we cry, oh, we cry, we cry, oh, we cry
There comes a time when every bird has to fly
At some point, every rose has to die
It's hard to let your children go, leave home
Where they go? Who knows
Getting drunk, getting stoned all alone
Teach a man to fish, you feed him now for life
You show your kids the truth, hope they never lie
Instead of reading in a letter that they've gone to something better
Bet you're sorry now, I won't be coming home tonight
I'm sick of looking for those heroes in the sky
To teach us how to fly
Together we cry, we cry, we cry
Together we cry, cry
Together we cry, oh yeah
There's so much sad, gonna flood the ocean
We're all in tears for the world is broken
Together we cry, oh yeah
Together we cry, cry
Together we cry, cry, yeah, yeah
Together we cry, cry
Together we cry
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still you lived inside of me
So tell me how is that
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I loved and not forgive
And though you've break my heart
You're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now I hate you it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl, no no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl
There's something that I feel I need to say
But up till now I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel your not deserving of me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh but now I don't hate you I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, mmm yeah
I ain't got to be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away without you
Yeah yeah yeah, oh oh...
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
You are eighteen year old girl, who live in small city of Japan
You heard me on the radio about one year ago
And you wanted to know, all about me, and my hobbies
My favorite food and my birthday
Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong, oh
I've got your letter, you've got my song
They don't make stationery like this where I'm from so fragile, so refined
So I sniff (So I sniff)
And I lick (And I lick)
Your envelope and fall to little pieces every time
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
I wonder how you decorate your room
I wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being across the sea
Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong, oh
I've got your letter, you've got my song
At ten, I shaved my head and tried to be a monk
I thought the older women would like me if I did
You see mom, I'm a good little boy (Good little boy)
It's all your fault, momma
It's all your fault (It's all your fault)
Goddamn, this business is really lame
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
So you send (So you send)
Me your love (Me your love)
From all around the world
As if I could live off words and dreams and a million screams
Oh, how I need a hand in mine to feel
Why are you so far away from me?
Why are you so far away from me?
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter, you've got my song
(I've got your letter) I've got your letter, you've got my song
Yesterday I went outside
With my mama's Mason jar
Caught a lovely butterfly
When I woke up today
Looked in on my fairy pet
She had withered all away
No more sighing in her breast
I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Every time I pin down what I think I want, it slips away
The ghost slips away
Smell you on my hand for days
I can't wash away your scent
If I'm a dog then you're a bitch
I guess you're as real as me
Baby, I can live with that
Maybe I need fantasy
Life of chasin' butterfly
I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Every time I pin down what I think I want, it slips away
The ghost slips away
I told you I would return
When the robin makes his nest
But I ain't never comin' back
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Ada, don't talk about reasons why you don't want to talk
About reasons why you don't wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
All alone, all together, all together in the dark
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all
Up in the air
Ada, put the sounds of your house in a song
Try to be speechless for a minute
If you think you're gonna faint, go out in the hallway
Let them all have your neck
Ada, don't stay in the lake too long
It lives alone and it barely knows you
It'll have a nervous breakdown and fall
Into a thousand pieces around you
Stand inside an empty tuxedo with grapes in my mouth
Waiting for Ada
Ada, hold onto yourself by the sleeves
I think everything counts a little more than we think
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all
Up in the air
Ada
Ada
Ada
Ada, I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall
Ada, don't talk about reasons why you don't want to talk
About reasons why you don't wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
All alone, all together, all together in the dark
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all
Up in the air
Ada
Ada
Ada
Ada, I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall
Ada
Ada
Ada
Ada, I've been hoping you know your way around
I could live in a different place
With a different house and a different name
I could sing you your favourite song 
Yeah, you'd sing along, you'd sing along
I could wrap you in your favourite clothes
And kiss your face just so you know
That I'm the one who has got your back 
Now turn around and don't be sad
I hope you find the love that's true
So the morning light can shine on you
I hope you find what you're looking for 
So your heart is warm for ever more
I could fly you away with me
To the furthest place you'll ever be
We could smoke 'til the sun goes down
And without a sound, without a sound
We'd fall asleep by the big blue sea
With open eyes so we could see
The way it shines for you and I
You know it'll shine until we fly
I hope you find the love that's true
So the morning light can shine on you
I hope you find what you're looking for
So your heart is warm for ever more
I could wait with you by the water
I could wait with you for the winter to come
I could stand with you with your snow boots on
I hope you find the love that's true
So the morning light can shine on you
I hope you find what you're looking for
So your heart is warm for ever more
I hope you find what you're looking for
So your heart is warm for ever more
As soon as you're born, they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
There's room at the top, they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me
If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
With all these left over feelings of you
'Cause I don't know
And tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When all these nightmares become real
'Cause I don't know
And I don't think you see the places inside me that I find you
And I don't know how we separate the lies here from the truth
And I don't know how we woke up one day and somehow thought we knew
Exactly what we're supposed to do
So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry
So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry
And I don't think you see the places inside me that I find you
And I don't know how we woke up one day and somehow thought we knew
Exactly what we're supposed to do
So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry
So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry
'Cause I don't think you see the places inside me that I find you
And I don't know how we woke up one day and somehow thought we knew
Exactly what we're supposed to do
Exactly what to do
Start, stop and start. Stupid acting smart
Flirting with the flicks; you say it's just for kicks
You'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks
You've got yourself to tease and displease
Doors swinging wide, you walked in to hide
Lookin' at your feet. Failure's complete
Saw you and me on the coin-op TV
Frozen in fear every time we appear
I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong, see nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong, totally wrong
See you walkin' by with another guy
Jailer who sells personal hells
Who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong, see nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong, totally wrong
I'm not surprised at all and really, why should I be?
Seen nothing wrong, seen nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Oh, everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
Don't let me darken your door
That's not what I came here for
No it's not what I came here for
And I won't hear you cry when I'm gone
I won't know if I'm doing you wrong
I never know if I'm doing you wrong
A constant reminder of where I can find her
A light that might give up the way
Is all that I'm asking for
Without her I'm lost
But my love, don't fade away
So I watched the world tear us apart
A stoic mind and a bleeding heart
You never see my bleeding heart
And your light's always shining on
And I've been traveling oh so long
I've been traveling oh so long
A constant reminder of where I can find her
Light that might give up the way
Is all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
Oh my love don't fade away
Oh my love don't fade away
Once divided and nothing left to subtract
Some words when spoken can't be taken back
Walks on his own with thoughts he can't help thinking
Future's above, but in the past, he's slow and sinking
Caught a bolt of lightning
Cursed the day he let it go
Nothingman
Nothingman
Isn't it something?
Nothingman
She once believed in every story he had to tell
One day she stiffened, took the other side
Empty stares from each corner of a shared prison cell
One just escapes, one's left inside the well
And he who forgets
Will be destined to remember
Nothingman
Nothingman
Isn't it something?
Nothingman
Oh, she don't want him
Oh, she won't feed him
After he's flown away
Oh, into the sun, ah, into the sun
Burn, burn
Nothingman
Nothingman
Isn't it something?
Nothingman
Nothingman
Nothingman
Could've been something
Nothingman
Oh
Oh
Oh
Still falling
Breathless and on again
Inside today
Beside me today
Around, broken in two
Till your eyes shed
Into dust
Like two strangers
Turning into dust
Till my hand shook
With the way I fear
I could possibly be fading
Or have something more to gain
I could feel myself growing colder
I could feel myself under your fate
Under your fate
It was you
Breathless and tall
I could feel my eyes turning into dust
And two strangers
Turning into dust
Turning into dust
Your neighbors were screaming, I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers, hoping you wouldn't be there
And now my head's hurting, you say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there, and I'd have wanted to stay 
But I got nothing to say
You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say, man, that was ugly
The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there, and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it, take the box, take the box
I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that's not me, you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen,I said goodbye to your bedroom
And smelled of you
Mr. False Pretense, you don't make sense, I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye? I think I love you
The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Now take it, take the box
Just take it, take it take the box
And now just take the box, take the box
In the cold light of morning 
While everyone's yawning 
You're high 
In the cold light of morning 
The party gets boring 
You're high 
As your skin starts a scratching 
Wave yesterday's action goodbye 
Forget past indiscretions and stolen possessions 
You're high 
In the cold light 
In the cold light of morning 
While everyone's yawning 
You're high 
In the cold light of morning 
You're drunk sick from whoring 
And high 
Staring back from the mirror's a face that you don't recognize 
It's a loser, a sinner, a cock in a dildo's disguise 
In the cold light 
Tomorrow 
Tomorrow 
Tomorrow 
As your skin starts a scratching
Wave yesterday's action goodbye 
Forget past indiscretions and stolen possessions 
You're high 
In the cold light of day 
Tomorrow's only a kettle whistle
Whistle
Whistle
Whistle
Whistle
Whistle
Whistle
Whistle
Whistle away 
In the cold light of day
Walking in the countryside
It seems that the winds have stopped
I took down the posters from my wall
Left letters for you all
I remember moments of happiness
Endless summer, acoustic guitars
Being a man made me coarse
When I wanted to be delicate
I called up Eugene
Told him I was drowning
Like a castaway on a warm ocean
Waiting for a purpose to rise
They say it's not becoming
For a boy my age
If you want to know what makes me sad
Well it's hope, the endurance of faith
A battle that lasts a lifetime
A fight that never ends
Walking in the countryside
It seems that the winds have stopped
Tell my mother I am sorry
And I loved her
It's summertime and I can understand if you still feel sad
It's summertime and though it's hard to see it's true possibilities
When you look inside, all you'll see
When you look inside, all you'll see is a self reflected inner sadness
Look outside, I know that you'll recognize, it's summertime
Oh no
Here comes that sun again
That means another day without you my friend
And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself
And it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes
Sometimes
You just have to walk away
Walk away
So many people to love in my life
Why do I worry about one
But'a you put the happy in my ness
You put the good times into my fun
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
Sometimes
Sometimes
You just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door
We've tried the goodbyes
So many days
We walk in the same direction
So that we could never stray
They say if you love somebody
Then you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and misery
They say that time, will make all this go away
But its time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun is a droppin' on down
And once again you my friend are no where to be found
And it's so hard to do, and so easy to say
But sometimes
Sometimes
You just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door
You just walk away
Walk away
Walk away...
Just walk on
Walk on
Turn and head for the door...
Walk away
What I want from you, is empty your head
But they say be true, don't stain your bed
And we do what we need to be free
And it leans on me like a rootless tree
What I want from us, is empty our minds
But we fake, we fuss, and fracture the times
We go blind when we've needed to see
And this leans on me, like a rootless...
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
And all we've been through
I said leave it, leave it, leave it
It's nothing to you
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Hate me so good
That you just let me out
Let me out, let me out
It's hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
What I want from this, is learn to let go
No, not of you, of all that's been told
Killers re-invent and believe
And this leans on me, like a rootless...
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
And all we've been through
I said leave it, leave it, leave it
It's nothing to you
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Hate me so good
That you just let me out
Let me out, let me out
It's hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
It's hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out
And fuck you, fuck you, love you
And all you've been through
I said leave it, leave it, leave it
It's nothing to you
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Hate me so good
That you just let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Hell when you're around
You were born inside of a raindrop
And I watched you falling to your death
And the sun, well, she could not save you
She'd fallen down to, now the streets are wet
Body of water, toxic and timeless
Atlantic ocean, New York skyline
I always get lost when I leave the village
So I couldn't come meet you in Brooklyn last night
But I sing glory from my lowest
And I will say peace to the people I meet
While the world waits for an explosion
That instant of light that wipes the slate clean
So don't be fooled
No, don't get lied to
Love was always cruel
And don't act strange, don't be a stranger
It happened to me; now it's happening to you
But if you take that train under water
Then we could talk it through
Well, if I could tame all of my desires
Wait out the weather that howls in my brain
Because it seems that it's always changing
The wind's indecision, the sorrowful rain
Yeah, I was a postcard, I was a record
I was a camera until I went blind
And now I'm riding, all over this island
Looking for something to open my eyes
But I still sing glory from a high-rise
And I will say thanks if you're pouring my drinks
While the world waits for an explosion:
That moment in time when we'll be set free
So don't stay mad, just let some time pass
And in the morning you'll awake feeling new
And if I don't come back
I mean, if I get sidetracked
It's only 'cause I wanted to
I'm keeping up with the moon on an all-night avenue
Goddamn
You make me cry
I feel unhappy, I feel so sad
I've lost the best friend that I ever had
She was my woman, I love her so
But it's too late now, I've let her go
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
We shared the years, we shared each day
In love together, we found a way
But soon the world had its evil way
My heart was blinded, love went astray
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
It took so long to realize
And I can still hear her last goodbyes
Now all my days are filled with tears
Wish I could go back and change these years
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh-ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Well take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds 
And that's what I've got to face
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Now take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do 
And that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now 
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've got to take
Take a look at me now
My baby lives in shades of blue
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California, too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
And when he calls, he calls for me, and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby, too
But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather
But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable
My baby lives in shades of cool
Cool heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women, too
I'm one of many, one is blue
And when he calls, he calls for me, and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace, and maybe someone new
But I can't help him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather
'Cause you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable
Your hot, hot, weather in the summer
High, high, neglectful lover
Hot, hot, weather in the summer
High, neglectful lover
You're crumbling, sadly
You're sadly, crumbling
You are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable
With all of this I know now
Everything inside of my head
It all just goes to show how
Nothing I know changes me at all
Again I waited for this to change instead
To tear the world in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you 
Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know
With all of this I feel now
Everything inside of my heart
It all just seems to be how
Nothing I feel pulls at me at all
Again I waited for this to pull apart
To break my time in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you
Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you
Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting you
And all again I wait for this 
To fill a hole, to shake the sky in two
Another night with her
I'm always wanting you
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you
See the animal in his cage that you built
Are you sure what side you're on?
Better not look him too closely in the eye
Are you sure what side of the glass you are on?
See the safety of the life you have built
Everything where it belongs
Feel the hollowness inside of your heart
And it's all right where it belongs
What if everything around you
Isn't quite as it seems?
What if all the world you think you know
Is an elaborate dream?
And if you look at your reflection
Is that all you want to be?
What if you could look right through the cracks
Would you find yourself, find yourself afraid to see?
What if all the world's inside of your head
Just creations of your own?
Your devils and your gods, all the living and the dead
And you're really all alone?
You can live in this illusion
You can choose to believe
You keep looking but you can't find the woods
While you're hiding in the trees
What if everything around you
Isn't quite as it seems?
What if all the world you used to know
Is an elaborate dream?
And if you look at your reflection
Is that all you wanted to be?
What if you could look right through the cracks
Would you find yourself, find yourself afraid to see?
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
You crossed this line
Do you find it hard to sit with me tonight?
I've walked these miles
But I've walked them straight lined
You'll never know what it's like to be
Fine
I'm wasting my young years
It doesn't matter if
I'm chasing old ideas
It doesn't matter if
Maybe, we are, we are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
Maybe, we are, we are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
Don't you know that it's only fear?
I wouldn't worry, you have all your life
I've heard it takes some time to get it right
I'm wasting my young years
It doesn't matter if
I'm chasing old ideas
It doesn't matter if
Maybe, we are, we are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
Maybe, we are, we are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
I don't know what you are
Don't leave me hanging on
Don't know what you are
Don't leave me hanging on
I was a liar, I gave into the fire;
I know I should've fought it - at least I'm being honest...
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you;
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar...
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything, but boy, I couldn't give it to you;
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything, but I got nothing here without you...
So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home;
One more time - I promise after that, I'll let you go...
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart;
All I really care is you wake up in my arms...
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home...
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it,
But stay with me a minute, I'll swear I'll make it worth it...
Can't you forgive me at least just temporarily?
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful...
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything, but boy, I couldn't give it to you;
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything, but I got nothing here without you, baby...
So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home;
One more time - I promise after that, I'll let you go...
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart;
All I really care is you wake up in my arms...
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home...
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest, yeah-ee;
Just stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it, babe,
'Cause I don't want to be without you...
So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home; (Takes you home, boy...)
One more time - I promise after that, I'll let you go... (I promise that... let you go...)
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart; 
All I really care is you wake up in my arms... (Wake up in my arms...)
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home...
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home...
Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons could you
He said, "Allah hu akbar."
I told him don't curse me
"Bo bo, you need prayer."
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
Ooh, this unrequited love
To me it's nothing but a one man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me love me love me love
Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
And you say, "Allah hu akbar."
I told him don't curse me
"Bo bo, you need prayer."
I guessed it couldn't hurt me, yeah
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
Oh, unrequited love
To me it's nothing but a one man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
No, no, oh
It's a it's a bad religion
To be in love with
Someone who could never love you
Only bad, only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do
There are twenty years to go
Twenty ways to know
Who will wear, who will wear the hat
There are twenty years to go
Best of all I hope
Enjoy the ride, the medicine show
Thems the breaks for we designer fakes
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye
There are twenty years to go
The faithful and the low
Best of starts, the broken heart, the stone
There are twenty years to go
Punch drunk and the blow
The worst of starts, the mercy part, the phone
Thems the breaks for we designer fakes
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye
Thems the breaks for we designer fakes
But it's you I take 'cause you're the truth not I
There are twenty years to go
A golden age I know
But all will pass, and end too fast you know
There are twenty years to go
Many friends I hope
Though some may hold the rose, some hold the rope
And that's the end and that's the start of it
That's the whole and that's the part of it
That's the high and that's the heart of it
That's the long and that's the short of it
That's the best and that's the test in it
That's the doubt, the doubt, the trust in it
That's the sight and that's the sound of it
That's the gift and that's the trick in it
You're the truth, not I
You're the truth, not I
You're the truth, not I
You're the truth, not I
It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place
Ah
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (lemme tell you)
When I see you again
Oh, oh, ooh
First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Oh, oh, ooh
When I see you again
Oh, oh, ooh
When I see you again
You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You were always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside, looking in on you
You were always the mysterious one with dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive but too cool to care
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather
Well, in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart, bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees
These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart
You were always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes, and talking over coffee
You philosophies on art, Baroque moved you, you loved Mozart 
And you'd speak of your loved ones as I clumsily strummed my guitar
Teach me of honest things, things that were daring 
Things that were clean, things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must've gone off track with you
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn, somebody more like myself
And these foolish games are tearing me, you're tearing me
You're tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart
You took your coat off, stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that
Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hands
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be, will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now
Crazy skies all wild above me now
Winter howling at my face
And everything I held so dear
Disappeared without a trace
Oh all the times I've tasted love
Never knew quite what I had
Little Darling, if you hear me now
Never needed you so bad
Spinning round inside my head
Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hands
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now
I've been talking drunken gibberish
Falling in and out of the bars
Trying to find some explanation here
For the way some people are
How did it ever come so far?
Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hands
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now
Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hands
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now
That's the one, Oy
How did he not find the baggy, with his hand in my shoe?
Way too close for me, ah well at least they allowed me through.
Should be a good night in here, Ramo in the main room,
People keep pushing me though, no reception on the phone.
And I'm thinkin'...
(Lights are blinding my eyes)
They said they'd be here they said, they said in the corner,
And I'm thinkin'...
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)
These look well speckly, bit of green and blue,
Freeze is well cheap though, so I'll take three if I need to.
Right I'm on the plan, I wish the bouncers would go away,
Borrow water off this man, here goes nothing OK
And I'm thinkin'...
(Lights are blinding my eyes)
That's proper rank, that tastes like hairspray
And I'm thinkin'...
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)
I hate coming to the entrance, just to get bars on my phone,
You have no new messages, so why haven't they phoned?
Menu, write message, so where are you and Simone?
Send message, Dan's number, where've they gone?
And I'm thinkin'...
(Lights are blinding my eyes)
Why's the message pending? where the fuck are ya?
And I'm thinkin'...
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)
Hmm, brandy or beer? Waters a good idea,
Wish that bar lady'd appear; and come serve over here.
Where the fuck could they be? still not over in the corner,
This night's a tragedy, I keep thinking I saw her.
And I'm thinkin'...
(Lights are blinding my eyes)
No that's not them, that's not them either...
And I'm thinkin'...
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)
I'm still not feeling anything, this has got to be a dud.
It's been ages since I necked it, and smoked six tabs to the nub.
Belly's not even tingling, I just feel a bit pissed...
No one looks like minglin', I can't see her or him...
And I'm thinkin'...
(Lights are blinding my eyes)
I'm gonna do another I think. Yeah, one more, these are shit.
And I'm thinkin'...
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)
These toilets are a piss take, queue's bigger than the door.
Gotta get rid of this pill taste, what are they chattin' so much for?
Glad I'm not a girl in this place, they'll be here till dawn.
Sure my belly's tingling a bit, somethings happening I'm sure.
And I'm thinkin'...
(Lights are blinding my eyes)
Maybe I shouldn't have done the second one, I feel all fidgety and warm...
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)
Whoa, everything in the room is spinning, I think I'm going to fall down,
My heart's beating to quick, I'm fucking tripping out.
I wonder whether they got in, turned away no doubt.
Who cares, this is a tune coming in, that one noise is like...
I'm thinkin'...
(Lights are blinding my eyes)
My eyes are rolling back, I'm rubbing my thighs with my hand.
And I'm thinkin'...
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)
Yeah yeah they cheer - can they see my hand in the air?
Need to wave 'em over here. Swear Simone's kissing Dan.
My head is twisted severe, body's rushing everywhere,
They could have texted me when they were here, but I'm fucked and I don't care.
(Lights are blinding my eyes)
What was I thinkin' about? Ah who cares, I'm maaaashed.
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)
Totally fucked, can't hardly fuckin' stand.
This is fuckin' amazing; rah
It takes the pain away
But could not make you stay
It's way too broke to fix
No glue, no bag of tricks
Lay me down
The lie will unfurl
Lay me down to crawl
Your smile would make me sneeze
When we were siamese
Amazing grace in here
I'd pay to have you near
Lay me down
The lie will unfurl
Lay me down to crawl
Don't go and lose your face
At some stranger's
...Place
And don't forget to breathe
And pay before you leave
Lay me down
The lie will unfurl
Lay me down to crawl
Lay me down
The lie will unfurl
Lay me down to crawl
Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know?
The days were endless
We were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shining, we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now
But one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You can't turn back the clock
You can't turn back the tide, ain't that a shame?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a rollercoaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting
And thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow
'Cause these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now
But some things remain
When I look and I find no change
Those were the days of our lives, yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now
But one thing's still true
When I look and I find I still love you
I still love you
Cut this picture into you and me
Burn it backwards, kill this history
Make it over, make it stay away
Or hate'll sing the ending that love started to say
There's a kid a floor below me saying, "Brother, can you spare
Sunshine for a brother? Old man winter's in the air"
Walked me up a story, asking how you are
Told me not to worry, "you were just a shooting star"
Sweet Adeline
Sweet Adeline
My Clementine
Sweet Adeline
(Oh)
It's a picture perfect evening and I'm staring down the sun
Fully loaded, deaf and dumb and done
Waiting for sedation to disconnect my head
Or any situation where I'm better off than dead
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit, it starts the need
To just let go, my party piece
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for younger meat
And the sound it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit, it starts the need
To just let go, my party piece
I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness, murmured in dreams
And we both of us knew how the ending would be
So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in deep, to the heart of bone again
Round and round and round
It's coming apart again
Over and over and over
Now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
Crying for sympathy
Crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd and three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me
To get closer to Heaven than ever feel whole again
I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
And stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness, murmured in dreams
And we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
Always
Always
Lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
Seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
Sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of the shoes
Hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose?
Take a look, you may see me on the ground
For I am the parasite of this town
Dancing a jig in a church with chimes, a sign of the times today
Hearing no bell from a steeple tall, people all in dismay
Falling so far on a silver spoon, making the moon for fun
Changing a rope for a size too small, people all get hung
Take a look, you might see me coming through
For I am the parasite who travels two-by-two
I'm lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
And I'm seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
And I'm sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of the shoes
And hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose?
Take a look, you might see me on the ground
For I am the parasite of this town
Take a look, you may see me in the dirt
For I am the parasite who hangs from your skirt
Feel it
Break your bones
Mr. Jones
Taste me
As I bleed
Taste my need
And spaceboy, I've missed you
Spinning 'round my head
And any way you choose me
You'll break instead
Watch me
Death defy
Defile my life
I don't need
I don't care
Please
I want to go home
I want to go home
I want to go home
I want to go home
'Cause when a lover aches
That's when a lover breaks
I want to go home
I want to go home
And spaceboy, they'll kill me
Before I'm dead and gone
And any way you choose me
It won't be wrong
And any way you choose me
We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong
We won't belong
It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see
But not for me
I sit and watch as tears go by
My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing
All I hear is the sound
Of rain falling on the ground
I sit and watch as tears go by
It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Doin' things I used to do
They think are new
I sit and watch as tears go by
Mmm, mmm
I've been twisting and turning
In a space that's too small
I've been drawing the line and watching it fall
You've been closing me in, closing the space in my heart
Watching us fading and watching it all fall apart
Well I can't explain why it's not enough, 'cause I gave it all to you
And if you leave me now, oh just leave me now
It's the better thing to do
It's time to surrender, it's been too long pretending
There's no use in trying, when the pieces don't fit anymore
The pieces don't fit here anymore
You pulled me under
I had to give in
Such a beautiful myth
That's breaking my skin
Well I'll hide all the bruises
I'll hide all the damage that's done
But I'll show how I'm feeling until all the feeling has gone
Well I can't explain why it's not enough, 'cause I gave it all to you
And if you leave me now, oh just leave me now
It's the better thing to do
It's time to surrender, it's been too long pretending
There's no use in trying, when the pieces don't fit anymore
The pieces don't fit here anymore
Oh don't misunderstand
How I feel
'Cause I've tried, yes I've tried
But still I don't know why, no I don't know why
I don't know why... why
Well I can't explain why it's not enough, I gave it all to you
And if you leave me now, just leave me now
It's the better thing to do
Well it's time to surrender, it's been too long pretending
There's no use in trying, when the pieces don't fit anymore
The pieces don't fit here anymore
The pieces don't fit anymore
Haven't laughed this hard in a long time
Better stop now before I start crying
Go off to sleep in the sunshine
I don't wanna see the day when it's dying
She's a sight to see, she's a-good to me
But I'm already somebody's baby
She's a pretty thing and she knows everything
But I'm already somebody's baby
You don't deserve to be lonely
But those drugs you got won't make you feel better
Pretty soon you'll find it's the only
Little part of your life you're keeping together
I'd be nice to you if I could make it through
But you're already somebody's baby
I could make you smile if you stayed a while
But how long will you stay with me, baby?
Because your candle burns too bright
I almost forgot it was twilight
Even if I think that you are right
Well, I'm tired of being down, I got no fight
You're wonderful, and it's beautiful
But I'm already somebody's baby
And if I went with you I'd disappoint you too
I'm already somebody's baby
Already somebody's baby
I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore,
Before you take a swing, I wonder what are we fighting for,
When I say out loud, I want to get out of this
I wonder, is there anything I'm going to miss?
I wonder
How it's going to be, when you don't know me
How's it going to be, when you're sure I'm not there?
How's it going to be, when there is no one there to talk to
Between you and me?
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?
Where we used to laugh, there's a shouting match,
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch,
A silence I can't ignore,
Like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in,
Swings empty,
I don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me
I wonder
How's it going to be, when it goes down?
How's it going to be, when you're not around?
How's it going to be, when you find out there was nothing
Between you and me?
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be,
When you don't know me, any more?
And how's it going to be
Want to get myself back in again,
The soft dive of oblivion
I want to taste the salt on your skin
The soft dive of oblivion, oblivion
How's it going to be,
When you don't know me, anymore?
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?
Take on another shift
Palms in the middle, hands in the middle
Work out another rift
Something is muffled, another chuckle
This is a foreground
It is a foreground
A cross country miss
Take direction, can't connect it
I'm afraid this is
Ten detected, nine in a wreck and
A little jetty fight
Pattern evolving, motion insolvent
Something about this might
Take all evening, I'll just be cleaning
This is a foreground
It is a foreground
I'm so glad you came
I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending
Our last dance together
Expectant, too punctual
But prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But older than me now
More constant, more real
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
To hair and contentment
That hangs in a basement
A woman now standing
Where once there was only a girl
I'm so glad you came
I'm so glad you remembered
The walking through walls
In the heart of December
The blindness of happiness
Of falling down laughing
And I really believed
That this time was forever
But Christmas falls late now
Flatter and colder
And never as bright
As when we used to fall
All this in an instant
Before I can kiss you
A woman now standing
Where once there was only a girl
I'm so glad you came
I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending
Our last dance together
Reluctantly, cautiously
But prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But Christmas falls late now
Flatter and colder
And never as bright
As when we used to fall
And even if we drink
I don't think we would kiss
In the way that we did
When the woman was only a girl
The how I can't recall
Now I'm staring at what once was the wall
Separating east and west
Now they meet amidst the broad daylight
So this is where you are, and this is where I am
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
It's hard I must confess
But I'm banking on the rest to clear away
'Cause we have spoken everything
Everything short of "I love you"
You right where you are, from right where I am
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
And who's to say it's wrong
And who's to say that it's not right
Where we should be for now
So this is where you are, and this is where I am
So this is where you are, and this is where I've been
And this is where I've been
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
I hope all of my days will be lit by your face
I hope all the years will hold tight our promises
I don't want to be old and sleep alone
An empty house is not a home
I don't want to be old and feel afraid
I don't want to be old and sleep alone
An empty house is not a home
I don't want to be old and feel afraid
And if I need anything at all
I need a place that's hidden in the deep
Where lonely angels sing you to your sleep
Though all the world is broken
I need a place where I can make my bed
A lover's lap where I can lay my head
Because now the room is spinning
The day's beginning
Water, water on the seeds
To my left they rose and leaf
To my right cross Seven Seas
Maybe maybe they'll stay true
My seeds will cross and then take root
And leave you to an empty room
Lonely, lonely that is you
Lonely, lonely that is you
Paper paper obsolete
How will you reach out to me
I thought you'd ask me not to leave
Lonely, lonely that is me
Lonely, lonely that is me
Distance makes the heart grow weak
So that the mouth can barely speak
Except to those who hide their needs
And I have read the golden seal
That tells of how the seedlings feel
Reminds my heart what love can yield
By my only things are clear
Baby boy I'm staying here
Lonely, lonely that was you
Lonely and so untrue
Billy's leaving today (don't know where he's going).
Holds his head in disgrace (he can't escape the truth).
He knows the price that he's paid.
He admits that it's too late to admit that he's afraid.
Tomorrow comes. Sorrow becomes his soul mate.
The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.
All doors closed but he's always open,
To hear the time in his mind.
Oh Billy.
Billy's leaving today (don't know where he's going).
He's got lines on his face (they tell the story of his pain).
He accepts it's his fate.
He admits it took too long to admit that he was wrong.
Tomorrow comes. Sorrow becomes his soul mate.
The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.
All doors closed but he's always open,
To hear the time in his mind,
Oh Billy.
Once he was a lover sleeping with another.
Now he's just known as a cheat.
And he wish he'd had a mirror; looked a little clearer.
Seen into the eyes of the weak.

What is love but the strangest of feelings?
A sin you swallow for the rest of your life?
You've been looking for someone to believe in
To love you until your eyes run dry
She lives by disillusion glow
We go where the wild blood flows
On our bodies we share the same scar
Love me, wherever you are
How do you love with a fate full of rust?
How do you turn what the savage tame?
You've been looking for someone you can trust
To love you, again and again
How do you love in a house without feelings?
How do you turn what the savage tame?
I've been looking for someone to believe in
Love me, again and again
She lives by disillusion's glow
We go where the wild blood flows
On our bodies we share the same scar
How do you love on a night without feelings?
She says, love, I hear sound, I see fury
She says, love's not a hostile condition
Love me, wherever you are
Love me, wherever you are
Love me, wherever you are
Wherever you are
The storm is coming but I don't mind
People are dying, I close my blinds
All that I know is I'm breathing now
I want to change the world
Instead I sleep
I want to believe in more than you and me
But all that I know is I'm breathing
All I can do is keep breathing
All we can do is keep breathing now
Now
Now
Now
All that I know is I'm breathing
All I can do is keep breathing
All we can do is keep breathing
All we can do is keep breathing
All we can do is keep breathing
All we can do is keep breathing
All we can do is keep breathing
All we can do is keep breathing
All we can do is keep breathing
All we can do is keep breathing now
There's a bluebird at my window 
I can't hear the songs he sings
All the jewels in Heaven
They don't look the same to me 
I just wade the tides that turned 
Till I learn to leave the past behind 
It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine
All the battlements are empty
And the moon is laying low
Yellow roses in the graveyard
Got no time to watch them grow
Now I bade a friend farewell
I can do whatever pleases me
It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine
Press my face up to the window
To see how warm it is inside
See the things that I've been missing
Missing all this time
It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine
Am I better off dead? Am I better off a quitter?
They say I'm better off now than I ever was with her
As they take me to my local down the street
I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet
They say a few drinks will help me to forget her
But after one too many I know that I'm never
Only they can see where this is gonna end
And they all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind turn it all around
I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I dialed her number and confessed to her 
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing
So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences
I know if I'm face to face that she'll come to her senses 
Every drunk step I take leads me to her door
If she sees how much I'm hurting she'll take me back for sure
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I dialed her number and confessed to her 
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing
She said nothing
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Oh I got nothing
Nothing
I got nothing
Nothing
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Oh, sometimes love is intoxicating
Oh, you're coming down,
Your hands are shaking
When you realize there's no one waiting
Am I better off dead?
Am I better off a quitter?
They say I'm better off now
Than I ever was with her
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I dialed her number and confessed to her 
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing
She said nothing
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Oh I got nothing
Nothing
I got nothing
Nothing
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Oh I got nothing
I got nothing
I got nothing
I never really had a problem because of leaving
But everything reminds me of her this evening
So if I seem a little out of it, sorry
But why should I lie? Everything reminds me of her
The spin of the earth impaled a silhouette
Of the sun on the steeple
And I gotta hear the same sermon
All the time now from you people
Why are you staring into outer space crying
Just because you came across it and lost it?
Everything reminds me of her
Everything reminds me of her
Everything reminds me of her
Ville:
I'm giving up the ghost of love
And a shadow is cast on devotion
Lauri:
She is the one that I adore
Queen of my silent suffocation
Both:
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny
Bittersweet
Lauri:
I won't give up, I'm possessed by her
Ville:
I'm bearing a cross, she's turned into my curse
Both:
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny
Lauri:
Bittersweet, I want you
Ville:
Oh, how I wanted you
Lauri:
And I need you
Ville:
How I needed you
Both:
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny
Bittersweet
Your words to me just a whisper
Your face is so unclear
I try to pay attention
Your words just disappear
Oh
'Cause it's always raining in my head
Oh
Forget all the things I should have said
So I speak to you in riddles
'Cause my words get in my way
I smoke the whole thing to my head
And feel it wash away
'Cause I can't take anymore of this
I wanna come apart
Or dig myself a little hole
Inside your precious heart
Oh
'Cause it's always raining in my head
Oh
Forget all the things I should have said
I am nothing more than
A little boy inside
That cries out for attention
Yet I always try to hide
'Cause I talk to you like children
Though I don't know how I feel
But I know I'll do the right thing
If the right thing is revealed
'Cause it's always raining in my head
Forget all the things I should have said
Ain't it funny how we pretend we're still a child?
Softly stolen under blanket skies
And rescue me from me and all that I believe
I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Will you leave me too?
Carve out your heart for keeps in an old oak tree
And hold me for goodbyes and whispered lullabyes
And tell me I am still the man I'm supposed to be
I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Will you leave me too?
Will you leave me too?
Too late to turn back now, I'm running out of sound
And I am changing, changing
And if we died right now
This fool you love somehow is here with you
I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Would you leave me too?
Would you leave me too?
Hello, world, hope you're listening
Forgive me if I'm young or speaking out of turn
But there's someone that I've been missin'
And I think that they could be the better half of me
They're in the wrong place, tryin' to make it right
And I'm tired of justifying, so I say to you
"Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waitin' for ya, for so long, for so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known
So come home"
I get lost in the beauty
Of everything I see, the world ain't half as bad as they paint it to be
If all the sons, all the daughters, stop to take it in
Hopefully, the hate subsides, and the love can begin
It might start now, or maybe I'm just dreamin' out loud, but until then
"Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waitin' for ya for so long, for so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known (ever known)
So come home"
Everything I can't be, is everything you should be
And that's why I need you here
Everything I can't be, is everything you should be
And that's why I need you here
So hear this now
"Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waitin' for ya for so long, for so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known (ever known)
So come home
Come home"
Mother don't worry, I killed the last snake that lived in the creek bed
Mother don't worry, I've got some money I saved for the weekend
Mother remember being so stern with that girl who was with me?
Mother remember the blink of an eye when I breathed through your body?
So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds, flying upward over the mountain
Mother I made it up from the bruise on the floor of this prison
Mother I lost it, all of the fear of the Lord I was given
Mother forget me now that the creek drank the cradle you sang to
Mother forgive me, I sold your car for the shoes that I gave you
So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons could be birds, taken broken up to the mountain
Mother don't worry, I've got a coat and some friends on the corner
Mother don't worry, she's got a garden we're planting together
Mother remember the night that the dog had her pups in the pantry?
Blood on the floor,  fleas on their paws, and you cried till the morning
So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds, flying always over the mountain
You called me out
You stayed inside
One you love
Is where you hide
Shot me down as I flew by
Crash and burn
I think sometimes you forget where the heart is
Answer no to these questions
Let her go, learn a lesson
It's not me, you're not listening 
Now can't you see something's missing?
You forget where the heart is
I'll Take you away from that empty apartment
You stay and forget where the heart is
Someday if ever you love me you'd say it's okay
Waking up from this nightmare
How's your life, what's it like there?
Is it all what you want it to be?
Does it hurt when you think about me?
And how broken my heart is
I'll Take you away from that empty apartment
You stay and forget where the heart is
Someday if ever you love me you'd say it's okay
It's okay to be angry and never let go
It only gets harder the more that you know
When you get lonely if no one's around
You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down
We came together but you left alone
And I know how it feels to walk out on your own
Maybe someday I will see you again
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend
I'll Take you away from that empty apartment
You stay and forget where the heart is
Someday if ever you love me you'd say its okay
It's okay
It's okay
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
I drink good coffee every morning
Comes from a place that's far away
And when I'm done I feel like talking
Without you here there is less to say
Don't want you thinking I'm unhappy
What is closer to the truth
If I lived till I was a hundred and two
I just don't think I'll ever get over you
No longer moved to drink strong whiskey
I shook the hand of time and I knew
That if I lived till I could no longer climb my stairs
I just don't think I'll ever get over you
A face that dances and it haunts me
With laughter still ringin' in my ears
I still find pieces of your presence here
Even, even after all these years
I don't want you thinkin' that I don't get asked to dinner
'Cause I'm here to say that I sometimes do
And even though I may seem to feel a touch of love
I just don't think I'll ever get over you
If I lived till I was a hundred and two
I just don't think I'll ever get over you
He never, ever saw it coming at all
He never, ever saw it coming at all
He never, ever saw it coming at all

Power to the people, we don't want it, we want pleasure
And the TVs try to rape us and I guess that they're succeeding
And we're going to these meetings, but we're not doing any meeting
And we're trying to be faithful, but we're cheating, cheating, cheating

I'm the hero of the story, don't need to be saved

Take a photograph, it'll be the last 
Not a dollar or a crowd could ever keep me here 
I don't have a past, I just have a chance 
Not a family or honest plea remains to say 
Rain, rain, go away
Come again another day 
All the world is waiting for the sun 
Is it you I want or just the notion of
A heart to wrap around so I can find my way around? 
Safe to say from here, you're getting closer now 
We are never sad, 'cause we are not allowed to be 
Rain, rain, go away
Come again another day 
All the world is waiting for the sun
Rain, rain, go away
Come again another day 
All the world is waiting for the sun 
To lie here, under you, is all that I could ever do 
To lie here, under you, is all 
To lie here, under you, is all that I could ever do 
To lie here, under you, is all 
Rain, rain, go away
Come again another day 
All the world is waiting for the sun 
Rain, rain, go away
Come again another day 
All the world is waiting for the sun
All the world is waiting for the sun
All the world is waiting for the sun
Staying in my play pretend

No wonder I'm scared
To look in your eyes,
You've turned me away
So many times,
You can take it away
At any given moment,
It's hard to believe
While you're in this disguise
So will you hold me please,
I'm trying hard to breathe
I'm just surviving
So will you hold me please,
I'm trying hard to breathe
Stop me from crying
When I see you walking with her
I have to cover my eyes
(I have to cover my eyes)
And every time you leave with her,
Something inside me dies
(Something inside of me dies)
No wonder it hurts
To sit by your side
(Turned me away so many times)
There's a different song 
I can play you tonight
(We don't have to sit here in silence)
We can break the pattern,
We can change the colour
(It's just a little sacrifice)
You don't need to worry about the others
(It's all in your mind)
So will you hold me please,
I'm trying hard to breathe
I'm just surviving
So will you hold me please,
I'm trying hard to breathe
Stop me from crying
When I see you walking with her
I have to cover my eyes
(I have to cover my eyes)
And every time you leave with her,
Something inside me dies
(Something inside of me dies)
When I see you walking with her
I have to cover my eyes
(I have to cover my eyes)
And every time you leave with her,
Something inside me dies
(Something inside of me dies)
Something inside me dies
When I see you walking with her
I have to cover my eyes
(I have to cover my eyes)
And every time you leave with her,
Something inside me dies
(Something inside of me dies)
When I see you walking with her
I have to cover my eyes
(I have to cover my eyes)
And every time you leave with her,
Something inside me dies
(Something inside of me dies)
Something inside me dies
I know you love the song, but not the singer. I know you've got me wrapped around your finger
I know you want the sin without the sinner. I know. I know
I know the past will catch you up as you run faster. I know the last in line is always called a bastard
I know the past will catch you up as you run faster. I know. I know
I know you cut me loose from contradiction. I know I'm all wrapped up in sweet attrition
I know it's asking for your benediction. I know. I know
I know the past will catch you up as you run faster. I know the last in line is always called a bastard
I know the past will catch you up as you run faster. I know. I know
I know the past will catch you up as you run faster. I know the last in line is always called a bastard
I know the past will catch you up as you run faster. I know. I know
I, I can't take things slowly
Come let away, that's what they all do
Help me 'cause I'm feeling shaky
Tell me what's wrong with my brain
'Cause I seem to have lost it
'Cause I am afraid of the light
Yeah, you know what I mean
And I can't sleep alone at night
Yeah, you know what I mean
Lonely, that's not quite my problem
I have all I need, haven't quite lost it
I try so hard to be happy
Cause something goes on once again
Please, please come and save me
Tell me what's wrong with my brain
'Cause I seem to have lost it
'Cause I am afraid of the light
Yeah, you know what I mean
And I can't sleep alone at night
Yeah, you know what I mean
'Cause I am afraid of the light
Yeah, you know what I mean
'Cause I can't sleep alone at night
Yeah, you know what I mean
I've been outside
Invited in
But I couldn't abide
Wouldn't miss it again
Burning every bridge that I cross
To find some beautiful place to get lost
I had true love
I made it die
I pushed her away
She said please stay
Burning every bridge that I cross
To find some beautiful place to get lost
To find some beautiful place to get lost
Well I don't know where I'll go now
And I don't really care who follows me there
But I'll burn every bridge that I cross
And find some beautiful place to get lost
And find some beautiful place to get lost
I am
Doll eyes
Doll mouth
Doll legs
I am
Doll arms
Big veins
Dog bait
Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, they really do
Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, and I do too
I want to be the girl with the most cake
I love him so much, it just turns to hate
I fake it so real I am beyond fake
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
Someday you will ache like I ache
I am doll parts
Bad skin
Doll heart
It stands
For knife
For the rest
Of my life
Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, they really do
Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, but I do too
I want to be the girl with the most cake
He only loves those things because he loves to see them break
I fake it so real I am beyond fake
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
Someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache!
And someday you will ache like I ache!
And someday you will ache like I ache!
And someday you will ache like I ache!
Someday you will ache like I ache
You, you know how to get me so low
My heart had a crash when we spoke
I can't fix what you broke
And you, you always have a reason
Again and again this feelin'
Why do I give in?
And I always was
I always was one for crying
I always was one for tears
The sun's gettin' cold, it's snowing
Looks like an early winter for us
Looks like an early winter for us
An early winter
Oh I need you to turn me over
It's sad
The map of the world is on you
The moon gravitates around you
The seasons escape you
And I always was
I always was one for crying
I always was one for tears
No I never was
I never was one for lying
You lied to me all these years
The sun's gettin' cold, it's snowing
Looks like an early winter for us
Looks like an early winter for us
An early winter
Oh I need you to turn me over
Why?
Why do you act so stupid?
Why?
You know that I'm always right
It looks like an early winter for us
It hurts and I can't remember sunlight
An early winter for us
The leaves are changing color (for us)
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
Starting over and over and (for us) over again
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
Starting over and over and (for us) over again
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
Well it looks like an early winter
Starting over and over and (for us) over again
For us
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
It looks like an early winter
Starting over and over and (for us) over again
For us
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
It hurts and I can't remember
I sit tight, don't want to miss the show
I hang on, don't want to miss my prime
'Cause time will fly, upon my baby's back
Time will fly, upon my baby's back
Stay a while, my baby wants me to
Don't you go, my baby begs me so
But tide will dry, upon my baby's back
Tide will dry, upon my baby's back
I get weak
I get weary
I miss sleep
I get moody
I'm in thoughts
I write songs
I'm in love
I walk on
Fingers crossed, my time is coming now
Don't you go, my baby begs me so
Time will fly, upon my baby's back
Time will fly, upon my baby's back
I get weak
I get weary
I miss sleep
I get moody
I'm in thoughts
I write songs
I'm in love
I walk on
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with silvery stuff
Honey kisses clouds of fluff
Shoulders shrugging off
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with radio cures
Electronic surgical words
Picking apples for the kings and queens of things I've never seen
Oh, distance has no way of making love understandable
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with silvery stuff
Honey kisses clouds of fluff
Picking apples for the kings and queens of things I've never seen
Oh, distance has no way of making love understandable
Oh, distance has no way of making love understandable
Oh, distance has no way of making love understandable
Oh, distance has no way of making love understandable
Oh, distance has no way of making love understandable
Cheer up
Honey, I hope you can
Procession moves on, the shouting is over
Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone
Talking aloud as they sit round their tables
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain
Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside
Cry like a child, though these years make me older
With children, my time is so wastefully spent
A burden to keep, though their inner communion
I accept like a curse an unlucky deal
Played by the gate at the foot of the garden
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall
No words could explain, no actions determine
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice, no sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all
Mutual misunderstanding
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice, no sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice, no sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
It's no sacrifice
Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
Evil's in my pocket and your will is in my hand
Oh, your will is in my hand
And I'll throw it in the current that I stand upon so still
Love is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill
Oh, mine has learned to kill
Oh, I said I could rise
From the harness of our goals
Here come the tears
But like always, I let them go
Just let them go
And now spikes will keep on falling from the heavens to the floor
The future was our skin and now we don't dream anymore
No, we don't dream anymore
Like a house made from spider webs and the clouds rolling in
I bet this mighty river's both my savior and my sin
Oh, my savior and my sin
Oh, I said I could rise
From the harness of our goals
Here come the tears
But like always, I let them go
Just let them go
Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
Evil's in my pocket and your strength is in my hand
Your strength is in my hand
And I'll throw you in the current that I stand upon so still
Love is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill
Oh, mine has learned to kill
Oh, I said I could rise
From the harness of our goals
Here come the tears
But like always, I let them go
Just let them go
I'll tell you why I don't want to know where you are
I got a joke I've been dying to tell you
A silent kid is looking down the barrel
To make the noise that I kept so quiet
Kept it from you, Pitseleh
I'm not what's missing from your life now
I could never be the puzzle pieces
They say that God makes problems
Just to see what you could stand
Before you do as the Devil pleases
Give up the thing you love
No one deserves it
The first time I saw you
I knew it would never last
I'm not half what I wish I was
I'm so angry, I don't think it'll ever pass
And I was bad news for you just because
I never meant to hurt you
Under your spell again
I can't say no to you
Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand
I can't say no to you
Shouldn't let you torture me so sweetly
Now I can't let go of this dream
I can't breathe but I feel
Good enough
I feel good enough
For you
Drink up sweet decadence
I can't say no to you
And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind
I can't say no to you
Shouldn't let you conquer me completely
Now I can't let go of this dream
Can't believe that I feel
Good enough
I feel good enough
It's been such a long time coming, but I feel good
And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall
Pour real life down on me
'Cause I can't hold on to anything this good enough
Am I good enough for you to love me too?
So take care what you ask of me
'Cause I can't say no
I see it around me, I see it in everything
I could be so much more than this
I said my goodbyes, this is my sundown
I'm gonna be so much more than this
With one hand high
You'll show them your progress
You'll take your time
But no one cares
No one cares
No one cares
I need you to show me the way from crazy
I wanna be so much more than this
With one hand high
You'll show them your progress
You'll take your time
But no one cares
With one hand high
You'll show them your progress
You'll take your time
But no one cares
No one cares
No one cares
No one cares
(I could be so much more than this)
No one cares
(I wanna be so much more than this)
No one cares
(I could be so much more than this)
No one cares
(I wanna be so much more than this)
No one cares
(I wanna be so much more than this)
No one cares
(I wanna be so much more than this)
Good good bye, lovely time
Good good bye, tinsel shine
Good good bye, I'll be fine
Good good bye, good good night
I am milk
I am red hot kitchen
And I am cool
Cool as the deep, blue ocean
I am lost
So I am cruel
But I'd be love and sweetness
If I had you
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
I am weak
But I am strong
I can use my tears to
Bring you home
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
I am milk
I am red hot kitchen
And I am cool
Cool as the deep blue ocean
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
I'm aching, I'm aching for you
I'm waiting
I'm waiting
I'm waiting
For you
I like the snake on your tattoo,
I like the ivy and the ink blue,
Yayo, yes, you, yayo.
You have to take me right now,
From this dark trailer park life now,
Yayo, how now, yayo.
Put me onto your black motorcycle,
Fifties, baby doll dress for my "I do."
It only takes two hours to Nevada,
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama.
Let me put on a show for you, daddy,
Let me put on a show.
Let me put on a show for you, tiger,
Let me put on a show.
I need you like a baby when I hold you,
Like a druggie, like I told you.
Yayo, yes, you, yayo.
Put me onto your black motorcycle,
Fifties, baby doll dress for my "I do."
It only takes two hours to Nevada,
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama.
Let me put on a show for you, daddy,
Let me put on a show.
Let me put on a show for you, tiger,
Let me put on a show.
Hello, Heaven, you are tunnel lined,
With yellow lights on a dark night.
Yayo, yes, you, yayo.
Put me onto your black motorcycle,
Fifties, baby doll dress for my "I do."
It only takes two hours to Nevada,
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama.
Let me put on a show for you, daddy,
Let me put on a show.
Let me put on a show for you, tiger,
Let me put on a show.
Been over
Been over this before
Been over and over
Been over this before
And over
Been over this before
So over this
Been over this
So over this
Been over this
Over this before
So you lost your trust
And you never should have
And you never should have
But don't break your back
If you ever see this
Don't answer that
In a bullet-proof vest
With the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
I'll see you soon
In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon
So they came for you
They came snapping at your heels
They come snapping at your heels
But don't break your back
If you ever say this
But don't answer that
In a bullet-proof vest
With the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
I'll see you soon
In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon
I'll see you soon
I know, you lost your trust
I know, you lost your trust
I know, don't lose your trust
I know, you lost your trust
I should have known better
To see what I could see
My black shroud
Holding down my feelings
A pillar for my enemies
I should have wrote a letter
And grieve what I happen to grieve
My black shroud
I never trust my feelings
I waited for the remedy
When I was three, three maybe four
She left us at that video store
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
I'm light as a feather
I'm bright as the Oregon breeze
My black shroud
Frightened by my feelings
I only want to be a relief
No, I'm not a go-getter
The demon had a spell on me
My black shroud
Captain of my feelings
The only thing I want to believe
When I was three, and free to explore
I saw her face on the back of the door
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
I should have known better
Nothing can be changed
The past is still the past
The bridge to nowhere
I should've wrote a letter
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling
Don't back down, concentrate on seeing
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor's greeting
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Don't back down, there is nothing left
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
I'm a fool in the fetter
Rose of Aaron's beard, where you can reach me
Don't back down, nothing can be changed
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Illumination
I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long
I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong
Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover
And the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster
'Cause you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you
Every time
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose
Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you
Every time
Too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end...
In the end
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here, oh oh
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I felt for sure last night
That once we said goodbye
No one else will know these lonely dreams
No one else will know that part of me
I'm still driving away
And I'm sorry every day
I won't always love these selfish things
I won't always live not stopping
It was my turn to decide
I knew this was our time
No one else will have me like you do
No one else will have me, only you
You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here and now I'm ready, holding on tight
Don't give away the end, the one thing that stays mine
Amazing still it seems
I'll be twenty-three
I won't always love what I'll never have
I won't always live in my regrets
You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here and now I'm ready, holding on tight
Don't give away the end, the one thing that stays mine
You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here and now I'm ready, holding on tight
Don't give away the end, the one thing that stays mine
In one single moment, your whole life can turn 'round
I stand there for a minute, starin' straight into the ground
Lookin' to the left slightly, then lookin' back down
The world feels like it's caved in, proper sorry frown
Please let me show you where we could only just be for us
I can change, and I can grow, or we could adjust
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust
We can even have an open relationship if you must
I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me
But her eyes glaze over, like she's lookin' straight through me
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity
When they open up she's lookin' down at her feet
Dry your eyes mate
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over
So then I move my hand up from down by my side
It's shaking; my life is crashing before my eyes
I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies
Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh
'Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me
There's things I can't imagine doin'
Things I can't imagine seein'
It weren't supposed to be easy, surely
Please, please, I'm begging, please
She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested
She wraps her fingers 'round mine with the softness she's blessed with
She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures
By pushin' my hand away to my chest, from hers
Dry your eyes mate
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over
And I'm just standin' there
I can't say a word
'Cause everything is just gone
I've got nothin'
Absolutely nothin'
Tryin' to pull her close out of bare desperation
Put my arms around her, tryin' to change what she's saying
Pull my head level with hers so she might engage in
Look in to her eyes to make her listen again
I'm not gonna fuckin' just fuckin' leave it all now
'Cause you said it'd be forever, and that was your vow
And you're gonna let our things simply crash and fall down
You're well out of order now, this is well out of town
She pulls away, my arms are tightly clamped round her waist
Gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face
Takes one step forward, looks back and then walks away
Dry your eyes mate
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over
I know in the past I've found it hard to say
Tellin' you things, but not tellin' straight
But the more I pull on your hand and say
The more you pull away
Dry your eyes mate
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now
I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
Baby, I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
Baby, I love you and all that I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter
Tighter
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, I want to split now
I just can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
Baby, I love you and all that I want you to do
Is just hold me (please), hold me (squeeze), hold me, hold me
You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
No warning sign, no alibi
We faded faster than the speed of light
Took our chance, crashed and burned
No we'll never, ever learn
I fell apart but got back up again
And then I fell apart but got back up again, yeah
We both could see crystal clear
That the inevitable end was near
Made our choice, a trial by fire
To battle is the only way we feel alive
I fell apart but got back up again
And then I fell apart but got back up again
And then I fell apart but got back up again
Way oh, way oh, way oh
Way oh, way oh, way oh
So here we are, the witching hour 
The quickest tongue to divide and devour 
Divide and devour
If I could end the quest for fire 
For truth, for love, for my desire
My desire
And I fell apart but got back up again 
Way oh, way oh, way oh, way oh
Way oh, way oh, way oh, way oh
I fell apart, I fell apart 
I fell apart, I fell apart
I fell apart but got back up again
The broken clock is a comfort, it helps me sleep tonight
Maybe it can't stop tomorrow from stealing all my time
I am here still waiting though I still have my doubts
I am damaged at best, like you've already figured out
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain there is healing
In your name I find meaning
So I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on
I'm barely holdin' on to you
The broken locks were a warning you got inside my head
I tried my best to be guarded, I'm an open book instead
I still see your reflection inside of my eyes
That are looking for purpose, they're still looking for life
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain is there healing
In your name I find meaning
So I'm holdin' on, I'm still holdin', 
I'm holdin' on, I'm still holdin',
I'm holdin' on, I'm still holdin'
I'm barely holdin' on to you
I'm hanging on another day just to see what you will throw my way
And I'm hanging on to the words you say
You said that I will be ok
The broken lights on the freeway left me here alone
I may have lost my way now, haven't forgotten my way home
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain (in the pain) there is healing
In your name (in your name) I find meaning
So I'm holdin' on (I'm still holdin')
I'm holdin' on (I'm still holdin')
I'm holdin' on (I'm still holdin')
I'm barely holdin' on to you
I'm holdin' on
I'm holdin' on
I'm holdin' on
I'm barely holdin' on to you
Come on Balthazar
I refuse to let you die
Come on fallen star
I refuse to let you die
'Cause it's wrong
And I've been waiting far too long
And it's wrong
I've been waiting far too long
For you to be
Be
Be
Be
Be mine
For you to be mine
Be mine
For you to be mine
And it's wrong
I've been waiting far too long
It's wrong
I've been waiting far too long
For you to be
Be
Be
Be
All the centrefolds
That you can't afford
They've long since waved their last goodbyes
All the centrefolds
That you can't afford
You've long since faded from their eyes
So be
Be mine
So be
Be mine
He was always such a nice Boy
The quiet one
With good intentions
He was down for his brother
Respectful to his mother
A good boy
But good don't get attention
One kid with a promise
The brightest kid in school
He's not a fool
Reading books about science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
Cause smart don't make you cool, whoa
He's not invisible anymore
With his Father's 9 and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over primetime news
Mary's got the same size hands
As Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Mann's Chinese Theatre show
She coulda been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole
Now we'll never know
No no no no oh
They were cryin' to the camera
Said he never fitted in
He wasn't welcome
He showed up to the parties
They was hanging in
Some guys were puttin' him down
Bullying him round round
Now I wish I woulda talked to him
Gave him the time of day
Not turn away
If I woulda been the one to maybe go this far
He might have stayed at home
Playing angry chords on his guitar
He's not invisible anymore
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains
Since he walked through that classroom door
Everybody knows his name
Mary's got the same size hands (Oh)
As Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints (Ooh)
At Mann's Chinese Theatre show
She coulda been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole
Now we'll never know
(Now we'll never know, oh)
Greg was always getting net from 20 feet away (20 feet away)
He had a tryout with the Sixers
Couldn't wait for Saturday (Saturday)
Now we're never gonna see him slam
Flying high as Kobe can
His life was stole (Stole)
Oh now we'll never know
Now we'll never never never know
Mmm now we'll never never never never know
Stole (Stole)
Oh whoa yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Mary's got the same size hands (Same size hands)
As Marilyn Monroe (Oh)
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Mann's Chinese Theatre show (She was gonna be a star)
She coulda been a movie star (Oh no)
Never got the chance to go that far (Never got the chance)
Her life was stole (Stole, stole)
Oh now we'll never know
(Now we'll never never know, no)
Greg was always getting net from 20 feet away (He had game, oh)
He had a try out with the Sixers
Couldn't wait for Saturday
Now we're never gonna see him slam (Never see him)
Flying high as Kobe can
His life was stole (Stole, oh)
Oh now we'll never know
(Now we'll never never know)
Oh no no no
Yeah their lives were stole
Now we'll never know
(Stole)
We were here all together yesterday
(Stole).
There's a woman crying out tonight
Her world has changed
She asks God why
Her only son has died
And now her daughter cries
She can't sleep at night
Downtown
Another day for all the suits and ties
Another war to fight
There's no regard for life
How do they sleep at night
How can we make things right?
Just wanna make this right
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
In this love
We are all the same
Human in all our ways and all of pain
(So let it be)
There's a love that could fall down like rain
(Let us see)
Let forgiveness wash away the pain
(What we need)
And no one really knows what they are searching for
(We believe)
This world is crying for so much more
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
In this love
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
In this love
So this world
Is too much
For you to take
Just lay it down and follow me
I'll be everything you need
In every way
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
In this love
(In this love)
We believe
(In this love)
We believe
(In this love)
We believe
(In this love)
When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done
When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you begun
When the day is done
When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold
When the bird has flown
Got no one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
When the bird has flown
When the game's been fought
Newspaper blow across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought
When the part is through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to start anew
Now the part is through
When the day is done
Down to earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done
Sleep will not come to this tired body now
Peace will not come to this lonely heart
There are some things I'll live without
But I want you to know that I need you right now
I need you tonight
I steal a kiss from her sleeping shadow moves
'Cause I'll always miss her wherever she goes
And I'll always need her more than she could ever need me
I need someone to ease my mind
But sometimes a someone is so hard to find
And I'll do anything to keep her here tonight
And I'll say anything to make her feel alright
And I'll be anything to keep her here tonight
'Cause I want you to stay with me
I need you tonight
She comes to me like an angel out of time
As I play the part of a saint on my knees
There are some things I'll live without
But I want you to know that I need you right now
Suffer my desire
Suffer my desire
Suffer my desire for you
Suffer my desire for you
Suffer my desire for you
Suffer my desire for you
For you
For you
We sent out the SOS call
It was a quarter past four
In the morning
When the storm broke our second anchor line
Four months at sea
Four months of calm seas
Only to be pounded in the shallows
Off of the tip of Montauk Point
They call them rogues
They travel fast and alone
One hundred foot faces
Of God's good ocean gone wrong
What they call love is a risk
To always get hit
Out of nowhere
By some wave and end up on your own
The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts
To bail us out
And flooded the engines and radio
And half buried bow
Your tongue is a rudder
It steers the whole ship
Sends your words past your lips
Or keeps them safe behind your teeth
But the wrong words will strand you
Come off course while you sleep
Sweep your boat out to sea
Or dashed to bits on the reef
The vessel groans
The ocean pressures its frame
Off the port I see the lighthouse
Through the sleet and the rain
And I wish for one more day
To give my love and repay debts
But the morning finds our bodies
Washed up thirty miles west
They say that the captain
Stays fast with the ship
Through still and storm
But this ain't the Dakota
The water's cold (so cold)
Won't have to fight for long
(This is the end)
This story's old (this is the end)
But it goes on and on
Until we disappear
(This is the calm)
Calm me and let me taste (this is the calm)
The salt you breathe
While you are underneath
(We are the resin)
I am the one who haunts your (we are the resin)
Dreams of mountains sunk
Below the sea
(After the storm)
I spoke the words but never (after the storm)
Gave a thought to what they all could mean
(Rest here with me)
I know that this (rest in the deep) is what you want
(Washed up on the beach)
A funeral keeps both of us apart
(Washed up on the beach)
You know that you are not alone
I need you like water in my lungs
This is the end
(This is the end)
This story's old (this is the end)
But it goes on and on
Until we disappear
(This is the calm)
Calm me and let me taste (this is the calm)
The salt you breathe
While you are underneath
(We are the resin)
I am the one who haunts your (we are the resin)
Dreams of mountains sunk
Below the sea
(After the storm)
I spoke the words but never (after the storm)
Gave a thought to what they all could mean
(Rest here with me)
I know that this (rest in the deep) is what you want
(Washed up on the beach)
A funeral keeps both of us apart
(Washed up on the beach)
You know that you are not alone
I need you like water in my lungs
This is the end
(Never to see any other way)
Shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
Did what I had to do
'Cause it's so far past me now
Shared my body and my life with you
That's way over now
There's not more I can do
You're so famous now
Got your bible, got your gun
And you like to party and have fun
And I like my candy and your women
I'm finally happy now that you're gone
With my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm the best, I'm crazy
Get a little bit of Bourbon in ya
Get a little bit suburban and go crazy
Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
You're dancin' circles around me
You're fuckin' crazy
Oh, you're crazy for me
I shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
I did what I had to do
I found another anyhow
Shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
I did what I had to do
I could see you leaving now
I got your bible and your gun
And you love to party and have fun
And I love your women and all of your heroin
And I'm so happy now that you're gone
Put my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm a mess, I'm crazy, yeah
Get a little bit of bourbon in ya
Go a little bit suburban and go crazy
Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
You're dancin' circles around me
You're fuckin' crazy
Oh, you're crazy for me
Got your bible and your gun
You like your women and you like fun
I like my candy and your heroin
And I'm so happy, so happy now you're gone
Put my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm a mess, I'm crazy, yeah
Get a little bit of Bourbon in ya
Get a little bit suburban and go crazy
Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
You're dancin' circles around me
You're fuckin' crazy
Oh, you're crazy for me
Oh, oh, you're crazy for me
My wounded rhymes make silent cries tonight
My wounded rhymes make silent cries tonight
And I keep it like a burning
Longing from a distance
I ranted, I pleaded, I beg him not to go
For sorrow, the only lover I've ever known
Sadness is a blessing
Sadness is a pearl
Sadness is my boyfriend
Oh, sadness I'm your girl
These scars of mine make wounded rhymes tonight
I dream of times when you were mine so I
Can keep it like a haunting
Heart beating close to mine
Sadness is a blessing
Sadness is a pearl
Sadness is my boyfriend
Oh, sadness I'm your girl
I ranted, I pleaded, I beg him not to go
For sorrow, the only lover I've ever known
Every night I rant, I plead, I beg him not to go
Will sorrow be the only lover I can call my own?
Sadness is a blessing
Sadness is a pearl
Sadness is my boyfriend
Oh, sadness I'm your girl
Sadness is my boyfriend
Oh, sadness I'm your girl
Oh, sadness I'm your girl
All I want is your understanding
As in the small act of affection
Why is this my life?
Is almost everybody's question
And I've tried
Everything but suicide
But it's crossed my mind
I prefer peace
Wouldn't have to have one worldly possession
But essentially I'm an animal
So just what do I do with all the aggression?
Well I've tried
Everything but suicide
But it's crossed my mind
Life is a one-way street, ain't it?
If you could paint it
I'd draw myself going in the right direction
So I go all the way, like I really really know
But the truth is I'm only guessin'
And I've tried
Everything but suicide
Oh but it's crossed my mind
Just a thought
It's even dark in the daytime
It's not just good, it's great depression
When I was lost I even found myself
Lookin' in the gun's direction
And so I've tried
Everything but suicide
But yes, it's crossed my mind
But I'm fine
Emma:
Do you still remember how we used to be?
Feeling together, believing whatever my love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers, young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave ya, we'd only just begun
All:
Hasta mañana
Always be mine
Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one
Melanie B:
Yes, I still remember every whispered word
Melanie B and Emma:
The touch of your skin, giving life from within like a love song never heard
Melanie C:
Slipping through our fingers, like the sands of time
Melanie C and Emma:
Promises made, every memory saved as reflections in my mind
All:
Hasta mañana
Always be mine
Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one
Victoria:
Back where I belong now
Was it just a dream?
Victoria and Emma:
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold
And the secret's safe with me
All:
Hasta mañana
Always be mine
Viva forever, I'll be waiting (Melanie C: Viva forever, I'll be waiting)
Everlasting like the sun (Melanie C: Everlasting like the sun)
Live forever, for the moment (Melanie C: Live forever, for the moment)
Ever searching for the one (Melanie C: Ever searching for the one)
Viva forever, I'll be waiting (Melanie C: Viva forever)
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment (Melanie C: Live forever)
Ever searching for the one
Viva forever, I'll be waiting (Melanie C: Viva forever)
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment (Melanie C:Live forever)
Ever searching for the one (Melanie C: For the one)
Melanie B:
Viva forever, I'll be waiting (Melanie C: I'll be waiting)
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment (Melanie C: Live forever)
Ever searching for the one
I don't get many things right the first time
In fact, I am told that a lot
Now I know all the wrong turns
The stumbles and falls brought me here
And where was I before the day
That I first saw your lovely face?
Now I see it every day
And I know
That I am
I am
I am
The luckiest
What if I'd been born 50 years before you
In a house on the street where you live?
Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike
Would I know?
And in a wide sea of eyes
I see one pair that I recognize
And I know
That I am
I am
I am
The luckiest
I love you more than I have
Ever found a way to say to you
Next door there's an old man who lived to his 90s
And one day passed away in his sleep
And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days
And passed away
I'm sorry, I know that's
A strange way to tell you
That I know we belong
That I know
That I am
I am
I am
The luckiest
I asked you a question
I didn't need you to reply
Is it gettin' heavy?
But then I realized
Is it gettin' heavy?
Well I thought it was already as heavy
As can be
Is it overwhelming
To use a crane to crush a fly?
It's a good time for Superman
To lift the sun into the sky
'Cause it's gettin' heavy
Well I thought it was already as heavy
As can be
Tell everybody
Waitin' for Superman
That they should try to hold on
Best they can
He hasn't dropped them
Forgotten
Or anything
It's just too heavy for Superman to lift
Is it gettin' heavy?
Well I thought it was already as heavy as can be.
Tell everybody
Waitin' for Superman
That they should try to hold on
Best they can
He hasn't dropped them
Forgotten
Or anything
It's just too heavy for Superman to lift
So we meet again and I offer my hand
All dry and English slow
And you look at me and I understand, yeah it's the look I used to know
"Three long years and your favourite man
Is that any way to say hello?"
And you hold me
Like you'll never let me go
Like you'll never let me go
"Oh come on and have a drink with me
Sit down and talk a while"
"Oh I wish I could and I will!
But now I just don't have the time"
And over my shoulder as I walk away
I see you give that look goodbye
I still see that look in your eyes
So dizzy, Mr. Busy, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the silly frilly things have to first get done
In a minute, sometime soon, maybe next time, make it June
Until later doesn't always come
Until later doesn't always come
It's so hard to think it ends sometime
And this could be the last
I should really hear you sing again
And I should really watch you dance
Because it's hard to think I'll never get another chance
To hold you
To hold you
But chilly, Mr. Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the tizzy, fizzy idiot things must get done
In a second, just hang on, all in good time, won't be long
Until later
I should've stop to think, I should've made the time
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on
But I didn't, now it's all too late
It's over and you're gone
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you so much
But how many times can I walk away
And wish "if only"
How many times can I talk this way
And wish "if only"
Keep on making the same mistake
Keep on aching the same heartbreak
I wish "if only"
But "if only"
Is a wish too late
So there goes my life
Passing by with every exit sign
It's been so long
Sometimes I wonder how I will stay strong
No sleep tonight
I'll keep on driving these dark highway lines
And as the moon fades
One more night gone, only twenty more days
But I will see you again
I will see you again a long time from now
And there goes my life
Passing by with every departing flight
And it's been so hard
So much time so far apart
And she walks the night
How many hearts will die tonight
And when things have changed
I guess I'll find out in seventeen days
But I will see you again
I will see you again a long time from now
My body aches
And it hurts to say
No one is moving
And I wish that I weren't here tonight
But this is my life.
And I will see you again
I will see you again a long time from now
And I will see you again
I will see you again a long time from now
You're the one who's always choking trojan
You're the one who's always bruised and broken
Sleep may be the enemy
But so's another line
It's a remedy
You should take more time
You're the one who's always choking Trojan
You're the one whose shower's always golden
Spunk and bestiality
Well it's an Assisi lie
It's ahead of me
You should close your fly
I understand the fascination
The dream that comes alive at night
But if you don't change your situation
Then you'll die, you'll die
Don't die, don't die
Please don't die
You're the one who's always choking Trojan
You're the one who's always bruised and broken
Drunk on immorality
Valium and cherry wine
Coke and ecstasy
You're gonna blow your mind
I understand the fascination
I've even been there once or twice, or more
But if you don't change your situation
Then you'll die, you'll die
Don't die, don't die
Please don't die
Please don't die
Please don't die
Please don't die
Every time you get a drink
And every time you go to sleep
Are those dreams inside your head
Is there sunlight on your bed
And every time you're driving home
Way outside your safety zone
Wherever you will ever be
You're never getting rid of me
You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me
You coulda made a safer bet
But what you break is what you get
You wake up in the bed you make
I think you made a big mistake
You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me
You own me
Lucky you
You own me
There's nothing you can do
You clean yourself to meet
The man who isn't me
You're putting on a shirt
A shirt I'll never see
The letter's in your coat
But no one's in your head
'Cause you're too smart to remember
You're too smart
Lucky you
Lucky you
Lucky you
Well I've been here before
Sat on the floor in a grey, grey room
Where I stay in all day
I don't eat, but I play with this grey, grey food
Désolé, if someone is prayin' then I might break out
Désolé, even if I scream I can't scream that loud
I'm all alone again
Crawling back home again
Stuck by the phone again
Well I've been here before
Sat on a floor in a grey, grey mood
Where I stay up all night
And all that I write is a grey, grey tune
So pray for me child, just for a while
That I might break out, yeah
Pray for me child
Even a smile would do for now
'Cause I'm all alone again
Crawling back home again
Stuck by the phone again
Have I still got you to be my open door?
Have I still got you to be my sandy shore?
Have I still got you to cross my bridge in this storm?
Have I still got you to keep me warm?
If I squeeze my grape and I drink my wine, yeah
If I squeeze my grape and I drink my wine
Oh 'cause nothing is lost, it's just frozen in frost
And it's opening time, there's no-one in line
But I've still got me to be your open door
I've still got me to be your sandy shore
I've still got me to cross your bridge in this storm
And I've still got me to keep you warm
Warmer than warm, yeah
Warmer than warm, yeah
Warmer than warm, yeah
Warmer than warm, yeah
Now at last I know
What a fool I've been
For I've lost the last love
I shall ever win
And/Now at last I see
How my heart was blind
To the joys before me
That I left behind
When the wind was fresh
On the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And a lark was heard in the still
Where was I
Where was I
When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winters lonely 
Now at last I know
When the wind was fresh
On the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And a lark was heard in the still
Where was I
Where was I
When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winters lonely 
Now at last I know
I fell asleep on a late night train
I missed my stop and went round again
Why would I want to see you now?
To fix it up, make it up somehow
Baby, I'll try again, try again
Baby, I die every night, every time
What I was isn't what I am
I'd change back, but I don't know if I can
Still I'll try, try again, try again
Baby, I die every night, every time
But I was made the way I am
I'm not a stone, I'm just a man
Lay down your arms and I will lay down mine
Rip back the time that we've been wasting
God I wish You could see me now
You'd pick me up and You'd sort me out
Baby, I'll try again, try again
Baby, I die every night, every time
I need some sleep, I can't go on like this
I tried counting sheep but there's one I always miss
Everyone says I'm getting down too low
Everyone says you just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
I need some sleep, time to put the old horse down
I'm in too deep and the wheels keep spinnin' 'round
Everyone says I'm getting down too low
Everyone says you just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
Just gotta let it go
It's a beautiful world we live in
A sweet romantic place
Beautiful people everywhere
The way they show they care
Makes me want to say
It's a beautiful world
Oh a beautiful world
For you
It's a wonderful time to be here
It's nice to be alive
Wonderful people everywhere
The way they comb their hair
Makes me want to say
It's a wonderful place
Oh what a wonderful place
For you (5 times)
Not me
(Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space)
(All I want in life's a little bit of love to take the pain away)

I guess that's what you want (I could still fall in love with you)
Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to believe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I can feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say, forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (Endless love)
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? (Tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you're asking me to feel things you never show?
You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are?
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? (Tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are (Where you are)
There's something missing in my heart (You are missing in my heart)
Show me the meaning of being lonely (Being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? (Tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are (Can't be there where you are)
There's something missing in my heart
And it starts, sometime around midnight
Or at least that's when you lose yourself
For a minute or two
As you stand, under the bar lights
And the band plays some song
About forgetting yourself for a while
And the piano's this melancholy soundtrack to her smile
And that white dress she's wearing
You haven't seen her for a while
But you know that she's watching
She's laughing, she's turning
She's holding her tonic like a cross
The room's suddenly spinning
She walks up and asks how you are
So you can smell her perfume
You can see her lying naked in your arms
And so there's a change, in your emotions
And all these memories come rushing
Like feral waves to your mind
Of the curl of your bodies
Like two perfect circles entwined
And you feel hopeless and homeless
And lost in the haze of the wine
Then she leaves, with someone you don't know
But she makes sure you saw her
She looks right at you and bolts
As she walks out the door
Your blood boiling
Your stomach in ropes
Oh and when your friends say,
"What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost."
Then you walk, under the streetlights
And you're too drunk to notice
That everyone is staring at you
You just don't care what you look like
The world is falling around you
You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You know that she'll break you in two
This has got to die
I said this has got to stop
This has got to lie down
With someone else on top
You can keep me pinned
'Cause it's easier to tease
But you can't paint an elephant
Quite as good as she
And she may cry like a baby
And she may drive me crazy
'Cause I am lately lonely
So why'd you have to lie?
I take it I'm your crutch
The pillow in your pillow case
Is easier to touch
And when you think you've sinned
Do you fall upon your knees?
Or do you sit within your picture?
Do you still forget the breeze?
And she may rise, if I sing you down
And she may wisely cling to the ground
'Cause I am lately horny
So why would she take me thorny?
What's the point of this song? Or even singing?
You've already gone, why am I clinging?
Well I could throw her out, and I could live without
And I could do it all for you
I could be true
Tell me if you want me to lie
'Cause this has got to die
I said this has got to stop
This has got to lie down, down
With someone else on top
You can both keep me pinned
'Cause it's easier to tease
But you can't make me happy
Quite as good as me
Well you know that's a lie
Some say love is a burning thing
That it makes a fiery ring
Oh but I know love as a fading thing
Just as fickle as a feather in a stream
See, honey, I saw love. You see, it came to me
It put its face up to my face so I could see
Yeah then I saw love disfigure me
Into something I am not recognizing
See, the cage, it called. I said, "Come on in"
I will not open myself up this way again
Nor lay my face to the soil, nor my teeth to the sand
I will not lay like this for days now upon end
You will not see me fall, nor see me struggle to stand
To be acknowledge by some touch from his gnarled hands
You see, the cage, it called. I said, "Come on in"
I will not open myself up this way again
You see, the moon is bright in that treetop night
I see the shadows that we cast in the cold, clean light
My feet are gold. My heart is white
And we race out on the desert plains all night
See, honey, I am not some broken thing
I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee
No my heart is gold. My feet are light
And I am racing out on the desert plains all night
So some say love is a burning thing
That it makes a fiery ring
Oh but I know love as a caging thing
Just a killer come to call from some awful dream
O and all you folks, you come to see
You just stand there in the glass looking at me
But my heart is wild. And my bones are steam
And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free
Boredoms in the bathroom shaking out the loose teeth
Sally's in the stirrups claiming her destiny
And nobody nowhere understands anything
About me and all my dreams lost at sea
Jack it up Judy, set your heart alight
Mayfair mistress of the satellites
Misspent youth faking up a rampage
To hold off the real slaves, paid off and staid
And what you never knew
Can never get to you, so fake it
I'll be your stumbleine
I'll be your super queen and make you
Jukebox fuckup hanging round the drugstore
No matter what you say, he'll be back for more
Mommy's in the manger with the little kids
She's got her reasons, got my forgets
Of tears and idle threats misplaced then
And no matter what they knew
They can't get to you, so fake it
I'll be your stumbleine
I'll be your super queen and make you me
Come around Ruby, I could never sleep alone
Elevator straight into my skull
The escalator rises as it falls
I swear our jet is crashing in my mind
You can hold on but I wouldn't waste your time
Farewell my black balloon
Farewell my black balloon
I've stood in a thousand street scenes
Just around the corner from you
On the edge of a dream that you have
Has anybody ever told you it's not coming true
Farewell my black balloon
Farewell my black balloon
(Let the weather have its way with you)
Farewell my black balloon
(Let the weather have its way with you)
Farewell my black balloon
Farewell my black balloon
Farewell my black balloon
(Let the weather have its way with you)
Farewell my black balloon
(Let the weather have its way with you)
Farewell my black balloon
(Let the weather have its way with you)
Farewell my black balloon
(Let the weather have its way with you)
Farewell my black balloon
Woke up and for the first time the animals were gone
It's left this house empty now, not sure if I belong
Yesterday you asked me to write you a pleasant song
I'll do my best now, but you've been gone for so long
The window's open now and the winter settles in
We'll call it Christmas when the adverts begin
I love your depression and I love your double chin
I love 'most everything that you bring to this offering
Oh I know that I left you in places of despair
Oh I know that I love you, so please throw down your hair
At night I trip without you, and hope I don't wake up
'Cause waking up without you is like drinking from an empty cup
Woke up and for the first time the animals were gone
Our clocks are ticking now so before our time is gone
We could get a house and some boxes on the lawn
We could make babies and accidental songs
I know I've been a liar and I know I've been a fool
I hope we didn't break yet, but I'm glad we broke the rules
My cave is deep now, yet your light is shining through
I cover my eyes, still all I see is you
Oh I know that I left you in places of despair
Oh I know that I love you, so please throw down your hair
At night I trip without you, and hope that I don't wake up
'Cause waking up without you is like drinking from an empty cup
I never knew perfection till I heard you speak 
And now it kills me just to hear you say the simple things
Now waking up is hard to do, sleeping's impossible too
And everything's reminding me of you
What can I do?
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break
A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane
The city looks so nice from here
Pity I can't see it clearly
While you're standing there it disappears
It disappears
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break
Saw you sitting all alone
You're fragile and you're cold, but that's alright
Love these days is getting rough
It knocks you down, then beats you up
But it's just a roller coaster anyway, yeah
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, not okay
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, and I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break, baby
When I was young I knew everything
She, a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt-stricken, sobbin' with my head on the floor
Stoppin' baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no
Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place
For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen
My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of Valium and slept
And now he's guilt-stricken, sobbin' with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept, he said
Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place
For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen
Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey yeah
Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We tried to wash our hands of all of this
We never talk of our lacking relationships
And how we're guilt-stricken sobbin' with our heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say
Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
And I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place
For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen
For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen
We were merely freshmen
We were only freshmen
The car is on fire, and there's no driver at the wheel
And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides and a dark wind blows
The government is corrupt
And we're on so many drugs with the radio on and the curtains drawn
We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
And the machine is bleeding to death
The sun has fallen down
And the billboards are all leering
And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
It went like this
The buildings tumbled in on themselves
Mothers clutching babies
Picked through the rubble and pulled out their hair
The skyline was beautiful on fire
All twisted metal stretching upwards
Everything washed in a thin orange haze
I said, "Kiss me, you're beautiful, these are truly the last days"
You grabbed my hand and we fell into it
Like a daydream or a fever
We woke up one morning and fell a little further down
For sure it's the valley of death
I open up my wallet and it's full of blood
Throw me in a landfill
Don't think about the consequences
Throw me in the dirt pit
Don't think about the choices that you make
Throw me in the water
Don't think about the splash I will create
Leave me at the alter
Knowing all the things you just escaped
Push me out to sea
On a little boat that you made
Out of the evergreen that you helped your father cut away
Leave me on the tracks
To wait until the morning train arrives
Don't you dare look back
Walk away
Catch up with the sunrise
'Cause this is torturous electricity
Between both of us and this is
Dangerous 'cause I want you so much
But I hate your guts
I hate you
So leave me in the cold
Wait until the snow covers me up
So I cannot move
So I'm embedded in the frost
Leave me in the rain
Wait until my clothes cling to my frame
Wipe away your tear stains
Thought you said you didn't feel pain
Well this is torturous electricity
Between both of us and this is
Dangerous, 'cause I want you so much
But I hate your guts. I want you so much
But I hate your guts.
Well this is torturous
Electricity between both of us
And this is dangerous 'cause I want you so much
But I hate your guts
I want you so much but I hate your guts
Why... Why...
How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done?! Uh...
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me:
Hey... this kind of trouble's only just begun
I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Tell me...
Why...
Why...
I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
And I've heard it said too many times
That you'd be better off...
Besides...
Why can't you see this boat is sinking
(This boat is sinking this boat is sinking)
Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out...
Turning inside out...
Tell me...
Why
Tell me...
Why
This is the book I've never read
These are the words I've never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tears...
The tears we shed
This is the fear
This is the dread
These are the contents of my head
And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel
I don't think you know what I feel
I don't think you know what I fear
You don't know what I fear
Snow can wait, I forgot my mittens
Wipe my nose, get my new boots on
I get a little warm in my heart when I think of winter
I put my hand in my father's glove
I run off where the drifts get deeper
Sleeping Beauty trips me with a frown
I hear your voice, "You must learn to stand up
For yourself, 'cause I can't always be around."
He says, "When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
'Cause things are gonna change so fast.
All the white horses are still in bed.
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that "things change, my dear"
Boys get discovered as winter melts
Flowers competing for the sun
Years go by and I'm here still waiting
Withering where some snowman was
Mirror, mirror, where's the crystal palace?
But I only can see myself
Skating around the truth, who I am
But I know, Dad, the ice is getting thin
"When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
'Cause things are gonna change so fast.
All the white horses are still in bed."
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that "things change, my dear"
Hair is grey, and the fires are burning
So many dreams on the shelf
You say, "I wanted you to be proud of me."
I always wanted that myself
When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
'Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses have gone ahead
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that "things change, my dear"
Never change
All the white horses
I don't want to be adored
Don't want to be first in line
Or make myself heard
I'd like to bring a little light
To shine a light on your life
To make you feel loved
No, I don't want to be the only one you know
I want to be the place you call home
I lay myself down to make it so
But you don't want to know
I give much more than I'd ever ask for
Will you see me in the end?
Or is it just a waste of time
Trying to be your friend?
Just shine, shine, shine
Shine a little light
Shine a light on my life
And warm me up again
Fool, I wonder if you know yourself at all
You know that it could be so simple
I lay myself down to make it so
But you don't want to know
You take much more than I'd ever ask for
Say a word or two to brighten my day
Do you think that you could see your way
To lay yourself down and make it so?
But you don't want to know
You take much more than I'd ever ask for
Stephanie says that she wants to know
Why she's given half her life to people she hates now
Stephanie says (Stephanie says) when answering the phone (answering the phone)
What country shall I say is calling from across the world
But she's not afraid to die
The people all call her Alaska
Between worlds, so the people ask her
'Cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind
Stephanie says (Stephanie says) that she wants to know (She wants to know)
Why it is though she's the door (Always), she can't be the room
Stephanie says (Stephanie says) but doesn't hang up the phone (Hang up the phone)
What seashell she is calling from across the world
But she's not afraid to die
The people all call her Alaska
Between worlds, so the people ask her
'Cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind
They're asking is it good or bad
It's such an icy feeling
It's so cold in Alaska (Stephanie says)
It's so cold in Alaska (Stephanie says)
It's so cold in Alaska (Stephanie says)
The earth is warm next to my ear
Insect noise is all that I hear
A magic trick makes the world disappear
The skies are dark, they're dark but they're clear 
A distant motorcade and suddenly there's joy
The snow and tickertape blurs all my senses numb
It's like the finish line where everything just ends
The crack of radios seems close enough to touch
Cold water, cleaning my wounds
A side parade, with a single balloon
I'm done with this, I'm counting to ten
Blue as seas, running to them
I feel like I am watching everything from space
And in a minute I hear my name and I wake
I think the finish line's a good place we could start
Take a deep breath, take in all that you could want
Lonesome tears, I can't cry them anymore
I can't think of what they're for, oh, they ruin me every time
But I'll try to leave behind some days
These tears just can't erase, I don't need them anymore
How could this love ever turning, never turn it's eye on me
How could this love ever changing, never change the way I feel
Lazy sun, your eyes catch the light
With promises that might come true for a while
Oh, I'll ride farther than I should
Harder than I could just to meet you there
How could this love ever turning, never turn it's eye on me
How could this love ever changing, never change the way I feel
I miss you
Miss you so bad
I don't forget you
Oh it's so sad
I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly
The day
You slipped away
Was the day
I found it won't be the same
Oh
I didn't get around to kiss you
Good-bye on the hand
I wish that I could see you again
I know that I can't
Oh-Oh-Oh, I hope you can hear me
'Cause I remember it clearly
The day
You slipped away
Was the day
I found it won't be the same
Oh
I've had my wake up
Won't you wake up?
I keep asking why (I keep asking why)
And I can't take it
It wasn't fake it
It happened you passed by
Now you're gone now you're gone
There you go there you go
Somewhere I can't bring you back
Now you're gone now you're gone
There you go there you go
Somewhere you're not coming back
The day
You slipped away
Was the day
I found it won't be the same
No
The day
You slipped away (na-na-na)
Was the day
That I found it won't be the same
Oh
I miss you
Adia, I do believe I failed you
Adia, I know I've let you down
Don't you know I tried so hard
To love you in my way?
It's easy let it go
Adia, I'm empty since you left me
Trying to find a way to carry on
I search myself and everyone
To see where we went wrong
There's no one left to finger
There's no one here to blame
There's no one left to talk to, honey
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence
'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?
Adia, I thought that we could make it
I know I can't change the way you feel
I leave you with your misery
Your friend who won't betray
I pull you from your tower
I take away your pain
I show you all the beauty you possess
If you'd only let yourself believe
'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?
'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?
All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby, but I've figured you out
And you thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't want to hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no, no, no
Looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could have loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't want to hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
You're not sorry, no, no
You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
You're not sorry, no, no
There's a picture on my kitchen wall
Looks like Jesus and his friends involved
There's a party getting started in the yard
There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive
Was I too young to see this with my eyes?
By the pool last night, apparently
The chemicals weren't mixed properly
You hit your head and then forgot your name
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain
And now your altitude and memory's a shame
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I like to believe it was all about love for a child
And when the house was left in shambles
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around
Well I'm far too old to care about that now
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I'd like to believe it was all about love for a child
It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce
I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age
And they never check to see my grades
What a fool I'd be to start complaining now
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I'd love to believe it's all about love for a child
It was all about love...
Lonely little love dog that
No one knows the name of
I know why you cry out
Desperate and in devout
Timid little teether
Your eyes set on the ether
Your moon in a bella luna and
Howling hallelujah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Nameless you above me
Come lay me low and love me
This lonely little love dog
That no one knows the name of
Curse me out in free verse and
Wrap me up and reverse this
Patience is a virtue
Until its silence burns you
And something slow
Has started in me as
Shameless as an ocean and
Mirrored in devotion
Something slow
Has sparked up in me
As dog cries for a master and
Sparks are swirling faster
Lonely little love dog
That no one knows the ways of
Where the land is low is
Where the bones'll show through
Lonely little love dog
That no one knows the days of
Where the land is low is
Where the water flows to
And holds you
Daddy's ghost behind you
Sleeping dog beside you
You're a poem of mystery
You're the prayer inside me
Spoken words like moonlight
You're the voice that I like
Needlework and seedlings
In the way you're walking
To me from the timbers
Faded from the winter
If you walk away, I'll walk away
First tell me which roads you will take
I don't want to risk our paths crossin' someday
So you walk that way, I'll walk this way
And the future hangs over our heads
And it moves with each current event
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
Just stay in when it's lookin' this way
And the moon's laying low in the sky
Forcing everything metal to shine
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like a jewelry store case
They argue "Walk this way", "No, walk this way"
And Laura's asleep in my bed
As I'm leaving, she wakes up and says
"I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
Baby, don't go away, come here"
And there's kids playing guns in the street
And one's pointing his tree branch at me
So I put my hands up; I say, "Enough is enough
If you walk away, I'll walk away"
(And he shot me dead)
I found a liquid cure
For my land locked blues
It will pass away like a slow parade
It's leaving but I don't know how soon
And the world's got me dizzy again
You'd think after 22 years I'd be used to the spin
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
So I'm always pacing around or walking away
And I keep drinking the ink from my pen
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
"If you love something, give it away"
A good woman will pick you apart
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
But you may be offended, and you may be afraid
But don't walk away, don't walk away
We made love on the living room floor
With the noise in the background from a televised war
And in that deafening pleasure, I thought I heard someone say
"If we walk away, they'll walk away"
But greed is a bottomless pit
And our freedom's a joke; we're just taking a piss
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
If you're still free, start runnin' away
('Cause we're comin' for ya!)
I've grown tired of holding this pose
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
Sayin' let me walk away, please
You'll be free, child, once you have died
From the shackles of language and measurable time
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Till then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
So I'm up at dawn, putting on my shoes
I just want to make a clean escape
I'm leaving but I don't know where to
I know I'm leaving but I don't know where to
Tiredness fuels empty thoughts
I find myself disposed
Brightness fills empty space
In search of inspiration
Harder now with higher speed
Washing in on top of me
So I look to my Eskimo friend
I look to my Eskimo friend
I look to my Eskimo friend
When I'm down, down, down
Rain, it wets muddy roads
I find myself exposed
Tapping doors, but irritate
In search of destination
Harder now with higher speed
Washing in on top of me
So I look to my Eskimo friend
I look to my Eskimo friend
I look to my Eskimo friend
When I'm down
Kosketa minua - Touch me
Älä käsilläsi - Not with your hands
Vaan niin että tunnen sinut - But so that I feel you
Halaa minua - Hug me
Älä käsilläsi - Not with your hands
Mutta sielussasi - But within your soul
Minä kaipaan eskimo-ystävääni - I miss my eskimo friend
When I'm down, down, down
When I'm down, down, down
When I'm down, down, down
You say that they've all left you behind
Your heart broke when the party died
Drape your arms around me and softly say
Can we dance upon the tables again?
When your smile is so wide and your heels are so high
You can't cry
Get your glad rags on and let's sing along
To that lonely song
You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark
Ooh Laura, you're more than a superstar
And in this horror show
I've got to tell you so
Ooh Laura, you're more than a superstar
You say that you're stuck in a pale blue dream
And your tears feel hot on my bed sheets
Drape your arms around me and softly say
Can we dance upon the tables again?
Your smile is so wide and your heels are so high
You can't cry
Get your glad rags on and let's sing along
To that lonely song
You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark
Ooh Laura, you're more than a superstar
You'll be famous for longer than them
Your name is tattooed on every boy's skin
Ooh Laura, you're more than a superstar
You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark
Ooh Laura, you're more than a superstar
And in this old horror show
I've got to let you know
Ooh Laura, you're more than a superstar
You're more than a superstar
I sleep with windows open
I sleep with eyes wide
In case you would come walk in
In case you change your mind
But don't strain yourself for me
Don't break yourself for me
Don't lose your selfish ways for me.
I keep a leash around you
And I keep it nice and tight
In case you would go walking
Over forbidden lines
But don't go all soft on me
Don't come across for me
Don't lose your selfish ways over me.
Un, deux, trois
Quatre, cinq, six,
A hundred times around
You keep on flunking out
Keep me wanting more
Un, deux, trois
Quatre, cinq, six,
A hundred times is fine
For you I go all blind
Oh my, where is my mind?
I keep my window open.
I keep it open wide
So keep me keep it open
Oh keep me on your mind
Stay low
Soft, dark, and dreamless
Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness
I hate me for breathing without you
I don't want to feel anymore for you
Grieving for you
I'm not grieving for you
Nothing real love can't undo
And though I may have lost my way
All paths lead straight to you
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you
Halo
Blinding wall between us
Melt away and leave us alone again
Humming, haunted somewhere out there
I believe our love can see us through in death
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you
There's room inside for two
And I'm not grieving for you
I'm coming for you
You're not alone
No matter what they told you, you're not alone
I'll be right beside you forevermore
I long to be like you, sis
Lie cold in the ground like you did
There's room inside for two
And I'm not grieving for you
And as we lay in silent bliss
I know you remember me
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you
There's room inside for two
And I'm not grieving for you
I'm coming for you
I was alright for a while
I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say hello
Oh, you wished me well
You couldn't tell
That I'd been crying over you
Crying over you
When you said, "so long"
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
It's hard to understand
But the touch of your hand
Can start me crying
I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more
Than I did before
But, darling, what can I do?
For you don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying over you
Crying over you
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
I'm crying
Crying over you
Don't like the things you don't say
Leaving it for such a long, long time
Why do you show me those sad, sad eyes
Each time you decide to pass on by?
And when you smile
Those sad eyes
Look sadder and sadder still
Autumn's hue in those sad eyes
Makes me love and love them more
We'll have a bath, I'll make the dinner
Then I'll go away for a long, long time
But still, you've not passed by door
I can tell that you're lonely but it seems now
There's nothing you want me to do
I won't try to take the sadness from those eyes that I love
Leave it open for someone else to
Trying to hold it together
Keep my love as light as a feather
Sad eyes, baby
It's been such a long time
Keep my heart breaking in the dark
Come and spend the night
Sad eyes, I'm trying to hold it together
Keep my love as light as a feather
Keep my heart breaking in the dark
Come and spend the night
With one or two I get used to the room
We go slow when we first make our moves
But five or six bring you out to the car
Number nine with my head on the bar
And it's sad, but true. Out of cash and I.O.U's
I've got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent
Bring you back to the bar. Get you out of the cold
A sober straight face gets you out of your clothes
And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit
Who they'll kiss before they get home
I will lie awake
Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say
Barely conscious in the door where you stand
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute
I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do
And your hair smells of smoke
Who will cast the first stone?
You can sin or spend the night all alone
Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
If you let me have my way, I swear I'll tear you apart
'Cause it's all you can be
You're a drunk and you're scared
It's ladies night, all the girls drink for free
I will lie awake
Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say
I will lie awake
Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say
Good times for a change
See, the luck I've had
Can make a good man turn bad
So please, please, please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me get what I want
This time
Haven't had a dream in a long time
See, the life I've had
Can make a good man bad
So for once in my life
Let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time
Skies are crying, I am watching
Catching teardrops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like
There's nothing left of me?
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper
As the smoke clears, I awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better
To watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken
But I'm standing on my feet
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
And go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper
Go run, run, run
I'm gonna stay right here
Watch you disappear, yeah oh
Go run, run, run
Yeah, it's a long way down
But I am closer to the clouds up here
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper, oh woah
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
I wrote this novel just for you
It sounds pretentious but it's true
I wrote this novel just for you
That's why it's vulgar
That's why it's blue
And I say thank you
I say thank you
I wrote this novel just for Mom
For all the Mommy things she's done
For all the times she showed me wrong
For all the times she sang God's song
And I say thank you Mom
Hello Mom
Thank you Mom
Hi Mom
I read a book about Uncle Tom
Where whitey bastard made a bomb
But now Ebonics rule our song
Those motherfuckers got it wrong
And I ask
Who is uncle Tom?
Who is uncle Tom?
Who is uncle Tom?
You are
I read a book about the self
Said I should get expensive help
Go fix my head
Create some wealth
Put my neurosis on the shelf
But I don't care for myself
I don't care for myself
I don't care for myself
I don't care
I wrote this novel just for you
I'm so pretentious
Yes it's true
I wrote this novel just for you
Just for you
Just for you
It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer and singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
But it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money, then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry
He tried hard to help me, you know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty, made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
But I'm so hard to handle, I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby that I ever had
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye
It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer, singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
Here we go again
We'll carry on, my only friends
I'll take one chance without compromise
There isn't anything left to try
Here we go again
We'll carry on, but then again
We couldn't take this on, the story goes unformed
As if we never were there at all
You'll never see the courage I know
Its color's richness won't appear within your view
I'll never glow the way that you glow
Your presence dominates the judgments made on you
But as the scenery grows I see in different lights
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch; I see from greater heights
I understand what I am still too proud to mention... to you
You'll say you understand but you don't understand
You'll say you'll never give up seeing eye to eye
But never is a promise and you can't afford to lie
You'll never touch these things that I hold
The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own
You'll never feel the heat of this soul
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown... to you
You'll say don't fear your dreams; it's easier than it seems 
You'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so high 
But never is a promise and you can't afford to lie
You'll never live this life that I live 
I'll never live the life that wakes me in the night 
You'll never hear the message I give 
You'll say it looks as though I might give up this fight...
But as the scenery grows I see in different lights
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch; I see from greater heights
I realize what I am now too smart to mention... to you
You'll say you understand; you'll never understand
I'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or why
I don't know what to believe in; you don't know who I am
You'll say I'll need appeasing when I start to cry
But never is a promise and I'll never need a lie
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can't breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe
Without you, but I have to
Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can't breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe
Without you, but I have to
Its two a.m., feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
Its two a.m., feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh
I can't breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe
Without you, but I have to
Breathe
Without you, but I have to
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was "Goodbye"
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time
I hear the clock, it's 6 a.m.
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I've got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots off of the mirror
Don't leave my keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee, but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts bein' broken, more people being used
Put on my coat in the pourin' rain
I saw a movie, it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy, oh, I was sad, and
It made me miss you oh so bad 'cause
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
I go about my business, I'm doin' fine
Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line?
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken every day
I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up and then I turn the sheets down and then I
Take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my PJs and hop into bed
I'm half alive, but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll all be alright
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
And I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
Yeah, you were meant for me
And I was meant for you
Yes indeed I'm, alone again
And here comes emptiness, crashing in
Its either love or hate, I can't find in between
'Cause I've been with witches and I've been with the queen
It wouldn't have worked out anyway
So now it's just another lonely day
Hey, hey
Further along, we just may
But for now it's just another lonely day
Wish there was something I, could say or do
I can resist anything but, the temptation from you
But I'd rather walk alone, than chase you around
I'd rather fall myself than let you, drag me on down
It wouldn't have worked out anyway
And now it's just another lonely day
Hey, hey
Further along, we just may
But for now it's just another lonely day
Yesterday seems like a, life ago
'Cause the one I loved today, I hardly know
You I held so close, in my heart oh dear
Grow further from me with every, falling tear
It wouldn't have worked out anyway
So now it's just another lonely day
Hey, hey
Further along, we just may
But for now it's just another lonely day
For now its just another lonely day
Hey, hey
For now its just another lonely day
The imitation picks you up like a habit
Writing in the glow of the TV's static
Taking out the trash to the man
Give the people something they'd understand
A stick man flashing a fine-lined smile
Junk bond trader trying to sell a sucker a stock
Rich man in a poor man's clothes
The permanent installment of the daily dose
And you tell off when you tell it like it is
Your world's no wider than your hatred of his
Checking into a small reality
Boring as a drug you take too regularly
The athlete's laugh, the broken crutch
The first true love that folded at the slightest touch
Brought down like an old hotel
People digging through rubble for things they can resell
Happy holidays, sad sick savior
The leaving lover that I still favor
I won't take your medicine
I don't need a remedy
To be everything I'm supposed to be
I don't want nobody else
I can do it by myself
We're meant to be together
Now I'm a policeman directing traffic
Keeping everything moving, everything static
I'm a hitchhiker you'll recognize passing
On your way to some everlasting
Better sell it while you can
Better sell it while you can
Better sell it while you can
Better sell it while you can
Kiss me goodbye
Pushing out before I sleep
Can't you see I try?
Swimming the same deep water as you is hard
"The shallow drowned lose less than we" you breathe
The strangest twist upon your lips
"And we shall be together"
"Kiss me goodbye
Bow your head and join with me"
And face pushed deep, reflections meet
The strangest twist upon your lips
And disappear, the ripples clear
And laughing break against your feet
And laughing break the mirror sweet
"So we shall be together"
"Kiss me goodbye"
Pushing out before I sleep
It's lower now and slower now
The strangest twist upon your lips
But I don't see and I don't feel
But tightly hold up silently
My hands before my fading eyes
And in my eyes, your smile
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
I will kiss you
I will kiss you
I will kiss you forever on nights like this
I will kiss you
I will kiss you
And we shall be together
Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds, at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love, at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life, at all
I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life, at all
Hey, are you lonely?
Has summer gone so slowly?
We found the ground
And that damage was done
It's cold as you fade into the sun
Where'd you go? To me?
But you're alive!
Well, it's only
Fallen frames, they told me
You stand out, it's so loud
And so what if it is?
It's cold as you face into the wind
Where'd it go to? tonight the sun shall see its light
So what if you catch me,
Where would we land?
In somebody's life
For taking his hands
Sing to me hope as she's
Thrown on the sand
All of our work
Is rated again
Where to go?
And you were somehow the rain this thing could allow
I tried but it's all wrong
You're so strong
And this life and work
And choice took far too long
Where'd it go? tonight the sun shall see its light
So what if you catch me,
Where would we land?
In somebody's life
For taking his hands
Sing to me hope as she's
Thrown on the sand
All of our work
Is rated again
When I was sure you'd follow through
My world was turned to blue so thin
When you'd hide your songs would die
So I'd hide yours with mine
And all my words were bound to fail
I know you won't fail
See, I can tell
It's in your reach
Concentrate
It's in your reach
Concentrate
If you deny this
Then it's your fault
That God's in crisis
He's over
It's in your reach
Concentrate
It's in your reach
Concentrate
If you deny this
Then it's your fault
That God's in Crisis
He's over
Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space
Find me space
It's in your reach
Concentrate
It's in your reach
Concentrate
If you deny this
Then it's your fault
That God's in Crisis
He's over
Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
It falls apart
It falls apart
It falls apart
Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart?
Every time I rise I see you falling
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart?
It falls apart
It falls apart
It falls apart
Ooh ooh
I never needed you to be strong
I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
I never needed pain, I never needed strain.
My love for you was strong enough you should've known.
I never needed you for judgement
I never needed you to question what I spent
I never asked for help, I take care of myself,
I don't know why you think you got a hold on me.
And it's a little in the conversations
There isn't anything that you can say.
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so look at me and listen to me because,
I don't want to
Stay another minute
I don't want you
To say a single word
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
There is no other way
I get the final say
Because
I don't want to
Do this any longer
I don't want you
There's nothing left to say
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
I've already spoken
Our love is broken
Baby Hush Hush
I never needed your corrections
On everything from how I act to what I say
I never needed words, I never needed hurt,
I never needed you to be there everyday
I'm sorry for the way I let go
Of everything I wanted when you came along
But I am never beaten, broken, not defeated
I know next to you is not where I belong
And it's a little late for explanations
There isn't anything that you can do
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so you will listen when I say baby
I don't want to
Stay another minute
I don't want you
To say a single word
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
There is no other way
I get the final say
Because
I don't want to
Do this any longer
I don't want you
There's nothing left to say
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
I've already spoken
Our love is broken
Baby Hush Hush
No more words
No more lies
No more crying, ooh ooh
No more pain
No more hurt
No more trying, oh oh yeah
Because
I don't want to
Stay another minute
I don't want you
To say a single word
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
There is no other way
I get the final say
Because
I don't want to
Do this any longer
I don't want you
There's nothing left to say
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
I've already spoken
Our love is broken
Baby Hush Hush
Yeah Oh
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
I've already spoken
Our love is broken
Baby Hush Hush
What have I got to do to make you love me
What have I got to do to make you care
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there
What do I do to make you want me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I say when it's all over
Sorry seems to be the hardest word
It's sad (so sad), so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad), so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word
It's sad (so sad), so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad), so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word
What do I do to make you love me
Oh, what have I got to do to be heard
What do I do when lightning strikes me
What have I got to do
What have I got to do
When sorry seems to be the hardest word
In the night time we are found
Misty sorrow swoop unbound
Whisper you mean it, say you'll stay
Hold my heart till brighter days
Now I am searching how to get alone
This queen of heart's dancing on her throne
But I need sorrow, baby, life's sorrow is the drug
So will I ever find that place they call good love?
Good love
Passed it last night in a dream
Good love
And my heart caught fire
I drove past true love once, in a dream
Like a house that caught fire, it burned and flamed
Then the magician disappeared as quickly as he came
And with a sound like white magic caught in a black car's blazing trail
The house set fire to my heart
Like an inferno we shone rays
I swallowed the sun in your form
I woke up and you were crying
I woke up and you were saying
Good love
Passed it last night in a dream
Good love
Cause my heart caught fire
Good love
Passed it last night in a dream
Good love
Cause my heart caught fire
Instrumental
I am a bird girl
I am a bird girl
I am a bird girl now 
I've got my heart 
Here in my hands
I've got my heart
Here in my hands now 
I've been searching 
For my wings
I've been searching
For my wings some time 
I'm gonna be born 
Gonna be born
Into soon the sky 
I'm gonna be born
Into soon the sky
'Cause I'm a bird girl 
And the bird girls go to heaven 
I'm a bird girl 
And the bird girls can fly 
Bird girls can fly
Bird girls can fly
Bird girls can fly
Being a mistress on the side
It might not appeal to fools like you
We've been around on the side
Wanna be something you would do
But you haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen him
He's got the fire and he walks with fame
He's got the fire and he talks with fame
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me so sad, girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me so sad, girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl
Being a bad bitch on the side
It might not appeal to fools like you
We've been around when he gets high
It might not be something you would do
But you haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen him
He's got the fire and he walks with fame
He's got the fire and he talks with fame
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me so sad, girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me so sad, girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl
Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
I'm on fire, baby
I'm on fire
He's got the fire and he walks with fame
He's got the fire and he talks with fame
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me so sad, girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me so sad, girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl
I leave the gas on
Walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention
'Cause I'm sending all the signs
That the clock is ticking,
And I'll be giving my two weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black
You best prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me
I'm still breathing
And we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost the grip
Best abandon ship, oh-oh
Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack
No formal education
And I swore way too much
But I swear you didn't care
'Cause we were in love
So as I write this letter
And shed my last tear
It's all for the better
That we end this here
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me
I'm still breathing
And we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
And we've been diagnosed
So let's give up the ghost
'Cause I'm still breathing
And we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost the grip
Best abandon ship, oh-oh
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Even though I'll never need her
Even though she's only giving me pain
I'll be on my knees to feed her
Spend a day to make her smile again
Even though I'll never need her
Even though she's only giving me pain
As the world is soft around her 
Leaving me with nothing to disdain
Even though I'm not her minder
Even though she doesn't want me around
I am on my feet to find her
To make sure that she is safe and sound
Even though I'm not her minder
Even though she doesn't want me around
I am on my feet to find her
To make sure that she is safe from harm
The sun sets on the war
The day breaks and everything is new
The sun sets on the war
The day breaks and everything is new
Everything is new
Everything is new
Everything is new
The sun sets on the war
The day breaks and everything is new
Today's the Macy's Day Parade
The night of the living dead is on its way
With the credit report for duty call
It's a lifetime guarantee
Stuffed in a coffin, ten percent more free
Red light special at the mausoleum
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed to you
What's the consolation prize?
Economy-sized dreams of hope
When I was a kid, I thought
I wanted all the things that I haven't got
Oh, but I learned the hardest way
Then I realized what it took
To tell the difference between thieves and crooks
A lesson learned to me and you
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed
'Cause I'm thinking about a brand new hope, the one I've never known
'Cause now I know it's all that I wanted
What's the consolation prize?
Economy-sized dreams of hope
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed
'Cause I'm thinking about a brand new hope, the one I've never known
And where it goes
And I'm thinking about the only road, the one I've never known
And where it goes
And I'm thinking about a brand new hope, the one I've never known
'Cause now I know it's all that I wanted
I want to be a good woman
And I want for you to be a good man.
This is why I will be leaving
And this is why I can't see you no more.
I will miss your heart so tender
And I will love this love forever.
I don't want be a bad woman
And I can't stand to see you be a bad man.
I will miss your heart so tender
And I will love this love forever.
And this is why I am leaving
And this is why I can't see you no more.
This is why I am lying when I say
That I don't love you no more.
'Cause I want (to) be a good woman
And I want for you to be a good man.
Someone found the future as a statue in a fountain
At attention, looking backward in a pool of water
Wishes with a blue songbird on his shoulder
Who keeps singing over everything
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me
I picked up the song and found my picture in the paper
The reflection in the water showed an iron man still trying to salute
People from a time when he was everything he's supposed to be
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me
Everything means nothing to me
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone, and some remain
All these places, have their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead, and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one, compares with you
And these memories, lose their meaning
When I think of love, as something new
Though I know I'll never lose, affection
For people and things, that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose, affection
For people and things, that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
In my life, I love you more
Ooh
Every time the day darkens down and goes away pictures open in my head of me and you
Silent and cliché, all the things we did and didn't say covered up by what we did and didn't do
Going through every out I used to cop to make the repetition stop. What was I supposed to say?
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Now I never leave my zone, we're both alone, I'm going home
I wish I'd never seen your face
Well, I miss my mother and I miss being her son
As crazy as I was I, guess I wasn't much of one
Sometimes I miss her so much, I want to hop on the next jet
And I get lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
And I love my sister, Lord knows how I've missed her
She loves me and she knows I won't forget
And sometimes I get jealous of all her little pets
And I get lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
I roll over in bed looking for someone to touch
There's a girl that I know of that don't ask for much
She's homely and she's cranky, and her hair's in a net
And I'm lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
Are you my friend when I need one?
I need someone to be one, I'll take anybody I can get
Sometimes I wanna call you but I feel like a pest
And I'm lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
I go down to the river filled with regret
I go down and I wondered if there was any reason left
I left just before my lungs could get wet
I'm lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
And I love my sister, Lord knows how I've missed her
She loves me and she knows I won't forget
And sometimes I get jealous of all her little pets
And I get lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
Yeah, I get lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
You're tearing me apart
Crushing me inside
You used to lift me up
Now you get me down
If I was to walk away
From you, my love
Could I laugh again?
If I walk away from you
And leave my love
Could I laugh again?
Again, again...
You're killing me again
Am I still in your head?
You used to light me up
Now you shove me down
If I was to walk away
From you, my love
Could I laugh again?
If I walk away from you
And leave my love
Could I laugh again?
I'm losing you again
Lacking me inside
I used to lift you up
Now I get you down
Without your love
You're tearing me apart
With you close by
You're crushing me inside
Without your love
You're tearing me apart
Without your love
I'm doused in madness
I can't lose the sadness
Can't lose the sadness
Can't lose the sadness
You're tearing me apart
Crushing me inside
Without your love
(You used to lift me up)
You're crushing me inside
(Now you get me down)
With you close by
I'm doused in madness
Can't lose the sadness
It's ripping me apart
It's tearing me apart
It's tearing me apart
I don't know how
It's ripping me apart
It's tearing me apart
It's tearing me apart
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
Without your love
Without your love
Without your love
Without your love
It's tearing me apart
I'm not afraid of anything 
I just need to know that I can breathe 
I don't need much of anything 
But suddenly, suddenly 
I am small and the world is big 
All around me is fast moving 
Surrounded by so many things 
Suddenly, suddenly 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel? 
I am young and I am free 
But I get tired and I get weak 
I get lost and I can't sleep 
But suddenly, suddenly 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel? 
Would you comfort me? 
Would you cry with me? 
I am small and the world is big 
But I am not afraid of anything 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel? 
How does it feel, how does it feel 
You're different from me, different
The food that I'm eating
Is suddenly tasteless
I know I'm alone now
I know what it tastes like
So break me to small parts
Let go in small doses
But spare some for spare parts
There might be some good ones
Like you might make a dollar
I'm inside your mouth now
Behind your tonsils
Peeking over your molars
You're talking to her now
You've eaten something minty
And you're making that face that I like
And you're going in, in for the kill, kill
For the killer kiss, kiss
For the kiss, kiss
I need your money, it'll help me
I need your car and I need your love
I need your money, it'll help me
I need your car and I need your love
So won't you help a brother out?
Won't you help a brother out?
Won't you help a brother out, out, out, out, out?
Just break me to small parts
Let go in small doses
But spare some for spare parts
You might make a dollar
You might make a dollar
Dollar
You might make a dollar
So won't you help a brother out?
Won't you help a brother out?
Won't you help a brother out, out, out, out, out?
Just break me to small parts
Let go in small doses
But spare some for spare parts
There might be some good ones
You might make a dollar
(There might be some good ones)
There might be some good ones
(You might make a dollar)
You might make a dollar
(There might be some good ones)
There might be some good ones
Hey, hey
Just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today
And I forget how to move
When my mouth is this dry
And my eyes are bursting hearts
In a blood-stained sky
Ah, it was sweet
It was wild
And oh, how we
I trembled
Stuck in honey
Honey, cling to me
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home
Ah, just one more
And I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home
To never go home
Never look her in the eyes
Never tell the truth
If she knows you're paper
You know she'll have to burn you
Never tell the one you want
That you do
Save it for the deathbed
When you know you kept her wanting you
And do everything
She'd never do
Fall asleep with stranger's wives
The wild wives of unknown men
Good for you, you've just become
Just another one of them
Never say you miss her
Never say a word
And do everything
She'd never do
Don't let her see
Your cardinal eyes
Let her treat you like a criminal
So you can treat her like a priest
Girls, forgive my human mind
Girls, forgive me one more time
Never tell the one you love
That you do
Save it for the deathbed
And do everything
She'd never do
Don't let her see
Your cardinal eyes
Don't let her see
Your cardinal eyes
Jesus Christ, you have confused me
Cornered, wasted, blessed, and used me
Forgive me, girls, I am confused
Stiff, and pissed, and lost, and loose
Jesus Christ, you have confused me
Cornered, wasted, blessed, and used me
Forgive me, girls, I am confused
Stiff, and pissed, and lost, and loose
In the corner
Beside my window
There hangs a lonely photograph
There is no reason 
I'd never notice 
A memory that could hold me back 
There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know
You'll never return to this place
Gone through days
Without talking
There is a comfort
In silence
So used to losing
All ambition 
Struggling to maintain what's left
There is a wound that's always bleeding 
There is a road I'm always walking 
And I know
You'll never return to this place 
Once undone
There's only smoke 
Burning in my eyes to blind 
To cover up
What really happened 
Force the darkness unto me
There is a wound that's always bleeding 
There is a road I'm always walking 
And I know you'll never return to this place
Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me, with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
When the sun came up,
We were sleeping in,
Sunk inside our blankets,
Sprawled across the bed,
And we were dreaming,
There are moments when,
When I know it and
The world revolves around us,
And we're keeping it,
Keep it all going,
This delicate balance,
Vulnerable all knowing,
Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would
Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, you would...
Sing me something soft,
Sad and delicate,
Or loud and out of key,
Sing me anything,
We're glad for what we've got,
Done with what we've lost
Our whole lives laid out right in front of us,
Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would,
Sing like you think no one's listening,
You would kill for this,
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit,
You would, you would...
Sing me something soft,
Sad and delicate,
Or loud and out of key,
Sing me anything.
Excuse me but can I be you for a while?
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
I got the anti-Christ in the kitchen yelling at me again
Yeah, I can hear that
Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say you know but nothing comes
Yes, I know what you think of me, you never shut up
Yeah, I can hear that
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it?
Hey, but I don't care 'cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice and it's been
Here, silent all these years
So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts?
Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you?
My scream got lost in a paper cup
I think there's a heaven where some screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough
To get us there?
'Cause what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it?
Hey, but I don't care 'cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice and it's been
Here, silent all these years
Years go by, will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand?
Years go by, if I'm stripped of my beauty
I'm the orange clouds raining in my hand
Years go by, will I choke on my tears
'Til finally there is nothing left?
One more casualty
You know we're too easy, easy, easy
Well, I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now but baby, don't look up
The sky is falling
Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody looking at you, here, take hold of my hand
Yeah, I can hear them
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of yours with her name still on it?
Hey, but I don't care 'cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice
I hear my voice, I hear my voice and it's been
Here, silent all these years
I've been here, silent all these years
Silent all these, silent all these years
No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore
If living is without you
Last time I saw you, you were on stage
Your hair was wild, your eyes were bright
And you were in a rage
You were swinging your guitar around
'Cause they wanted to hear that sound
But you didn't want to play
And I don't blame you
I don't blame you
Been around the world, in many situations
Been inside many heads in different positions
But you never wanted them that way
What a cruel price you thought that you had to pay
Them back for all that shit on stage
But it never made sense to them anyway
Could you imagine when they turned their backs
They were only scratching their heads
'Cause you simply deserve the best
And I don't blame you
I don't blame you
They said you were the best
But then they were only kids
Then you would recall the deadly houses you grew up in
Just because they knew your name
Doesn't mean they know from where you came
What a sad trick you thought that you had to play
But I don't blame you
They never owned it
And you never owed it to them anyway
I don't blame you
Well I held you like a lover
Happy hands and your elbow in the appropriate place
And we ignored our others, happy plans
For that delicate look upon your face
Our bodies moved and hardened
Hurting parts of your garden
With no room for a pardon
In a place where no one knows what we have done
Do you come
Together ever with him?
And is he dark enough?
Enough to see your light?
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
Is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
Does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?
Well you held me like a lover
Sweaty hands and my foot in the appropriate place
And we use cushions to cover
Happy glands in the mild issue of our disgrace
Our minds pressed and guarded
While our flesh disregarded
The lack of space for the light-hearted
In the boom that beats our drum
Well I know I make you cry
And I know sometimes you wanna die
But do you really feel alive without me?
If so, be free
If not, leave him for me
Before one of us has accidental babies
For we are in love
Do you come
Together ever with him?
Is he dark enough?
Enough to see your light?
Do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?
What about me?
If you're sleeping are you dreaming
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me
Mother:
Hi, Justin, this is your mother.
It's 2:33 on Monday afternoon.
I was just calling to see how you were doing, you sounded really uptight last night, it made me a little nervous, and well it made me nervous that it sounded like you were nervous, too.
I just want to make sure you are really okay and wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication too.
You know I love ya!
Take care, honey, I know you're under a lot of pressure.
See ya.
Bye, bye!
I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape, to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head, that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you, will you never call again?
And will you never say that you love me, just to put it in my face
And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
I'm sober now for three whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing that I won't touch again
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I have made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry, and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, "Make it go away"
Just make her smile come back and shine, just like it used to be
And then she whispered, "How can you do this to me?"
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
For you
For you
For you
If you're sleeping are you dreaming
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me
Hey, Justin! [12x]
Oh I do believe
In all the things you see
What comes is better
Than what came before
And you better come come 
Come come to me
Better come come come come come to me
Better run run run run run to me
Better come
Oh I do believe
In all the things you see
What comes is better
Than what came before
And you better
Run run run run to me
Better run run run run run to me
Better come come come come come to me
Better run
Passed out on the overpass, Sunday best and broken glass
Broken down from the bikes and bars
Suspended like spirits over speeding cars
You and me were kings over the parkway tonight
And tonight will go on forever while we
Walk around this town like we own the streets
And stay awake through summer like we own the heat
Singing Everybody wake up (Wake up)
It's time to get down. (Everybody wake up, it's time to get down)
And when I pass the bottle back to Pete
On the overpass tonight, I bet we laugh
I'm gonna stay eighteen forever (Cut me open)
So we can stay like this forever (Sun poisoned)
And we'll never miss a party (This offer...)
'Cause we keep them going constantly (...Stands forever)
And we'll never have to listen (New haircut)
To anyone about anything (New Bracelet)
'Cause it's all been done and it's all been said (Eyeliner)
We're the coolest kids and we take what we can get
The hell out of this town
And find some conversation
The low fuel lights been on for days
It doesn't mean anyhting
I've got another 500 'nother 500 miles
Before we shut this engine down
(We shut it down)
I'm gonna stay eighteen forever (Cut me open)
So we can stay like this forever (Sun poisoned)
And we'll never miss a party (This offer...)
'Cause we keep them going constantly (...Stands forever)
And we'll never have to listen (New haircut)
To anyone about anything (New Bracelet)
'Cause it's all been done and it's all been said (Eyeliner)
We're the coolest kids and we take what we can get (Wait forever)
(you're just jealous 'cause I'm young and in love)
Eighteen forever (first kisses)
(your stomach's filled up but you're starved for conversation)
So we can stay like this forever (new stitches)
(you're spending all your nights growing old in your bed)
And we'll never miss a party (collar weekend)
(and your tearin up your photos cause you wanna forget... it's over)
'Cause we keep them going constantly (appearance ticket)
(you're just jealous 'cause we're young and in love)
And we'll never have to listen (November to...)
(your stomach's filled up but you're starved for conversation)
To anyone about anything 'cause it's all been done (...remember)
(you're spending all your nights growing old in your bed)
And it's all been said (nightswimmers)
(and your tearin up your photos cause you wanna forget... it's over)
We're the coolest kids and we take what we can get
Just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
Your just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
Your just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
Your just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
Your just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
Just jealou-
(turntable scratch)
Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
Just stay with me
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
It don't matter when you turn
Gonna survive
You live and learn
I've been thinking about you, baby
By the light of dawn
A midnight blue, day and night
I've been missing you
I've been thinking about you, baby
Almost makes me crazy
Come and live with me
Either way, win or lose
When you're born into trouble
You live the blues
I've been thinking about you, baby
See it almost makes me crazy
Child, nothing's right, if you ain't here
I'll give all that I have just to keep you near
I wrote you a letter, I tried to make it clear
That you just don't believe that I'm sincere
I've been thinking about you, baby
Plans and schemes
Hopes and fears
Dreams that deny for all these years
I, I've been thinking about you, baby
Living with me, well
I've been thinking about you, baby
Makes me wanna
Child, nothing's right, if you ain't here
I'll give all that I have just to keep you near
I wrote you a letter, darling, tried to make it clear
Oh, but you just don't believe that I'm sincere
I've been thinking about you, baby
I want you to live with me, well
I've been thinking about you, baby
I want you to live with me
See the storm is broken
In the middle of the night
Nothing left here for me
It's washed away
The rain pushes
The buildings aside
The sky turns black
The sky
Wash it far
Push it out to sea
There's nothing left here
For me
I watch it lift up to the sky
I watch it crush me
And then I die
Speak to me baby
In the middle of the night
Pull your mouth
Close to mine
I can see the wind coming down
Like black night
So speak to me
Like the winds outside
It's broken up, pushing us
Hear the rain fall
See the wind come to my eyes
See the storm broken
Now nothing
Speak to me baby
In the middle of the night
Speak to me
Hold your mouth to mine
'Cause the sky is breaking
It's deeper than love
I know the way you feel
Like the rains outside
Speak to me
Crawl across toward your window
I'm calling softly from the street
Always a lonely widow
Half-awake and sleeping on my feet
I'm of age but have no children
No quarter phone booth calls to home
Just late night television
Inside my bedroom all alone
There is no use in waiting
Offer up your steps so I can climb
Show me all your figure paintings
Etched in the middle of the night
Let me stretch upon your carpet
Let me hear the rain tap on your street
Knowing I am safe on the inside
Blankets wrapped and drifting off to sleep
Don't turn away
I pray you've heard
The words I've spoken
Dare to believe
Over one last time
Then I let the
Darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again
On my own
Carry me away
I need your strength
To get me through this
Dare to believe
Over one last time
Then I let the darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
Dare to believe
Over one last time
Then I let the darkness cover me
Denied everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again
On my own
On my own
All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I the girl that you dream of?
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world
I'll wait for you, babe
It's all I do, babe
You don't come through, babe
You never do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
All those special times I spent with you, my love
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
But I don't really mind, I've got much more than that
Like my memories, I don't need that
I'll wait for you, babe
You don't come through, babe
You never do, babe
That's just what you do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
Don't say you need me when
You're leaving, you leave again
I'm stronger than all my men
Except for you
Don't say you need me if
You're leaving us, you're leaving
I can't do it, I can't do it
But you do it well
'Cause I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
Pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
Pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
Abraham
Worth a righteous one
Take up on the wood
Put it on your son
Lake or lamb
There is none to harm
When the angel came
You had raised your arm
Abraham
Put off on your son
Take instead the ram
Until Jesus comes
Eli, the barrow boy of the old town
Sells coal and marigolds and he cries out
All down the day
Below the tamaracks he is crying
"Corn cobs and candle wax for the buying"
All down the day
Would I could afford to buy my love a fine robe
Made of gold and silk, Arabian thread
But she is dead and gone and lying in a pine grove
And I must push my barrow all the day
And I must push my barrow all the day
Eli, the barrow boy when they found him
Dressed all in corduroy, he had drowned in
The river down the way
They laid his body down in a church yard
But still, when the moon is out, with his push cart
He calls down the day
Would I could afford to buy my love a fine gown
Made of gold and silk, Arabian thread
But I am dead and gone and lying in a church ground
And still I push my barrow all the day
Still I push my barrow all the day
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
'Cause nobody told me
That you'd be here
And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young
Softly we tremble tonight,
Picture perfect fading smiles are all that's left in sight,
I said I'd never leave you'll never change
I'm not satisfied with where I'm at in life.
Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price.
Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price.
You said, you said that you would die for me.
We made plans to grow old,
Believe me there was truth in all those stories that I told.
Lost in a simple game cat and mouse are we the same people as before this came to light?
Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price.
Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price.
You said, you said that you would die for me.
You must live for me too
For me too, yeah, yeah
You said that you would die for me...
Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price.
Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price.
You said, you said that you would die for me.
You said that you would die for me
You said that you would die for me oh oh
You said that you would die for me
Oh oh oh
Mother, where are you today? 
You took a piece of me the day you went away, 
No recollection nor the smell of your perfume, 
I took a piece of you the day I left the womb. 
Brother, put your needles down. 
The best thing for you is to leave this awful town. 
Pretty soon, you'll have kids to feed. 
If you see mother, tell her I can sing
Please don't worry, I am doing fine. 
You're much to busy to even find the time, 
So use your chemicals and take this to your grave, 
The boys you left are men you didn't raise. 
And daddy, how are you today? 
You must be proud of the boys that you have raised. 
Your withered heart and everything it's seen
Your guts and callouses, you had kids to feed. 
You had kids to feed. 
Please don't worry, I am doing fine. 
You're much to busy to even find the time, 
So use your chemicals and take this to your grave, 
The boys you left are men you didn't raise.
She just walked away
Why didn't she tell me, and where do I go tonight?
This isn't happening to me, this can't be happening to me
She didn't say a word, just walked away
You were the first to say that we were not okay
You were the first to lie when we were not alright
This was my first love, she was the first to go
And when she left me for you, I was the last to know
Why didn't she tell me where to go tonight?
She didn't say a word, she just walked away
You were the first to say that we were not okay
You were the first to lie when we were not alright
This was my first love, she was the first to go
And when she left me for you, I was the last to know
I'll be the first to say that now I'm okay
And for the first time I've opened up my eyes
This was my worst love; you'll be the first to go
And when she leaves you for dead, you'll be the last to know
I'll be the first to say that now I'm okay
And for the first time I've opened up my eyes
This was my worst love; you'll be the first to go
And when she leaves you for dead, you'll be the last to know
The bridge is all crumbled
The water soaks into rocks
That fell at the bottom of the road
(At the end of town)
The town we lived in
The memories shaken apart
From the weeds that grow
Over the
Sidewalks
Running away from the streets we knew
Sidewalks
Like the time we thought was made for you
Out on the front porch
Watching the cars as they go by
(Eighteen blue, twenty-one gray)
Looking ahead
For the first time that we could drive
Out on our own
To speed away
From the...
All of the days have passed us by
All of the sun is gone away
I'm not alone
I wish I was
'Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now
I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pain
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate
Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all
When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart
Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all
I can't be sure that this state of mine
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test
For loneliness like this
Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

Messages waiting on me when
I come home
She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me
I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad
She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable
She's a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad
But I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I catch in my throat
Choke
Torn into pieces
I won't - no
I don't want to be this
But I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
Won't let this build up inside of me
Won't let this build up inside of me
She isn't real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
I can't make her real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
She isn't real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
I can't make her real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
You're GONE!
You're GONE!
Your body's cold
Hope is lost, I can't let go.
Can I die with you so we can never grow old?
Cut the ties,
With this note you left behind,
As I read the words I hear you telling me why
Too late, too late,
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late,
Can't even ask you why.
And now I'm wasting
Away in my own misery.
I hope you're finally gone
To a place where you belong.
My sadness shows
As your name is carved in stone.
Can't erase the words so the reality grows.
I wish I died
On that night right by your side,
So just kill me now and let the good times roll!
Too late, too late,
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late,
Can't even ask you why.
And now I'm wasting
Away in my own misery.
I hope you're finally gone
To a place where you belong.
Will you wait for me?
Will I see you on the other side?
You won't have to wait too long, yeah, yeah.
Will you come for me?
Will you take me to the other side?
Cause here I don't belong.
Too late, too late,
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late,
Can't even ask you why.
And now I'm wasting
Away in my own misery.
I hope you're finally gone
To a place where you belong.
I never said goodbye
Can't even ask you why.
I'm wasting!
Away in my own misery.
I hope you're finally gone
To a place where you belong!
Anyone can tell you there's no more road to ride
Everyone will tell you there's no place to hide
There's no laws or rules to unchain your life
But the ones who didn't make it
The ones who couldn't take it
So glad they made it out alive
Everyone loves the fun, everyone comes by
In the wind I crunch, I want to die
They can give me pills
Or let me drink my fill
The heart wants to explode
Far away where nobody knows
Do you believe she said that?
Do you believe she said that?
I said I hate myself and I want to die
Half of it is innocent
The other half is wise
The whole damn thing makes no sense
I wish I could tell you a lie
Hey, come here
Let me whisper in your ear
I hate myself and I want to die
Do you believe she said that?
Can you believe she repeated that?
I said I hate me, myself and I
I said I hate myself and I want to die
Instrumental
(Hey! Ain't life wonderful?)
(Isn't it wonderful, so wonderful, wonderful, etc)
(Isn't everything wonderful?)
(Isn't it wonderful now?)
I close my eyes when I get too sad
I think thoughts that I know are bad
Close my eyes and I count to ten
Hope it's over when I open them
I want the things that I had before
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten
And make everything be wonderful again
I hope my mom and I hope my dad
Will figure out why they get so mad
I hear them scream, I hear them fight
They say bad words that makes me wanna cry
Close my eyes when I go to bed and I
Dream of angels who make me smile
I feel better when I hear them say that
Everything will be wonderful someday
Promises mean everything
When you're little and the world's so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
Tell me everything is wonderful now
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
I go to school and I run and play
I tell the kids that it's all okay
I laugh a lot so my friends won't know
That when the bell rings I just don't want to go home
Go to my room and I close my eyes
I make believe that I have a new life
I don't believe you when you say that
Everything will be wonderful someday
Promises mean everything
When you're little and the world is so big (so big)
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
When you tell me everything is wonderful now
No, no
I don't want to hear you tell me
Everything is wonderful now
No, no
I don't want to hear you tell me
Everything is wonderful now
I don't want to hear you say
That I will understand someday
No, no, no, no
Don't want to hear you say
That you both have grown in a different way
No, no, no
No, I don't want to meet your friend
And I don't want to start over again
I just want my life to be the same
Just like it used to be
Somedays I hate everything
I hate everything
Everyone and everything
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
No
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
Don't tell me everything is wonderful now, no
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
Yeah, yeah everything is wonderful now
Oh yeah, everything is wonderful now
Everything is wonderful now
Now, now
Everything is wonderful now
I woke up early this morning around 4a.m.
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's okay, there's nothing left to say, but
Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.
I went out driving, trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been.
So
Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me.
Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life.
Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me.
Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.
And you're gonna think of me
Oh, someday baby, someday
I won't regret saying this
This thing that I'm saying
Is it better than keeping my mouth shut
That goes without saying
Call, break it off
Call, break my own heart
Maybe I would have been something you'd be good at
Maybe you would have been something I'd be good at
But now we'll never know
I won't be sad
But in case I go there
Everyday, to make myself feel bad
There's a chance that I'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do
I won't be out long
But I still think it better if
You take your time coming over here
I think that's for the best
Call, break it off
Call, break my own heart
Maybe I would have been something you'd be good at
Maybe you would have been something I'd be good at
But now we'll never know
I won't be sad
But in case I go there
Everyday, to make myself feel bad
There's a chance that I'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do
I'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do
Where is my love?
Where is my love?
Horses galloping
Bring him to me
Where is my love?
Where is my love?
Horses running free
Carrying you and me
Where is my love?
Where is my love?
Safe and warm
So close to me
In my arms 
Finally
There is my love
There is my love
Horses galloping
Bringing him to me
Where is my love?
Where is my love?
Hold your grandmother's bible
To your breast
Gonna put it to the test
You wanted it to be blessed
And in your heart
You know it to be true
You know what you gotta do
They all depend on you
And you already know
Yeah, you already know
How this will end
There is no escape
From the slave-catchers' songs
For all of the loved ones gone
Forever's not so long
And in your soul
They poked a million holes
But you never let 'em show
C'mon it's time to go
And you already know
Yeah, you already know
How this will end
Now you've seen his face
And you know that there's a place in the sun
For all that you've done
For you and your children
No longer shall you need
You always wanted to believe
Just ask and you'll receive
Beyond your wildest dreams
And you already know
Yeah, you already know
How this will end
You already know (you already know)
You already know (you already know)
You already love will end
You touched these tired eyes of mine
And map my face out line by line
And somehow growing old feels fine
I listen close for I'm not smart
You wrap your thoughts in works of art
And they're hanging on
The walls of my heart
I may not have the softest touch
I may not say the words as such
And though I may not look like much
I'm yours
And though my edges maybe rough
I never feel I'm quite enough
I may not seem like very much
But I'm yours
You healed these scars over time
Embraced my soul you loved my mind
You're the only angel in my life
The day news came my best friend died
My knees went weak and you saw me cry
Say I'm still the soldier in your eyes
I may not have the softest touch
I may not say the words as much
And though I may not look like much
I'm yours
And though my edges may be rough
I never feel I'm quite enough
It may not seem like very much
But I'm yours
I may not have the softest touch
I may not say the words as much
I know I don't fit in that much
But I'm yours
I've got enough on my mind
That when she pulls me by the hair
She hasn't much to hold onto
She's keeping count on her hand
One, two, three days that I've been sleeping on my side
I've finished kissing my death
So now I head back up the steps
Thinking about where I've been
I mean it's always never like this
I wanna feel with the seasons
I guess it makes sense
'Cause my life's become as vapid as
A night out in Los Angeles
And I just wanna stay in bed
And hold you like I used to
You know that I am home
So darling if you love me
Would you let me know?
Well, go on, go on, go on
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one
Always packing all my stuff?
For once, for once, for once
I've got the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one
Always packing all my stuff?
She got enough on her mind
But now she feels no sorrow
I let my faith fill the air
So now she's rolling down the window
Never been one to hold on
But I need a last breath
So I ask if she remembers when
She used to come and visit me
We were fools to think that nothing would go wrong
Go on, go on, go on
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one
Always packing all my stuff?
For once, for once, for once
I've got the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one
Always packing all my stuff?
I think I kinda like it but I might have had too much
I'll move back down
To this western town
When they find me out
Make no mistake about it
I'll move back down
To this western town
When they find me out
Make no mistake about it
(I'll move back down)
Go on, go on, go on
(To this western town)
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one
Always packing all my stuff?
Go on, go on, go on
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one
Always packing all my stuff?
For once, for once, for once
I've got the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one
Always packing all my stuff?
I think I kinda like it but I mighta had too much
I'll move back down
Katie, don't cry
I know you're trying your hardest
And the hardest part is letting go
Of the nights we share
Ocala is calling
And you know it's haunting
But compared to your eyes
Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it
So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there
And you're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes, because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess that I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable at best
You're all that I hoped to find in every single way
And everything I will give is everything you couldn't take
Cause nothing feels like home
You're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay
'Cause I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet and I need it
So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there
And you're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes, because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess that I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable at best
And this'll be the first time in a week that I'll talk to you
And I can't speak
Been three whole days since I've had sleep
'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong
And I miss the lips that made me fly
So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there
And you're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes, because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess that I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable
And I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable
And I can live without you
Oh, without you I'll be miserable at best
There's a place in the sun for anyone
Who has the will
To chase one and I think I've found mine
Yes, I do believe I have found mine
So, close your eyes
And think of someone you physically admire
And let me kiss you, oh
Let me kiss you, oh
I zig-zagged all over America
And I cannot find a safety haven
Say, would you let me cry on your shoulder
I've heard that you'll try anything twice
Close your eyes
And think of someone you physically admire
And let me kiss you, oh
Let me kiss you, oh
But then you open your eyes
And you see someone that you physically despise
But my heart is open
My heart is open to you
There's a Possibility,
There's a Possibility,
All that I had was all I'm gonn' get.
There's a Possibility,
There's a Possibility,
All I'm gonna get is gonna be yours then
All I'm gonna get is gonna be yours then.
So tell me when you hear my heart stop
You're the only one that knows
Tell me when you hear my silence
There's a possibility I wouldn't know.
Know that when you leave,
Know that when you leave,
By blood and by me, you walk like a thief
By blood and by me, and I fall when you leave.
So tell me when you hear my heart stop
You're the only one that knows
Tell me when you hear my silence
There's a possibility I wouldn't know.
So tell me when my silence's over
You're the reason why I'm closed
Tell me when you hear me falling
There's a possibility it wouldn't show.
By blood and by me, and I'll fall when you leave.
By blood and by me, I follow your lead.
I know you've fallen again
The way I fell before
'Cause I'm a bad loser
When you get your way
And I know that I'm chained
I'm chained again
And you've lost your way
To the bed that I once made
'Cause I'm a bad habit
One you cannot shake
And I hope that I change
Don't follow me, don't follow me
'Cause if I go
Where the floweres grow
Into that deep below
Oh, would you forget me now?
Still small, small voice of calm
Place the blame into my arms
'Cause I'm a bad habit
One you cannot shake
Oh, Mary mercy
Would you pray for me?
Would you pray for me?
'Cause if I go
Where the floweres grow
Into that deep below
Oh, would you forget me now?
And if I could
Make the days okay
Wash the stains away
Oh, would you forgive me now?
'Cause I've made my mistakes
And I feel something's changed
And I know what's at stake
Wash the stains away
'Cause if I go
Where the floweres grow
Into that deep below
Oh, would you forget me now?
And if I could
Take the pain away
Wash the stains away
Oh, would you forgive me now?
I've made my mistakes
And I feel something's changed
And I know what's at stake
Wash the stains away
And I feel quite okay
Take a breath, I pull myself together
Just another step until I reach the door
You'll never know the way it tears me up inside to see you (oh... oh...)
I wish that I could tell you something (oh... oh...)
To take it all away
Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up till it's over
If it takes you forever, I want you to know
When I hear your voice, it's drowning in the whispers
You're just skin and bones, there's nothing left to take
And no matter what I do, I can't make you feel better (oh... oh...)
If only I could find the answer (oh... oh...)
To help me understand
Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up till it's over
If it takes you forever, I want you to know
That if you fall, stumble down, I'll pick you up off the ground
If you lose faith in you, I'll give you strength to pull through
Tell me you won't give up 'cause I'll be waiting
If you fall, you know, I'll be there for you
(Oh... oh...) If only I could find the answer
(Oh... oh...) To take it all away
Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up till it's over
If it takes you forever, I want you to know
I wish I could save you
I want you to know
I wish I could save you
Millionaires say
Got a big shot deal
And thrown it all away but
But I'm not too sure
How I'm supposed to feel
Or what I'm supposed to say but
I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels
To handle every day
And I miss you love
Make room for the prey
'Cause I'm coming in
With what I wanna say but
It's gonna hurt
And I love the pain
A breeding ground for hate but
I'm not, not sure,
Not too sure how it feels
To handle everyday
Like the one that just passed
In the crowds of all the people
Remember today
I've no respect for you
And I miss you love
And I miss you love
I love the way you love
But I hate the way
I'm supposed to love you back
It's just a fad
Part of the teen, teenage angst brigade and
I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels
To handle everyday
Like the one that just passed
In the crowds of all the people
Remember today
I've no respect for you
And I miss you love
And I miss you love
Remember today
I've no respect for you
And I miss you love
And I missed you
I love the way you love
But I hate the way
I'm supposed to love you back
My lover's gone, 
His boots no longer by my door, 
He left at dawn, 
And as I slept I felt him go, 
Returns no more, 
I will not watch the ocean, 
My lover's gone,
No earthly ships will ever bring him home again,
Bring him home again.
My lover's gone, 
I know that kiss will be my last, 
No more his song, 
The tune upon his lips has passed 
I sing alone, 
While I watch the ocean, 
My lover's gone, 
No earthly ships will ever bring him home again, 
Bring him home again.
So denied, so I lied
Are you the now or never kind?
In a day and a day love
I'm gonna be gone for good again
Are you willing to be had?
Are you cool with just tonight?
Here's a toast to all those
Who hear me all too well
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to goodbye
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon
Put your name on the line
Along with place and time
Wanna stay not to go
I wanna ditch the logical
Here's a toast to all those
Who hear me all too well
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to goodbye
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon
All my time is frozen motion
Can't I stay an hour or two or more?
Don't let me let you go
Don't let me let you go
Here's a toast to all those
Who hear me all too well
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to goodbye
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon, too soon
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to goodbye
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon
The boy done wrong again
Hang your head in shame and cry your life away
The boy done wrong again
Hang your head in shame and cry your life away
Are you ok now?
On Saturday I was an angel shining fair
You shone louder, longer
You put my shine to shame
Put me to shame now
What is it I must do to pay for all my crimes?
What is it I must do?
I would do it all the time
Do it all the time now
All that I wanted was to sing the saddest songs
And if you would sing along I will be happy now
The woodland spring has put the darkness from your thinking
If this town's your sinking ship
Then you know where to jump
Talking dirty for a hobby that's alright
So pour another glass of wine
I'll think of England this time
All I wanted was to sing the saddest songs
And if you would sing along
Oh if you would sing along
If you'd only sing along
I will be happier
You look so fine
I want to break your heart
And give you mine
You're taking me over
It's so insane
You've got me tethered and chained
I hear your name
And I'm falling over
I'm not like all of the other girls
I can't take it like the other girls
I won't share it like the other girls
That you used to know
You look so fine
Knocked down
Cried out
Been down just to find out
I'm through
Bleeding for you
I'm open wide
I want to take you home
We'll waste some time
You're the only one for me
You look so fine
I'm like the desert tonight
Leave her behind
If you want to show me
I'm not like all the other girls
I can't take it like the other girls
I won't fake it like the other girls
That you used to know
You're taking me over
Over and over
I'm falling over
Over and over
You're taking me over
(Melt in me one more time)
Over and over
(Hide inside me tonight)
I'm falling over
(Do what you want to do)
Over and over
(Let's pretend, happy end)
You're taking me over
(Let me know, let it show)
Over and over
(Ending with letting go)
I'm falling over
Ending with letting go 
Ending with letting go
Ending with letting go
Let's pretend, happy end
Let's pretend, happy end
Let's pretend, happy end
Let's pretend, happy end
My life is changing in so many ways
I don't know who to trust anymore
There's a shadow running through my days
Like a beggar going from door to door
I was thinking that maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
It's hard to make that change
When life and love turns strange
And old
To give a love, you gotta live a love
To live a love, you gotta be part of
When will I see you again?
A while ago somewhere I don't know when
I was watching a movie with a friend
I fell in love with the actress
She was playing a part that I could understand
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
A man needs a maid
When will I see you again?
One of these mornings
Won't be very long
You will look for me
And I'll be gone
One of these mornings
Won't be very long
You will look for me
And I'll be gone
One of these mornings
Won't be very long
You will look for me
And I'll be gone
One of these mornings (one of these mornings)
Won't be very long (won't be very long)
You will look for me (you will look for me)
And I'll be gone (and I'll be gone)
(And I'll be gone)
(And I'll be gone)
(And I'll be gone)
(And I'll be gone)
(And I'll be gone)
(And I'll be gone)
You will look for me (and I'll be gone)
(And I'll be gone)
You will look for me (and I'll be gone)
(And I'll be gone)
You will look for me (and I'll be gone)
(And I'll be gone)
You will look for me
One of these mornings
Won't be very long
You will look for me
And I'll be gone
It's the first day
Of spring
And my life is starting over again
Well, the trees grow
The river flows
And its water will wash away my sin
For I do believe
That everyone
Has one chance
To fuck up their lives
Like a cut down tree
I will rise again
I'll be bigger
And stronger than ever before
If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
There's a hope 
In every new seed
And every flower that grows upon the Earth
And though I love you
And you know that
Well I no longer know what that's worth
And I'll come back to you
In a year or so
And rebuild
Ready to become
Oh the person
You believed in
Or the person
That you used to love
If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me
I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad
She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable
She's a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad
But I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I catch in my throat
Choke
Torn into pieces
I won't - no
I don't want to be this
But I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
Won't let this build up inside of me
Won't let this build up inside of me
She isn't real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
I can't make her real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
She isn't real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
I can't make her real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
Ah
Thought you'd be looking for the next in line to love
Then ignore, put out and put away
And so you'd soon be leaving me
Alone like I'm supposed to be
Tonight, tomorrow and everyday
There's nothing here that you'll miss
I can guarantee you this
Is a cloud of smoke
Trying to occupy space
What a fucking joke
What a fucking joke
Ah
I waited for a bus to separate the both of us
And take me off far away from you
'Cause my feelings never change a bit
I always feel like shit
I don't know why, I guess that I just do
You once talked to me about love
And you painted pictures of
A Never-Neverland
And I could've gone to that place
But I didn't understand
I didn't understand
I didn't understand
Everybody needs inspiration,
Everybody needs a soul
A beautiful melody
When the night's so along
'Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy
Yeah when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
When I look at you I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone
Yea when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
Cover me, all I need every
Breath that I breathe don't you know
You're beautiful
Yeah yeah yeah
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
I look at you
Yea yea oh oh
And you appear just like a dream
To me
I'll sing it one last time for you
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done
And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here
Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say
To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbyes
I nearly do
Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say
Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say
Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say
All that is left is an empty shell
Of my heart that is crushed
I don't never wanna see
What my mind has seen
When you loved me
Every night, every night alone with you
Every night, alone now
When she sits on your lap
Try to pretend to laugh
When she does stupid things
Just like I used to do
Do not hate her
Don't you even try
For to leave her is to love her
The same as you and I
I love you 
And I miss you too
I really do love you
And I really do miss you too
But I don't know you
And I don't need you
And I don't want you anymore
Every night, every night alone with you
Every night, alone now
There's a moment in time
And it's stuck in my mind
Way back, when we were just kids
'Cause your eyes told the tale
Of an act of betrayal
I knew that somebody did
Oh, waves of time
Seem to wash away
The scenes of our crimes
For you this never ends
Can you stay strong?
Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom
Winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away
Though the marks on your dress
Had been neatly repressed
I knew that something was wrong
And I should have spoke out
And I'm so sorry now
I didn't know
'Cause we were so young
Oh, clouds of time
Seem to rain on
Innocence left behind
It never goes away
Can you stay strong?
Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom
Winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away
Oh, clouds of time
Seem to rain on
Innocence left behind
It never goes away
(It never goes away)
It never goes away
Can you stay strong?
Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom
Winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away
Twilight fades through blistered avalon
The sky's cruel torch on aching autobahn
Into the uncertain divine
We scream into the last divide
You make me real
You make me real
Strong as I feel
You make me real
Sheila rides on crashing nightingale
Intake eyes leave passing vapor trails
With blushing brilliance alive
Because it's time to arrive
You make me real
You make me real
Strong as I feel
You make me real
Lately I just can't seem to believe
Discard my friends to change the scenery
It meant the world to hold a bruising faith
But now it's just a matter of grace
A summer storm graces all of me
Highway warm sing silent poetry
I could bring you the light
And take you home into the night
You make me real (Lately I just can't seem to believe)
You make me real (Discard my friends to change the scenery)
Strong as I feel (It meant the world to hold a bruising faith)
You make me real (But now it's just a matter of grace)
Something has left my life
And I don't know where it went to.
Somebody caused me strife
And it's not what I was seeking.
Didn't you see me? Didn't you hear me?
Didn't you see me standing there?
Why did you turn out the lights?
Did you know that I was sleeping?
Say a prayer for me,
Help me to feel the strength I did.
My identity, has it been taken?
Is my heart breakin' on me?
All my plans fell through my hands;
They fell through my hands, on me.
All my dreams, it suddenly seems, it suddenly seems
Empty.
Goodnight to every little hour that you sleep tight
May it hold you through the winter of a long night
And keep you from the loneliness of yourself
Heart strung is your heart frayed and empty
'Cause it's hard luck when no one understands your love
It's unsung and I say
Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
Goodnight, always to all that's pure that's in your heart
Goodnight, may your dreams be so happy and your head light
With wishes of a sandman and a night light
Be careful not to let the bedbugs sleep tight, nestled in the covers
The sun shines but I don't
A silver rain will wash away
The sun shines but I don't
A silver rain will wash away
And you can tell it's just as well
And you can tell it's just as well
Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
Goodnight, always to all that's pure that's in your heart
Hang on travelling woman
Don't sacrifice your plan
Cause it will come back to you
Before you lose it on the man
Never fall in love with potential
Cause you can see with your own eyes
All the pretty faces and sorry words
Can take away your pride
Got to listen
To the vision
Some may say a dream
Words from the unseen...
Or it can make you tired, tell you lies and make you fall
Make you tired, tell you lies, make you fall
Make you tired, tell you lies, make you fall
Hang on travelling woman
Don't sacrifice your plan
Cause it will come back to you
Before you lose it on the man
Got to listen
To the vision
Play in the ashes
Of what you once were...
Got to listen
To the vision
Play in the ashes
Of what you once were...
Please remember me happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin
The time when we counted every black car passing
Your house beneath the hill and up until
Someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention
But please remember me fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say that the pearly gates
Had some eloquent graffiti
Like 'We'll meet again' and 'Fuck the man'
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
And angels with their gray handshakes
Were always done in such a hurry
And please remember me at Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white by midnight
We'd forgotten one another
And when the morning came, I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
But now you're lit up by the city
So please remember me mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower call
Then pass us by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour
Gleam and resonate just like the gates
Around the holy kingdom
With words like 'Lost and Found' and 'Don't Look Down'
And 'Someone Save Temptation'
And please remember me as in the dream
We had as rug-burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Aside the lions and the ladies
That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior
But please remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above their running
In circles 'round the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter's
So bright on cinder gray and spray paint
'Who the hell can see forever?'
And please remember me seldom
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turn from me
And said the trapeze act was wonderful
But never meant to last, the clowns that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger
So please remember me, finally
And all my uphill clawing, my dear
But if I make the pearly gates
Do my best to make a drawing
Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissing on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around the frightened trapeze swingers
Dear darkness, dear darkness
Won't you cover, cover me again
Dear darkness, dear
I've been your friend for many years
Won't you do this for me, dearest darkness
And cover me from the sun
And though the words tightening
The words are tightening around my throat and, and
Around the throat of the one I love
Tightening, tightening, tightening
Around the throat of the one I love
Tightening, tightening, tightening
Dear darkness, dear darkness 
Now it's your time to look after us
'Cause we kept your clothes, we kept your business
When everyone else was having good luck
So now it's your time, time to pay
To pay me and the one I love
With the wordly goods you stashed away
With all the things you took from us
Sunshine been keeping me up for days
There is no night time, it's only a passing phase
And I feel pretty, pretty enough for you
I felt so ugly before, I didn't know what to do
Sometimes is all I feel up to now
But it's not worth it to you
'Cos you gotta get high somehow
Is it destruction that you require to feel?
Like somebody wants you, someone that's more for real
Sunshine, been keeping me up for days
There is no night time, only a passing phase
And I'll feel pretty, another hour or two
I felt so ugly before, I didn't know what to do
I felt so ugly before, I didn't know what to do
I felt so ugly before, I didn't know what to do
Ugly before
If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all?
I never know what the future brings 
But I know you are here with me now
We'll make it through 
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?
If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?
I don't know why you're so far away 
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through 
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I pray in you're the one I build my home with
I hope, I love you all my life
I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?
'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight you know my heart is by your side
I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?
I don't care anymore
If I let you down
I believe that I need to be free
I'm so used to my life with you around
I don't know anymore the real me
And I thought that I found myself today
And I thought that I had control
All the change in my life just fell away 
For a moment, I didn't need you
All these tears that I cried
You must be tired of taking care of me
But it's what you do best and I'm a liar
'Cause really, it's what I need
And I thought that I found myself today
And I thought that I had control
All the change in my life just fell away
For a moment, I didn't need you
Someone like you, someone like me
Maybe it's change
That set you free
Free
And I thought that I found myself today
And I thought that I had control
All the change in my life just fell away
For a moment, I didn't need you
And I thought that I found myself today
And I thought that I had control
All the change in my life just fell away
For a moment, I didn't need you
Holdin' on
That's what I do, since I met you
And it won't be long
Would you notice, if I left you?
And it's fine for some
'Cause you're not the one, you're not the one
There
There, there, there...
There, there
All night long, laid on my pillow
These things are wrong
I can't sleep here
So lovely
So lovely
So lovely
I have decided to leave you forever
I have decided to start things from here
Thunder and lightning won't change what I'm feelin'
And the daffodils look lovely today...
And the daffodils look lovely today... 
Look lovely today
Through your eyes I can see the disguise
Through your eyes I can see the dismay
Has anyone seen lightning?
Has anyone, looked lovely?
And the daffodils look lovely today...
And the daffodils look lovely today...
Look lovely today
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely
Nah, nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah, nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah, nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah, nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
(The Lament of the Monastary ends the song)
Slip and stumble at my first offences
It's not treason, it's no lie
You talk in paragraphs
I write my sentence
It's not treason, it's no lie
It seemed a place for us to dream
It seemed a place for us to dream
Crush and crumble under your defenses
It's not treason, it's no lie
You frame the photograph
I sit on fences
Change of season, love can die
It seemed a place for us to dream
It seemed a place for us to dream
If we tear out the tumor
It's later, never sooner
If we tear out the tumor
It's later, never sooner
It seemed a place for us to dream
You'd better keep it in check
Or you'll end up a wreck
And you'll never wake up
You'd better keep it in check
Or you'll end up a wreck
And you'll never wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
It seemed a place for us to dream
It seemed a place for us to dream
You'd better keep it in check
Or you'll end up a wreck
And you'll never wake up
And you'll never wake up
And you'll never wake up
And you'll never wake up
Wake up
I'll wrap up my bones
And leave them
Out of this home
Out on the road
Two feet standing on a principle
Two hands longing for each others warmth
Cold smoke seeping out of colder throats
Darkness falling, leaves nowhere to go
It's spiralling down 
Biting words like a wolf howling
Hate is spitting out each others mouths
But we're still sleeping like we're lovers
Still with feet touching
Still with eyes meeting
Still our hands match
Still with hearts beating
Two feet standing on a principle
Two hands digging in each others wounds
Cold smoke seeping out of colder throats
Darkness falling, leaves nowhere to move
It's spiraling down 
Biting words like a wolf howling
Hate is spitting out each others mouths
But we're still sleeping like we're lovers
Still with feet touching
Still with eyes meeting
Still our hands match
Still with hearts beating
I'll wrap up my bones
And leave them
Out of this home
Out on the road
Two feet standing on a principle
Two hands longing for each others warmth
Cold smoke seeping out of colder throats
Darkness falling, leaves nowhere to go
We, too, feel alone
We, too, feel alone
We, too, feel alone
We, too, feel alone
We've to feel alone 
We, too, feel alone
We, too, feel alone
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
Where have I been all the time?
Lost, enslaved, fatal decline
I've been waiting for this to unfold (good)
The pieces are only as good as the whole
Severed myself from my own life
Cut out the only thing that was right
What if I never saw you again?
I'd die right next to you in the end
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
I won't let you walk away
Without hearing what I have to say
Without hearing what I have to say
Without hearing what I have to say
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and white sunshine
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
The kids were young and pretty
Where have you been? Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The Queen of New York City
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come
The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty?
My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come
And if you call I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind I'll come, come, come
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and white sunshine
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
And we were young and pretty
Got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past
And everybody's gone at last
Sweet, sweet smile, and it's fading fast
'Cause everybody's gone at last
Don't get upset about it. No I'm not anymore
There's nothing wrong that wasn't wrong before
Had a second alone with a chance let pass
And everybody's gone at last
I hope you're not waiting, waitin' 'round for me
'Cause I'm not going anywhere, obviously
Got a broken heart and a name on my cast
And everybody's gone at last
Everybody's gone at last
Slightly bemused by his lack of direction
Hey you, hey you
Came to this world by caesarian section
Hey you, hey you
Chooses his clothes to match his pallid complexion
Hey you, hey you
Now it takes him all day just to get an erection
Hey you, things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all
Things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all
Goes out to cruise and to meet his connection
Hey you, hey you
He never scores he just gets an infection
Hey you, hey you
Dreams of a place with a better selection
Hey you, hey you
Still it takes him all day just to get an erection
Hey you, things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all
Things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all
Luxemburger Queen
He's a Burger Queen
Slightly bemused by the total rejection
Hey you, hey you
Came to this world by ceasarian section
Hey you, hey you
Dreams of a place with a better selection
Hey you, hey you
Dreams of a face that is pure perfection
Hey you, things aren't what they seem

I'm in the city you hated
My eyes are falling
Counting the clicks with the living dead
My eyes are red
I'm in the crush and I hate it
My eyes are falling
I'm having trouble inside my skin
I'll try to keep my skeletons in
Is it weird to be back in the south?
And can they even tell
If the city girl was ever there
Or anywhere?
I'm having trouble inside my skin
I'll try to keep my skeletons in
I'll be a friend and a fuck-up
And everything
But I'll never be
Anything you ever want me to be
I keep coming back here where everything slipped, ah
But I will not spill my guts out
I keep coming back here where everything slipped, ah
But I will not spill my guts out, ah ah
I don't need any help to be breakable, believe me
I know nobody else who can laugh along to any kind of joke
I won't need any help to be lonely when you leave me
It'll be easy to cover
Gather my skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas
Before I realize, ah
I don't want you to grieve
But I want you to sympathize, alright
I can't blame you for losing your mind
For a little while, so did I
I don't want you to change
But I want you to recognize that I
It'll be easy to cover
Gather your skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas
Before you realize
That I'll never be
Anything you ever want me to be
I keep coming back here where everything slipped, ah
But I will not spill my guts out
I keep coming back here where everything slipped, ah
But I will not spill my guts out, ah ah
I thought I saw your face today
But I just turned my head away
Your face against the trees
But I just see the memories
As they come
As they come
And I couldn't help but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
I saw it glitter as I grew
And loved it why I never knew
I thought this place was heaven sent
But now it's just a monument
In my mind
In my mind
And I couldn't help but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
The cars and freeways implore me to stay away 
Out of this place
My mother said just keep your head
And play it as it lays
The cars and freeways implore me to stay away
Out of this place
My mother said just keep your head
And play it as it lays
I somehow see what's beautiful
In things that are ephemeral
I'm my only friend, am I?
Love is just a piece of time
In the world
In the world
And I couldn't help but fall in love again
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again...
Somedays aren't yours at all
They come and go
As if they're someone else's days
They come and leave you behind someone else's face
And it's harsher than yours
And colder than yours
They come in all quiet
Sweep up and then they leave
And you don't hear a single floor board creak
They're so much stronger
Than the friends you try to keep
By your side
Downtown, Downtown
I'm not here
Not anymore, I've gone away
Don't call me, don't write
I'm in love with your daughter
I wanna have her baby
I'm in love with your daughter
So can I please?
Downtown, Downtown
I'm not here
Not anymore, I've gone away
Don't call me, don't write
I've gone away
Don't call me, don't write
Don't call me, don't call me, don't call me
Don't write, don't write, don't write
Don't write, don't write
Somedays aren't yours at all
They come and go as if they're someone else's days
They come and leave you behind someone else's face
And it's harsher than yours
And it's colder than yours
The caves of our mouths are forest darkness
And the air in between is overflowing
And the rushing wolverine flies past
His shiny, shiny teeth
And she is kind, he is free, full of knowing
She is sure
She is sure
The caves of our mouths are bear's bellies
And the air in between is spewing comets
And the dancing centaur queen flies past
Her tiny, tiny teeth
He is kind, she is free, and wants to show him
Find him in the bat's mouth
He is singing in her bat's mouth
He is shaking and dancing in her bat mouth
Getting tired and sleepy in her bat mouth
And she's holding him tight in her bat arms
She is wrapping him up in her bat arms
And she's thanking her mother sea
"Thank you mother sea for letting him see the sea in me"
Days like this, I don't know what to do with myself
All day - and all night
I wander the halls along the walls and under my breath
I say to myself
I need fuel - to take flight
And there's too much going on
But it's calm under the waves, in the blue of my oblivion
Under the waves in the blue of my oblivion
Is that why they call me a sullen girl - sullen girl
They don't know I used to sail the deep and tranquil sea
But he washed me shore and he took my pearl
And left an empty shell of me
And there's too much going on
But it's calm under the waves, in the blue of my oblivion
Under the waves in the blue of my oblivion
Under the waves in the blue of my oblivion
It's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion
So let's face it, this was never what you wanted
But I know that it's fun to pretend
Our blank stares and empty threats
Are all I have...
They're all I have...
So drown me and if you can
Or we could just have conversation
And I fall, I fall, I falter
I found you before I drift away
Now you still speak of day old hate
Though your whole world has gone up into flames
And isn't it great to find that you're really worth nothing
And how safe it is to feel safe
So drown me and if you can
Or we could just have conversation
And I fall, I fall, I falter
But I found you before I drift away
The things we do just to stay alive (x3)
The things we do just to keep ourselves alive
You look like a perfect fit
For a girl in need of a tourniquet
But can you save me?
Come on and save me
If you could save me
From the ranks of the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
'Cause I can tell you know what it's like
A long farewell of the hunger strike
But can you save me?
Come on and save me
If you could save me
From the ranks of the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
You struck me dumb, like radium
Like Peter Pan or Superman
You have come to save me
Come on and save me
If you could save me
From the ranks of the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
Except the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
But the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
Come on and save me
Why don't you save me?
If you could save me
From the ranks of the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
Except the freaks
Who suspect they could never love anyone
Except the freaks
Who could never love anyone
She's mostly gone, some other place
I'm getting by in other ways
Everything they whispered in our ear is coming true
Try to justify the things I used to do
Believe in you
Watching you drown
I'll follow you down
I am here right beside you
The lights in the sky
Have finally arrived
I am staying right beside you
I tried to stay away, just in case
I've come to realize we all have our place
Time, time has a way, you know, to make it clear
And I have my role in this, I can't disappear
Or leave you here
Watching you drown
I'll follow you down
And I am here right beside you
The lights in the sky
Are waving goodbye
And I am staying right beside you
I was young but I wasn't naïve
I watched helpless
As you turned around to leave
And still I have the pain I have to carry
A past so deep
That even you could not bury if you tried
After all this time
I never thought we'd be here
Never thought we'd be here
When my love for you is blind
But I couldn't make you see it
Couldn't make you see it
That I loved you more
Than you'll ever know
And part of me died
When I let you go
I would fall asleep
Only in hopes of dreaming
That everything
Would be like it was before
But nights like this
It seems are slowly fleeting
They disappear as reality is crashing to the floor
After all this time
I never thought we'd be here
Never thought we'd be here
When my love for you is blind
But I couldn't make you see it
Couldn't make you see it
That I loved you more
Than you'll ever know
And part of me died
When I let you go
After all this why
Would you ever wanna leave
Maybe you could not believe it
That my love for you is blind
But I couldn't make you see it
Couldn't make you see it
That I loved you more
Than you will ever know
And part of me died
When I let you go
That I loved you more
Than you will ever know
And part of me died
When I let you go
And I don't know where you went when you left me but
Says here in the water you must be gone by now
I can tell somehow
One hand on the trigger of a telephone
Wondering when the call comes
Where you say it's all right
You got your heart right
Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on the porch till you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness
Two wrongs make it all all right tonight
All you need is love is a lie cause
We had love but we still said goodbye
Now we're tired, battered fighters
And it stings when it's nobody's fault
Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name
It's only the air you took and the breath you left
Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on the porch till you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
So I'll check the weather wherever you are
'Cause I wanna know if you can see the stars tonight
It might be my only right
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness
I called
Because
I just
Need to feel you on the line
Don't hang up this time
And I know it was me who called it over but
I still wish you'd fought me till your dying day
Don't let me get away
'Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me
So I can say this is the way that I used to be
There's no substitute for time
Or for the sadness
Split screen sadness
We share the sadness
Take me to the station 
And put me on a train 
I've got no expectations 
To pass through here again 
Once I was a rich man 
And now I am so poor 
But never in my sweet short life 
Have I felt like this before 
You heart is like a diamond 
You throw your pearls at swine 
And as I watch you leaving me 
You pack my peace of mind 
Our love was like the water 
That splashes on a stone 
Our love is like our music 
It's here and then it's gone 
So take me to the airport 
And put me on a plane 
I got no expectations 
To pass through here again

I'm all out of luck
But what else could I be?
I know he's yours
And he'll never belong to me again
I did him wrong
So don't brag, keep it to yourself
I did him wrong
I was never, no, I was never, no
I was never enough
But I can try, I can try
To toughen up
I listened when they told me
If he burns you let him go
Change is hard, I should know
I should know
I should know
So I'll keep my head down
If you keep it quiet from now on
In the halls I'd rather hear silence
Than the bells of new love
So don't brag, keep it to yourself
I did him wrong
I was never, no, I was never, no
I was never enough
But I can try, I can try
To toughen up
I listened when they told me
If he burns you let him go
Change is hard, I should know
I should know
I should know
Instrumental
I was lying in my bed last night staring
At a ceiling full of stars
When it suddenly hit me
I just have to let you know how I feel
We live together
In a photograph of time
And I look into your eyes
And the seas open up to me
I tell you I love you
And I always will
And I know that you can't tell me
I know that you can't tell me
So I'm left to pick up
The hints, the little symbols of your devotion
So I'm left to pick up
The hints, the little symbols of your devotion
And I feel your fist
And I know it's out of love
And I feel the whip
And I know it's out of love
And I feel your burning eyes, oh
Burning holes straight through my heart
It's out of love, ooh
It's out of love
And I accept and I collect upon my body
The memories of your devotion
And I accept and I collect upon my body
The memories of your devotion, ooh
And I feel your fist
And I know it's out of love
And I feel the whip
And I know it's out of love
And I feel your burning eyes
Burning holes straight through my heart
It's out of love, ooh ooh
It's out of love
Give me the mysterious love
Give me a little fool love
Fistful of love, love
Fist, fist, fist, fistful of love
Ooh-ooh, darling, oh love, come on
You give me a little bit
Give me a little fistful of love
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, give me a fistful of love
Ooh, give me a little, give me just a little
Give me a fistful of love
Give a little fist, give a little fist, fistful of love
Ooh, ooh, baby
Give a little, a little fistful of love
Ooh ooh, a little fistful
Give a little, just a little bit
Give a little, just a little bit
Walked away, heard them say
Poison hearts will never change
Walked away again
Turned away in disgrace
Felt the chill upon my face
Cooling from within
It's hard to notice gleaming from the sky
When you're staring at the cracks
It's hard to notice what is passing by
With eyes lowered
You walked away, heard them say
Poison hearts will never change
Walk away again
All the cracks they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me
All the cracks, they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me
And I fell apart
As I walked away, heard them say
Poison hearts will never change
Walked away again
Turned away in disgrace
Felt the chill upon my face
Cooling from within
Somberly, somberly linger lie long early
Grateful our cold memories bide
For the plentiful times that, 
That her eagerly death had had
Counter intuitive thunder ride
Clean my sparkling teeth
Brush down my sparkling sides
Thy nervous blood will become undone
From impiety as pounding ideas
Some shattering find for this candor to die
Plug up your wormholes and give them, to feeders and spirits be freer
Some shattering find for this candor to die
Plug up your wormholes and give them, to feeders and spirits be freer
And freer and broil and toil and foil die
Scallop the breastbone, roll in toll and fold the long winter in it
Think not what the season will become
Breathe truthfully at the garden glen, that grew masterfully over your
Withering son
Beat out the bed bugs, 
Stand when you do it
Beat out the bed bugs, 
Stand when you do it
Some shattering find for this candor to die
Plug up your wormholes and give them, to feeders and spirits be freer
Some shattering find for this candor to die
Plug up your wormholes and give them, to feeders and spirits be freer
And freer and freer and
Can't believe it's over
I watched the whole thing fall
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
If I'd only knew
The days were slipping past
That the good things would never last
That you were crying
Mmm, summer turned to winter
And the snow had turned to rain
And the rain turned into tears upon your face
I hardly recognized the girl you are today
And God, I hope it's not too late
Mmm, it's not too late
'Cause you are not alone
I'm always there with you
And we'll get lost together
Till the light comes pouring through
'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won
Babe, you're not lost
When your world's crashing down
And you can't bear the thought
I said, "Babe, you're not lost"
Life can show no mercy, it
It can tear your soul apart
It can make you feel like you've gone crazy
But you're not
And things have seem to changed
There's one thing that's still the same
In my heart, you have remained
And we can fly, fly, fly away
'Cause you are not alone
And I am there with you
And we'll get lost together
Till the light comes pouring through
'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won
Babe, you're not lost
When the world's crashing down
And you cannot bear the cross
I said, "Baby, you're not lost"
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I said, "Baby, you're not lost"
I said, "Baby, you're not lost"
Ooh, yeah, yeah
I said, "Baby, you're not lost"
Lord, hear me now
Junk boats and English boys
Crashing out in supermarts
Electric fences and guns
You swallow me
I'm a pill on your tongue
Here on the nineteenth floor
The neon lights make me calm
And late in a star's life
It begins to explode
And all the people in a dream
Wait for the machine
To pick the shit up, leave it clean
Kid, hang over here
What you're learning in school
Is the rise of an eastern sun
Gonna be good for everyone?
The radio station disappeared
Music turned into thin air
The DJ was the last to leave
She had well-conditioned hair
Was beautiful but nothing really was there
There's a dream that I see, I pray it can be
Look cross the land, shake this land
A wish or a command
Dream that I see, don't kill it, it's free
You're just a man, you get what you can
We all do what we can
So we can do just one more thing
We can all be free
Maybe not in words
Maybe not with a look
But with your mind
Listen to me, don't walk that street
There's always an end to it
Come and be free, you know who I am
We're just living people
We won't have a thing
So we got nothing to lose
We can all be free
Maybe not with words
Maybe not with a look
But with your mind
You've got to choose a wish or command
At the turn of the tide, is withering thee
Remember one thing, the dream you can see
Pray to be, shake this land
We all do what we can
So we can do just one more thing
We won't have a thing
So we've got nothing to lose
We can all be free
Maybe not with words
Maybe not with a look
But with your mind
But with your mind
There's
Nobody here
There's
Nobody near
I
Try not to care
Dead
Eyes always stare
Let
These matters be
Don't trust what you see 
Take
Hold of your time
Step into the line 
There's innocence torn from its maker 
Stillborn the trust in you 
This failure has made the creator 
So would you tell him
What to do? (would you?)
Leave
Your mark upon
The
Head of someone 
Who'll
Cry for his state
We
Know it's too late
I turn around to see
What was meant to be 
Faint
Movement release
To rid the disease
There's innocence torn from its maker 
Stillborn the trust in you (I have lost all trust I had in you) 
This failure has made the creator
So would you tell him
What to do?
(I have lost all trust I had in you)
I thought it was funny when you, missed the train
When I rang you at home, they said you'd left, yesterday
I thought it was strange when your, car was found
By the tree in Ennis where we used to hang around
Dear Isobel, I hope you're well, and what you've done is right,
Oh it's been such hell, I wish you well, I hope you're safe tonight
It's been a long day coming and long will it last
When it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it pass
By loving you more
And who would he become, all the things he'd have done
Would he have loved you, and not let you down?
And would he be stronger than his father?
Don't punish yourself; leave it well alone
Dear Isobel, I hope you're well, and what you've done is right,
Oh it's been such hell, I wish you well, I hope you're safe tonight
It's been a long day coming and long will it last
When it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it pass
By loving you more
I am done, smoking gun 
We've lost it all, the love is gone 
She has won. Now it's no fun 
We've lost it all, the love is gone 
And we had magic 
And this is tragic 
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself 
I feel like our world's been infected 
And somehow you left me neglected 
We found our life's been changed 
Babe, you lost me 
And we tried, oh how we cried 
We lost ourselves, the love has died 
And oh, we tried, you can't deny 
We're left as shells, we lost the fight 
And we had magic 
And this is tragic 
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself 
I feel like our world's been infected 
And somehow you left me neglected 
We found our life's been changed 
Babe, you lost me 
Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet 
But you chose lust when you deceived me 
You'll regret it but it's too late 
How can I ever trust you again? 
I feel like our world's been infected 
And somehow you left me neglected 
We found our life's been changed 
Babe, you lost me
What if you could wish me away?
What if you spoke those words today?
I wonder if you'd miss me when I'm gone
It's come to this, release me
I'll leave before the dawn
But for tonight I'll stay here with you
Yes for tonight I'll lay here with you
But when the sun hits your eyes
Through your window
There'll be nothing you can do
What if you could hear this song?
What if I felt like I belong?
I might not be leaving oh so soon
Began the night believing
I loved you in the moonlight
So for tonight I'll stay here with you
Yes for tonight I'll lay here with you
But when the sun hits your eyes
Through your window
There'll be nothing you can do
I could've treated you better, better than this
Well I'm gone
This song's your letter
Can't stay in one place
So for tonight I'll stay here with you
Yes for tonight I'll lay here with you
But when the sun hits your eyes
Through your window
There'll be nothing you can do
Eating snowflakes with plastic forks
And a paper plate of course, you think of everything
Short love with a long divorce
And a couple of kids of course, they don't mean anything
Live in trailers with no class
Goddamn, I hope I can pass high school means nothing
Taking heartache with hard work
Goddamn, I am such a jerk, I can't do anything
And I shout that you're all fakes
And you should have seen the look on your face
And I guess that's what it takes
When comparing your belly aches
And it's been a long time
Which agrees with this watch of mine
And I know that I miss you
And I'm sorry if I dissed you
Eating snowflakes with plastic forks
And a paper plate of course, you think of everything
Short love with a long divorce
And a couple of kids of course, they don't mean anything
Live in trailers with no class
Goddamn, I hope I can pass high school means nothing
Taking heartache with hard work
Goddamn, I am such a jerk, I can't do anything
And I shout that you're all fakes
And you should have seen the look on your face
And I guess that's what it takes
When comparing your belly aches
And it's been a long time
Which agrees with this watch of mine
And I guess that I miss you
And I'm sorry if I dissed you
And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time
And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes
And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time
And so it is
The colder water
The blower's daughter
The pupil in denial
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes
(Lisa Hannigan)
Did I say that I loathe you?
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind?
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind
My mind... my mind
'Til I find somebody new
I'm careful not to fall
I have to climb your wall
'Cause you're the one
Who makes me feel much taller than you are
I'm just a peeping tom
On my own for far too long
Problems with the booze
Nothing left to lose
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared
The face that fills the hole
That stole my broken soul
The one that makes me seem to feel much taller than you are
I'm just a peeping tom
On my own for far too long
Troubles with the gear
Nothing left to fear
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared
With every bet I lost
And every trick I tossed
You're still the one who makes me feel much taller than you are
I'm just a peeping tom
On my own for far too long
Problems with the booze
Nothing left to lose
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
Like I heard her backwards saying
"I can take one thousand showers
And never be clean"
Of course she lied awake
She is ten times heavier
Stronger than you found the grave
Or ever was
He's got it down now
You know what I need
Who doesn't lie?
You know what I mean
If I'm ever in doubt you
Like you don't know
I am so, angry
I am so, at ease
I feel just like
Some great big disease
I think you need
Ice water
But the only thing that
You really hate
Is all its emptiness
I will swim
And I will drink myself to
Death
If I'm never in
Doubt of you
Like you don't know
Am I correct to defend the fist that holds this pen?
It's ink that lies, the pen, the page, the paper
I live, I learn, you will always take what I have earned
So aid my end while I believe I'm winning
Our friends speak out in our defense
Pay ten deaf ears for two months' rent
We burn the gallows they erect
And cut the nooses they tie for our necks
You constantly make it impossible
To make conversation
We're comatose but audible
And I liked it, the farther I get out
We passed it off, but it's all on us
For common conversation
It took everything I got
And I liked it, the farther I get out
Once said, always said, I will hold the past over your head
I'll speak my mind, whenever I feel slighted
I am hellbent on extracting all of my revenge
Take heart, sweetheart, or I will take it from you
I slip concealed back to the keep
Concede to do the work for free
We prey as wolves among the sheep
And slit the necks of soldiers while they sleep
You constantly make it impossible
To make conversation
We're comatose but audible
And I liked it, the farther I get out
We passed it off, but it's all on us
For common conversation
It took everything I got
And I liked it, the farther I get out
You constantly make it impossible
To make conversation
We're comatose but audible
And I liked it, the farther I get out
We passed it off, but it's all on us
For common conversation
It took everything I got
And I liked it, the farther I get out
You constantly make it impossible
To make conversation
We're comatose but audible
And I liked it, the farther I get out
We passed it off, but it's all on us
For common conversation
It took everything I got
And I liked it, the farther I get out
The phone slips from a loose grip.
Words were missed then some apology,
"I didn't want to tell you this,
No, it's just some guy she's been hanging out with...
Oh, I don't know, the past couple of weeks I guess."
I thank you and hang up the phone,
Let the funeral start,
Hear the casket close.
Let's pin split-black ribbon onto your overcoat.
Still laughter pours from under doors in this house,
I don't understand that sound no more.
It seems artificial, like a T.V. set.
Haligh, Haligh, a lie, Haligh,
This weight it must be satisfied,
You offer only one reply:
You know not what you do.
But you tear and tear your hair from roots,
From that same head you've twice removed, now
A lock of hair you said would prove
Our love would never die.
Well, ha ha ha.
But I remember everything,
The words we spoke on freezing South street,
And all those mornings watching you get ready for school.
You combed your hair inside that mirror,
The one you painted blue and glued with jewelry tears.
Something about those bright colors
Would always make you feel better.
But now we speak with ruined tongues
And the words we say aren't meant for anyone.
It's just a mumbled sentence to a passing acquaintance
But there was once you,
You said you hate my suffering and you understood,
And you'd take care of me.
You'd always be there,
Well where are you now?
Haligh, Haligh, a lie, Haligh,
The plans were never finalized
But left to hang like yarn and twine,
Dangling before my eyes.
As you tear and tear your hair from roots,
From that same head that you have twice removed
A lock of hair you said would prove
Our love would never die.
And I sing and sing of awful things,
The pleasure that my sadness brings,
And my fingers press onto the strings
You get another clumsy chord.
Haligh, Haligh, an awful lie,
This weight will now be satisfied,
I'm gonna give you only one reply:
I know not who I am.
But I talk in the mirror to the stranger that appears,
Our conversations are circles, always one sided,
Nothing is clear.
Except we keep coming back to this meaning that I lack,
He says the choices were given,
And now you must live them or just not live.
But do you want that?
Scott:
You keep your distance, I can't deny you
I've got the feeling, can't satisfy you
I've got your picture on the wall
I've got the picture, long gone
You keep your wishes I'll keep my feelings
There goes another one that kept me breathing
I'm waiting for you I know your leaving
I still adore you, you never need me
Hold on
I found another way to let you go away
Hold on
You found another way to bleed my soul away
Fred:
The things you told me to hear you speak
I'm burning slowly I'm growing weak
You bring me closer to yesterday
Yesterday's a million miles away
Why can't you hear me? Why can't I sleep?
And I don't understand what keeps me breathing
I'm waiting for you I know your leaving
I'll still adore you, you'll never need me
Hold on
I found another way to let you go away
Hold on
You found another way to bleed my soul away
(Repeats 4 times)
(What the heart wants...)
(The heart wants...)
(What the heart wants...)
You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby no I can't escape
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down 
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants baby
It wants what it wants baby...
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
I'm waiting for you
For I'm broken down
Coming down this time
For my heart lies
Far and away where they took you down
Let them over to your house
Where I'm broken.
Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Still my heart beats, for you
Have become, all I love,
And all I hoped for.
But I, must carry on
Always one
Never broken
Run to the lobby where I saw you try
Don't give a damn for your reasons why
Where Sophie's down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll leave them over to your eyes.
Woah, I am one,
I am one.
Great story of
Peace and love,
In a future
Bright, sacrifice,
Came around, never broken.
Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you still can't see,
Traveling a street that I did not go,
Leaves like ton to the winter load.
Down in the valley where the church bells cry,
I'll leave them over to your eyes,
Woah, I am one,
Woah, I am one,
I am one.
Watching me watch the pianos
Hear the, hear the magic if you could
All around me are familiar faces
Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow
And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very mad world
Mad world
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And I feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me, what's my lesson?
Look right through me, look right through me
And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very mad world
Mad world
Enlarging your world
Mad world

I had a dream
Crispy, crispy Benjamin Franklin came over
Babysat all four of my kids
Then in my dream
I told the doctor off
He said, "If you don't want to do it,
then you don't have to do it."
He said, "The truth is you'll be okay, anyway."
Then in my dream
Crispy, crispy Benjamin Franklin and the doctor
Went and had a talk with my boss
Something about insurance policies
They kept the door closed at all times
I couldnt hear or see
When they came out they said,
"You'll be okay, anyway."
And I smiled cause I'd known it all along
No thank you. No thank you. No thank you. No thank you!
I don't have to pay for this shit!
I can't afford chemo like I can't afford a limo
and on any given day I'd rather ride a limousine!
No thank you. No thank you. No thank you. No thank you!
I ain't about to to die like this
I can't afford chemo like I can't afford a limo
And besides, this shit is making me tired
It's making me tired
It's making me die
You know I plan to retire someday
And I'm-a gonna go out in style
Go out in style
This shit it's making me tired
It's making me tired
It's making me die
I'm-a gonna go out in style, go out in style
When I woke up
My kids were being quiet
I knew it was a dream right away
I called the limousine company
Then I got dressed
I dressed the kids as well
The limousine pulled in
And we piled in
The doctor, he asked which way we were headed
I said, "Sir, let's just go west."
And he listened obediently
Sophie only wants to listen to radio BBC
Michael sat on my knees and whispered to me
All about the meanies
Jacqueline was being such a big girl
With her cup of tea looking out of the window
And Barbara, she looks just like my mom
Oh my Barbara, she looks so much like my mom
No thank you! No thank you! No thank you! No thank you!
I don't have to pay for this shit
I can't afford chemo like I can't afford a limo
And on any given day I'd rather ride a limousine
No thank you! No thank you! No thank you! No thank you!
I ain't about to die like this
I can't afford chemo like I can't afford a limo
And besides this shit is making me tired
It's making me tired
It's making me die
You know I plan to retire some day
And I'm-a gonna go out in style
Go out in style
This shit it's making me tired
It's making me tired
It's making me die
I'm-a gonna go out in style
Go out in style
Style
Style
Style?
Style
Style?
Style
Style?
Style

You know it ain't easy 
For these thoughts here to leave me
There are no words to describe it
In French or in English
'Cause diamonds they fade
And flowers they bloom
And I'm telling you
That these feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
They've been knockin' me out lately
Whenever you come around me
But these feelings won't go away 
They've been knockin' me sideways
I keep thinking in a moment that
Time will take them away
But these feelings won't go away
Just down the street from your hotel, baby,
I stay at home with my disease,
And ain't this position familiar, darling,
Well, all monkeys do what they see,
Help me stay awake, I'm falling.
Down on Virginia and La Loma,
Where I got friends who'll care for me,
You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted,
I got an attitude of need,
So help me stay awake, I'm falling.
Asleep in perfect blue buildings,
Beside the green apple sea,
I wanna get me a little oblivion baby,
Try to keep myself away from me.
It's 4:30 A.M. on a Tuesday,
And it doesn't get much worse than this,
In beds in little rooms in buildings in the middle,
Of these lives which are completely meaningless,
Help me stay awake, I'm falling.
Asleep in perfect blue buildings,
Beside the green apple sea,
I wanna get me a little oblivion baby,
Try to keep myself away from myself and me.
Well I got bones beneath my skin, and mister,
There's a skeleton in every man's house,
Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody,
There's a dead man trying to get out,
So please help me stay awake, I'm falling.
Asleep in perfect blue buildings,
Beside the green apple sea,
I wanna get me a little oblivion baby,
Try to keep myself away from me.
Perfect blue buildings, oh,
Beside the green apple sea,
I wanna get me a little oblivion baby,
Try to keep myself away from myself and me.
Oh, in the perfect blue buildings,
I can't keep myself away from me,
Oh, in the perfect blue buildings,
Said how 'm I gonna keep myself,
How 'm I gonna keep myself away from me,
Keep myself away,
How 'm I gonna keep myself away from me,
Keep myself away,
How 'm I gonna keep myself away from me.
Danny is lonely, 'cause Mary's in India now;
She said she'd call but that was three weeks ago.
She left all her things, well, her books and her letters from him;
But as the sun rises on Mary, it sets on him.
And just dance, and just drink,
And just say the things I'll probably never get a chance to say.
Danny is not eating, he's drinking and sleeping in;
I saw him last night at the party, he's definitely thin.
He says he's happy, he looked pretty good but I think,
That as the sun rises on Mary, it sets on him.
And just dance and just drink,
And just say the things I'll probably never get a chance to say.
Danny came over last night and I cooked for him;
He talked about you, Mary, and how much we loved you still.
He told me he's packed up your books and letters and things;
As the sun sets on Mary, its rising on him. 
And we danced, and we drank.
And I've seen something you probably never got a chance to see.
Don't worry Mary, 'cause I'm taking care of Danny,
And he's taking care of me.
Hold on this will
Hurt more than
Anything has before
What it was,
What it was,
What it was
I've brought this on us
More than
Anyone could ignore
What I've done,
What I've done,
What I've done
I've worked for so long
Just to see you mess around
What you've done,
What you've done,
What you've done
I want back the
Years that you took
When I was
Young
I was young,
I was young,
But it's done
Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away
Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away
We'll fall just like stars being hung by only
String
Everything, everything, here is gone
No map can direct
How to ever make it home
We're alone, we're alone, we're alone
Oh take it all away
I don't feel it anymore
Oh take it all away
You walked around
Thought yourself beautiful
Just too bad they stare, just too bad they stare
Broke up your crown
Called you unusable
See how well you fare
Stole underground
To kick your heart around
Banished from above, banished from above
Forgot yourself,
Go home and shot your health
Left it all for love
I know there is delirious quips
Last seen with friends wishing them well
You listen for the truth
Just too bad they lie, just too bad they lie
Oh come around
In form of future youth
Summoned from the sky
Ooh, ooh
I know I'm a man, I know I'm a man
I know I'm a man, I know I'm a man
I know I'm a man, I know I'm a man
I know I'm a man, I know I'm a man
Refuse these cruel
Unusual fools
Leave them to rule in hollow point hell
You've much to do
Now listen to the truth
Cradle in a cry, cradle in a cry
Your life will shine, ?File indisputable?
Keep your head on high, keep your head on high
When you walk around, know you are beautiful
Aimless and alive
Broken and defined
When you walk around, know you are future youth
Summon to the sky
Ooh, ooh
Of all the things I've believed in
I just want to get it over with
Tears form behind my eyes
But I do not cry
Counting the days that pass me by
I've been searching deep down in my soul
Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old
Feels like I'm starting it all over again
The last three years were just pretend
And I said
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
I still get lost in your eyes
And it seems that I can't live a day without you
Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away
To a place where I am blinded by the light
But it's not right
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
And it hurts to want everything
And nothing at the same time
I want what's yours and I want what's mine
I want you
But I'm not giving in this time
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
And when the stars fall
I will lie awake
You're my shooting star
What's the time, seems it's already morning
I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue
The TV's on but the only thing showing is a picture of you
Oh I get up and make myself some coffee
I try to read a bit, but the story is too thin
I thank the Lord above that you're not here to see me
In this shape I'm in
Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time
I try to call but I don't know what to tell you
I leave a kiss on your answering machine
Oh help me please is there someone who can make me
Wake up from this dream?
Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you are missing me too
I'm spending my time
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound
Of "tears of a clown"
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time
My friends keep telling me hey life will go on
Time will make sure I'll get over you ooh
This silly game of love - you play, you win only to lose
I'm spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound
Of "tears of a clown"
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time
I'm spending my time...
I heard about your trip
I heard about your souvenirs
I heard about the cool breeze and the cool nights
And the cool guys that you spent them with
I guess I should have heard of them from you
I guess I should have heard of them from you
Well don't you see, don't you see
That the charade is over
And all the "best deceptions" and the
"Clever cover story" awards go to you
So kiss me hard
'Cause this will be the last time that I let you
You will be back someday
And this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips
Will be of service to keeping you away
I heard about your regrets
I heard that you were feeling sorry
I heard from someone that you wish you could
Set things right between us
Well, I guess I should have heard of that from you
I guess I should have heard of that from you
Well don't you see, don't you see
That the charade is over
And all the "best deceptions" and the
"Clever cover story" awards go to you
So kiss me hard
'Cause this will be the last time that I let you
You will be back someday
And this awkward kiss that screams of other people's lips
Will be of service to keeping you away
To keeping you away
I'm waiting for blood to flow to my fingers
I'll be alright when my hands get warm
Ignoring the phone--I'd rather say nothing
I'd rather you never heard my voice
You're calling too late, too late to be gracious
You do not warrant long goodbyes
You're calling too late
You're calling too late
You're calling too late
I've been around this world
Yet I see no end
All shall fade to black 
Again and again
This storm that's broken me
My only friend
In this river 
All shall fade to black
In this river 
Ain't no coming back
In this river 
All shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back
Withdrawn a step away
Just to find myself
The door is closed again
The only one left
This storm that's broken me
My only friend
In this river 
All shall fade to black
In this river 
Ain't no coming back
In this river 
All shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back
In this river 
All shall fade to black
In this river 
Ain't no coming back
In this river 
All shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back
In this river 
All shall fade to black
In this river 
Ain't no coming back
In this river 
All shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back
In this river 
All shall fade to black
In ths river 
Ain't no coming back
In this river 
All shall fade to black
Ain't no coming back
For a second I was in control
I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below would rise
And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let me go
But one last time
Tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
Remember once upon a time
When I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine
So tell me you love me
And if you don't then lie
Lie to me
Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
If you don't then lie
Oh, lie to me
And call it true, call it true love
Call it true, call it true love
In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail
No fight left, or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose
Don't give up
'Cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not beaten yet
Don't give up
I know you can make it good
Though I saw it all around
Never thought that I could be affected
Thought that we'd be last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground
Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up
We don't need much of anything
Don't give up
'Cause somewhere there's a place where we belong
Rest your head
You worry too much
It's gonna be all right
When times get rough
You can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please don't give up
Got to walk out of here
I can't take any more
Gonna stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
And whatever may go
That river's flowing
That river's flowing
Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no one needs
Don't give up
'Cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not the only one
Don't give up
No reason to be ashamed
Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up now
We're proud of who you are
Don't give up
You know it's never been easy
Don't give up
'Cause I believe there's a place
There's a place where we belong
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
'Scuse me, I apologize. He likes your attitude; he tries it on for size
He spends the afternoon between your thighs. How's that for gratitude? I apologize
It seemed to last for hours. It seemed to last for days
This lady of the flowers and her hypnotic gaze
'Scuse me, I apologize. She's got vacuum cleaner eyes that suck you in
She's got magazines filled with hair pies. 'Scuse me, I apologize
It seemed to last for hours. It seemed to last for days
This lady of the flowers and her hypnotic gaze
She wears her tears on her blouse. Confused and racked with self-doubt
She stole the keys to my house and then she locked herself out
'Scuse me, I apologize. He likes your attitude; he tries it on for size
He spends the afternoon between your thighs. How's that for gratitude? I apologize
It seemed to last for hours. It seemed to last for days
This lady of the flowers; her electronic haze
She wears her tears on her blouse. Confused and racked with self-doubt
She stole the keys to my house and then she locked herself out
She stole the keys to my house and then she locked herself out
She lays me down. She lays me
I love the tone that's in your laugh
Gasping for an extra breath
Waiting for the time to pass
I believe in days ahead
Don't spend another night alone
Cross and wishing you were dead
Mary, you shouldn't let it make you mad
You hold the best you can,
And Mary, after all the pain is gone
I'm always gonna live to be your man
Ooh... oh
I've had it easy now you see
When I'm down you're always there
Standing by to comfort me
Someday we'll go round the world
I'll make the journey so sublime
I know you're not a travelling girl
Mary, you shouldn't let it make you mad
You hold the best you can,
And Mary, after all the pain is gone
I'm always gonna live to be your man
Oh oh
'Cause I'd give everything I have
Forget all the things that bring me joy
You could have one day of pure and simple happiness
Until that moment comes
I'll be here where I've always been
I'm gonna be your friend
Until the day I die
Mary, you shouldn't let it make you mad
You hold the best you can,
And Mary, after all the pain is gone
I'm always gonna live to be your man
Ooh ooh ooh
Your golden lies feed my role 
In this forgotten space race under my control 
Who's returned from the dead? 
Who remains?
You wanted more than I was worth 
You think I was scared yeah 
And you needed proof 
Who really cares anymore? 
Who restrains?
I don't love you and I never did 
I don't love you and I never will
There's no need to argue anymore. 
I gave all I could, but it left me so sore. 
And the thing that makes me mad, 
Is the one thing that I had, 
I knew, I knew, 
I'd lose you. 
You'll always be special to me, 
Special to me, to me. 
And I remember all the things we once shared, 
Watching T.V. movies on the living room armchair. 
But they say it will work out fine. 
Was it all a waste of time. 
'Cause I knew, I knew, 
I'd lose you. 
You'll always be special to me, 
Special to me, to me. 
Will I forget in time, ah, 
You said I was on your mind? 
There's no need to argue, 
No need to argue anymore. 
There's no need to argue anymore.
I will light a match this morning so I won't be alone
Watch as she lies silent for soon light will be gone
Oh, I will stand arms outstretched, pretend I'm free to roam
Oh, I will make my way through one more day in Hell
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
I will hold the candle until it burns up my arm
Oh, I'll keep taking punches until their will grows tired
Oh, I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
Hey, I won't change direction and I won't change my mind
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
I'll swallow poison until I grow immune
I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room
How much difference?
How much difference?
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
You thought we'd be fine
All these years gone by
Now you're asking me to listen
Well then tell me 'bout everything
No lies, we're losing time
'Cause this is a battle
And it's your final last call
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know
But why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why?
This can be better, you used to be happy, try!
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
You've got them on your side
They won't change their minds
Now it's over and I'm feeling like
We've missed out on everything
I just hope it's worth the fight
'Cause this is a battle
And it's your final last call 
(Why'd you have to let it go?)
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know 
(Can't you see you hurt me so?)
Why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why?
Things can be better, you could be happy, try!
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
'Cause this is a battle
And it's your final last call
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know 
(Can't you see you hurt me so?)
But why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why?
This can be better, we can be happy, try!
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
'Cause this is a battle,
This is a battle
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
And it's your final last call
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
'Cause this is a battle,
This is a battle
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
And it's your final last call
This is a battle and it's your final last call
Now that it's time
Now that the hour hand has landed at the end
Now that it's real
Now that the dreams have given all they had to lend
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go
And maybe try another time
And do I really have a hand in my forgetting?
Now that I've tried
Now that I've finally found that this is not the way
Now that I turn
Now that I feel it's time to spend the night away
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go
And maybe finally split the rhyme
And do I really understand the undernetting?
Yes and the morning has me
Looking in your eyes
And seeing mine warning me
To read the signs carefully
Now that it's light
Now that the candle's falling smaller in my mind
Now that it's here
Now that I'm almost not so very far behind
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go
And maybe follow another sign
And do I really have a song that I can ride on?
Now that I can
Now that it's easy, ever easy all around
Now that I'm here
Now that I'm falling to the sunlights and a song
I want to know
Do I stay or do I go
And do I have to do just one
And can I choose again if I should lose the reason?
Yes, and the morning
Has me looking in your eyes
And seeing mine warning me
To read the signs more carefully
Now that I smile
Now that I'm laughing even deeper inside
Now that I see
Now that I finally found the one thing I denied
It's now I know
Do I stay or do I go
And it is finally I decide
That I'll be leaving
In the fairest of the seasons
Stay with me
You're the one I need
You make the hardest things
Seem easy
Keep my heart
Somewhere drugs don't go
Where the sun shine slows
Always keep me close
If only you could see
The stranger next to me
You promised, you promised that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
Don't let go
We'll dig a great big hole
Down an endless hole
We'll both go
You're so blind
You can't save me this time
Hope comes from inside
And I feel so low tonight
If only you could see
The stranger next to me
You promised, you promised that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
I wish that you could see
This face in front of me
You're sorry, you swear it, you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
(Take me) I need your help
(So far) To pull me up, take the pain
(Take me) Out from me
(So far) Out from me
(Take me) If only you could see
(I need your help)
(So far) The stranger next to me
(To pull me up, take the pain)
(Take me) You promised, you promised that you're done
(Out from me)
(So far) But I can't tell you from the drugs
(Out from me)
(Take me) I wish that you could see
(I need your help)
(So far) This face in front of me
(To pull me up, take the pain)
(Take me) You're sorry, you swear it, you're done
(Out from me)
(So far) But I can't tell you from the drugs
(Out from me)
Keep my heart
Somewhere drugs don't go
Where the sun shine slows
Always keep me close
Can you stop, please?
Can you stop the fire?
You can't stop the fire,
You won't say the words.
Please, Please
Please, please forgive me
But I won't be home again
Maybe someday you'll look up
And barely conscious you'll say to no one
"Isn't something missing?"
You won't cry for my absence I know
You forgot me long ago
Am I that unimportant?
Am I so insignificant?
Isn't something missing?
Isn't someone missing me?
Even though I'm the sacrifice,
You won't try for me, not now.
Though I'd die to know you love me,
I'm all alone.
Isn't someone missing me?
Can you stop, please?
Can you stop the fire?
You can't stop the fire,
You won't say the words.
Please, Please
Please, please forgive me
But I won't be home again.
I know what you do to yourself,
I breathe deep and cry out,
"Isn't something missing?
Isn't someone missing me?"
Even though I'm the sacrifice,
You won't try for me, not now.
Though I'd die to know you love me,
I'm all alone.
Isn't someone missing me?
And if I bleed,
I'll bleed:
Knowing you don't care.
And if I sleep,
Just to dream of you,
And wake without you there.
Isn't something missing?
Isn't something...?
Even though I'm the sacrifice,
You won't try for me, not now.
Though I'd die to know you love me,
I'm all alone.
Isn't something missing?
Isn't someone missing me?
Can you stop, please?
Can you stop the fire?
You can't stop the fire,
You won't say the words.
Please, Please
Hopelessly drift in the eyes of the ghost again
Down on my knees and my hands in the air again
Pushing my face in the memory of you again
But I never know if it's real
Never know how I wanted to feel
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you
Never quite managed the words to explain to you
Never quite knew how to make them believable
And now the time has gone
Another time undone
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you
Never quite managed the words to explain to you
Never quite knew how to make them believable
And now the time has gone
Another time undone
Hopelessly fighting the devil futility
Feeling the monster climb deeper inside of me
Feeling him gnawing my heart away hungrily
I'll never lose this pain
Never dream of you again
I don't know how else to put this, its taking me so long to do this
I'm falling asleep and I can't see straight
My muscles feel like a melee, my body's curled in a "U" shape
I put on my best, but I'm still afraid
Propped up by lies and promises, saving my place as life forgets
Maybe its time I saw the world
I'm only here for awhile, but patience is not my style
And I'm so tired that I gotta go...
What am I supposed to hide now? What am I supposed to do?
Did you really think I wouldn't see this through?
Tell me I should stick around for you; tell me I could have it all
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go
I get to go home in one week, but I'm leaving home in three weeks
They throw me a bone just to pick me dry
I'm following suit and directions, I crawl up inside for protection
I'm told what to do and I don't know why
I'm over existing in limbo, I'm over the myths and placebos
I don't really mind if I just... Fade away...
I'm ready to live with my family, I'm ready to die in obscurity
'Cause I'm so tired that I gotta go
Oh, where am I supposed to hide now? What am I supposed to do?
You still don't think I'm going to see this through?
Tell me I'm a part of history! Tell me I could have it all!
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go
Ooh yeah!
Oh, where am I supposed to hide now? What am I supposed to do?
You still don't think I'm going to see this through?
Tell me I'm a part of history! Tell me I could have it all!
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go!
Yeah...
When they call out your name
Will you walk right up
With a smile on your face?
Or will you cower in fear
In your favorite sweater
With an old love letter?
I wish you would
I wish you would
Come pick me up
Take me out
Fuck me up
Steal my records
Screw all my friends
They're all full of shit
With a smile on your face
And then do it again
I wish you would
When you're walking downtown
Do you wish I was there?
Do you wish it was me?
With the windows clear
And the mannequin's eyes
Do they all look like mine?
You know you could
I wish you would
Come pick me up
Take me out
Fuck me up
Steal my records
Screw all my friends
Behind my back
With a smile on your face
And then do it again
I wish you would
I wish you'd make up my bed
So I could make up my mind
Try it for sleeping instead
Maybe you'll rest sometime
I wish I could
I wish I could
I wish I could
Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could've told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for
One as beautiful as you
Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will
I guess we'll have to move
The neighborhood is onto us
Let's join the little babes
throwin' rocks in front of us
Riding on my bicycle
I pass my sister on a bus
Let's take the country road
before our parents send for us
Trees keep fallin' at my feet
I guess it's time to build a boat
Make a raft of our bodies
Do you think that it'll float?
What I said was not a joke,
But you just licked the envelope
I'm tired of dating, let's elope
But you just licked the envelope
Three cheers for my parents,
Lonely failed experiments!
Three cheers for my parents,
The only failed experiments!
I miss those blue eyes
How you kissed me at night
I miss the way we sleep
Like there's no sunrise
Like the taste of your smile
I miss the way we breathe
But I never told you
What I should have said
No I never told you
I just held it in
And now I miss everything about you
I can't believe I still want you
After all the things we've been through
I miss everything about you
Without you
I see your blue eyes
Every time I close mine
You make it hard to see
Where I belong to when I'm not around you
It's like I'm not with me
But I never told you
What I should have said
No I never told you
I just held it in
And now I miss everything about you
I can't believe I still want you
After all the things we've been through
I miss everything about you
Without you
But I never told you
What I should have said
No I never told you
I just held it in
And now I miss everything about you (Still you're gone)
Can't believe that I still want you (And loving you I never should have walked away)
After all the things we've been through (I know it's never gonna come again)
I miss everything about you
Without you
But I never told you
What I should have said
No I never told you
I just held it in
And now I miss everything about you
I can't believe I still want you
After all the things we've been through
I miss everything about you
Without you
You in the dark
You in the pain
You on the run
Living a hell
Living your ghost
Living your end
Never seem to get in the place that I belong
Don't wanna lose the time, lose the time to come
Whatever you say, it's alright
Whatever you do, it's all good
Whatever you say, it's alright
Silence is not the way
We need to talk about it
If heaven is on the way
If heaven is on the way
You in the sea
On a decline
Breaking the waves
Watching the lights go down
Letting the cables sleep
Whatever you say, it's alright
Whatever you do, it's all good
Whatever you say, it's alright
Silence is not the way
We need to talk about it
If heaven is on the way
We'll wrap the world around it
If heaven is on the way
If heaven is on the way
I'm a stranger in this town
I'm a stranger in this town
I'm a stranger in this town
If heaven is on the way
If heaven is on the way
I'm a stranger in this town
I'm a stranger in this town
Operator, number, please, it's been so many years
Will she remember my old voice while I fight the tears?
Hello, hello there, is this Martha? This is old Tom Frost
And I am calling long distance, don't worry about the cost
'Cause it's been forty years or more, now, Martha, please recall
Meet me out for coffee, where we'll talk about it all
And those were days of roses, poetry and prose
And, Martha, all I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrows and we'd packed away our sorrows
And we saved 'em for a rainy day
And I feel so much older now, you're much older, too
How's the husband? How's your kids? You know that I got married, too?
Lucky that you found someone to make you feel secure
'Cause we were all so young and foolish, now we are mature
And those were days of roses, poetry and prose
And, Martha, all I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrow, we'd packed away our sorrows
And we saved 'em for a rainy day
And I was always so impulsive, I guess that I still am
And all that really mattered then was that I was a man
I guess that our being together was never meant to be
And Martha, Martha, I love you can't you see?
And those were days of roses, poetry and prose
And, Martha, all I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrows, and we'd packed away our sorrows
And we saved them for a rainy day
And I remember quiet evenings trembling close to you
Now and again
It seems worse than it is
But mostly the view is accurate
You see your breath in the air
As you climb up the stairs
To that coffin you call your apartment
And you sink in your chair
Brush the snow from your hair
And drink the cold away
And you're not really sure
What you're doing this for
But you need something to fill up the days
A few more hours
There's a dream in my brain
That just won't go away
It's been stuck there since it came a few nights ago
And I'm standing on a bridge
In the town where I lived
As a kid with my mom and my brothers
And then the bridge disappears
And I'm standing on air
With nothing holding me
And I hang like a star
Fucking glow in the dark
For all those starving eyes to see
Like the ones we've wished on
But now I'm confused
Is this depth really you?
Do these dreams have any meaning?
No no, I think it's more like a ghost
That's been following us both
Something vague that we're not seeing
Something more like a feeling
Waiting for your call, I'm sick, call, I'm angry, call, I'm desperate for your voice
Listening to the song we used to sing
In the car, do you remember?
Butterfly, early summer
It's playing on repeat, just like when we would meet
Like when we would meet
I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to
To make you mine, stay with me tonight
Stripped and polished, I am new, I am fresh,
I am feeling so ambitious, you and me, flesh to flesh
'Cause every breath that you will take when you are sitting next to me,
Will bring life into my deepest hopes, what's your fantasy?
What's your...?
(What's your...? what's your...?)
What's your...?
I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to
To make you mine, stay with me tonight
And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment makes me want to come back home
And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment makes me want to come back home
And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment makes me want to come back home
And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment makes me want to come back home
(I know that everything you wanted was yours)
I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to
And I was born to tell you I love you
(I know that everything you wanted was yours)
And I am torn to do what I have to
(I know that everything you wanted was yours)
To make you mine, stay with me tonight
Maybe somewhere else will not be half as cold as me
The curtains drawn, the winter sun makes patterns on your face
It looks like some kaleidoscopic breathing exercise
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
Baby, won't you breathe?
Baby, won't you breathe?
Hold me in your freezing arms before we have to go
I wince a little, but it's not because I know the truth
The windshield of your little car is frosted through the glass
A clear heart of air appears as we shiver on the seats
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
Treat it as a test
Treat it as a test
Baby, won't you breathe?
Baby, won't you breathe?
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same
No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around
Christian brothers gonna take him down
But it can't help me get over
Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Fake concern says "what's the matter, man?"
And you think I ought to shake your motherfuckin' hand
Well, I know how much you care
Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
Wakin' in the dawn of day
I gotta think about what I wanna say
Phone ringin' off the shelf
I guess he wanted to kill himself
Wakin' on a pretty day
Don't know why I ever go away
It's hard to explain
My love in this daze
You can say I've been most all around
But honey I ain't goin' nowhere
Don't worry 'bout a thing
It's only dying
I live along a straight line
Nothin' always comes to mind
To be frank, I'm fried
But I don't mind
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Been diggin'
Layin' low, low, low
I'm diggin' in
Layin' low, low, low
Dig, dig in
To these lives that we are livin'
Livin' low
Lackadaisically so
Risin' at the crack of dawn
I gotta think about what wisecrack
I'm gonna drop along the way today
Phone ringin' off the shelf
I guess somebody got somethin' they
Really wanna prove to us today
Wakin' on a pretty day
For any place
No use sayin' nothin'
To explain it
To my loved ones today
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
I survived the dinner
Then the air went thinner
I retire to the briars by the pool
It gets so loud
If I die this instant
Taken from a distance
They will probably list it down
Among other things 'round town
Got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down
In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of the white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound
All the L.A. women
Fall asleep while swimming
I got paid to fish 'em out
And then one day I lost the job
And I cried a little
I got fried a little
Then she laid her eyes on mine
And she said, "Babe, you're better off."
I got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down
In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of the white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today
As the free fall advances
I'm the moron who dances, ah
I was teething on roses
I was in Guns and Noses, ah
Under the withering white skies of humiliation
Under the withering white skies of humiliation
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
I was dressed for success, but success it never comes
And I'm the only one who laughs at your jokes when they are so bad
And your jokes are always bad
But they're not as bad as this
Come join us in a prayer
We'll be waiting, waiting where
Everything's ending here
And all the sterile striking, it defends an empty dock you cast away
And rain upon the forehead where the mist's for hire if it's just too clear
Let's spend our last quarterstance randomly
Go down to the outlet once again
Painted portraits of minions and slaves, crotch mavens and one-night plays
Are they the only ones who laugh at the jokes when they are so bad?
And the jokes, they're always bad
But they're not as bad as this
Come join us in a prayer
We'll be waiting, waiting where
Everything's ending here
And all the Spanish candles unsold away have gone to this
And a run-on piece of mountain trembles, shivers, runs down the freeway
I guess she spent her last quarter randomly
I guess a guess is the best I'll do
Last time
Last time
Was the best time
I spent
That I would be good, even if I did nothing...
That I would be good, even if I got the thumbs down...
That I would be good if I got and stayed sick...
That I would be good, even if I gained ten pounds...
That I would be fine, even if I went bankrupt...
That I would be good if I lost my hair and my youth...
That I would be great if I was no longer queen...
That I would be grand if I was not all knowing...
That I would be loved, even when I numb myself...
That I would be good, even when I am overwhelmed...
That I would be loved, even when I was fuming...
That I would be good, even if I was clingy...
That I would be good, even if I lost sanity...
That I would be good, whether with or without you...
I was on your porch
The smoke sank into my skin
So I came inside to be with you
We talked all night
About everything you could imagine
'Cause come the morning, I'll be gone
And as our eyes start to close
I turn to you and I let you know
That I love you
Well my dad was sick
My mom, she cared for him
Her loving nursed him back to life
And me, I ran
I couldn't even look at him
For fear I'd have to say goodbye
And as I start to leave
He grabs me by the shoulder and he tells me
"What's left to lose?
You've done enough
And if you fail, well then you fail, but not to us
'Cause these last three years
I know they have been hard
But now it's time to get out of the desert and into the sun
Even if it's alone"
So now here I sit
In a hotel off of Sunset
My thoughts bounce off Sam's guitar
And that's the way it's been
Ever since we were kids, but now
Now, we've got something to prove
And I, I can see their eyes
But tell me something, can they see mine?
'Cause what's left to lose?
I've done enough
And if I fail, then I fail, but I gave it a shot
'Cause these last three years
I know they have been hard
But now it's time to get out of the desert and into the sun
Even if it's alone
(Even if it's alone)
Even if it's alone
I was on your porch last night
The smoke, it sank into my skin
Love in our life is just too valuable
Oh, to feel for even a second without it
But life without death is just impossible
Oh, to realize something is ending within us
Feelin' yourself disintegrate
Feelin' yourself disintegrate
Feelin' yourself disintegrate
Feelin' yourself disintegrate
Feelin' yourself disintegrate
Feelin' yourself disintegrate
Feelin' yourself disintegrate
Feelin' yourself disintegrate
I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time;
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind...
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets,
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget...
I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know - I was here...
I want to say I lived each day until I die,
And know that I meant something in somebody's life...
The hearts that I touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see...
I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know...
I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know - I was here...
I just want them to know that I gave my all, did my best, brought someone some happiness,
Left this world a little better, just because I was here...
I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I want to leave my mark so everyone will know...
I was here;
(I lived,) I lived... (I loved...)
I was here...
(I did,) I did! (I've done...)
I was here!
(I lived,) I lived... (I loved) I loved!
I was here... (Oh, ooh, ooh...)
I did, I've done...
I was here.

Sleep don't weep
My sweet love
Your face it's all wet
And your day was rough
So do what you must do
To find yourself
Wear another's shoe
Or paint my shelves
There's times that I was broke
And you stood strong
I think I found a place
Where I ...
Sleep don't weep
My sweet love
Your face it's all wet
'Cause our days were rough
So do what you must do
To fill that hole
Wear another's shoe
To comfort the sole
There's times that I was broke
And you stood strong
I think I found a place
Where I feel I will...
Sleep don't weep
My sweet love
My face it's all wet
'Cause my day was rough
So do what you must do
To find yourself
Wear another's shoe
Or paint my shelves
There's times that I was broke
And you stood strong
I hope I find a place where I feel I belong
Sleep don't weep
My sweet love
My face it's all wet
'Cause my day was rough
Don't weep
My sweet love
My face is all wet
'Cause my days were rough
I don't know what I've done
Or if I like what I've begun
But something told me to run
And honey you know me it's all or none
There were sounds in my head
Little voices whispering
That I should go and this should end
Oh and I found myself listening
'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you
All I know is that I should
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you
All I know is that I should
'Cause she will love you more than I could
She who dares to stand where I stood
See I thought love was black and white
That it was wrong or it was right
But you ain't leaving without a fight
And I think I am just as torn inside
'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you
All I know is that I should
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you
All I know is that I should
'Cause she will love you more than I could
She who dares to stand where I stood
And I won't be far from where you are if ever you should call
You meant more to me than anyone I ever loved at all
But you taught me how to trust myself and so I say to you
This is what I have to do
'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you
All I know is that I should
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you
All I know is that I should
'Cause she will love you more than I could
She who dares to stand where I stood
Oh, she who dares to stand where I stood
I'm waiting for the train
The subway that only goes one way
The stupid thing that will come to pull us apart
And make everybody late
You spent everything you had
Wanted everything to stop that bad
And now I'm a crushed credit card registered to Smith
Not the name that you call me with
You turned white like a saint
I'm tired of dancing on a pot of gold flake paint
Oh, we're so very precious, you and I
And everything that you do makes me want to die
Oh, I just told the biggest lie
I just told the biggest lie
The biggest lie
All I need is a little love in my life
All I need is a little love in the dark
A little, but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little, but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart, yeah
Shotgun, aimed at my heart, you got one
Tear me apart and then some
How do we call this love?
I tried, to run away but your eyes
Tell me to stay, oh why
Why do we call this love?
It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
When I say,
All I need is a little love in my life
All I need is a little love in the dark
A little, but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little, but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
Maybe, some part of you just hates me
You pick me and play me
How do we call this love?
One time, tell me you need me tonight
To make it easy, you lie
And say, "it's all for love"
It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
When I say,
All I need is a little love in my life
All I need is a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
(Whoa, whoa)
Me and my broken heart
(Whoa, whoa)
(Me and my broken...)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Me and my broken...)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(How do we call this love?)
It's just me
It's just me
It's just me
Me and my broken heart
All I need is a little love in my life
All I need is a little love in the dark
A little, but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little, but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And he's taken just all that I had
But if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know
The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
And when it comes to loving me he's worst
I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
If you want, I'll try to love again, try
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know
Oh, the first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
And when it comes to loving me he's worst
(Instrumental break)
I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
But I'm sure gonna give you a try
'Cause if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know
Oh, the first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
And when it comes to loving me he's worst
Oh, the first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
Try to love again
While this town is busy sleeping
All the noise died away
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
But she'll never change her ways
Don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart feels so still
As I try to find the will to forget her somehow
Oh I think I've forgotten her now
Her love is a rose pale and dying
Dropping her petals in pain unknown
All full of wine the world before her
But sober with no place to go
Don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart is frozen still
As I try to find the will to forget her somehow
She's somewhere out there now
Oh my tears fall down as I tried to forget
Her love was a joke from the day that we met
All of the words, All of her men
All of my pain when I think back to when
Remember her hair as it shone in the sun
It was on the bed that I knew what she'd done
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need her again
Don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Oh my heart is frozen still
As I try to find the will to forget her somehow
She's out there somewhere now
Oh
She was heartache from the day that I first met her
My heart is frozen still
As I try to find the will to forget you somehow
'Cause I know you're somewhere out there right now
It's not what you thought
When you first began it
You got what you want
Now you can hardly stand it, though
By now you know
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
Till you wise up
You're sure there's a cure
And you have finally found it
You think one drink
Will shrink you till you're underground
And living down
But it's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
Till you wise up
Prepare a list for what you need
Before you sign away the deed
'Cause it's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
Till you wise up
No, it's not going to stop
Till you wise up
No, it's not going to stop
So just give up
There's a heart on the line, and it rests with your eyes
Please don't fade and please don't cry, 'cause it's all white lies
Take a chance watch it fall, grab too much and lose it all
Now I've lost my disguise, it was all white lies
Stay here, lie with me here, oh lo-fi, lonely sighs
I will roam lost but never alone, hide with me, hide
Would it help if I tried, or has it sailed and passed me by
First love grows then it does, and it's all white lies
Stay here, lie with me here, oh lo-fi, lonely sighs
I will roam lost but never alone, hide with me, hide with me
Now you move with the tide and I've heard you've found peace of mind
And I now know that life's design moves around white lies, white lies, white lies, white lies
I don't feel alright in spite of these comforting sounds you make.
I don't feel alright because you make promises that you break.
Into your house, why don't we share our solitude?
Nothing is pure anymore but solitude.
It's hard to make sense, feels as if I'm sensing you through a lens.
If someone else comes, I'll just sit here listening to the drums.
Previously I never called it solitude.
And probably you know all the dirty shows I've put on.
Blunted and exhausted like anyone.
Honestly I tried to avoid it. Honestly.
Back when we were kids, we would always know when to stop.
And now all the good kids are messing up.
Nobody has gained or accomplished anything.
The building turned its back, ignored my call
The concrete looks too thin to break my fall
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene
I counted people as I neared the street below
I saw it all, I saw it all go down
The shadow grew as he approached the ground
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene
I turned away as he came near the street below
Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on
You don?�t want me, no
You don?�t need me
Like I want you, oh
Like I need you
And I want you in my life
And I need you in my life
You can?�t see me, no
Like I see you
I can?�t have you, no
Like you have me
And I want you in my life
And I need you in my life
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
You can?�t feel me, no
Like I feel you
I can?�t steal you, no
Like you stole me
And I want you in my life
And I need you in my life
I never thought that I would find myself in bed amongst the stones
The columns are all men begging to crush me. No shapes sail on the dark deep lakes
And no flags wave me home
In the caves all cats are grey, in the caves the texture coats my skin
In the death cell a single note rings on and on and on
And so once again
My dear Johnny, my dear friend
And so once again
You are fighting us all
And when I ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry and I fall
Oh my friend, how did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum
You say I have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But I can remember
All the good things you are
And so I ask you, please
Can I help you find the peace and the star
Oh my friend, what time is this
To trade the handshake for the fist
And so once again
Oh America, my friend
And so once again
You are fighting us all
And when we ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry and we fall
Oh my friend, how did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum
You say we have turned
Like the enemies you earned
But we can remember
All the good things you are
And so we ask you, please
Can we help you find the peace and the star
Oh my friend, we have all come
To fear the beating of your drum
Look at me, my depth perception must be off again
'Cause this hurts deeper than I thought it did
It has not healed with time
It just shot down my spine
You look so beautiful tonight
Reminds me how you laid us down
And gently smiled
Before you destroyed my life
Would you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces?
(Let me rest in pieces)
Would you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces?
(Let me rest in pieces, pieces)
Look at me, my depth perception must be off again
You got much closer than I thought you did
I'm in your reach
You held me in your hands
But could you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces?
(Let me rest in pieces)
Would you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces?
(Let me rest in pieces)
Would you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces?
Would you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces?
Would you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces?
(Let me rest in pieces)
Would you find it in your heart?
Would you find it in your heart?
Would you let me rest in pieces?
Would you find it in your heart?
Would you let me rest in pieces?
(Find it in your heart...)
Would you find it in your heart?
Would you let me rest in pieces?
Would you find it in your heart?
Would you let me rest in pieces?
I am terrified of all things
Frightened of the dark
I am
You are taller than a mountain
Deeper than the sea
You are
Hold me
Hold me
Take me with you 'cause I'm lonely
I was closer to you back then
I was happier
I was
You are fading further from me
Why don't you come home to me?
Hold me
Hold me
Take me with you 'cause I'm lonely
I am...
I am...
Cold
Hold Me
Hold me
Hold me
Take me with you 'cause I'm lonely
Hold me
Hold me
Take me with you 'cause I'm lonely
Hold me
Hold me
It was Don DeLillo, whiskey neat
And a blinking midnight clock
Speakers on a TV stand
Just a turntable to watch
And the smoke came out our mouths
On all those hooded sweatshirt walks
We were a stroke of luck
We were a gold mine, they gutted us
And from the sidelines you see me run
Until I'm out of breath
Living the good life, I left for dead
The sorrowful Midwest
Well I did my best...
To keep my head
It was grass stain jeans and incompletes
And a girl from class to touch
But you think about yourself too much
And you ruin who you love
Well all these claims at consciousness
My stray dog freedom
Let's have a nice clean cut
Like a bag we buy and divy up
And from the sidelines, I see you run
Until you're out of breath
And all those white lines that sped us up
We hurried to our death
Well I lagged behind...
So you got ahead
Good morning, son.
I am a bird
Wearing a brown polyester shirt
You want a coke?
Maybe some fries?
The roast beef combo's only $9.95
It's okay, you don't have to pay
I've got all the change
Everybody knows
It hurts to grow up
And everybody does
It's so weird to be back here
Let me tell you what
The years go on and
We're still fighting it, we're still fighting it
And you're so much like me
I'm sorry
Good morning, son
In twenty years from now
Maybe we'll both sit down and have a few beers
And I can tell you 'bout today
And how I picked you up and everything changed
It was pain
Sunny days and rain
I knew you'd feel the same things
Everybody knows
It sucks to grow up
And everybody does
It's so weird to be back here.
Let me tell you what
The years go on and
We're still fighting it, we're still fighting it
You'll try and try and one day you'll fly
Away from me
Good morning, son
I am a bird
It was pain
Sunny days and rain
I knew you'd feel the same things
Everybody knows
It hurts to grow up
And everybody does
It's so weird to be back here.
Let me tell you what
The years go on and
We're still fighting it, we're still fighting it
Oh, we're still fighting it, we're still fighting it
And you're so much like me
I'm sorry
We'll rise above this
We'll cry about this
As we live and learn
A broken promise
I was not honest
Now I watch as tables turn
And you're singing
I'll wait my turn
To tear inside you
Watch you burn
I'll wait my turn
I'll wait my turn
I'll cry about this
And hide my cuckold eyes
As you come off all concerned
And I'll find no solace
In your poor apology
In your regret that sounds absurd
Keep singing
I'll wait my turn
To tear inside you
Watch you burn
And I'll wait my turn
To terrorize you
Watch you burn
I'll wait my turn
I'll wait my turn
A Promise is a promise
A Promise is a promise
A Promise is a promise
A Promise is a promise
And I'll wait my turn
To tear inside you
Watch you burn
I'll wait my turn
I'll wait my turn
A broken promise
You were not honest
I'll bide my time
I'll wait my turn
I've been watching your world from afar
I've been trying to be where you are
And I've been secretly falling apart
Unseen
To me, you're strange and you're beautiful
You'd be so perfect with me
But you just can't see
You turn every head but you don't see me
I'll put a spell on you
You'll fall asleep
When I put a spell on you
And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see
And you'll realize that you love me
Yeah
Ye-ah
Sometimes the last thing you want comes in first
Sometimes the first thing you want never comes
But I know that waiting is all you can do
Sometimes
I'll put a spell on you
You'll fall asleep
When I put a spell on you
And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see
And you'll realise that you love me
I'll put a spell on you
You'll fall asleep
'Cause I put a spell on you
And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see
And you'll realize that you love me, yeah
Yeah
Ye-ah
Yeah
Ye-ah
Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave and I'll lay me down
Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne with your pretty white beads
Oh John you'll never be a man
And you'll never see your home again
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
Tonight will be your very last night
A woman said, "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes
Hindley wakes and says
"Wherever he has gone I have gone"
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes
Hindley wakes and says
"Oh whatever he has done I have done"
But this is no easy ride
For a child cries
Oh find me, find me, nothing more
We are on a sullen misty moor
We may be dead and we may be gone
But we will be, we will be
We will be right by your side
Until the day you die, this is no easy ride
We will haunt you when you laugh
Yes, you could say we're a team
You might sleep, you might sleep
You might sleep, but
You will never dream
You might sleep but you will never dream
You might sleep but you will never dream
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Find me, find me
Find me, I'll haunt you when you laugh
I'll haunt you when you laugh
You might sleep but you will never dream
Over the moors, I'm on the moor
Over the moor
The child is on the moor
I wrapped you inside my coat
When they came to firebomb the house
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no one can touch me
Now that I'm held in your spell
A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust
Sell me a car that goes
Sell me a house that stands, oh
I never cared before, I never cared before
I never cared before, before, before, before
A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust
A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust
I stood in front of her face
When the first bullet was shot
I know I'm unlovable
You don't have to tell me
I don't have much in my life
But take it, it's yours
I don't have much in my life
But take it, it's yours
I know I'm unlovable
You don't have to tell me
Message received
Loud and clear
Loud and clear
I don't have much in my life
But take it, it's yours
I know I'm unlovable
You don't have to tell me
Message received
Loud and clear
Loud and clear
Message received
I don't have much in my life
But take it, it's yours
I wear black on the outside
'Cause black is how I feel on the inside
I wear black on the outside
'Cause black is how I feel on the inside
And if I seem a little strange
Well, that's because I am
And if I seem a little strange
That's because I am
But I know that you would like me
If only you could see me
If only you could meet me
I don't have much in my life
But take it, it's yours
I don't have much in my life
But take it, it's yours
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Among the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky, 
When we walked in fields of gold
So she took her love
For to gaze awhile 
Among the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold
Will you stay with me? 
Will you be my love
Among the fields of barley?
And you can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
I never made promises lightly,
And there have been some that I have broken
But I swear in the days still left 
We will walk in fields of gold
We will walk in fields of gold
I never made promises lightly,
And there have been some that I have broken
But I swear in the days still left 
We will walk in fields of gold
We will walk in fields of gold
Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
As you lie in fields of gold
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Among the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
Found you there
In the blink of an eye
I miss you
Turned away
Into a thousand dreams
Found out what they mean
Lost you there
In a moment of truth
I trust you
Gave away
The one and only heart
A gift to tear apart
Stain me
Save me
Take me to my home
Hold me
Show me
Take me to my home
Weaker now
Drawing fluid from me
You kill me
I'm not afraid
Of what you have just done
But of what you've just become
Hello, I'm your martyr, will you be my gangster? 
Can you feel my trigger hand, moving further down your back?
When you hide, hide inside that body 
But just remember that when I touch you 
The more you shake, the more you give away 
Cold, but I'm still here, blind, 'cause I'm so blind, say never 
We're far from comfortable this time 
Cold, now we're so cold, mine, and you're not mine, say never 
We're far from obvious this time 
Wait another minute here, time will kill us after all 
Can you feel its second hand wrapped around your neck 
So fall into my eyes and fall into my lies 
But don't you forget 
The more you turn away, the more I want you to stay 
Cold, but I'm still here, blind, 'cause I'm so blind, say never 
We're far from comfortable this time 
Cold, now we're so cold, mine, and you're not mine, say never 
We're far from obvious this time 
You're so endearing, you're so beautiful, 
Well I don't look like they do, and I don't love like they do 
But I don't hate like they do 
Am I ever on your mind? 
Cold, but I'm still here, blind, 'cause I'm so blind, say never 
We're far from comfortable this time 
Cold, now we're so cold, mine, and you're not mine, say never 
We're far from obvious this time  
(Cold) You broke me from the very first night 
I'm far too comfortable this time 
(Cold) I loved you from the very first night 
You broke me 'til the day that I die 
I'm far too obvious this time
So far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
How I wish I could, but you're so far away
One more song about movin' along the highway
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it bein' close to you
But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away
Travelin' around sure gets me down and lonely
Nothin' else to do but close my mind
I sure do hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find
But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away
You're so far away
You're so far away
I can't imagine all the people that you know 
And the places that you go 
When the lights are turned down low 
And I don't understand all the things you've seen 
But I'm slipping in between 
You and your big dreams 
It's always you 
In my big dreams 
And you tell me that it's over 
Wake up lying in a patch of four leaf clover 
And you're restless, and I'm naked 
You gotta get out 
You can't stand to see me shaking 
No 
Could you let me go? 
I didn't think so 
And you don't wanna be here in the future 
So you say the present's just a pleasant interruption to the past 
And you don't wanna look much closer 
'Cause you're afraid to find out all this hope
You had sent into the sky by now had crashed 
And it did 
Because of me 
And then you bring me home 
Afraid to find out that you're alone 
And I'm sleeping in your living room 
But we don't have much room to live 
I had these dreams, in them, I learned to play guitar 
Maybe cross the country 
Become a rock star 
And there was hope in me that I could take you there 
But dammit, you're so young 
Well, I don't think I care 
And if I hurt you 
Then I'm sorry 
Please don't think that this was easy 
And then you'd bring me home 
'Cause we both know what it's like to be alone 
And I'm dreaming in your living room 
But we don't have much room to live 
And Konstantine is walking down the stairs 
Doesn't she look good 
Standing in her underwear 
And I was thinking 
What I was thinking 
But we've been drinking, and it doesn't get me anywhere 
My Konstantine came walking down the stairs 
And all that I could do was touch her long blonde hair 
And I've been thinking 
But it hurts me, thinking
That these nights when we were drinking 
No, they never got us anywhere 
No 
This is because I can spell confusion with a K 
And I can like it 
It's to dying in another's arms and why I had to try it 
It's to Jimmy Eat World and those nights in my car 
When the first star you see may not be a star 
I'm not your star 
Isn't that what you said 
What you thought this song meant 
And if this is what it takes 
Just to lie with my mistakes 
And live with what I did to you 
All the hell I put you through 
I always catch the clock 
It's 11:11 
And now you want to talk 
It's not hard to dream 
You'll always be my Konstantine 
My Konstantine
They'll never hurt you like I do 
No, they'll never hurt you like I do 
No, no, no no no no no no no
This is to a girl who got into my head 
With all the pretty things she did 
Hey 
You know 
You keep me up in bed 
This is to a girl who got into my head 
With all these fucked up things I did 
Hey 
Maybe 
Baby 
You could keep me up in bed 
My Konstantine 
You spin around me like a dream 
We played out on this movie screen 
And I said 
Did you know I miss you?
Did you know I miss you?
Did you know I miss you?
Did you know I miss you?
Did you know I miss you?
Did you know I miss you?
Did you know I miss you?
I miss you 
And then you bring me home 
And we'll go to sleep, but this time, not alone, no no 
And you'll kiss me in your living room 
I know 
I know you miss me in your living room 
'Cause these nights I think maybe that I miss you in my living room 
But we don't have much room 
I said does anybody need that room? 
Because we all need a little more room 
To live 
My Konstantine
Couldn't save you from the start
Love you so it hurts my soul
Can you forgive me for trying again
Your silence makes me hold my breath
Time has passed you by
Oh, for so long I've tried to shield you from the world
Oh, you couldn't face the freedom on your own
Here I am left in silence
You gave up the fight
You left me behind
All that's done's forgiven
You'll always be mine
I know deep inside
All that's done's forgiven
I watched the clouds drifting away
Still the sun can't warm my face
I know it was destined to go wrong
You were looking for the great escape
To chase your demons away
Oh, for so long I've tried to shield you from the world
Oh, you couldn't face the freedom on your own
And here I am left in silence
You gave up the fight
You left me behind
All that's done's forgiven
You'll always be mine
I know deep inside
All that's done's forgiven
I've been so lost since you've gone
Why not me before you?
Why did fate deceive me?
Everything turned out so wrong
Why did you leave me in silence?
You gave up the fight
You left me behind
All that's done's forgiven
You'll always be mine
I know deep inside
All that's done's forgiven
I know the feeling of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing from cutting yourself with a jagged edge
I'm telling you that, it's never that bad
And take it from someone who's been where you're at
You're laid out on the floor and you're not sure
You can take this anymore
So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell; I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Please let me take you out of the darkness and into the light
'Cause I have faith in you that you're gonna make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done, you're far too young
And the best is yet to come
So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell; I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Well everybody's hit the bottom and everybody's been forgotten
Well everybody's tired of being alone
And everybody's been abandoned and left a little empty handed
So if you're out there barely hangin' on
So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell; I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Whoa, oh, yeah,
She was so young with such innocent eyes
She always dreamt of a fairytale life
And all the things your money can't buy
She thought daddy was a wonderful guy
Then suddenly, things seemed to change
It was the moment she took on his name
He took his anger out on her face
She kept all of her pain locked away
Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again
So mother, I thank you
For all you've done and still do
You got me, I got you
Together we always pull through
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother
It was the day that he turned on his kids
That she knew she just had to leave him
So many voices inside of her head
Saying over and over and over,
"You deserve much more than this."
She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises)
So tired of defending her life, she could have died
Fighting for the lives of her children
Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed)
Oh mother, don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again (he'll never hurt us again)
So mother, I thank you (thank you)
For all that you've done and still do (still do)
You got me, I got you, (yeah you got me and I got you)
Together we always pull through.
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother
All of your life you have spent
Burying hurt and regret
But mama, he'll never touch us again
For every time he tried to break you down
Just remember who's still around
It's over, and we're stronger
And we'll never have to go back again
Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back (oh mother don't look back again)
'Cause he'll never hurt us again ('cause he'll never hurt us again)
So mother, I thank you (and I thank you for everything you've done)
For all that you've done and still do (together we always move on)
You got me, I got you, (you got me, I got you)
Together we always pull through (always pull through)
We always pull through
We always pull through
I love you mom
Well, all the apostles, they're sitting in swings
Saying, "I'd sell off my savior for a set of new rings
And some sandals with the style of straps that cling best to the era"
So all of the businessers in unlimited hell
Where they buy and they sell
And they sell all their trash to each other
But they're sick of it all and they're bankrupt on selling
And all of the angels, they'd sell off your soul
For a set of new wings and anything gold
They remember the people they loved
Their old friends and I've seen through 'em all
Seen through 'em all, seen through most everything
All the people you knew were the actors
All the people you knew were the actors
Well, I'll go to college and I'll learn some big words
And I'll talk real loud, goddamn right, I'll be heard
And you'll remember the guy who said all those big words
He must've learned in college
And it took a long time till I came clean with myself
I come clean out of love with my lover
I still love her, loved her more when she used to be sober
And I was kinder
I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing
My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry
Did it happen when we first kissed
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I shoulda never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Gotta figure out how you stole my heart
My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry
How did I get here with you, I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so, personal
After all I tried to do, stay away from loving you
I'm broken-hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry
All my life...
They're waking you up to close the bar
The street's wet, you can tell by the sound of the cars
The bartender's singing "Clementine"
While he's turning around the open sign
Dreadful sorry, Clementine
Though you're still her man it seems a long time gone
Maybe the whole thing's wrong
What if she thinks so but just didn't say so
You drank yourself into slow-mo
Made an angel in the snow
Anything to pass the time
And keep that song out of your mind
Oh my darling
Oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine
Dreadful sorry, Clementine
Dreadful sorry, Clementine
Sew this up with threads of reason and regret
So, I will not forget. I will not forget
How this felt one year six months ago
I know I cannot forget. I cannot forget
I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that I can share with you
I can tell that you don't know me anymore
It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget
And being on this road is anything but sure
Maybe we'll forget, I hope we don't forget
I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that I can share with you
So many nights, legs tangled tight
Wrap me up in a dream with you
Close up these eyes, try not to cry
All that I've got to pull me through is memories of you
Memories of you
Memories of you
Memories of you
I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that we can share
Falling into memories of you and things we used to do
The King's Crossing was the main attraction, dominoes falling in a chain reaction
The scraping subject ruled by fear told me whiskey works better than beer
The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final, and nobody gets a reprieve
And every wave is tidal, if you hang around you're going to get wet
I can't prepare for death any more than I already have
All you can do now is watch the shells
The game looks easy, that's why it sells
Frustrated fireworks inside your head are gonna stand and deliver talk instead
The method acting that pays my bills keeps the fat man feeding in Beverly Hills
I got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity
And I get my check from the trash treasury
Because I took my own insides out
It don't matter 'cause I have no sex life, and all I wanna do now is inject my ex-wife
I've seen the movie and I know what happens
It's Christmas time and the needles on the tree, a skinny Santa is bringing something to me
His voice is overwhelming, but his speech is slurred
And I only understand every other word
Open your parachute and grab your gun, falling down like an omen, a setting sun
Read the part and return at 5, it's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive
But I don't care if I fuck up, I'm going on a date with a rich white lady
Ain't life great?
Give me one good reason not to do it (because we love you)
So do it
This is the place where time reverses
And dead men talk to all the pretty nurses
Instruments shine on a silver tray
Don't let me get carried away
Don't let me get carried away
Don't let me be carried away
I'm just so tired
Won't you sing me to sleep
Fly through my dreams
So I can hitch a ride
With you tonight
And get away from this place
Have a new name and face
I just ain't the same without you in my life
Late night drives
All alone in my car
I can't help but start
Singing lines
From all our favorite songs
And there are melodies in the air
Singing Life just ain't fair
But sometimes I still just can't
Believe you're gone
And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Then we will make it through
One more year, down here
Feel your fire when it's cold in my heart
And things sorta start reminding me
Of my last night with you
I only need one more day
Just one more chance to say
I wish that I had gone up with you too
And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Then we will make it through
One more year, down here
You won't be coming back
And I didn't get to say goodbye
I really wish I got to say goodbye
And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Then we will make it through
One more year, down here
I hope that all is well in heaven
'Cause it's all shot to hell down here
I hope that I find you in heaven
'Cause I'm so lost without you down here
You won't be coming back
And I didn't get to say goodbye
I really wish I got to say goodbye
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Now, I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
Well, you could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Thanks for all you've done
I've missed you for so long
I can't believe you're gone and
You still live in me
I feel you in the wind
You guide me constantly
I never knew what it was to be alone... no
'Cause you were always there for me
You were always the waiting
But now I come home
And I miss your face so
Smiling down on me
I close my eyes to see
And I know
You're a part of me
And it's your song
That sets me free
I sing it while
I feel I can't hold on
I sing tonight
'Cause it comforts me
I carry the things that remind me of you
In loving memory of the one that was so true
You were as kind as you could be
And even though you're gone
You still mean the world to me
I never knew what it was to be alone... no
'Cause you were always there for me
You were always the waiting
But now I come home
And it's not the same no
It feels empty and alone
I can't believe you're gone
And I know
You're a part of me
And it's your song
That sets me free
I sing it while
I feel I can't hold on
I sing tonight
'Cause it comforts me
I'm glad He set you free from sorrow
But I'll still love you more tomorrow
And you'll be here
With me still
All you did you did with feeling
And you always found a meaning
And you always will
And you always will
And you always will
And I know
You're a part of me
And it's your song
That sets me free
I sing it while
I feel I can't hold on
I sing tonight
'Cause it comforts me
It's the same outside
Driving to the riverside
I pretend to cry
Even if I cried alone
I forgot the start
Use my hands to use my heart
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Since the first of June
Lost my job and lost my room
I pretend to try
Even if I tried alone
I forgot the part
Lose my hands to use my heart
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Even if I died
The Litebrite's now black-and-white
'Cause they took apart a picture that wasn't right
Pitch burning on a shining sheet
The only maker that you'd want to meet
A dying man in a living room
Whose shadow paces the floor
He'll take you out any open door
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
Fond farewell to a friend
He said "really, I just wanna dance"
Good and evil matched perfect, it's a great romance
I can deal with some psychic pain
If it'll slow down my higher brain
Veins full of disappearing ink
Vomiting in the kitchen sink
Disconnecting from the missing link
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
Fond farewell to a friend
I see you're leaving me and taking up with the enemy
The cold comfort of the in-between
A little less than a human being
A little less than a happy high
A little less than a suicide
The only things that you really tried
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
Fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Remember when we used to look how sun sets far away?
And how you said: "this is never over"
I believed your every word and I guess you did too
But now you're saying "hey, let's think this over"
You take My hand and pull me next to you, so close to you
I have a feeling you don't have the words
I found one for you, kiss your cheek, say bye, and walk away
Don't look back 'cause I am crying
I remember little things, you hardly ever do
Tell me why
I don't know why it's over
I remember shooting stars, the walk we took that night
I hope your wish came true, mine betrayed me
You let my hand go, and you fake a smile for me
I have a feeling you don't know what to do
I look deep in your eyes, hesitate a while...
Why are you crying?
Tallulah, it's easier to live alone than fear the time it's over
Tallulah, find the words and talk to me, oh, Tallulah,
This could be... heaven
I see you walking hand in hand with long-haired drummer of the band
In love with her or so it seems, he's dancing with my beauty queen
Don't even dare to say you hi, still swallowing the goodbye
But I know the feelings still alive, still alive
I lost my patience once, so do you punish me now
I'll always love you, no matter what you do
I'll win you back for me if you give me a chance
But there is one thing you must understand
Tallulah, it's easier to live alone than fear the time it's over
Tallulah, find the words and talk to me, oh, Tallulah,
This could be...
Tallulah, it's easier to live alone than fear the time it's over
Tallulah, find the words and talk to me, oh, Tallulah,
This could be...
It's a good thing tears never show in the pouring rain
As if a good thing ever could make up for all the pain
There'll be no last chance to promise to never mess it up again
Just the sweet pain of watching your back as you walk
As I'm watching you walk away
And now you're gone, there's like an echo in my head
And I remember every word you said
It's a cruel thing you'll never know all the ways I tried
It's a hard thing faking a smile when I feel like I'm falling apart inside
And now you're gone, there's like an echo in my head
And I remember every word you said
But you never were, and you never will be mine
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
For the first time, there is no mercy in your eyes
And the cold wind's hitting my face and you're gone
And you're walking away, away
And I am helpless sometimes, wishing's just no good
Cause you don't see me like I wish you would
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
I saw you at the station
You had your arm around what's-her-name
She had on that scarf I gave you
And you got down to tie her laces
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
(You looked happy, and that's great)
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
(I just miss you, that's all)
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you have always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
(You never were, and you never will)
You never were, and you never will be mine
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you have always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
All the wild horses
All the wild horses
Tethered with tears in their eyes
May no man's touch ever tame
May no man's reigns ever chain you
And may no man's weight
Ever defrayed your soul
And as for the clouds
Just let them roll
Roll away
Roll away
As for the clouds
Just let them roll
Roll away
Roll away
My head is a-spinning round
My heart is in my shoes, yeah
I went and set the Thames on fire
Now I must come back down
She's laughing in her sleeve, boys
I can feel it in my bones
Oh, but anywhere, anywhere I'm gonna lay my head
I'm gonna call my home
Well I see that the world is upside-down
Seems that my pockets were filled up with gold
And now the clouds, well they've covered everything, oh
And the wind is blowing cold
Well I don't need anybody
Because I learned, I learned to be alone
Well I said anywhere, anywhere, anywhere I lay my head, boys
Well I gonna call my home
I don't think it's going to happen anymore
You took my thoughts from me, now I want nothing more
And did you think you could just take it all away
I don't think it's happening, this is what I say
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
'Cause I found it all
Twenty One
Twenty One
Twenty One
So I don't think it's going to happen anymore
I don't think it's going to happen anymore
Twenty One

Breathe you out, breathe you in
You keep coming back to tell me you're the one who could've been
And my eyes see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears
Try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself and don't look back
I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
That maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
So let me go, just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us grow deeper and much darker everyday
Watch me now, and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for everyone but you
Even when I cross the line
It's like a lie I told a thousand times
I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
That maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
From under, from under
From under, from under
And part of me still believes when you say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes we can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So let's just say goodbye forever
I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
That maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
That maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
From under, from under
From under, from under
Ya estoy curado
Anestesiado
Ya me he olvidado de ti.
Hoy me despido
De tu ausencia
Ya estoy en paz.
Ya no te espero
Ya no te llamo
Ya no me engaño
Hoy te he borrado
De mi paciencia
Hoy fui capaz.
Desde aquel día
En que te fuiste
Yo no sabía
Que hacer de ti
Ya están domados
Mis sentimientos
Mejor así.
Hoy me he burlado
De la tristeza
Hoy me he librado
De tu recuerdo
Ya no te extraño
Ya me he arrancado
Ya estoy en paz.
Ya estoy curado
Anestesiado
Ya me he olvidado.
Ya estoy curado
Anestesiado
Ya me he olvidado.
Te espero siempre mi amor
Cada hora, cada día
Te espero siempre mi amor
Cada minuto que yo viva... Te espero siempre mi amor...
Te quiero... Siempre
Mi amor...
Sé que un día... volverás...
No me olvido y te quiero...T.E.S.M.A...T.E.S.M.A...

She held the world upon a string
But she didn't ever hold me
Spun the stars on her fingernails
But it never made her happy
Cause she couldn't ever have me
She said she won the world at a carnival
But she could never win me
Cause she couldn't ever catch me
I, I know why
Because when I look in her eyes
I just see the sky
When I look in her eyes
Well I, just see the sky
I don't love you I'm just passing the time
You could love me if I knew how to lie
But who could love me?
I am out of my mind
Throw an old line out to sea
To see if I can catch a dream
The sun was always in her eyes
She didn't even see me
But that girl had so much love
She'd wanna kiss you all the time
Yeah, she'd wanna kiss you all the time
She said she won the world at a carnival
But I'm sure it didn't ruin her
Just made her more interesting
I'm sure it didn't ruin her
Just made her more interesting
I, I know why
Because when I look in her eyes
I just see the sky
When I look in her eyes
Well I, I just see the sky
I don't love you I'm just passing the time
You could love me if I knew how to lie
But who could love me?
I am out of my mind
Throw an old line out to sea
To see if I can catch a dream
Four score years, living down in this rainswept town
Sea salt tears, swimming 'round as the rain comes down
Mr. Postman, do you have a letter for me?
Mr. Postman, do you have a letter for me, a letter for me?
From my own true love lost at sea, lost at sea
Mr. Postman, do you have a letter for me?
Mr. Postman, do you have a letter for me, a letter for me?
From my own true love lost at sea, lost at sea
Additional verses from demo version
Hands hang low creasing the fabric of my wedding dress
Does he lie below snagged in the fingers of a seaweed tress?
Mr. Postman, do you have a letter for me?
Mr. Postman, do you have a letter for me, a letter for me?
From my own true love lost at sea, lost at sea
He and I had something beautiful
But so dysfunctional, it couldn't last
I loved him so but I let him go
'Cause I knew he'd never love me back
Such pain as this
Shouldn't have to be experienced
I'm still reeling from the loss
Still a little bit delirious
Near to you, I am healing
But it's taking so long
'Cause though he's gone
And you are wonderful
It's hard to move on
Yet, I'm better near to you
You and I have something different
And I'm enjoying it cautiously
I'm battle scarred
But I am working, oh, so hard
To get back to who I used to be
He's disappearing, fading steadily
Well, I'm so close to being yours
Won't you stay with me, please
'Cause near to you, I am healing
But it's taking so long
'Cause though he's gone
And you are wonderful
It's hard to move on
Yet, I'm better near to you
Yet, I'm better near to you
I only know that
I am better where you are
I only know that
I am better where you are
I only know that I belong
Where you are
Near to you, I am healing
But it's taking so long
Though he's gone
And you are wonderful
It's hard to move on
Near to you, I am healing
But it's taking so long
'Cause though he's gone
And you are wonderful
It's hard to move on
Yet, I'm better near to you
Yet, I'm better near to you
Well, it's all in your mind 
It's all in your mind 
And it's all in your mind 
It's all in your mind
And I wanted to be 
I wanted to be 
Wanted to be 
Your good friend
Well I cannot believe
You got a devil up your sleeve
And he's talking to me
And I cannot believe
And I wanted to be
And I wanted to be
I wanted to be
Your good friend
Well you're all scared and stiff
A sick stolen gift
And the people you're with
They're all scared and stiff
And I wanted to be 
I wanted to be 
Wanted to be 
Your good friend
When our mouths are filled with uninvited tongues of others
And the strays are pining for their unrequited mothers
Milk that sours is promptly spat
Light will fill our eyes like cats
And they shall enter from the back
With spears and scepters and squirming sacks
Scribes and tangles between their ears
Faceless scrumbled charcoal smears
Through the coppice and the chaparral
The thickets thick with mold
The bracken and the brier
Catchweed into the fold
When our mouths are filled with uninvited tongues of others
And the strays are pining for their unrequited mothers
Milk that sours is promptly spat
The light will fill our eyes like cats
Cataracts
I wanna be a bottle blonde
I don't know why but I feel conned
I wanna be an idle teen
I wish I hadn't been so clean
I wanna stay inside all day
I want the world to go away
I want blood, guts, and chocolate cake
I wanna be a real fake
Yeah, I wish I'd been, I wish I'd been, a teen, teen idle
Wish I'd been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super, super! Suicidal
The wasted years
The wasted youth
The pretty lies
The ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find, I've come alive
I wanna be a virgin pure
A 21st century whore
I want back my virginity
So I can feel infinity
I wanna drink until I ache
I wanna make a big mistake
I want blood, guts, and angel cake
I'm gonna puke it anyway
Yeah, I wish I'd been, I wish I'd been, a teen, teen idle
Wish I'd been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super, super! Suicidal
The wasted years
The wasted youth
The pretty lies
The ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find, I've come alive
Come alive, I've come alive
Oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh
I wish I wasn't such a narcissist
I wish I didn't really kiss
The mirror when I'm on my own
Oh God, I'm gonna die alone
Adolescence didn't make sense
A little loss of innocence
The ugliness of being a fool
Ain't youth meant to be beautiful?
Yeah, I wish I'd been, I wish I'd been, a teen, teen idle
Wish I'd been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super, super! Suicidal
The wasted years
The wasted youth
The pretty lies
The ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find, I've come alive
Only to find, I've come alive
Only to find, I've come alive
Oh, alive
(Feeling super, super, super!)
(Feeling super, super, super!)
(Feeling super, super, super!)
Oh, alive
Never knew love like this
The wind, moon, the earth, the sky
(Sky so high)
Never knew pain like this
Everything die
(Then die)
Never knew love like this
The sun, the sea and I
(You and I)
Never knew pain, never knew shame
Now I know why
Bury me, marry me to the sky
Bury me, marry me to the sky
Bury me, marry me to the sky
Bury me, marry me to the sky
Feels like time is on my time
Bury me upside down
Cherokee, Kissimmee
When I'm, I'm going down
Feels like time is on my time
Bury me upside down
Cherokee, Kissimmee
When I'm, I'm going down
Never knew love like this
The wind, moon, the earth, the sky
(Sky so high)
Never knew pain like this
Everything die
(Then die)
Never knew love like this
The sun, the sea and I
(You and I)
Never knew pain, never knew shame
Now I know why
Bury me, marry me to the sky
Bury me, marry me to the sky
Bury me, marry me to the sky
Bury me, marry me to the sky
Feels like time is on my time
Bury me upside down
Cherokee, Kissimmee
When I'm, I'm going down
Feels like time is on my time
Bury me upside down
Cherokee, Kissimmee
When I'm, I'm going down
(Cherokee, Kissimmee
When I'm, I'm going down)
When the sun is high
In the afternoon sky
You can always find something to do
But from dusk till dawn
As the clock ticks on
Something happens to you
In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never even think of counting sheep
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all
As I walk on
Through this wicked world
Searching for light in the darkness of insanity
I ask myself
Is all hope lost
Is there only pain and hatred and misery
And each time I feel like this inside
There's one thing I wanna know
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
As I walk on
Through troubled times
My spirit gets so down-hearted sometimes
So where are the strong
And who are the trusted
And where is the harmony, sweet harmony
'Cause each time I feel it slipping away
Just makes me wanna cry
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
So where are the strong
And who are the trusted
And where is the harmony, sweet harmony
'Cause each time I feel it slipping away
Just makes me wanna cry
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
People have the right to fly
And will when it gets compromised
Their hearts say 'move along'
Their minds say 'gotcha heart'
'Let's move it along'
And airports see it all the time
Where someone's last goodbye
Blends in with someone's sigh
Cause someone's coming home
In hand a single rose
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And I won't be the last
No I won't be the last
To love her
You can't build a house of leaves
And live like it's an evergreen
It's just a season thing
It's just this thing the seasons do
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And you won't be the first
No you won't be the first
To love me
You can find me
If you ever want again
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around 
And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
You just might find if you give it time you will wave hello again
You just might wave hello again
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
You can't love too much one part of it
You can't love too much one part of it
I believe that my life's gonna see
The love I give returned to me
Oh, oh, how you're my hero
Oh, oh, how you're never here though
Remember times when you put me on your shoulders
How I wish that it was forever you would hold us
Oh, oh, right now I'm too young to know
How in the future it will affect me when you go
Oh, oh, you could've had it all
You, me and mum, y'now, anything was possible
I won't be the lonely one, sitting on my own and sad
A fifty year old, reminiscing what I had
I won't be the lonely one, sitting on my own and sad
Forget your dad, he's gone
Forget your dad, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
All I wanted was a kick-a-bout in the park
For you to race me home when it was nearly getting dark
How I could've been yours and you be mine
It could've been me and you until the end of time
Oh, do what you want when you want
Be as fucking insincere as you can
What kind of way is that to treat your wife?
To see your son on Saturdays, what way is that to live your life?
I won't be the lonely one, sitting on my own and sad
A fifty year old, reminiscing what I had
I won't be the lonely one, sitting on my own and sad
Forget your dad, he's gone
Forget your dad, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
I won't be the lonely one, sitting on my own and sad
A fifty year old, reminiscing what I had
I won't be the lonely one, sitting on my own and sad
Forget your dad, he's gone
Forget your dad, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
Oh, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
Weep not for roads untravelled
Weep not for paths left alone
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known
Give up your heart left broken and let that mistake pass on
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
And in time you'll be glad it's gone
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end, and if you need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me
Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk
And I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, relief, believe
And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen
'Cause I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, relief, believe
Relief, believe
It's too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful...
I've seen it all, I have seen the trees
I've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
I've seen a man killed by his best friend
And lives that were over before they were spent
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all, there is no more to see!
 
You haven't seen elephants, kings or Peru!
I'm happy to say I had better to do
What about China? Have you seen the Great Wall?
All walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!
 
And the man you will marry? The home you will share?
To be honest, I really don't care
 
You've never been to Niagara Falls?
I have seen water, it's water, that's all...
The Eiffel Tower, the Empire State?
My pulse was as high on my very first date!
Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
To be honest, I really don't care...
I've seen it all, I've seen the dark
I've seen the brightness in one little spark
I have seen what I choose and I've seen what I need
And that is enough, to want more would be greed
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all, there is no more to see!
You've seen it all and all you have seen
You can always review on your own little screen
The light and the dark, the big and the small
Just keep in mind you need no more at all
You've seen what you were and you know what you'll be
You've seen it all, there is no more to see!
Love ridden, I've looked at you
With the focus I gave to my birthday candles
I've wished on the lidded blue flames
Under your brow
And baby, I wished for you
Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed
And I wanna crawl in with you
But I cry instead
I want your warm, but it will only make
Me colder when it's over
So I can't tonight, baby
No, not "baby" anymore - if I need you
I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while, we'll only have to wave
My hand won't hold you down no more
The path is clear to follow through
I stood too long in the way to the door
And now I'm giving up on you
No, not "baby" anymore - if I need you
I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while, we'll only have to wave
No, not "baby" anymore - if I need you
I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
And in a little while, we'll only have to wave
I picture you in the sun wondering what went wrong
And falling down on your knees asking for sympathy
And being caught in between all you wish for and all you seen
And trying to find anything you can feel that you can believe in
May God's love be with you
Always
May God's love be with you
I know I would apologize if I could see your eyes
'Cause when you showed me myself I became someone else
But I was caught in between all you wish for and all you need
I picture you fast asleep
A nightmare comes
You can't keep awake
May God's love be with you
Always
May God's love be with you
'Cause if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
If I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
You
I don't know anymore
What it's for
I'm not even sure
If there is anyone who is in the sun
Will you help me to understand
'Cause I been caught in between all I wish for and all I need
Maybe you're not even sure what it's for
Any more than me
May God's love be with you
Always
May God's love be with you
Putting all the vegetables away,
That you bought at the grocery store today,
And it goes fast,
You think of the past,
Suddenly everything has changed,
Driving home the sky accelerates,
And the clouds all form a geometric shape,
And it goes fast,
You think of the past,
Suddenly everything has changed,
Putting all the clothes you washed away,
As you're folding up the shirts you hesitate,
Then it goes fast,
Think of the past,
Suddenly everything has changed
I live in America with a pair of Payless shoes
The Upper Peninsula and the television news
And I've seen my wife at the K-Mart
In strange ideas, we live apart
I live in a trailer home with a snowmobile, my car
The window is broken out and the interstate is far
And I drove all night to find my child
In strange ideas, he's been reviled
In strange ideas, in stranger times
I've no idea what's right sometimes
I lost my mind, I lost my life
I lost my job, I lost my wife
My name is Leslie Anne Levine
My mother birthed me down a dry ravine
My mother birthed me far too soon
Born at nine and dead at noon
Fifteen years gone now, I still wander this parapet
And shake my rattled bone
Fifteen years gone now, I still cling to the petticoat
Of the girl who died with me
On the roof above the streets
The only love I've known is a chimney sweep
Lost him lodged inside a flue
Back in 1842
Fifteen years gone now, I still wail from these catacombs
And curse my mother's name
Fifteen years gone now, still a wastrel mésallied
Has brought this fate on me
My name is Leslie Anne Levine
I've got no one left to mourn for me
My body lies inside its grave
In a ditch not far away
Fifteen years gone, I still wander this parapet
And shake my rattled bone
Fifteen years gone now, I still cling to the petticoat
Of the girl who died with me
Who died with me
Who died with me
Who died with me
It's a call
I fell into your arms that night
Don't ask
It's the time we had apart to sort things out
Just don't ask
It's the work you saying you're doing
But baby, I don't even ask
It's the love that came undone between us
And nobody ever asks
There's a place and time for everything I know
Don't ask
But when I'm around you still I lose control
Just don't ask
You suggest the struggle goes both ways
But baby, I don't even ask
I just wish you had a little faith
But I'm learning not to ask
Yearning for more than a blue day 
I enter your new life for me 
Burning for the true day 
I welcome your new life for me 
Forgive me, Let live me 
Set my spirit free 
Forgive me, Let live me 
Set my spirit free 
Losing, it comes in a cold wave 
Of guilt and shame all over me 
Child has arrived in the darkness 
The hollow triumph of a tree 
Forgive me, Let live me 
Kiss my falling knee 
Forgive me, Let live me 
Bless my destiny 
Forgive me, Let live me 
Set my spirit free 
Weakness sown, Overgrown 
Man is the baby
How much would you bet
That if I tried hard enough
I would spontaneously combust?
I wish I could disappear
And run away from all of my fears.
I think I'm coming undone.
So stay the night.
I promise that I won't bite.
'Cause without you there,
I don't think I can close my eyes.
How did I end up this way?
A constant knot in my gut,
Tied with uncertainty and with lust.
A classic case, I suppose,
A haunted man who can't outrun his ghosts.
They're in my skin and my bones.
So stay the night.
I promise that I won't bite.
'Cause without you there,
I don't think I can close my eyes.
And now I sing.
Yeah, yeah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
So I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruined
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard me, dear
It's all downhill from here
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nose dive in the flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (you showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard me, dear
It's all downhill from here
Remember life
Remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality
Pull the ripchord, the ship has lost it's sail
Your mama's got a new man, your daddy always fails
And you're eatin' again at them 
'Cause nobody loves you
And even fancy things have finally lost their charm
Wine and diamond rings that never get you any more
You're sleeping again, alone 
'Cause nobody loves you
And ooh...
They should have seen you
Should have known you
Should have known what it was like to be you
So come on kid, look at what you did
I don't know if you meant it, but you did yourself in
And I was even having a good day when I'd found out we'd lost you
So ahh, ohh, ahh...
And ooh...
She said it was in the singing and the strumming
Or maybe I even saw it coming
Tell me everything that happened
Tell me everything you saw
They had lights inside their eyes
They had lights inside their eyes
Did you see the closing window?
Did you hear the slamming door?
They moved forward, and my heart died
They moved forward, and my heart died
Please, please tell me what they looked like
Did they seem afraid of you?
They were kids that I once knew
They were kids that I once knew
I could say it, but you won't believe me
You say you do, but you don't deceive me
It's hard to know they're out there
It's hard to know that you still care
I could say it, but you won't believe me
You say you do, but you don't deceive me
Dead hearts are everywhere
Dead hearts are everywhere
Did you touch them? Did you hold them?
Did they follow you to town?
They make me feel I'm falling down
They make me feel I'm falling down
Was there one you saw too clearly?
Did they seem too real to you?
They were kids that I once knew
They were kids that I once knew
I could say it, but you won't believe me
You say you do, but you don't deceive me
It's hard to know they're out there
It's hard to know that you still care
I could say it, but you won't believe me
You say you do, but you don't deceive me
Dead hearts are everywhere
Dead hearts are everywhere
I could say it, but you won't believe me
You say you do, but you don't deceive me
It's hard to know they're out there
It's hard to know that you still care
I could say it, but you won't believe me
You say you do, but you don't deceive me
Dead hearts are everywhere
Dead hearts are everywhere
They were kids that I once knew
They were kids that I once knew
Now they're all dead hearts to you
Now they're all dead hearts to you
They were kids that I once knew
They were kids that I once knew
Now they're all dead hearts to you
I think it's time, we give it up
And figure out what's stopping us
From breathing easy, and talking straight
The way is clear if you're ready now
The volunteer is slowing down
And taking time to save himself
The little cracks they escalated
And before we knew it was too late
For making circles and telling lies
You're moving too fast for me
And I can't keep up with you
Maybe if you'd slow down for me
I could see you're only telling
Lies, lies, lies
Breaking us down with your
Lies, lies, lies
When will you learn
The little cracks they escalated
And before you know it is too late
For making circles and telling lies
You're moving too fast for me
And I can't keep up with you
Maybe if you'd slow down for me
I could see you're only telling
Lies, lies, lies
Breaking us down with your
Lies, lies, lies
When will you learn
So plant the thought and watch it grow
Wind it up and let it go
I'm just tired of counting bodies
Is this mausoleum tardy?
Let's just paint you a pretty face
Flies dip tongues into tear ducts
In toothpicks fought unborn
Contusion is hungry
They still eat their young
Proto-culture null and void
All veins in highway laps
This breath collapsed again
This hex was delivered spent
Orchestra influenza
Drawn and quartered pets
It dwells and grows and grunts
This is the pocket sized edition
Rabid sleep through benediction
Let's just paint you a pretty face
Museums mark their bodies down
All the tenants found
All the distance in their prefix
Contusion is hungry
They still eat their young
Proto-culture null and void
All veins in highway laps
This breath collapsed again
This hex was delivered spent
Orchestra influenza
Drawn and quartered pets
It dwells and grows and grunts
Fever bliss into central nervousness
Bitten on the entrance
I was bitten on the entrance
Fever bliss into central nervousness
Bitten on the entrance
I was bitten on the entrance
Bitten on the entrance
I was bitten on the entrance
Bitten on the entrance
Bitten
So, it's sad this doesn't suit you now
And me fresh out of rope
Please ignore the lisp
I never meant to sound like this
So take me and break me
And make me strong like you
I'll be forever grateful to
This and you
It's only you, beautiful
Or I don't want anyone
If I can choose
It's only you
Fix me to a chain around your neck
And wear me like a nickel
Even new wine, served in old skins
Cheapens the taste
I shot the pilot
I'm begging you to fly this for me
I'm here for you to use; broken and bruised
Do you understand?
It's only you, beautiful
Or I don't want anyone
If I can choose
It's only you
But how could I miscalculate?
Perfect eyes will have perfect aim
If I could choose
It's only you
We're wrecking
And I'm dry like a drum
When you scream
So fine, I'll leave
We're spending
Take our time in trials
Measured in miles
We slave for days and weeks
It's only you, beautiful
Or I don't want anyone
If I can choose
It's only you
But how could I miscalculate?
Perfect lies from a perfect dame
If I can choose
It's only you
Clinging to me
Like a last breath you would breathe
You were like home to me
I don't recognize this street
Please don't close your eyes
Don't know where to look without them
Outside the cars speed by
I've never heard them until now
I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
You were just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
And I know you care
I used to run down the stairs
To the door and I thought you were there
To shape to the comfort of us
Two lovers locked out of love
Oh, but I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
You were just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
I know it wasn't always wrong
But I've never known a winter so cold
Now I don't warm my hands in your coat
But I still hope
'Cause this is how things ought to have been
And I know the worst of it
Wasn't all that it seemed
Why can't I dream, why can't I dream?
'Cause I know you care
And I know you care
I know you care, I know you care
I know it's always been there
I swear that you don't have to go
I thought we could wait for the fireworks
And I thought we could wait for the snow
To wash over Georgia and kill the hurt
I thought I could live in your arms
(I thought I could live in your arms)
And spend every moment I had with you
(And spend every moment I had with you)
Stay up all night with the stars
(Stay up all night with the stars)
Confess all the faith that I had in you
(I had in you)
Too late, I'm sure and lonely
(Another night, another dream wasted on you)
Just be here now against me
(Against me)
You know the words so sing along for me baby
(You know the words so sing along for me baby)
For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
But you won't stop crying
(But you won't stop crying)
This anniversary may never be the same
(This anniversary may never be the same)
Inside I hope you know I'm dying 
With my heart beside me
(With my heart beside me)
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
(In shattered pieces that may never be replaced)
And if I died right now you'd never be the same
(And if I died right now you'd never be the same)
I thought with a month of apart
(I thought with a month of apart)
Together would find us an opening 
(Together would find us an opening)
And moonlight would provide the spark
(And moonlight would provide the spark)
And that I would stumble across the key
(And that I would stumble across the key)
Or break down the door to your heart
Forever could see us not you and me
(Forever could see us not you and me)
And you'd help me out of the dark
(And you'd help me out of the dark)
I'd give my heart as an offering
(An offering)
Too late, I'm sure and lonely
(Another night, another dream wasted on you)
Just be here now against me
(Against me)
You know the words so sing along for me baby
(You know the words so sing along for me baby)
For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
But you won't stop crying
(But you won't stop crying)
This anniversary may never be the same
(This anniversary may never be the same)
Inside I hope you know I'm dying 
With my heart beside me
(With my heart beside me)
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
(In shattered pieces that may never be replaced)
And if I died right now you'd never be the same
(And if I died right now you'd never be the same)
And I will always remember you
As you are right now to me
And I will always remember you now
Remember you now
So sleep alone tonight
With no one here just by your side
Sleep alone tonight
How does he feel
How does he kiss
(Sleep alone tonight)
How does he taste while he's on your lips
(With no one here just by your side)
How does he feel 
How does he kiss
(Sleep alone tonight)
How does he feel
How does he kiss
(Sleep alone tonight)
How does he taste while he's on your lips
(With no one here just by your side)
How does he feel 
How does he kiss
(Sleep alone tonight)
How does he feel
How does he kiss
(Sleep alone tonight)
How does he taste while he's on your lips
(With no one here just by your side)
How does he feel 
How does he kiss
(Sleep alone tonight)
Woah-oh
And I can't forget you
(And sleep alone tonight)
I know you want me to want you, I want to
(With no one here just by your side)
I can't forgive you
(Sleep alone tonight)
So when this is over, don't blow your composure baby
I can't forgive you
(And sleep alone tonight)
And I know you want me to want you, I want to
(With no one here just by your side)
But I can't forget you
(Sleep alone tonight)
So when this is over, don't blow your composure baby
I can't forget you
(I can't forget you)
I know you want me to want you, I want to
(I know you want me to want you, I want to)
How to fight loneliness
Smile all the time
Shine your teeth to meaningless
And sharpen them with lies
And whatever's going down
Will follow you around
That's how you fight loneliness
You laugh at every joke
Drag your blanket blindly
Fill your heart with smoke
And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you'll ever need
That's how you fight it
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Two to one
Static to the sound of you and I
Undone for the last time
And there this was
Hiding at the bottom of your
Swimming pool some September
And don't you think
I wish that I could stay
Your lips give you away
I can hear it, a jet engine
Through the center of the storm
And I'm thinking I'd
Prefer not to be rescued
Two to none
Roads that lead away from this
I'm following myself just this once
And I got spun
It appears you're spun as well
It happens when you pay attention
This could take all year, but
When it's quiet, does she hear me?
A jet is sent to the
Center of the storm
And I'm thinking I'd
Prefer not to be rescued
And oh-oh, I can feel her, she's dying
Just to keep me cool
I'm finally numb, so please
Don't get me rescued... rescued...
And it's unclear
But this may be my last song
Oh-Oh, I, I can tell
She's raising hell to give to me
But she got me warm
So please don't get me rescued
And oh-oh, say you'll miss me (say you'll miss me) one last time
I'll be strong, but whatever you do
Please don't get me rescued...
'Cause I'm feeling like
I might need to be near you
And I feel all right, so please
Don't get me rescued...
With the door closed, shades drawn
The world shrinks
Let's open up those blinds
But someone has to sweep the floor
Pick up her dirty clothes
That job's not mine
Now that everyone's an enemy
My heart sinks
Let's put away those claws
I don't blame them for their curtain-call
'Cause I pulled the rope
I wanna call them back out for applause
Spring and Thompson on the first of May
Is horrible
We hid in catacombs
So now I'm sleeping next to mousetraps
In a bed of all our clothes
While I hope that she won't come home
And it was easier to lock the door
And kill the phones
Than to show my skin
Because the hardest thing is never
To repent for someone else
It's letting people in
Well, you can come inside, unlock the door
Take off your shoes
But this might take all night
To explain to you I would have walked
Out those sliding doors
But the timing never seemed right
When your helicopter came and tried
To lift me out
I put its rope around my neck
And after that you didn't bother
With the airlift or the rescue
You knew just what to expect
That with the door closed, shades drawn
We're dead enough
We don't open from outside
And someone has to speak
With their teeth behind their tongue
To never let that right be denied
We can't rely on photographs
And visitation time
But I just don't know where to begin
I wanna bust down the door
If you're willing to forgive
I've got the keys, I'm letting people in
Don't be scared to speak
Don't speak with someone's tooth
Don't bargain when you're weak
Don't take that sharp abuse
Some patients can't be saved
But that burden's not on you
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
How can I forget your tender smile
Moments that I have shared with you
Our hearts may break
But they're on their way
And there's nothing I can do
So do what you're gotta do
And don't misunderstand me
You know you don't ever have to worry 'bout me
I'd do it again
I can understand that it can't be
Guess it's hard as you were meant for me
But I can't hide my own despair
I guess I never will
So do what you're gotta do
And don't misunderstand me
You know you don't ever have to worry 'bout me
I'd do it again
So tired of life
No fairytale
So hold your fire
'Cause I need you
Just do what you're gotta do
And don't misunderstand me
You know you don't ever have to worry 'bout me
I'd do it again
Do what you're gotta do
And don't misunderstand me
You keep going over every word that we've said
But you don't have to worry
About me
Well death may come invisible
Or in a holy wall of fire
In the breath between the markers
On a black I-80 mile
From the madness of the governments
To the vengeance of the sea
Well everything is eclipsed
By the shape of destiny
So love me now, hell is coming
Yeah kiss my mouth, hell is here
Little soldier, little insect
You know war it has no heart
It will kill you in the sunshine
Or happily in the the dark
Where kindness is a card game
Or a bent up cigarette
In the trenches, in the hard rain
With a bullet and a bet
He says help me out, hell is coming
Could you do it now? Hell is here
See the sterile soil, poison sky
Yellow water, final scraps of light
Bringin' new tears 
Well wake, baby, wake
But leave that blanket around you 
There's nowhere else safe
I'm leaving this place
But there's nothing I'm planning to take
Just you, just you
It makes me lonely,
It makes me very lonely
When I see you here waitin' on
He makes me tired, he makes me very tired
And inside of me, lingers on
But you have your heart
Don't believe it, and you will find it
Waitin' on
Everything I said, oh, well I meant it
And inside my head, holdin' on
'Cause if I died tonight
Would you hold my hand, no
Would you understand
And if I lived in spite
Would you still be here, no
Would you disappear
Surely must be you
But I don't make you lonely
I'll get over you
But I don't make you lonely
And so tomorrow there will be another number
For the one who had a name
Desert wind and a perverse desire to win
History buried in shame
All the beating drums
Celebration guns
The thunder and the laughter
The last thing they remember
All the beating drums
Celebration guns
The thunder and the laughter
The last thing they remember
And then the next day, how will you know your enemy?
By their color or your fear?
One by one you can cage them in your freedom
Make them all disappear
Six hundred sixty-six hundred sixty days
Two guards for one uncharged
This morning's paper's ink stains my fingers
My hands grow darker everyday
All the beating drums
Celebration guns
The thunder and the laughter
The last thing they remember
All the beating drums
Celebration guns
The thunder and the laughter
The last thing they remember
All the beating drums
Celebration guns
The thunder and the laughter
The last thing they remember
All the beating drums
Celebration guns
The thunder and the laughter
The last thing they remember
Goodnight, sleep light, stranger
Goodnight, sleep light, stranger
Goodnight, sleep light, stranger
I'll fake it through the day with some help from Johnny Walker Red
Send the poisoned rain down the drain to put bad thoughts in my head
With two tickets torn in half and a lot of nothin' to do
Do you miss me, Miss Misery, like you say you do?
A man in the park read the lines in my hand
Told me I'm strong, hardly ever wrong. I said, "Man, you mean..."
You had plans for both of us that involved a trip out of town
To a place I've seen in a magazine that you left lyin' around
I don't have you with me but I keep a good attitude
Do you miss me, Miss Misery, like you say you do?
I know you'd rather see me gone than to see me the way that I am
When I am in the life anyway
Next door TV's flashing blue frames on the wall
It's a comedy of errors, you see. It's about taking a fall
To vanish into oblivion, it's easy to do
And I try to be, but you know me, I come back when you want me to
Do you miss me, Miss Misery, like you say you do?
I'm sick and tired of the way that I feel
I'm always dreaming and it's never for real
I'm all alone with my deep thoughts
I'm all alone with my heartache and my good intentions
I work to eat and drink and sleep just to live
Feels like I'm never getting back what I give
I've got a sad song in my sweet heart
And all I really ever need is some love and attention
And I don't want to cry my whole life through
I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and laugh with me
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah, I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me
Sometimes you've just got to make it for yourself
Sometimes sugar, it just takes someone else
Sometimes you've just got to make it for yourself
Sometimes baby, you just need someone else
And I don't want to cry my whole life through
I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and laugh with me
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah, I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me
Sometimes you've just got to make it for yourself
Sometimes honey, it just takes someone else
Sometimes you've just got to make it for yourself
Sometimes darling, you just need someone else
But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Yeah, I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and laugh with me
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah, I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me
But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Yeah, I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and laugh with me
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah, I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me
But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Yeah, I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and laugh with me
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah, I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me
But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Yeah, I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and laugh with me
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah, I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me
It's so hard to say that I'm sorry
I'll make everything all right
All these things that I've done
Now what have I become
And where'd I go wrong
I don't mean to hurt
Just to put you first
I won't tell you lies
I will stand accused
With my hand on my heart
I'm just trying to say...
I'm sorry
It's all that I can say
You mean so much
And I'd fix all that I've done
If I could start again
I'd throw it all away
To the shadows of regrets
And you would have the best of me
I know that I can't take back all of the mistakes
But I will try
Although it's not easy, I know you believe me
'Cause I would not lie
Don't believe their lies
Told through jealous eyes
They don't understand
I won't break your heart
I won't bring you down
But I will have to say
I'm sorry
It's all that I can say
You mean so much
And I'd fix all that I've done
If I could start again
I'd throw it all away
To the shadows of regrets
And you would have the best of me
I'm sorry
It's all that I can say
You mean so much
And I'd fix all that I've done
If I could start again
I'd throw it all away
To the shadows of regrets
And you would have the best of me
Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again
And fade out
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again
And fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again
And fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love
Hit her with a hammer 
Teeth smashed in 
Red tongues twitching 
Look inside a skeleton 
My fingers sting 
Where I feel your fingers have been 
Ghostly fingers 
Moving my limbs 
Oh God I miss you 
Daddy's in the corner 
Rattling his keys 
Mummy's in the doorway 
Trying to leave 
Nobody's listening 
Oh God I miss you
Good times for a change
See, the luck I've had
Can make a good man turn bad
So please, please, please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me get what I want
This time
Haven't had a dream in a long time
See, the life I've had
Can make a good man bad
So for once in my life
Let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time
I'm a junkyard full of false starts
And I don't need your permission
To bury my love under this bare light bulb
The moon is a sickle cell
It'll kill you in time
Your cold, white brother riding your blood
Like spun glass in sore eyes
While the moon does its division you're buried below
And you're coming up roses
Everywhere you go red roses follow
The things that you tell yourself
They'll kill you in time
Your cold white brother alive in your blood
Spinnin' in the night sky
While the moon does its division you're buried below
And you're coming up roses
Everywhere you go red roses
So you got in a kind of trouble that nobody knows
It's coming up roses
Everywhere you go red roses
Pass me that lovely little gun
My dear, my darling one
The cleaners are coming, one by one
You don't even want to let them start
They are knocking now upon your door
They measure the room, they know the score
They're mopping up the butcher's floor
Of your broken little hearts
O children
Forgive us now for what we've done
It started out as a bit of fun
Here, take these before we run away
The keys to the gulag
O children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice
Here comes Frank and poor old Jim
They're gathering round with all my friends
We're older now, the light is dim
And you are only just beginning
O children
We have the answer to all your fears
It's short, it's simple, it's crystal clear
It's round about, it's somewhere here
Lost amongst our winnings
O children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice
The cleaners have done their job on you
They're hip to it, man, they're in the groove
They've hosed you down, you're good as new
They're lining up to inspect you
O children
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost
He's found the answer that was lost
We're all weeping now, weeping because
There ain't nothing we can do to protect you
O children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice
Hey little train! We are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station
Hey, little train! Wait for me!
I once was blind but now I see
Have you left a seat for me?
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?
Hey little train! Wait for me!
I was held in chains but now I'm free
I'm hanging in there, don't you see
In this process of elimination
Hey little train! We are all jumping on 
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
It's beyond my wildest expectation
Hey little train! We are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station
There's a corner of your heart for me.
There's a corner of your heart just for me.
I will pack my bags just to stay in the corner of your heart.
Just to stay in the corner of your heart.
There is room beneath your bed for me.
There is room beneath your bed just for me.
I will leave this town just to sleep underneath your bed.
Just to sleep underneath your bed.
There's one minute of your day.
There's one minute of your day.
I will leave this man just to occupy one minute of your day.
Just to occupy one minute of your day.
Just to sleep underneath your bed.
Just to stay in the corner of you heart.
Tell me a story
Where we all change
And we'd live our lives together
And not estranged
I didn't lose my mind it was
Mine to give away
Couldn't stay to watch me cry
You didn't have the time
So I softly slip away...
No regrets they don't work
No regrets they only hurt
Sing me a love song
Drop me a line
Suppose it's just a point of view
But they tell me I'm doing fine
I know from the outside
(Some people said)
We looked good for eachother
Felt things were going wrong
When you didn't like my mother
I don't want to hate
But that's all you've left me with
A bitter aftertaste and a fantasy
Of how we all could live
No regrets they don't work
No regrets now, they only hurt
(We've been told you stay up late)
I know they're still talking
(You're far too short to carry weight)
The demons in your head
(Return the videos they're late)
If I could just stop hating you
(Goodbye)
I'd feel sorry for us instead
Remember the photographs insane
The ones where we all laugh so lame
We were having the time of our lives
Well thank you, it was a real blast
No regrets, they don't work
No regrets, they only hurt
(We've been told you stay up late)
Write me a love song
(You're far too short to carry weight)
Drop me a line
(Return the videos they're late)
Suppose it's just a point of view
(Goodbye)
But they tell me I'm doing fine
Everything I wanted to be
Everytime I walked away
Everytime you told me to leave
I just wanted to stay
Everytime you looked at me
And every time you smiled
I felt so vacant you treat me like a child
I loved the way we used to laugh
I loved the way we used to smile
Often I sit down and think of you for a while
And then it passes me by
And I think of someone else instead
I guess the love we once had
Is officially
Dead
Old friends, old friends
Sat on their park bench like bookends
A newspaper blown through the grass
Falls on the round toes
Of the high shoes of the old friends
Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends
Can you imagine us years from today
Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange to be 70
Old friends, memory brushes the same years
Silently sharing the same fears
You'll discover that casual friends kept notes in their pockets to remember your name.
And all these places we went to see sights just gave them excuses into the game.
There's a look in the faces tonight that's untrustable as the hope that you'll never return in a while.
But you're always on time, so...
Sleeping soundly: the back of the car felt more like a home than I would have ever thought.
And through the evening the engine kept on until we hit Chicago and decided to stop.
These colors will not change, you change the way I see them
These words will fade when you explain why you hate them
We are the same, oh
She keeps repeating "I bet she needed"
She says she's right here, she seems so distant
Saying goodbye this time the same old story
Seeing you cry it makes feel like saying sorry
Just a few last hours we gotta make this count
We're counting backwards
(Just a few last hours, we gotta make this count)
We're falling forward
She keeps repeating "I bet she needed"
She says she's right here, she seems so distant
Saying goodbye this time, the same old story
Seeing you cry it makes me feel like saying sorry
Saying sorry, we've fallen apart
Wish we knew this from the start
Saying goodbyes the hardest part
Wish we knew this from the start
Saying goodbye this time, the same old story
Seeing you cry it makes me feel like saying sorry
If you're lost and feel alone, circumnavigate the globe
All you ever have to hope for too
And the way you seem to flow, circumnavigate in hope
And they seem to lose control with you
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Everyone of us is hurt and everyone of us is scarred
Everyone of us is scared, not you
Yeah, your eyes closed, your head hurts
Your eyes feel so low
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Everyone of us is scared, everyone of us is hurt
Everyone of us has hope for you, for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you
Killing a southern belle
Is all you know how to do
That and give other people hell
It's what they expect from you too
But I wouldn't have you how you are
I don't wanna walk around
I don't even wanna breathe
I live in a southern town
Where all you can do is grit your teeth
But I wouldn't have you how you are
How come you're not ashamed of what you are
And sorry that you're the one she got?
Ain't nobody looking now
Nobody nothing's said
No one's about to shout
Nobody's seeing red
But I wouldn't have you how you are
You're killing a southern belle
Killing a southern belle
Killing a southern belle
I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride
And I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain
If I wait for stormy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know
That I still love you so
Only heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain
Raindrops falling from heaven
Could never take away my misery
Since we're not together
I'll pray for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Some day when my crying's done
I'm going to wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll
Never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
Since we're not together
I'll pray for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Some day when my crying's done
I'm going to wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll
Never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
Ne me quitte pas
Il faut oublier
Tout peut s'oublier
Qui s'enfuit déjà
Oublier le temps
Des malentendus
Et le temps perdu
A savoir comment
Oublier ces heures
Qui tuaient parfois
A coups de pourquoi
Le cœur du bonheur
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Moi je t'offrirai
Des perles de pluie
Venues de pays
Où il ne pleut pas
Je creuserai la terre
Jusqu'apres ma mort
Pour couvrir ton corps
D'or et de lumière
Je ferai un domaine
Où l'amour sera roi
Où l'amour sera loi
Où tu seras reine
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Je t'inventerai
Des mots insensés
Que tu comprendras
Je te parlerai
De ces amants là
Qui ont vu deux fois
Leurs cœurs s'embraser
Je te racont'rai
L'histoire de ce roi
Mort de n'avoir pas
Pu te rencontrer
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
On a vu souvent
Rejaillir le feu
D'un ancien volcan
Qu'on croyait trop vieux
Il est paraît-il
Des terres brûlées
Donnant plus de blé
Qu'un meilleur avril
Et quand vient le soir
Pour qu'un ciel flamboie
Le rouge et le noir
Ne s'épousent-ils pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Je ne vais plus pleurer
Je ne vais plus parler
Je me cacherai là
A te regarder
Danser et sourire
Et à t'écouter
Chanter et puis rire
Laisse-moi devenir
L'ombre de ton ombre
L'ombre de ta main
L'ombre de ton chien
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Little bird
Have you got a key?
Unlock the lock
Inside of me
Where will you go
To keep yourself afloat?
Feeling old
Until the wing
Unfolded
Caught me a long wind
Where will we go
To keep ourselves afloat?
I caught a long wind
A long life wind
I got to know the sky
But it didn't know me
I got to see the land
And land on top of the sea
And be the bird and be the key
And the current tells
What the wave withheld
And the lightning sang
Of where the light would land
Where will you go 
To keep yourself afloat?
I caught a long wind
A long life wind
Like a swallow
A night owl
A little chickadee
Sad sparrow
Good morning bird
Good nightingale
I took a deep breath
And caught a long wind
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what you say but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say
That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you,
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
"Sorry" like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
It's too late to apologize, yeah,
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah
I'm holdin' on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
Some said the local lake had been enchanted,
Others said it must have been the weather.
The neighbors were trying to keep it quiet,
But I swear that I could hear the laughter.
So they jokingly nicknamed it the porridge,
'Cause overnight that lake had turned as thick as butter.
But the local kids would still go swimming,
Drinking, saying that to them it doesn't matter.
If you just hold in your breath,
'Til you come back up in full.
Hold in your breath,
'Til you thought it through,
You fool.
The genius next door was bussing tables,
Wiping clean the ketchup bottle labels.
Getting high and mumbling German fables.
Didn't care as long as he was able,
To strip his clothes off by the dumpsters,
At night while everyone was sleeping,
And wade midway into that porridge,
Just him and the secret he was keeping.
If you just hold in your breath,
'Til you come back up in full.
Hold in your breath,
'Til you thought it through,
You foolish child.
In the morning, the film crews start arriving,
With doughnuts, coffee, and reporters.
The kids were waking up hung over,
The neighbors were starting up their cars.
The garbage men were emptying the dumpsters,
Atheists were praying full of sarcasm,
And the genius next door was sleeping.
Dreaming that the antidote is orgasm.
If you just hold in your breath,
'Til you come back up in full.
Hold in your breath,
'Til you thought it through,
You foolish child.
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
She hangs her head and cries in my shirt.
She must be hurt very badly.
Tell me what's making you sadly?
Open your door - don't hide in the dark.
You're lost in the dark - you can trust me.
'Cause you know that's how it must be.
Lisa - Lisa, sad Lisa - Lisa.
Her eyes like windows trickelin' rain
Upon the pain getting deeper.
Though my love wants to relieve her.
She walks alone from wall to wall.
Lost in her hall, she can't hear me.
Though I know she likes to be near me.
Lisa - Lisa, sad Lisa - Lisa.
She sits in a corner by the door.
There must be more I can tell her.
If she really wants me to help her.
I'll do what I can to show her the way.
And maybe one day I will free her.
Though I know no one can see her.
Lisa - Lisa, sad Lisa - Lisa.
I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
Remember the good times that we had?
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one
I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard
But I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to lose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light
And I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
And I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
Weep not for the memories
I'm writing a song all about you
A true song as real as my tears
But you've no need to fear it
'Cause no one will hear it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
I'll tell all about how you cheated
I'd like for the whole world to hear
I'd like to get even
With you 'cause you're leavin'
But sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
I never thought that I could be so bold
To even say these thoughts aloud
I see you with your man, your eyes just shine
While he stands tall and walking proud
That look you give that guy
I wanna see looking right at me
If I could be that guy instead of me
I'd never let you down
It always seems like you're going somewhere
Better than you've been before
While I go to sleep and I dream all night
Of you knocking on my door
That look you give that guy
I wanna see looking right at me
If I could be that guy instead of me
I'd be all I can be
I'd be all I can be
I'm nothing like what I'd like to be
I'm nothing much I know it's true
I lack the style and the pedigree
And my chances are so few
That look you give that guy
I wanna see looking right at me
If I could be that guy instead of me
I'd give you all I got
I never thought that I could be so bold
To even say these thoughts aloud
But if, let's say, it won't work out
You know where I can be found
That look you give that guy
I wanna see looking right at me
If I could be that guy instead of me
I'd never let you down
I'd never let you down
Who am I to need you when I'm down
And where are you when I need you around
Your life is not your own
And all I ask you is for another chance
Another way around you
To live by circumstance
Once again
Who am I to need you now
To ask you why
To tell you no
To deserve your love and sympathy
You were never meant to belong to me
And you may go but I know you won't leave
Too many years built into memories
You're life is not your own
Who am I to need you now
To ask you why
To tell you no
To deserve your love and sympathy
You were never meant to belong to me
Who am I to leave
Along the way I lost my faith
And as you are you'll be again
To mold like clay, to break like dirt
To tear me up in your sympathy
You were never meant to belong to me
You were never meant to belong to me
You were never meant to belong to me
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?
When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore
Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love's so distant and obscure
Remains the cure
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself anymore
When I was young
I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore, oh, oh
All by myself
Don't wanna live
Oh, oh, oh
Don't wanna live by myself, by myself anymore, oh
By myself anymore
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, all by myself
Don't wanna live
I never, never, never needed anyone
Pop tart, what's our mission?
Do we know but never listen?
For too long they held me under
But I hear it's almost over
In Detroit, on a Memphis train
Like you said it's
Down in the heat and the summer rain of
The automatic gauze of your memories
Down in the sleep at the airplane races
Try to hold on
To this heart a little bit longer
Try to hold on
To this love aloud
Try to hold on
For this heart's a little bit colder
Try to hold on
To this love
Paperback scrawl your hidden poems
Written around the dried out flowers
Here we are still trading places
To try to hold on
Pop tart, can you envision
A free world of clear division?
For too long they held us under
But I know we're getting over
In Detroit with the Nashville tears
Like you said it's
Down in the heat with the broken numbers
Down in the gaze of solemnity
Down in the way you've held together
To try to hold on
To this heart a little bit closer
Try to hold on
To this love aloud
Try to hold on
For this heart's a little bit older
Try to hold on
To this love aloud
And we are still alive
Try to hold on
And we have survived
Try to hold on
And no one should deny
We tried to hold on
To the pulse of the feedback current
Into the flow of encrypted movement
Slapback kills the ancient remnants
That try to hold on
Try to hold on (try)
To this heart alive (try, try)
Try to hold on (try)
To this love aloud (try, try)
Try to hold on (try)
And we are still alive (try, try)
Try to hold on (try)
And we have survived (try, try)
Try to hold on
Pop tart, you never listen
Skinned knees
Try to hold on (try)
Stop start, what's our mission?
Skinned knees
Try to hold on (try)
"I can't wait forever" is all that you said
Before you stood up
And you won't disappoint me
I can do that myself
But I'm glad that you've come
Now if you don't mind
Leave, leave
And free yourself at the same time
Leave, leave
I don't understand, you've already gone
And I hope you feel better
Now that it's out
What took you so long?
And the truth has a habit
Of falling out of your mouth
But now that it's come
If you don't mind
Leave, leave
And please yourself at the same time
Leave, leave
Let go of my hand
You said what you came to now
Leave, leave
Let go of my hand
You said what you have to now
Leave, leave
Leave, leave
Let go of my hand
You said what you have to now
Leave, leave
I won't shiver in the cold
I won't let the shadows take their toll
I won't cover my head in the dark
And I won't forget you when we part
Collapse the light into earth
Collapse the light into earth
I won't heal given time
I won't try to change your mind
I won't feel better in the cold light of day
But I wouldn't stop you if you wanted to stay
Collapse the light into earth
Collapse the light into earth
Collapse the light into earth
Collapse the light into earth
Collapse the light into earth...
Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I'm going to ride this plane out of your life again.
I wish that I could stay but you argue.
But more than this I wish you could've seen my face
In backseat staring out the window.
I'll do anything for you,
Kill anyone for you.
So leave yourself intact
'Cause I will be coming back.
In a phrase to cut these lips,
I love you.
The morning will come
In the press of every kiss
With your head upon my chest
Where I will annoy you
With every waking breath
Until you decide to wake up.
I've earned through hope and faith
The curves around your face
That I'm the one you'll hold forever.
If morning never comes for either one of us,
Then this I pray to you wherever.
I'll do anything for you.
This story is for you.
('Cause I'd do anything you want me to... for you.)
I'll do anything for you,
Kill anyone for you.
So leave yourself intact
'Cause I won't be coming back.
In a phrase to cut these lips,
I loved you.
The morning will come
In the press of every kiss
With your head upon my chest
Where I will annoy you
With every waking breath
Until you decide to wake up.
The morning will come
In the press of every kiss
With your head upon my chest
Where I will annoy you
With every waking breath
'Til you decide to wake up.
I guess it's luck, but it's the same
Hard luck, you've been trying to tame
Maybe it's love, but it's like you said
"Love is like a role that we play."
But, I believe in you so much
I could die for the words that you say
But, I believe in you so much
I could die from the words that you say
But, you're chasin' the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing
Is getting away from you again
While you're chasin' ghosts
I guess it's luck, but it's the same
Hard luck, you've been trying to tame
Maybe it's love, but it's like you said
"Love is like a role that we play."
But, I believe in you so much
I could die for the words that you say
But, I believe in you so much
I could die from the words that you say
But, you're chasin' the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing
Is getting away from you again
While you're chasin' ghosts
Just bend the pieces till they fit
Like they were made for it
But, they weren't meant for this
No, they weren't meant for this
Just bend the pieces till they fit
Like they were made for it
But, they weren't meant for this
Chasin' the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing
Is getting away, away, away, away from you again
Chasin' the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing
Is getting away from you again
While you're chasin' ghosts
This circus is falling down on its knees,
The big top is crumbling down,
It's raining in Baltimore fifteen miles east,
Where you should be, no one's around.
I need a phone call,
I need a raincoat,
I need a big love,
I need a phone call.
These train conversations are passing me by,
And I don't have nothing to say,
You get what you pay for,
But I just had no intention of living this way.
I need a phone call,
I need a plane ride,
I need a sunburn,
I need a raincoat.
And I get no answers,
And I don't get no change,
It's raining in Baltimore, baby,
But everything else is the same.
There's things I remember, things I forget,
I miss you, I guess that I should,
Three thousand five hundred miles away,
But what would you change if you could?
I need a phone call,
Maybe I should buy a new car,
I can always hear a freight train,
Baby if I listen real hard,
And I wish, I wish it was a small world,
'Cause I'm lonely for the big towns,
I'd like to hear a little guitar,
I guess it's time to put the top down.
I need a phone call,
I need a raincoat,
I really need a raincoat,
I really, really need a raincoat,
I really, really, really need a raincoat,
I really need a raincoat.
What ghosts exist behind these attic walls? There's got to be a simpler explanation,
'Cause I scrimped and I saved just to find that they've been splicing my inventions.
Cold skin and bones and this latitude: we ain't payin' until the heat comes through.
So you slept in a stocking cap and wool scarf.
Promises of payments were upon your shoulders constantly,
But don't forget to entertain 'cause this is your first defense.
A four-year offense to the devoted type. I may have got an invitation but I wasn't invited.
But I thought that this meant something more than broken hearts and new addictions.
We'll leave our sins within the carpet twine.
Our bodies will dissolve the chemicals in due time.
Promises of payments were upon your shoulders constantly,
But don't forget to entertain 'cause this is your first defense, this is your first defense.
I'm two cups into my coffee break
I'm sitting alone in the café front way
Reading all by myself
I'm turning my cell off, just to breath
Cause everyone I know just keeps calling me
And I just need a little time
'Cause I've overcommitted myself
I guess this is growing up
I'm sleeping so little these days
I guess this is growing up
I'm feeling things are about to change
I'm guessing this is growing up
Yeah, I'm guessing this is growing up
And my mom hates my guts
She has every reason to
For all the things I do
And it breaks me just to know
That I have torn her apart so many times, so many times
'Cause I've overcommitted myself
I guess this is growing
I'm sleeping so little these days
I guess this is growing up
I'm feeling things are about to change
I'm guessing this is growing up
Yeah, I'm guessing this is growing up
I don't wanna change, I wanna stay right where I lay
Eyes closed, head down on the pillow
Better change, before it's too late
I'm guessing this is growing up
Now I'm done with my coffee break
I turn on my phone, now that I've grown up

Mammy's hero
B.F.P.O
Mammy's hero
Our little army boy
Is coming home from B.F.P.O
I've a bunch of purple flowers
To decorate a mammy's hero
Mourning in the aerodrome
The weather warmer he is colder
Four men in uniform
To carry home my little soldier
What could he do?
Should have been a rock star
But he didn't have the money for a guitar
What could he do?
Should have been a politician
But he never had a proper education
What could he do?
Should have been a father
But he never even made it to his twenties
What a waste
Army dreamers
Ooh what a waste of
Army dreamers
Tears o'er a tin box
Oh Jesus Christ he wasn't to know
Like a chicken with a fox
He couldn't win the war with ego
Give the kid the pick of pips
And give him all your stripes and ribbons
Now he's sitting in his hole
He might as well have buttons and bows
What could he do?
Should have been a rock star
But he didn't have the money for a guitar
What could he do?
Should have been a politician
But he never had a proper education
What could he do?
Should have been a father
But he never even made it to his twenties
What a waste
Army dreamers
Ooh what a waste of
Army dreamers
Ooh, what a waste of all that
Army dreamers
Army dreamers
Army dreamers, ooh

Driving away from the wreck of the day
And the light's always red in the rear-view
Desperately close to a coffin of hope
I'd cheat destiny just to be near you
If this is giving up, then I'm giving up
If this is giving up, then I'm giving up, giving up
On love, On love
Driving away from the wreck of the day
And I'm thinking 'bout calling on Jesus
'Cause love doesn't hurt so I know I'm not falling in love
I'm just falling to pieces
And if this is giving up then I'm giving up
If this is giving up then I'm giving up, giving up
On love, On love
Maybe I'm not up for being a victim of love
All my resistance will never be distance enough
Driving away from the wreck of the day
And it's finally quiet in my head
Driving alone, finally on my way home to the comfort of my bed
And if this is giving up, then I'm giving up
If this is giving up, then I'm giving up, giving up
On love, On love
Juan from Argentina
Such a strange predicament we find ourselves in
Baby, it's a long way to South America
Every option I have costs more than I've got
If you trust in me, if I could I would be there
All I have to give
Seems to be all over you and everyone else
I guess I'm guilty spreading thin with my love
If you trust in me, if I could I would be there
If you trust in me, if I could I would be there
If you trust in me, if I could I would be there
Don't you know you've got your Daddy's eyes
Daddy was an alcoholic
But your mother kept it all inside
Threw it all away
I was looking for another you
And I found another one
I was looking for another you
When I looked round you were gone
Stay by my side
And the pipe dream is yours now
Stay by my side
And the singer won't get in our way
Don't you know you've got your Daddy's eyes
And your Daddy was an alcoholic
But your mother kept it all inside
Threw it all away
I was looking for another you
And I found another one
I was looking for another you
When I looked round you were gone
Stay by my side
And the pipe dream is yours now
Stay by my side
And the cynics won't get in our way
Don't you know you've got your Daddy's eyes
And your Daddy was an alcoholic
But your mother kept it all inside
Threw it all away
I was looking for another chance
To see your blue eyed problem
Are you still into it? 'Cause I'm still into it
We haven't had sore bits for about a fortnight
Am I your only one? 'Cause you're still my only one
But if you need more, I'll just do it in some, right
We should go into town and spend some money
We could go to the pictures and see something funny
We'd share a popcorn and we can go to the pub at night
We can get right tanked up and and go home and have a fight
Will you still miss me when I'm gone?
Is there love there, even when I'm wrong?
Will you still kiss me if you find out?
I will now leave here but don't follow me
We could go into town and spend some money
We could go to the pictures, go and see something funny
Share a popcorn and when it's finished we could go to the pub at night
And get really pissed and go home and have a fight
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
Is there love there, even when I'm wrong?
Will you still kiss me if you find out?
I will leave you and I will miss you
One, two, three, four
This flower is scorched, this film is on
On a maddening loop, these clothes
These clothes don't fit us right
I'm to blame
It's all the same
It's all the same
You come to me with a bone in your hand
You come to me with your hair curled tight
You come to me with positions
You come to me with excuses
Ducked out in a row
You wear me out
You wear me out
We've been through fake-a-breakdown
Self-hurt, plastics, collections
Self-help, self-pain
est, psychics, fuck all
I was central, I had control
I lost my head
I need this, I need this
A paperweight, junk garage
Wedding ring, a honey pot
Crazy, all the lovers have been tagged
A hotline, a wanted ad
It's crazy what you could've had
It's crazy what you could've had
It's crazy what you could've had
I need this, I need this
It's crazy what you could've had
Crazy what you could've had
I need it, I need this
It's crazy what you could've had
It's crazy what you could've had
I need this, I, I need this
It's crazy what you could've had
I need this, I need this
It's crazy what you could've had
Crazy what you could've had
I need this, I need this
Crazy what you could've had
Crazy what you could've had
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)
We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else
(Outro - Stevie Wonder Harmonica)
Disappointment you shouldn't have done
You couldn't have done
You wouldn't have done
The things you did then
And we could've been happy
What a piteous thing, a hideous thing
Was tainted by the rest
But it won't get any harder
And I hope you'll find your way again
And it won't get any higher
But it all boils down to what you did there
In the night we fight, I fled you're right
It was exactly there
I decided
But it won't be any harder
And I hope you'll find your way again
And it won't get any higher
But it all boils down to what you did there
I pull off the road
East of Baldock and Ashford
Feeling for my cell
In the light from the dashboard
Hissing from the road
The smell of rain in the air con
Maybe check the news
Or just put a tape on
Lighting up a smoke
I've got this feeling inside me
Don't feel too good
If I close my eyes
And fell asleep in this layby
Would it all subside
The fever pushing the day by
Motor window wind
I could do with some fresh air
Can't breathe too well
(She waits for me)
I guess I should go now
(Home waits for me)
She's waiting to make up
(She waits for me)
To tell me she's sorry
(Home waits for me)
And how much she missed me
(She waits for me)
I guess I'm just burnt out
(Home waits for me)
I really should slow down
(She waits for me)
I'm perfectly fine but
(Home waits for me)
I just need to lie down
(She waits for me)
We'll grow old together
(She waits for me)
We'll grow old together
(She waits for me)
We'll grow old together...
Mother, you had me, but I never had you
I wanted you, you didn't want me
So I, I just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye
Father, you left me, but I never left you
I needed you, you didn't need me
So I, I just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye
Children, don't do what I have done
I couldn't walk, and I tried to run
So I, I just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye
Mama, don't go, daddy, come home
Mama, don't go, daddy, come home
Mama, don't go, daddy, come home
Mama, don't go, daddy, come home
Mama, don't go, daddy, come home
So be it, I'm your crowbar
If that's what I am so far
Until you get out of this mess
And I will pretend
That I don't know of your sins
Until you are ready to confess
But all the time, all the time
I'll know, I'll know
And you can use my skin
To bury secrets in
And I will settle you down
And at my own suggestion,
I will ask no questions
While I do my thing in the background
But all the time, all the time
I'll know, I'll know
Baby-I can't help you out, while she's still around
So for the time being, I'm being patient
And amidst this bitterness
If you'll just consider this-even if it don't make sense
All the time-give it time
And when the crowd becomes your burden
And you've early closed your curtains,
I'll wait by the backstage door
While you try to find the lines to speak your mind
And pry it open, hoping for an encore
And if it gets too late, for me to wait
For you to find you love me, and tell me so
It's ok, don't need to say it.
Hey Dad,
I'm writing to you
Not to tell you that I still hate you
Just to ask you how you feel
And how we fell apart
How this fell apart
Are you happy out there in this great wide world?
Do you think about your sons?
Do you miss your little girl?
When you lay your head down,
How do you sleep at night?
Do you even wonder if we're alright?
If we're alright,
We're alright
It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
You broke my mother's heart
You broke your children for life
Its not okay
But we're all right
I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
But those are just a long lost memory of mine
I spent so many years learning how to survive
And I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive
The days I spent so cold, so hungry,
Were full of hate, I was so angry
The scars run deep inside this tattooed body
There's things I'll take to my grave
But I'm okay
I'm okay
It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
You broke my mother's heart
You broke your children for life
It's not okay
But we're all right
I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
But those are just a long lost memory of mine
Now I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive
And I'm still alive
Sometimes I forgive
Yeah, and this time
I'll admit
That I miss you
Said I miss you
It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
You broke my mother's heart
You broke your children for life
It's not okay
But we're all right
I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
Those are just a long lost memory of mine
Now I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive
And sometimes I forgive,
And this time,
I'll admit,
That I miss you,
I miss you,
Hey Dad.
There's a place your mother goes
When everybody else is soundly sleeping
Through the lights of Beacon Street
And if you listen, you can hear her weeping
She's weeping
'Cause the gentlemen are calling
And the snow is softly falling on her petticoat
And she's standing in the harbor
And she's waiting for the sailors in the jolly boat
See how they approach
With dirty hands and trousers torn
They grapple till she's safe within their keeping
A gag is placed between her lips
To keep her sorry tongue from any speaking
Or screaming
And they row her out to packets
Where the sailors' sorry racket falls for maidenhead
And she's scarce above the gunwales
When her clothes fall to a bundle and she's laid in bed
On the upper deck
And so she goes from ship to ship
Her ankles clasped, her arms so rudely pinioned
'Till at last she's satisfied
The lot of the marina's teeming minions
In their opinions
And they tell her not to say a thing
To cousin, kindred, kith or kin or she'll end up dead
And they throw her dirty dollars
And return her to the harbor where she goes to bed
And this is how you're fed
So be kind to your mother
Though she may seem an awful bother
And the next time she tries to feed you collard greens
Remember what she does when you're asleep
We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdriftin'
This far but no further, I'm hanging off a branch
I'm teetering on the brink
Oh, honey sweet, so full of sleep
I'm backsliding
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So you're backtracking
Ah, ah, ah, you fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
You fell into our, ah, you fell into a
We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifters
Two sides twist and then collide;
You're calling off the guards (Am I coming?)
I'm coming through. (Am I coming?)
Adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission,
You know, sometimes it just feels better to give in.
(Sometimes it just feels better to give in.)
And it's all too familiar
Only it happens all the time.
All the cards begin to stack up,
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime,
But it's you I can't deny.
(You I can't deny.)
Dull heat rises from the sheets.
I'm both a patient boy,
Well, and a jealous man. (Am I coming?)
But double standardized suspicion
Is remedied, oh, my blue heaven,
Sometimes it just feels better to give in.
(Sometimes it just feels better to give in.)
And it's all too familiar
Only it happens all the time.
All the cards begin to stack up,
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime,
But it's you I can't deny.
(You I can't deny.)
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in
My head starts to sing
"You're safe, child, you are safe."
("You're safe, child, you are safe.")
"You're safe, child, you are safe."
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in
My head starts to sing
"You're safe, child, you are safe."
"You're safe, child, you are.."
Safe (safe, safe)
You are (safe)
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in
My head starts to sing
"You're safe, child, you are safe." (Am I coming?)
"You're safe, child, you are safe." (Am I coming through?)
Is this all too familiar?
Does it happen all the time?
I'm just asking you to hear me.
Could you please, just once, just hear me?
More then anything you wanted to be right.
Still it's you, you, it's you I can't deny.
(You I can't deny.)
It's you I can't deny.
Go if you want to
I never tried to stop you
Know there's a reason
For all of this you're feeling
Low, it's not my call
You couldn't ever love me more
You couldn't love me more
You couldn't love
Me, I don't show much
It's not that hard to hide you
See in a moment
I can't remember how to
Be all you wanted
I couldn't ever love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love
You want me to cry and play my part
I want you to sigh and fall apart
We want this like everyone else
Stay if you want to
I always wait to hear you
Say there's a last kiss
For all the times you run this
Way, it's not my fault
You couldn't ever love me more
You couldn't love me more
You couldn't love me more
Love me more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love
You want me to lie not break your heart
I want you to fly not stop and start
We want us like everything else
Maybe we didn't understand
It's just the end of the world
Maybe we didn't understand
Not just a boy and a girl
It's just the end of the, end of the world
Me, I don't say much
It's far too hard to make you
See in a moment
I still forget just how to
Be all you wanted
I couldn't ever love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more
Let's get together and talk about the modern age.
All of our friends were gathered there with their pets
Just talking shit about how we're all so upset about the disappearing ground.
As we watch it melt...
It's all of the good that won't come out of us
And how eventually our hands will just turn to dust,
If we keep shaking them.
Standing here on this frozen lake.
I do this thing where I think I'm real sick
But I won't go to the doctor to find out about it
'Cause they make you stay real still in a real small space
As they chart up your insides and put them on display.
They'd see all of it, all of me, all of it.
All the good that won't come out of me
And all the stupid lies I hide behind.
It's such a big mistake
Lying here in your warm embrace.
Oh, you're almost home.
I've been waiting for you to come in.
Dancing around in your old suits going crazy in your room again.
I think I'll go out an embarrass myself by getting drunk and falling down in
The street.
You say I choose sadness
That it never once has chosen me.
Maybe you're right...
Let's talk about all of our friends who lost the war
And all of the novels that had yet to be written about them.
It's all the good that won't come out of them
And all the stupid lies they hide behind.
It's such a big mistake
Standing here on this frozen lake.
It's all of the good that won't come out of me
And how eventually my mouth will just turn to dust
If I don't tell you quick.
Standing here on this frozen lake.
She wakes up
Rage and grace
Pulling me closer, pushing away at me
The sharpest thorn on your vine
Twistin' and turnin', we're all intertwined
Broken wing
Empty glass
Words that scream and bounce right back
She says, "You know, we'd all like to rearrange"
I wish I could fix you
And make you how I want you
I wish I could fix you
And I wish you could fix me
I wish I could heal you
And mend where you are broken
I wish I could heal you
And I wish you could heal me
A beaming sunrise buries the night
The setting sun destroys the light
And she says, "Baby, I've gotta get going"
Cutting each other without even knowing
She sees a million stars like holes in the sky
All god's tears for her, they cry
And I am in her reign
I wish I could fix you
And make you how I want you
I wish I could fix you
And I wish you could fix me
I wish I could heal you
And mend where you are broken
I wish I could heal you
And I wish you could heal me
Broken wing
Empty glass
Words that scream and bounce right back
She says, "You know, we'd all like to rearrange"
The wall on which the prophets wrote is cracking at the seams
Upon the instruments of death, the sunlight brightly gleams
When every man is torn apart with nightmares and with dreams
Will no one lay the laurel wreath when silence drowns the screams?
Confusion will be my epitaph
As I crawl a cracked and broken path
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh
But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Between the iron gates of fate, the seeds of time were sown
And watered by the deeds of those who know and who are known
Knowledge is a deadly friend if no one sets the rules
The fate of all mankind I see is in the hands of fools
The wall on which the prophets wrote is cracking at the seams
Upon the instruments of death, the sunlight brightly gleams
When every man is torn apart with nightmares and with dreams
Will no one lay the laurel wreath when silence drowns the screams?
Confusion will be my epitaph
As I crawl a cracked and broken path
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh
But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Crying
Crying
Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
Crying
I'm lost in the light
I pray for the night
To take me, to take you too
After so many words
Still nothing's heard
Don't know what we should do
So if someone could see me now
Let them see you
'Twas my greatest thrill
When we just stood still
You let me hold your hand till I had my fill
Even counting sheep
Don't help me sleep
I just toss and turn right there beside ya
So if someone could help me now
They'd help you too
They'd help you too
See you through
All the hard things we've all gotta do
'Cause this life is long
So you wouldn't be wrong
Being free, leaving me on my own
And I held my own
Still I rattled your bones
I said some awful things and I take them back
If we would try again
Just remember when
Before we were lovers I swear we were friends
So if someone could see me now
Let them see you
Let them see you
See you through
All the hard things we've all gotta do
'Cause this life is long
So you wouldn't be wrong
Being free, leaving me on my own
(Now : You : Go)
We're swimming in the blue
Nigh misfortune
Will night bring light or gloom?
My eyes are soaked all way through
Our sinking friendships
We drown them all
I'm singing a sad tune
Is this song to you? (Ooh Ooh Ooh)
Is this song to you? (Ooh Ooh Ooh)
We should all wear two lifesaving layers
We should all wear two...
No one knows you, till it's over
You know no one true, till it's over
Is this song to you?
Is this song to you?
My lips are pale plum
My shivering half-moon
My last night's lost tune
It's the end of the end of the end
Our sinking friendships
We drown them all
I'm singing a sad tune
Is this song to you? (Ooh Ooh Ooh)
Is this song to you? (Ooh Ooh Ooh)
We should all wear two lifesaving layers
We should all wear two...
No one knows you, till it's over
You know no one true, till it's over
No one knows you, till it's over
You know no one true, till it's over
Is this song to you?
Is this song to you?
(You : Go : Now)
Look in my eyes
I'm jaded now whatever that means
By sharing these things,
I rip my heart out.
It's worth my time,
Whatever that means... so
Hard to see up,
My neck feels stiff until I wake up.
The orange I choked
And back to my neck
It's worth my time
Whatever that means... so
Share with me
'Cause I need it right now
Let me see your insides
Or write me off
'Cause I'd rather stop now
If you won't open up
Give it to me
Give me all... Whatever you want
It's never been me
To want this much from you
I can see
Yeah...
Share with me
'Cause I need it right now
Let me see your insides
Or write me off
'Cause I'd rather stop now
If you won't open up
You won't open up
(Tears me up!)
(Tears me up!)
(Tears me up!)
(Tears me up!)
Look in my eyes
I'm jaded now, whatever that means.
By sharing these things
I rip my heart out
It's worth my time
Whatever that means... so
Share with me
'Cause I need it right now
Let me see your insides
Or write me off
'Cause I'd rather stop now
If you won't open up
Share with me
'Cause I need it right now
Let me see your insides
Or write me off
'Cause I'd rather stop now
If you won't open up.
You won't open up; (It tears me up)
Baby, I've been waiting
I've been waiting night and day
I didn't see the time
I waited half my life away
There were many invitations
And I know you sent me some
But I was waiting
For the miracle to come
I know you really loved me
But, you see, my hands were tied
I know it must have hurt you
It must have hurt your pride
To stand beneath my window
With your bugle and your drum
While I was waiting
For the miracle to come
You wouldn't like it baby
You wouldn't like it here
There's not much entertainment
And the critics are severe
The maestro says it's Mozart
But it sounds like bubble gum
When you're waiting
For the miracle to come
Waiting for the miracle
There's nothing left to do
I haven't been this happy
Since the end of World War II
Nothing left to do
When you know that you've been taken
Nothing left to do
When you're begging for a crumb
Nothing left to do
When you've got to go on waiting
For the miracle to come
I dreamed about you, baby
It was just the other night
Most of you was naked
But some of you was light
The sands of time were falling
From your fingers and your thumb
And you were waiting
For the miracle to come
Baby, let's get married
We've been alone too long
Let's be alone together
Let's see if we're that strong
Let's do something crazy
Something absolutely wrong
While we're waiting
For the miracle to come
When you've fallen on the highway
And you're lying in the rain
And they ask you how you're feeling
Of course you say you can't complain-
If you're squeezed for information
That's when you've got to play it dumb:
You just say you're out there waiting
For the miracle to come
Once there was a great storm
Pushed my head beneath the waves
I was gone
Underneath the walnut tree
Where you said you'd wait for me
And I waited a long, long time
I waited a long, long time
I waited a long, long time
I waited a long, long time
I waited a long, long time
Why, why do I come here?
Seeking out the memories I hold dear
'Cause you put your spell on me
Made me live in memory
And I'm frozen in just the wrong time
I waited a long, long time
I waited a long, long time
I waited a long, long time
I waited a long, long time
Saw your face
My hand you took
Just like in a storybook
And you got me
Yeah, you got me
I can't even argue
Couldn't, 'cause it's true
Now you got me
Yeah, you got me
Got me tucked up in your pocket
Don't know how you won my heart
'Cause I'd locked it
Yeah, I'd locked it
I can't feel your heartbeat
Where I lay my head
Cause you got me
Yeah, you got me
I can't feel your heartbeat
Where I lay my head
Cause you got me
Yeah, you got me
Got me tucked up in your pocket
Don't know how you won my heart
'Cause I'd locked it
Yeah, I'd locked it
I know I've been mistaken
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
I've got some imperfections
But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face
But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away, I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting
I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending, it's as much as I can take
And you're so independent
You just refuse to bend so I keep bending till I break
But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away, I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting
I've made a commitment
I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what I need in you
Why can't you just forgive me
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made along the way
But I always find a way to keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say to keep you right here waiting
'Cause you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if I chose to walk away, would you be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep me right here waiting
Well the future's got me worried
Such awful thoughts
My head's a carousel of pictures
The spinning never stops
I just want someone to walk in front
And I'll follow the leader
Like when I fell under the weight of a schoolboy crush
Started carrying her books and doing lots of drugs
I almost forgot who I was
But I came to my senses
Now I'm trying to be assertive
I'm making plans
Gonna rise to the occasion yeah
Meet all their demands
But all I do is just lay in bed
And hide under the covers
Yeah I know I should be brave
But I'm just too afraid of all this change
And it's too hard to focus through all this doubt
I keep making these to-do lists but nothing gets crossed out
Working on the record seems pointless now
When the world ends who's gonna hear it?
But I'm trying to take some comfort in written words
Yeah, Tim, I heard your album and it's better than good
When we get off tour I think we should
Hang and black out together
'Cause I been feeling sentimental for days gone by
All the summers singing, drinking, laughin'
Wasting our time
Remember all the songs and the way we smiled
In those basements made of music
But now I've got to crawl to get anywhere at all
I'm not as strong as I thought
So when I'm lost in a crowd
I hope that you'll pick me out
How I long to be found
The grass grew high, I laid down
Now I'm waiting for a hand
To lift me up, help me stand
I've been laying so low
Don't wanna lay here no more
Don't wanna lay here no more
Everything that happens is supposed to be
And it's all predetermined can't change your destiny
Guess I'll just keep moving
Someday maybe I'll get to where I'm going
Please sleep, my darling, sleep
Your cry for inspiration
Never reaches ears on distant stars
And every night our lonely planet
Slides across the universe
And I won't pretend I understand
Please sleep, my darling, sleep
Your death by information
Won't disturb the peace on distant stars
And even when you lock the doors
And slide behind the unlit shades
None of us are strangers anymore
So fall asleep with the windows open
Come to me with the worst you've said and done
You'll close your eyes and see me
(A little death makes life more meaningful)
I stand no chance at all
Please sleep, my darling, sleep
Your car crash in slow motion
Won't upset the pace on distant stars
And one by one the years of our lives 
Stumble as the moments pass
So please hold on, (so please hold on) please hold on
So fall asleep with the windows open
Come to me with the worst you've said and done
You'll close your eyes and see me
(A little death makes life more meaningful)
I stand no chance at all
Please sleep, my darling, sleep
Please sleep, my darling, sleep
So fall asleep with the windows open
Come to me with the worst you've said and done
You'll close your eyes and see me
(A little death makes life more meaningful)
I stand no chance at all
When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Living alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home
All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore
Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure
All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore
When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore
 
All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
I chose an eternity of this
Like falling angels, the world disappeared
Laughing into the fire, is it always like this?
Flesh and blood and the first kiss
The first colours, the first kiss
We writhed under a red light
Voodoo smile, Siamese twins
A girl at the window looks at me for an hour
Then everything falls apart
Broken inside me, it falls apart
The walls and the ceiling move in time
Push a blade into my hands
Slowly up the stairs
And into the room, is it always like this?
Dancing in my pocket
Worms eat my skin
She glows and grows with arms outstretched
Her legs around me, in the morning I cried
Leave me to die, you won't remember my voice
I walked away and grew old
You never talk, we never smile, I scream "You're nothing"
"I don't need you anymore, you're nothing"
It fades and spins
Fades and spins
Sing out loud "We all die"
Laughing into the fire, is it always like this?
Is it always like this?
Is it always like this?
Did you ever think of me
As your best friend
Did I ever think of you
I'm not complaining
I never tried to feel
I never tried to feel this vibration
I never tried to reach
I never tried to reach your Eden
Did I ever think of you
As my enemy
Did you ever think of me
I'm complaining
I never tried to feel
I never tried to feel this vibration
I never tried to reach
I never tried to reach your Eden
Sister, won't you rise with me?
Run 'way from your grave
Father set our house to flame
Please his newfound lady
Brother, won't you steal away?
Dreams of night at play
Father set our house ablaze
Blackened stones, I beg you, speak
Of the murderous hand
Words will never sound again
On this shallow land
Blackened sky, I beg you, weep
What the day has lost
No one left to weep for us
No need to worry
We'll get some jewelry for your momma
No need to worry
We'll get some jewelry for your momma
No need to worry
We'll get some jewelry for your momma
Cinders of gold
Cinders of gold
Cinders of gold
Cinders of gold
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one
It's the loneliest number since the number one
"No" is the saddest experience you'll ever know
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
Because one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever know
It's just no good anymore since you went away
Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday
Because one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever know
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number, much much worse than two
One is the number divided by two
You get what you see
I saw a rich fuck giving charity
Saw an evil emperor wearing my clothes
They're far from the best
But they might suit you better than the rest
Just looking in the mirror
Will make you a brave man
I know my place
I hate my face
I know how I begin, and how I'll end
Strung out again
Was a parliament of owls
Fly over a city of canals
Floating on the body, floating in the Dalles
You get what you see
But some things they just change invisibly
I don't know where I'm going
I don't even want to know
I know my place
I hate my face
I know how I begin, and how I'll end
Strung out again
Standing, smiling on some fantasy island
Looking at my lost reflection again
But a tide's coming in
And I'm strung out again
Strung out again
Where the human tried 
Where the cave man died 
In the sea again 
By the fallen stars 
Only chimes sing again 
There's a storm only in loving me 
In the storm, by the storm 
Beneath the stars 
Right here when the storm blows over 
Right here like a storm left over 
I die here as your friend or lover 
They never learn 
They never learn
How I needed you
How I grieve now you're gone
In my dreams I see you
I awake so alone
I know you didn't want to leave
Your heart yearned to stay
But the strength I always loved in you finally gave way
Somehow I knew you would leave me this way
Somehow I knew you could never, never stay
And in the early morning light
After a silent, peaceful night
You took my heart away and my being
In my dreams I can see you
I can tell you how I feel
In my dreams I can hold you
And it feels so real
I still feel the pain
I still feel your love
I still feel the pain
I still feel your love
And somehow I knew you could never, never stay
And somehow I knew you would leave me
And in the early morning light
After a silent, peaceful night
You took my heart away
Oh I wish, I wish you could have stayed
Broke account so I broke a sweat
I've bought some things that I sort of regret, about now
Broke my pace and ran out of time
Sometimes I'm so full of shit that it should be a crime
Broke a promise 'cause my car broke down
Such a classic excuse it should be bronze by now
Broke up and I'm relieved somehow
It's the end of the discussions that just go round and round
And round, and round, and round, and round, and round, and round
It shouldn't have been anyway, no way, no way, no way, that's right
Hah-oh hah-oh, hah-oh hah-oh no
Hah-oh hah-oh, hah-oh hah-oh no
Hah-oh hah-oh, hah-oh hah-oh no
It was extremely kind(?), in a tiny (?) jar
You're livin' on fancy wine
You'll drink that turpentine
You're startin' conversations
You don't even know the topic

Well I have nothing
I have no one
And I've been so quickly set free
And I love nothing
I love no one
Are words that you whisper in my mind
To someone I don't know
To someone I don't know
To someone I
So walk with me
On this new spring morning
I'll walk you till your fears are numb
I'm a new baby weeping
And the flower you're keeping
That without love will wilt and die
I need your light in my life
Need your light in my life
Need your light
So come back to me my darling
Come back to me my darling
I'd do anything to be at your side
I'd be anyone to be at your side
I need your light in my life
Need your light in my life
Need your light
I know they say you can't go home again.
I just had to come back one last time.
Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam.
But these handprints on the front steps are mine.
And up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar.
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard.
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.
Mama cut out pictures of houses for years.
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazines.
Plans were drawn, concrete poured,
And nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to mama's dream.
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.
You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can.
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am.
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could walk around I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.
I don't need an education,
I learned all I need from you.
They've got me on some medication,
My point of balance was askew.
It keeps my temperature from rising,
My blood is pumping through my veins.
Somebody get me out of here,
I'm tearing at myself.
Nobody gives a damn about me or anybody else.
I wear myself out in the morning,
You're asleep when I get home.
Please don't call me self defending,
You know it cuts me to the bone.
And it's really not surprising,
I hold a force I can't contain.
Somebody get me out of here,
I'm tearing at myself.
Nobody gives a damn about me or anybody else.
And still you call me co-dependent,
Somehow you lay the blame on me.
And still you call me co-dependent,
Somehow you lay the blame on me.
Somebody get me out of here,
I'm tearing at myself.
I've got to make a point these days,
To extricate myself.
Somebody get me out of here,
I'm tearing at myself.
Nobody gives a damn about me or anybody else.
And still you call me co-dependent,
Somehow you lay the blame on me.
And still you call me co-dependent,
Somehow you lay the blame on me.
Somehow you lay the blame on me...
Where do we go from here?
How do we carry on?
I can't get beyond the questions
Clambering for the scraps
In the shatter of us collapsed
That cuts me with every could-have-been
Pain on pain on play repeating
With the backup, makeshift life in waiting
Everybody says
Time heals everything
But what of the wretched hollow?
The endless in-between?
Are we just going to wait it out?
There's nothing to see here now
Turning the sign around
We're closed to the earth 'til further notice
A stumbling clichéd case
Crumpled and puffy faced
Dead in the stare of a thousand miles
All I want, only one, street-level miracle
I'll be an out-in-out, born-again, from none more cynical
Everybody says
That time heals everything
All in the end
What of the wretched hollow?
The endless in-between?
Are we just going to wait it out?
And sit here cold, we will be long gone by then
In lackluster, in dust we layer on old magazines,
Fluorescent lighting sets the scene
For all we could and should be being
In the one life that we've got
In the one life that we've got
Everybody says
That time heals everything
What of the wretched hollow?
The endless in-between?
Are we just going to wait it out?
And sit here
Just going to wait it out
And sit here cold
Just going to sweat it out
Wait it out
Here in line where stupid shit collides
With dying shooting stars
All we got to show what we really are
Is the same kind of scars
And looking at you, all I see is
You're waiting for something
Single file
You're a murder mile
You idiot kid
Your arm's got a death in it
Mmm...
If you're choking up, take this paper cup
But there's a price that you'll pay
For trying hard to become whatever they are
And saying whatever they say
So help yourself to this bitter pill
Or somebody else will
Single file
You were murdered by
You idiot kid
Your arm's got a death in it
Single file
Single file
Single file
Single file
I met a girl, a snowball in hell
She was hard and as cracked as the Liberty Bell
I got her to come on and move in with me
And I said I'd find a better place we could spend eternity
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay
Her mama called me a thief
And her dad called himself commander-in-chief
I fought him off with my love
But I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise above
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay
She had a dream, woke up in shock
She had seen her own body outlined in chalk
I split the scene, the globe had been spun
And her ghost leaned down to kiss me with a message from the sun
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay, stay
When I wake up
In the morning
I pour the coffee
Read the paper
Then I slowly
And so softly
Do the dishes
Feed the fishes
Sing me Happy Birthday
Sing it like it's going to be your last day
Like it's halleujah
Don't just let it pass on through ya
It's a giant among cliches
And that's why I want you to sing it anyway
Sing me Happy Birthday
Cause hell what's it all about
Anyway
Sing me Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Like it's gonna be your last day
Here on earth
I don't wanna go out
You don't wanna stay in
I guess we're gonna argue again
There's a tear in your eye
And there's no 'I' in team
I guess we're gonna argue again
But what I do is always come back to you
My heart is oh so true
But I might hurt you again
You know that it's true
I'm loving you
Oh no, not again, we're arguing
There's one thing causing you trouble
And girl you're the one thing caught in between
They say your boyfriend lives in a bubble
But I'd let them in, I'd let them in
I am like powder, I am like relaxation
I am the snow, I am the snow, I am the snow
I live in a desert
And I let the wind make love to me
I dig in this ocean and I try to fill it with gold
Fill it to the top, fill it to the top, fill it to the top
Do you look for hope in other people's eyes
Well that may be your worst redemption
Do you feed and clothe yourself
Well that may be your best defense
I am from the moon, I am from the moon, I am from the moon,
So they say, so they say, so they say
Facing, confronting, branding each other
We were made through one another
Great expectations, great expectations, great expectations
So they say, so they say, so they say
I am the snow, I am the snow, I am the snow
Don't know what to do anymore
I've lost the only love worth fighting for
And I'll drown in my tear storming sea
That would show you
That would make you hurt like me
All the same
I don't want mud-slinging games
It's just a shame
To let you walk away
Is there a chance
A fragment of light
At the end of the tunnel
A reason to fight?
Is there a chance
You may change your mind
Or are we ashes and wine?
Don't know if our fate's already sealed
This day's a spinning circus on a wheel
And I'm ill with the thought of your kiss
Coffee-laced, intoxicating on her lips
Shut it out
I've got no claim on you now
I'm not allowed 
To wear your freedom down, no
Is there a chance
A fragment of light
At the end of the tunnel
A reason to fight?
Is there a chance
You may change your mind
Or are we ashes and wine?
I'll tear myself away
If that's what you need
There is nothing left to say
But, is there a chance
A fragment of light
At the end of the tunnel
A reason to fight?
Is there a chance
You may change your mind
Or are we ashes and wine?
Reduced to ashes and wine
Or are we ashes
Scarred, your back was turned, curled like an embryo
Take another face, you will be kissed again
I was cold as I mouthed the words, and crawled across the mirror
I wait, await the next breath
Your name like ice into my heart
A shallow grave, a monument to the ruined age
Ice in my eyes, and eyes like ice don't move
Screaming at the moon, another pastime
Your name like ice into my heart
Everything as cold as life, can no one save you?
Everything, as cold as silence
And you never say a word
Your name like ice into my heart
Your name like ice into my heart
When I clung to you
There was nothing to
Hold on tight with
You left me adrift

His name was Perry
He had a learning difficulty
His father was a very mean man
His father burned his skin
His father sent him to his death
He was ten years old
He was ten years old
He was ten years old
Her name was Naomi
Beautiful round face, so ashamed
Told me how to please a man
After school in the back of a bus
She was doin' it every day
She was eleven years old
She was eleven years old
She was eleven years old
Her name was Sheryl
Black hair, like an electric space
She would pretty paint my face
She was a very good friend
Her father would come to her in the night
She was twelve years old
She was twelve years old
She was twelve years old
His name was Donovan
He was a very good friend
The cards were stacked against him
He was selling cocaine
The last time I saw him
He was thirteen years old
He was thirteen years old
He was thirteen years old
His name was Charles
He said he was in love with me
We were both fourteen
Then I had to move away
Then he began to smoke crack
Then he had to sell ass
I don't know where he is
I don't know where they are
Erupt again; ignore the pill, and I won't let it show
Sacrifice the torture's orchestral tear cashflow
Increase, delete, escape, defeat - it's all that matters to you
Cotton case for an iron pill
Distorted eyes when everything is clearly dying
Burn my knees and, burn my knees and
Burn my knees and
Emotion sickness
Addict with no heroine
Emotion sickness
Distorted eyes when everything is clearly dying
Burn my knees and, burn my knees and pray
Burn my knees and, burn my knees and pray
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, won't you stop my pain
Emotion sickness
Addict with no heroine
Good things will pass
Lessons learnt
Emotion sickness 
Lessons learnt
I hope that our few remaining friends
Give up on trying to save us
I hope we come up with a fail-safe plot
To piss off the dumb few that forgave us
I hope the fences we mended
Fall down beneath their own weight
And I hope we hang on past the last exit
I hope it's already too late
And I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
Someday burns down
And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
And I never come back to this town again
In my life, I hope I lie
And tell everyone you were a good wife
And I hope you die
I hope we both die
I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
I hope it bleeds all day long
Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
We're pretty sure they're all wrong
I hope it stays dark forever
I hope the worst isn't over
And I hope you blink before I do
And I hope I never get sober
And I hope when you think of me years down the line
You can't find one good thing to say
And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out
You'd stay the hell out of my way
I am drowning, there is no sign of land
You are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hand
And I hope you die
I hope we both die
I would dig a thousand holes to lay next to you
I would dig a thousand more if I needed to
I look around the grave
For an escape route of old routines
There doesn't seem to be any other way
'Cause I've started falling apart
I'm not savouring life
I've forgotten how good it could be
To feel alive
Crazy as it sounds you won't
Feel as low as you feel right now
At least that's what I've been told by everyone
I whisper empty sounds in your ear
And hope that you won't let go
Take the pieces and build them skywards
'Cause I've started falling apart
I'm not savouring life
I've forgotten how good it could be
To feel alive
I've started falling apart
I'm not savouring life
Take the pieces and build them skywards
I've forgotten how good it could be
To feel alive
Take the pieces and build them skywards
I've started falling apart
I'm not savouring life
Take the pieces and build them skywards
I've forgotten how good it could be
To feel alive
Take the pieces and build them skywards
I've started falling apart
I'm not savouring life
Take the pieces and build them skywards
I've forgotten how good it could be
To feel alive
Take the pieces and build them skywards
Take the pieces and build them skywards
And take the pieces and build them skywards
And take the pieces and build them up to the sky
Oh
I feel these four walls closing in
Face up against the glass
Looking at him
Is this my life I'm wondering
It happened so fast
How do I turn this thing around
Is this the bed I chose to make
It's greener pastures I'm thinking about
Wide open spaces far away
All I want is
The wind in my hair
To face the fear but
Not feel scared
Wild horses
I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind
I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love
Like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses
Ah yeah
Oh oh
I see the girl I wanna be
Riding bareback
Carefree along the shore
If only that someone was me
Jumping headfirst
Headlong without a thought
To act and damn the consequence
How I wish it could be that easy
But fear surrounds me like a fence
I wanna break free
All I want is
The wind in my hair
To face the fear but
Not feel scared
Oh wild horses
I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind
I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love
Like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses
Oh
I wanna run too
Oh
Recklessly abandoning myself before you
I wanna open up my heart
Tell him how I feel
Ooh wild horses
I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind
I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love
Like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses
Oh yeah yeah oh oh
I wanna run with the wild horses
Oh
Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no
You were my lesson, I had to learn
I was your fortress, you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Do you wanna go higher
There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
You were my lesson, I had to learn
I was your fortress
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
Learn... to... say... good... bye
I yearn... to... say... good... bye
There's nothing left to try
There's no more places to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
As I walk away
I look over my shoulder
To see what I'm leaving behind
Pieces of puzzles
And wishes on eyelashes fail
Oh, how do I show all the love
Inside my heart
Well this is all new
And I'm feeling my way through the dark
And I used to talk
With honest conviction
Of how I predicted my world
I'm gonna leave it to stargazers
Tell me what your telescope says
Oh, what is in store for me now?
It's coming apart
I know that it's true
'Cause I'm feeling my way through the dark
Try to find a light on somewhere
Try to find a light on somewhere
I'm finding I'm falling in love with the dark, oh yeah
Oh, what do I know
I don't care where I start
For my troubles are few
As I'm feeling my way through the dark
Through the dark
I'm feeling my way through the dark
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them.
And my father told me, "Son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say...
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh.
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain,
Black suit, black tie standing in the rain.
And now my family is one again,
Stapled together with the strangers and the friend.
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen.
6 years old I remember when my father told me, "Son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say...
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh.'
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
And my father and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah
And my brother and all my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah
(And all my brothers and my sisters yeah)
And my brother and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
I don't mind
If your hand's a little cold
'Cause I'm alive
But I've got nowhere to go
So stay with me Evelyn
Don't leave me with the medicine
In the night
As you sit and watch me sleep
I know you cry
But I never want to see
So if you go
I don't know what I'll do
So don't you go
'Cause I've got no-one but you
So stay with me Evelyn
Don't leave me with the medicine
So stay with me Evelyn
Don't leave me with the medicine
I see the lights
Casting shadows on my screen
And I don't mind
The lullabies from the machines
But if you go
I don't know what I'll do
So don't you go
'Cause I've got no-one but you
So stay with me Evelyn
Don't leave me with the medicine
So stay with me Evelyn
Don't leave me ...
I'm more afraid than I've ever been
So stay with me Evelyn
I've looked everywhere, Mr. Forbes
But I can't find the cello or yet the french horn
And I can't find the harp
I don't know where it's gone
And of course, you can't go without that
I've looked everywhere, Mr. Forbes
But I can't find your clamshells
Your file or your drill
And your sheepskin-lined coat is eluding me still
And of course, you can't go without that
I've looked in the attic, the cellar and hall
I've looked in the studio, study and all
I've looked in the chest where I thought it should be
I've looked in the greenhouses, one, two and three
I've looked everywhere, Mr. Forbes
But I can't find the dagger and oh why oh why
Can't I think what I did with that ol' skill and dye
And of course, you can't go without that
You can't possibly go without that
While the hands are pointing up midnight
You're a question mark
Coming after people you watched collide
You can ask what you want to, the satellite
'Cause the names you drop
Put ice in my veins
And for all you know
You're the only one who finds it strange
When they call it a lover's moon, the satellite
'Cause it acts just like lovers do, the satellite
A burned out world you know
Staying up all night, the satellite
Got no place to go
But there's a girl waiting for me down in Mexico
She got a bottle of tequila, a bottle of gin
And if I bring a little music I could fit right in
We got airplane rides
We got California drowning out the window side
We got big black cars
And we got stories how we slept with all the movie stars
I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me
Drink my worries down the drain
And fly away to somewhere new
Hop on my choo-choo
I'll be your engine driver in a bunny suit
If you dress me up in pink and white
We may be just a little fuzzy 'bout it later tonight
She's my angel
She's a little better than the one that used to be with me
'Cause she liked to scream at me
Man, it's a miracle that she's not living up in a tree
I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me
Drive this little girl insane
And fly away to someone new
Everybody's gone
They left the television screaming that the radio's on
Someone stole my shoes
But there's a couple of bananas and a bottle of booze
Oh well, happy New Year's, baby
We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day
Or we could simply pack our bags
And catch a plane to Barcelona 'cause this city's a drag
I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me
Flush my worries down the drain
And fly away to somewhere new
Take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me
Drive this little girl insane
Fly away to someone new
Fly away to someone new
Fly away to someone new
Dear my love, haven't you wanted to be with me
And dear my love, haven't you longed to be free
I can't keep pretending that I don't even know you
And at sweet night, you are my own
Take my hand
We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone
They'd only hold us down
So by the morning light
We'll be half way to anywhere
Where love is more than just your name
I have dreamt of a place for you and I
No one knows who we are there
All I want is to give my life only to you
I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore
Let's run away, I'll take you there
We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone
They'd only hold us down
So by the morning light
We'll be half way to anywhere
Where no one needs a reason
Forget this life
Come with me
Don't look back you're safe now
Unlock your heart
Drop your guard
No one's left to stop you
Forget this life
Come with me
Don't look back you're safe now
Unlock your heart
Drop your guard
No one's left to stop you now
We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone
They'd only hold us down
So by the morning light
We'll be half way to anywhere
Where love is more than just your name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (ah)
Yeah, yeah... yeah (yeah yeah) (ah)
Yeah, yeah... yeah (yeah yeah) (ah)
Yeah, yeah... yeah (yeah yeah) (ah)
Yeah, yeah... yeah (yeah yeah) (ah)
Hold the gun
Way deep down
Look out young son
Look out young son
Good things coming
'Cause the good thing's coming
Shot guns with no guns
Shot army with no army at all
I don't know what is worse 
And I can't tell what is the best
People emphasize the weight of the world
Demons despise the sound of shaking paper
Guess what I found out
You
Did
Too
Hold the gun
Way deep down
Look out young son
Look out young son
'Cause the good thing's coming
'Cause the good thing is coming
Shot guns with no guns
Shot army with no army at all
I don't know what is worse 
And I can't tell what is the best
People emphasize the weight of the world
Demons despise the sound of shaking paper
Guess what I found out
You
Did
Too
'Cause the good thing is coming
'Cause the good thing is coming
'Cause the good thing is coming
'Cause the good thing is coming
I try to stay busy
I do the dishes, I mow the lawn
I try to keep myself occupied
Even though I know you're not comin' home
I try to keep the house nice an' neat
I make my bed, I change the sheets
I even learned how to use the washin' machine
Keeping things clean doesn't change anything
What am I gonna do when I run out of shirts to fold?
What am I gonna do when I run out of lawn to mow?
What am I gonna do if you never come home?
Tell me, oh what am I gonna do?
Oh, hate it
I hate it here
When you're gone
I caught myself thinkin'
I caught myself thinkin' once again
I had to try to keep my mind outta this
Try not to pretend
I check the phone
I check the mail
I check the phone again, I call your mom
She says you're not there and I should take care
I hate it here
When you're gone
I hate it
I hate it here
When you're gone
I try to stay busy
I take out the trash, I sweep the floor
Try to keep myself occupied
'Cause I know you don't live here anymore
K, it's your ride
Get your petals out and lay them in the aisle
Pretend
Your garden grow, and it's your day to wed
We found your man
He's drinking up, he's all-American
And he'll drive
He's volunteered with grace to end your life
We'll tidy up
It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us
You explode
You firefly, you tiny boat, with oars
Feather oars
The world tilts back and pours and pours and so
You satellite
You tidal wave, you're a big surprise
And I've one more night
To be your mother
The signal interrupts
Baby's frequency not strong enough, remain
In my hands, and smile, we will miss you
But in time you'll get settled, and we will write
Hey, beauty supreme
Yeah, you were right about me
But can I get myself out from underneath
This guilt that will crush me?
And in the choir
I saw our sad messiah
He was bored and tired of my laments
Said, "I died for you one time, but never again"
Never again, never again, never again, never again
Never again, never again, never again, never again
Well, I love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again)
No, 'cause I can dish it out (Never again)
But I can't take it (Never again)
Well, I love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again)
'Cause I can dish it out (Never again)
But I can't take it (Never again)
One will love you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it
Two will love you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it
Three will love you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it
Four will love you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it
Five will love you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it
Six will love you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it
Seven loves you so much
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
'Cause I can dish it out
But I can't take it
(I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth)
Seven loves you so much
(We'll never have to rot together underneath the dirt)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
(I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd)
'Cause I can dish it out
(I should be laughing right now)
But I can't take it
(I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth)
Seven loves you so much
(We'll never have to rot together underneath the dirt)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
(I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd)
'Cause I can dish it out
(I should be laughing right now)
But I can't take it
(I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth)
Seven loves you so much
(We'll never have to rot together underneath the dirt)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply
(I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd)
'Cause I can dish it out
(I should be laughing right now...)
But I can't take it
Time passes by, direction unknown
You've left us now, but we're not alone
Before you know it your cup's overflown
You measured no one that I've ever known
And it's quite alright
And goodbye for now
Just look up to the stars
And believe who you are
'Cause it's quite alright
And so long, goodbye
We always knew that it'd come to this
It's times like these I forget what I miss
Matters of heart are hard to address
Especially when yours is full of emptiness
And it's quite alright
And goodbye for now
Just look up to the stars
And believe who you are
'Cause it's quite alright
And so long, goodbye
Well, Time passes by, direction unknown
You've left us now, but we're not alone
Before you know it your cup's overflown
Well, You measured no one that I've ever known
And it's quite alright
And goodbye for now
Just look up to the stars
And believe who you are
'Cause it's quite alright
And so long, goodbye
I see the moon
I see the moon
I see the moon
Oh when you're looking at the Sun
Not a fool
I'm not a fool
Not a fool
No you're not fooling anyone
Oh but when you're gone
When you're gone
When you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out
Oh baby come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down, oh no
No I won't let you down, oh no
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I see in blue
I see in blue
I see in blue
Oh and you see everything in red
And there's nothing that I wanna do for you
Do for you
Do for you
Oh cause you got inside my head
Oh but when you're gone
When you're gone
When you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out
Oh baby come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down, oh no
No I won't let you down, oh no
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one
Will you be mine?
Oh baby come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down, oh no
No I won't let you down, oh no
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay
Hey, eh, eh, ey
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, eh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all this worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay
Past the roaring shore
I have nothing left to hear
I'm chasing all the words
But everything you say I only see
But honestly it's fine
When I mention how I love you
It's all I do
Even as I stray
We have the cold to keep
I'm not sure I still believe
My most is nothing more
Than a place we've been before
We'll draw and drag it on
I'm telling you I'm trying to hear this out
I want nothing more to doubt
A little bit of shame
Which of yourselves is truly gone?
And checked out so long
Unhinged unwound
Come help me on
To let lie what's done
In some great beyond
You're still there still as you were
At the end of the line
It's as if there's no time at all
Nothing to left to win
Every pleasure burned to the wick
Content to be alone
A quiet picture drawn each day before it ends
To remind me once again
Why I'm even here
Which of yourselves is truly gone?
Checked out so long
Unhinged unwound
Come help me on
To let lie what's done
In some great beyond
You're still there still as you were
I know I'm afraid, I know I'm afraid,
I'm drunk and I'm tired,
And the city I walk in, the city I walk in,
It feels like it swallows,
With my hand in my pocket,
I feel like a shadow, I feel like a shadow.
Though I'm afraid,
Afraid that I have made mistakes.
Now there's nothing here for me.
The things you once told me,
The thoughts you once gave me,
Sound like the wind in my ears
That blows out the knots I've got in my long brown hair.
I feel like the shadows I don't even bother for anymore than that.
What did you whisper in my ear?
What did you tell me that I wanted to hear?
What was the answer you wanted me to find out?
There's no lies, the lies, the lies, the lies...
Brought back something,
A bit for you, a bit for everyone.
You and all your pieces,
You and all your pieces made me come,
And all that love you gave was strong enough to make me stay and now it will be alright.
I feel like the shadows I don't even bother for anymore than that.
I feel like the shadows I don't even bother for anymore than that.
What did you whisper in my ear?
What was the answer you wanted me to find out?
There's no lies, the lies, the lies, the lies...
I need another place
Will there be peace?
I need another world
This one's nearly gone
Still have too many dreams
Never seen the light
I need another world
A place where I can go
I'm gonna miss the sea
I'm gonna miss the snow
I'm gonna miss the bees
I'll miss the things that grow
I'm gonna miss the trees
I'm gonna miss the sound
I'll miss the animals
I'm gonna miss you all
I need another place
Will there be peace?
I need another world
This one's nearly gone
I'm gonna miss the birds
Singing all their songs
I'm gonna miss the wind
Been kissing me so long, oh
Another world
Another world
Another world
Another world
Baby, I know you hate me so
I gave you everything, why do you hate me so?
I don't feel sorry when you cry
I don't believe you when you lie
Because your eyes are always saying goodbye
Saying goodbye
Baby, you took my soul
I gave you everything, what did you give my soul?
I don't feel sorry when you cry
I don't believe you when you lie
Because your eyes are always saying goodbye
Saying goodbye
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
I don't feel sorry when you cry
I don't believe you when you lie
Because your eyes are always saying goodbye
Saying goodbye
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
The evil it spread like a fever ahead
It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?
Oh could I be the sky on the fourth of July?
"Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die"
Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like junior high
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now where am I? My fading supply
"Did you get enough love, my little dove
Why do you cry?
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles"
The hospital asked should the body be cast
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?
"Shall we look at the moon, my little loon
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light
Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die"
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
So goodnight my dear
Hope you're feeling well
Hope your're feeling very clear
In this song and rhyme
Thoughts of changes that
Keep ourselves intact
And yes
It's hard to fake but I'm faltering
In the steps I'm about to take
I am sure it's true
What is all for me is much the same to you
If all the statues in the world
Would turn to flesh with teeth of pearl
Would they be kind enough to comfort me
The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free
So we wait and see
How this backward chapter reads
In verse inadvertently
And it feels like fading light
But that's all that's left
Only what's left is right
If all the statues in the world
Would turn to flesh with teeth of pearl
Would they be kind enough to comfort me
The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free
Jumping from a balloon
A carried aloft by a parachute in June
Twisting round and round
Well I hope the ground is what you find
The setting sun is set in stone
And it remains for me alone
To carve my own and set it free
Silver birch against a Swedish sky
The singer in the band made me want to cry
We're all inside our own heads now
We are leaving new friends, leaving this town
And I wish you could be here with me
I would show you off like a trophy
The road it winds, it twists, it turns, oh my stomach burns
Once again I'll be the foolish one
Thinking a blink of these lashes would make you come
Don't you worry, don't get in a state
I don't believe in true love anyway
Oh, who's being pessimistic now?
I could document this as our first, as our last row
The more you look forlorn, the more to you I warm
I won't be seeing you for a long while
I hope it's not as long as these country miles
I feel lost
I feel lost
No, I won't be seeing you for a long while
I hope it's not as long as these country miles
I feel lost
I feel lost
Watching terrible TV, it kills all thought
Getting spacier than an astronaut
Making out with people I hardly know or like
I can't believe what I do late at night
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above
Only when we get to see the aerial view
Will the patterns show, we'll know what to do
I know the last page so well, I can't read the first
So I just don't start, it's getting worse
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I can't find my way in
I try again and again
I'm on the outside of love
Always under or above
I can't find my way in
I try again and again
I'm on the outside of love
Always under or above
Must be a different view
To be a me with a you
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
I'm standing at the gates
I see the beauty above
I wanna know what it's like
On the inside of love
Of course I'll be alright
I just had a bad night
I had a bad night
You were the only face I'd ever known
I was the light from the lamp on the floor
And only as bright as you wanted me to be
But, I am no gentleman, I can be a prick
And I do regret more than I admit
You have been followed
Back to the same place I sat with you drink for drink.
Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist
Everything we had, everything we had
Everything we had, everything we had
Is no longer there
It was the only place I'd ever known
Turned off the light on my way out the door
I will be watching wherever you go
Through the eyes of a fly on the wall
You have been followed
Back to the same place I sat with you drink for drink
Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist
Everything we had, everything we had
Everything we had, everything we had
Is no longer there, longer there
Well you saw for yourself, the way it played out
For you, I am blinded
For you, I am blinded, for you
I am no gentleman, I can be a prick
And I do regret more than I admit
You have been followed
Back to the same place I sat with you drink for drink
Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist, oh...
(You have been followed)
Everything we had
(You have been followed)
Everything we had
(You have been followed)
Everything we had
(You have been followed)
Everything we had
(You have been followed)
Everything we had
(You have been followed)
Everything we had
(You have been followed)
Everything we had...
I'll be with you wherever you go
Through the eyes of a fly on the wall
Treated you like a rusty blade
A throwaway from an open grave
Cut you loose from a chain gang and let you go
And on the day you said it's true
Some love holds, some gets used
Tried to tell you I never knew it could be so sweet
Who could ever be so cruel?
Blame the devil for the things you do
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
These wasted Blues
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
When the moon is a counterfeit
Better find the one that fits
Better find the one that lights the way for you
When the road is full of nails
Garbage pails and darkened jails
And their tongues are full of heartless tales that drain on you
Who would ever notice you?
You fade into a shaded room
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
These wasted blues
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Where did your long hair go?
Where is the girl I used to know?
How could you lose that happy glow?
Oh, Caroline, no
Who took that look away?
I remember how you used to say
You'd never change, but that's not true
Oh, Caroline, you
Break my heart
I want to go and cry
It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
Oh, Caroline, why
Could I ever find in you again
Things that made me love you so much then?
Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone?
Oh, Caroline, no
Brenda's (Brenda)
Got a (Got a)
Baby
(Say it one more time, baby)
Brenda's
Got a (Baby)
Baby
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family)
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now, Brenda really never knew her moms, and her dad
Was a junky, went in debt into his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought-my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out, and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old, guess she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester who's sexin' her crazy
And yet in all, she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of 'em are together,
Whatever, he left her, and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor, and didn't know so
She didn't know what to throw away, and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up, and threw him in a trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heep, ballin'
Mama can't help him, but it hurts to hear him callin'
Brenda wants to run away, Mama say
You making me lose pay, a social worker's here everyday
Now, Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitters, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack, but ended up gettin' robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as her way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby
Baby
Don't you know she's got a (don't you know)
Don't you know she's got a (don't you know)
Don't you know she's got a babe (baby)
(She's havin' a baby)
Don't you know she's got a (yes, she is)
Don't you know she's got a (yes, she is)
Don't you know she's got a baby
(I know she's havin' a baby)
Don't you know she's got a (I know I know)
Don't you know she's got a (I know)
Don't you know she's got a babe (I know)
(I know know know know know know know)
Don't you know she's got a (know know know know know know know)
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a babe
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a babe
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a babe
Bad day, looking for a way home,
Looking for the great escape.
Gets in his car and drives away,
Far from all the things that we are.
Puts on a smile and breathes it in
And breathes it out, he says,
Bye bye bye to all of the noise.
Oh, he says, bye bye bye to all of the noise.
Doo doo doo doo doo no no
Doo doo doo doo doo no no no no
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo no no no
Hey child, things are looking down.
That's okay, you don't need to win anyways.
Don't be afraid, just eat up all the gray
And it will fade all away.
Don't let yourself fall down.
Doo doo doo doo doo no no
Doo doo doo doo doo no no no no
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo no no no
Bad day, looking for the great escape.
He says, bad day, looking for the great escape.
On a bad day, looking for the great escape,
The great escape.
Fill these spaces up with days
In my room
You can go, you can stay
But I can't sleep
I can't speak to you
I can't sleep
Now these years locked in my drawer
I'll open to see
Just to be sure
But I can't sleep
I can't speak to you
I can't sleep
And so I'm reaching out for the one
And so I've learned the meaning of the sun
And all this like a message comes
To shift my point of view
I'm watching through my own light
As it tints the shade of you
Hold my wine, hold it in
Nobody's lost
But nobody wins
And I can't sleep
I can't speak to you
I can't sleep
And so I'm reaching out for the one
And so I've learned the meaning of the sun
And all this like a message comes
To shift my point of view
I'm watching through my own light
As it tints the shade of you
I can't sleep
I can't speak to you...
For 27 years I've been trying to believe and confide in
Different people I've found.
Some of them got closer than others
Some wouldn't even bother and then you came around
I didn't really know what to call you, you didn't know me at all
But I was happy to explain.
I never really knew how to move you
So I tried to intrude through the little holes in your veins
And I saw you
But that's not an invitation
That's all I get
If this is communication
I disconnect 
I've seen you, I know you
But I don't know
How to connect, so I disconnect
You always seem to know where to find me and I'm still here behind you
In the corner of your eye.
I'll never really learn how to love you
But I know that I love you through the hole in the sky.
Where I see you 
And that's not an invitation
That's all I get
If this is communication
I disconnect 
I've seen you, I know you
But I don't know
How to connect, so I disconnect
Well this is an invitation
It's not a threat
If you want communication
That's what you get
I'm talking and talking
But I don't know
How to connect 
And I hold a record for being patient
With your kind of hesitation
I need you, you want me
But I don't know
How to connect, so I disconnect
I disconnect.
I guess it's funnier from where your standing
'Cause from over here I miss the joke
Clear the way for my crash landing
I've done it again, another number for your notes
I'd be smiling if I wasn't so desperate
I'd be patient if I had the time
I could stop and answer all of your questions
As soon as I find out how I can move from the back of a line
I'll be your clown behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh 'cause it's funny, I would too if I saw me
I'll be your clown on your favorite channel
My life's a circus, circus round in circles, selling out tonight
I'd be less angry if it was my decision
And the money was just rolling in
If I had more than my ambition, I'll have time for please
I'll have time for 'thank you's as soon as I win
I'll be your clown behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh 'cause it's funny, I would too if I saw me
I'll be your clown on your favorite channel
My life's a circus, circus round in circles, selling out tonight
From a distance my choice is simple
From a distance I can entertain
So you can see me, I put make-up on my face
But there's no way you can feel it from so far away, yeah
I'll be your clown behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh 'cause it's funny, I would too if I saw me
I'll be your clown on your favorite channel
My life's a circus, circus round in circles, I'm selling out tonight
Every chance
Every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
I was always looking
Left and right
Always crashing in the same car
Jasmine, I saw you peeping
As I put my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to ninety-four
But I'm always crashing in the same car
I will lay me down
In a bunker underground
I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants, sitting ducks
I will rise up
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes
You'd better crawl on your knees
The next time you say that you love me
Fall on your knees, 'cause this time I won't be so kind
Can't you see that this is life and life is killing me?
Is it yours?
Or is it mine?
Our sky fell down tonight
To wash away our pain
Tell me
Over and over and over and over and over again
It never was the time for us
It never was the time to let me in
Show me
Over and over and over and over and over again
It never was the time for us
It never was the time to let me in
You better see how evil you can be
When you see my evil smile
It's the one that you'll remember
When I'm not so kind
Can't you see that this is death
And death is saving me?
I say burn all of your bridges
While you still have control of the flame
I know it's hard, but you...
Tell me
Over and over and over and over and over again
It never was the time for us
It never was the time to let me in
Show me
Over and over and over and over and over again
It never was the time for us
It never was the time to let me in
Hardened to the point
So hard and to the point
Tell me
Over and over and over and over and over again
(Hardened) It never was the time for us
(To the point) It never was the time to let me in
Show me
Over and over and over and over and over again
(So hard and) It never was the time for us
(To the point) It never was the time to let me in
Tell me
Over and over and over and over and over again.
It never was the time for us
It never was the time to let me in
Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walkin' away
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes, tonight I wanna cry
Would it help if I turned a sad song on?
"All By Myself" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way
'Cause I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes, tonight I wanna cry
Well I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with this pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes, tonight I wanna cry
There's a sense of longing in me
As I read Rosemary's letter
Her writing's honest
Can't forget the years she's
Lost
In isolation
She talks about her love
And as I read
"I'll die alone"
I know she's aching
There's a certain detail seen here
The pen must have slipped to the side
And left a stain
Next to his name
She
Knows he's gone
And isolation
Is all that would remain
"The wound in me
Is pouring out to rest
On a lover's shore"
You. You were a friend. 
You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night. 
You see, it was my fault. Of course it was mine. 
I'm too hard at work. 
Have you ever heard of anything so absurd ever in your life? 
I'm sorry for wasting your time. 
Who am I to say this situation isn't great? 
When it's my job to make the most of it 
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me. 
Not that easy. 
Hey. What's that you say? 
You're not blaming me for anything. 
Well, that's great, but I don't break that easy. 
Does it fade away? 
So, that's why I'm ... I'm apologizing now 
For telling you I thought that we could make it 
I just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed. 
See who am I to say this situation isn't great? 
It is my time to make the most of it 
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me. 
Not that easy, no. 
No, no no. 
If all along the fault is up for grabs, 
Why can't she have it? 
If it's for sale, what is your offer? 
I will sell it for no less than what I bought it for. 
Pay no more than absolutely zero. 
Well, neither one of us deserves the blame, 
Because opportunities moved us away. 
It's not an easy thing to learn to play 
A game that's made for two--that's you and me.
The rules remain a mystery. 
See how it's easy? 
So, who am I to say this situation isn't great? 
When it's our time to make the most of it, 
How could we ever know that this would happen to me? 
Not that easy, no. 
No ... 
When all along the fault is up for grabs, and there you have it. 
Well, it's for sale--go make your offer. 
Will I sell it for no less than what I bought it for me?
Pay no more than absolutely zero? 
(Love, love)

These things can be scary, not always what you want

I'll phone you first I guess, I hope I see you soon
I never got your name, I assume you're thirty-three
Your voice, it sounded kind, I hope that you like me
When you see my face, I hope that you don't laugh
I'm not a film star beauty, I'll send a photograph
I hope that you don't laugh
Note to single M: Why did you not show up?
I waited for an hour, I finally gave up
I thought once that I saw you, I thought that you saw me
I guess we'll never meet now, it wasn't meant to be
It wasn't meant to be
I was sure you saw me, but it wasn't meant to be

I saw you this morning
You were moving so fast
Can't seem to loosen my grip
On the past
And I miss you so much
There's no one in sight
And we're still making love
In my secret life
I smile when I'm angry
I cheat and I lie
I do what I have to do
To get by
But I know what is wrong
And I know what is right
And I'd die for the truth
In my secret life
Hold on, hold on, my brother
My sister, hold on tight
I finally got my orders
I'll be marching through the morning
Marching through the night
Moving cross the borders
Of my secret life
Looked through the paper
Makes you want to cry
Nobody cares if the people
Live or die
And the dealer wants you thinking
That it's either black or white
Thank God it's not that simple
In my secret life
I bite my lip
I buy what I'm told
From the latest hit
To the wisdom of old
But I'm always alone
And my heart is like ice
And it's crowded and cold
In my secret life
Breathe it in and breathe it out
And pass it on, it's almost out
We're so creative, so much more
We're high above but on the floor
It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
If you don't have it you're on the other side
The deeper you stick it in your vein
The deeper the thoughts, there's no more pain
I'm in heaven, I'm a god
I'm everywhere, I feel so high
It's not an habit, it's cool, I feel alive
If you don't have it you're on the other side
I'm not an addict, maybe that's a lie
It's over now, I'm cold, alone
I'm just a person on my own
Nothing means a thing to me
Oh, nothing means a thing to me
It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
If you don't have it you're on the other side
I'm not an addict, maybe that's a lie
Free me, leave me
Watch me as I'm going down
Free me, see me
Look at me, I'm falling and I'm falling
It is not a habit, it is cool I feel alive, I feel
It is not a habit, it is cool I feel alive
It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
If you don't have it you're on the other side
I'm not an addict, maybe that's a lie
I'm not an addict
I'm not an addict
I'm not an addict
If I had to I would put myself right beside you
So let me ask, would you like that, would you like that?
And I don't mind if you say this love is the last time
So now I'll ask, do you like that, do you like that?
No
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place
In the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be
Try to find out what makes you tick as I lie down
Sore and sick, do you like that, do you like that?
There's a fine line between love and hate and I don't mind
Just let me say that I like that, I like that
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place
In the diary of Jane
As I burn another page
As I look the other way
I still try to find my place
In the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be
Desperate, I will crawl, waiting for so long
No love, there is no love
Die for anyone; what have I become?
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place
In the diary of Jane
As I burn another page
As I look the other way
I still try to find my place
In the diary of Jane
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around a faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less
I think I want to change my attitude 
I think I want to change my oxygen
I think I want to change my air, my atmosphere
I wanna be strong
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less
I think I need to change my attitude 
I think I want to change my oxygen
I think I want to change my air, my atmosphere
I wanna be strong
Bigger, and better
Bigger, and better
Bigger, and better
Bigger, and better
Bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go
I opened my eyes
While you were kissing me once more than once
And you looked as sincere as a dog
Just as sincere as a dog does,
When it's the food on your lips with which it's in love
I bet you could never tell
That I knew you didn't know me that well
It is my fault you see
You never learned that much from me
Oh you silly stupid pastime of mine
You were always good for a rhyme
And from the first, to the last time, the signs
Said 'Stop' - but we went on whole-hearted
It ended bad, but I love what we started
They said 'Stop' - but we went on whole-hearted
It ended bad, but I love what we started
I took off my glasses
While you were yelling at me once more than once
So as not to see you see me react
Should've put 'em, should've put 'em on again
So I could see you see me sincerely yelling back
I bet your fortressed face
Belied your fort of lace
It is by the grace of me
You never learned what I could see
Oh you silly stupid pastime of mine
You were always good for a rhyme
And from the first to all the last times, all the signs
Said 'Stop' - but we went on whole-hearted
It ended bad, but I love what we started
They said 'Stop' - but we went on whole-hearted
It ended bad, but I love what we started
My head is lead, I don't ever want to go to bed
Your hair is on fire
You snuff the blaze, turn to vapor then you float away
We got into a bad fight
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
My eyes are lungs, I'm a prophet and I speak in tongues
I know how you'll die
Your sister groans, 'oh, usurper to the holy throne'
To me she's just a dead spy
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
I don't know what you feel like
Ambushed on the road, stole your gold
You're a rose and you're laughing now
Everything that I owned starts to pile up
Like bones make the walls of a prison
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
I don't ever want to go to bed
Stay up for the fight
The champ goes down like a clown in the second round
I wish we'd had a better goodbye
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
They say that Richard Cory owns one-half of this whole town
With political connections to spread his wealth around
Born into society, a banker's only child
He had everything a man could want, power, grace and style
But I work in his factory
And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be
Oh, I wish that I could be
Oh, I wish that I could be Richard Cory
The papers print his pictures almost everywhere he goes
Richard Cory at the opera, Richard Cory at a show
And the rumours of his parties and the orgies on his yacht
Oh, he surely must be happy with everything he's got
But I work in his factory
And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be
Oh, I wish that I could be
Oh, I wish that I could be Richard Cory
He freely gave to charity, he had the common touch
And they were grateful for his patronage and they thanked him very much
So my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read
"Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head."
But I work in his factory
And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be
Oh, I wish that I could be
Oh, I wish that I could be Richard Cory
There's a song that's inside of my soul
It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again
I'm awake in the infinite cold
But You sing to me over and over and over again
So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours
I pray to be only Yours
I know now You're my only hope
Sing to me of the song of the stars
Of Your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again
When You feel like my dreams are so far
Sing to me of the plans that You have for me over again
And I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours
I pray to be only Yours
I know now You're my only hope
I give You my apathy
I'm giving You all of me
I want Your symphony
Singing in all that I am
At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back
And I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours
I pray to be only Yours
I pray to be only Yours
I know now You're my only hope
Here's the army that you mowed to the ground
And the bodies you left lying around
Talking it out the last hour
I'm through trying now, it's a big relief
I'll be staying down where no one else gonna give me grief
Mess me around
Just make it over
Your opinion was the law of the land
A single thing that I could always understand
I lived it out from hour to hour
The only thing that never really changed
You ran me all around
And dragged me down at the end of the day
Don't keep me around
Just make it over
I've been thinking of the things that I missed
Situations that I passed up for this
One-way love I took for ours
I'm through trying now, it's a big relief
I'll be staying down
I wasn't good at being a thief
More like a clown
Make it over
It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white, going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in her shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide 
She put her veil down trying to hide the tears 
Oh she just couldn't believe it 
She heard the trumpets from the military band 
And the flowers fell out of her hand
Baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now, 
This can't be happening to me 
This is just a dream
The preacher man said "let's bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul and heal this hurt"
Then the congregation all stood up and sang 
The saddest song, that she ever heard 
And then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him 
Oh and what could've been 
And then the guns rang one last shot 
And it felt like a bullet in her heart
Baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now, 
This can't be happening to me 
This is just a dream
Oh baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know,
Oh I'll never know
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now, 
This can't be happening to me 
This is just a dream
Oh this is just a dream
This is just a dream
Yeah yeah
This year's love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
And I've been waiting on my own too long
But when you hold me like you do
It feels so right
I start to forget
How my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on
Turning circles and time again
It cuts like a knife oh now
If you love me got to know for sure
'Cause it takes something more this time
Than sweet, sweet lies, oh now
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul
And when you kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet
This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last
So who's to worry?
If our hearts get torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Don't you know this life goes on?
And won't you kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing 'ain't this life so sweet'
This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last
This year's love had better last
I don't feel the joy
I don't feel the pain
You were just a toy
I am just insane
Walking on my own
Leaving you behind
You were crying out
That you need to speak your mind
Oh
So alone in love
So alone in love
I'm going to haunt you every day
(Going to haunt you)
Haunt you every day
(Every day)
I am gonna kill
When I need a thrill
Eating at the heart
Till I've had my fill
When will stupid learn
Fire's gonna burn
Think of consequence
Then you move when it's your turn
Oh
So alone in love
So alone in love
I'm going to haunt you every day
(Going to haunt you)
Haunt you every day
(Every day)
Walking on my own
Leaving you behind
You were crying out
That you need to speak your mind
Oh
So alone in love,
So alone in love
(I'm)
I'm going to haunt you every day
(Going to haunt you)
Haunt you every day
(Every day, I'm)
Haunt you every day
(Going to haunt you)
Haunt you every day
(Every day)
Oh, oh
I just remembered that time at the market
Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rolled down aisle five
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave
Can't remember what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve, say "she's gonna be good for you"
They throw me high fives
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty
Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say, hey
Say, hey
She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
Grey sweatpants
No makeup
So perfect
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
I'm not impressed
I want you back
I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naïve
I'm just out to find
The better part of me
I'm more than a bird
I'm more than a plane
More than some pretty face beside a train
And it's not easy to be me
I wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see
It may sound absurd
But don't be naïve
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed
But won't you concede
Even heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me
Up, up and away, away from me
Well it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything
I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naïve
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees
I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Digging for Kryptonite on this one-way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Looking for special things inside of me, inside of me
Inside of me, yeah inside of me, inside of me
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
I'm only a man looking for a dream
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
And it's not easy
It's not easy to be me
The absence of God will bring you comfort, baby
And plannings for the poor 
So let's pretend that we're rich
And I'm not my body 
For how I choose to destroy it
Folk singers sing songs for the working, baby
We're just recreation for all those doctors and lawyers
There's no relief for the bleeding heart
'Cause they'll be losing bodies tonight
And Rob says
You love love love, then you die
I've watched him while sleeping and seen him cry
With closed eyes
And you're not happy, but you're funny
And I'm tripping over my joy
I just keep on getting up again
We could be daytime drunks if we wanted
We'd never get anything done that way, baby
And we'd still be ruled by our dueling perspectives
And I'm not my perspective
Or the lies I'll tell you every time
And Morgan says
Maybe love won't let you down
All of your failures are training grounds
And just as your back's turned, you'll be surprised
She says
As your solitude subsides
And like, I'll teach you how to swim
If you turn the bad in me into good again
And I say there's trouble when everything is fine
The need to destroy things creeps up on me every time
And just as love's silhouette appears 
I close my eyes and disappear tonight
And something's gotta change
'Cause our love's the slowest-moving train
Poke at my iris
Why can't I cry about this?
Maybe there is something that you know that I don't
We adopt brand new language
Communicate through pursed lips
And you try not to put on any sexy clothes or graces
I might never catch a mouse 
And present it in my mouth
To make you feel you're with someone who deserves to be with you
But there's one thing we've got going
And it's the only thing worth knowing
It's got lots to do with magnets and the pull of the moon
Why won't our love keel over
As it chokes on a bone?
And we can mourn its passing and then bury it in snow
Or should we kick its cunt in
And watch as it dies from bleeding?
If you don't want to be with me just say and I will go
Well we can change our partners 
This is a progressive dance but
Remember it was me who dragged you up to the sweaty floor
Well this has been a reel
I've got shin-splints and a stitch from we
But like a drunken night it's the best bits that are coloured in
You should look through some old photos
I adored you in every one of those
If someone took a picture of us now they'd need to be told
That we had ever clung and tied
A navy knot with arms at night
I'd say she was his sister but she doesn't have his nose
And now we're unrelated
And rid of all the shit we hated
But I hate when I feel like this and I never hated you
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Scratching at the surface now
And I'm trying hard to work it out
And so much has gone misunderstood
And this mystery only leads to doubt
And I didn't understand
When you reached down to take my hand
And if you have something to say
You'd better say it now
'Cause this is what you've waited for
Your chance to even up the score
And as these shadows fall on me now
I will somehow
'Cause I'm picking up the message, Lord
And I'm closer than I've ever been before
So if you have something to say
Say it to me now
Just say it to me now
O, Katrina! Why you gotta be mean?
You saw a highway down in New Orleans
I can't believe what I saw on the TV screen
O, Katrina! Why can't you be serene?
O, Katrina! (O, Katrina!)
O, Katrina! (O, Katrina!)
O, Katrina! (O, Katrina!)
Why you gotta be mean
(O, Katrina!)
Why you gotta be...
O, Katrina! Why you gotta be mean?
You saw a highway down in New Orleans
I can't believe what I saw on the TV screen
O, Katrina! Why can't you be serene?
O, Katrina! (O, Katrina!)
O, Katrina! (O, Katrina!)
O, Katrina! (O, Katrina!)
Why you gotta be mean
(O, Katrina!)
Why you gotta be...
O, Katrina! (O, Katrina!)
O, Katrina! (O, Katrina!)
O, Katrina! (O, Katrina!)
O, Katrina! (O, Katrina!)
O, Katrina! (O, Katrina!)
Why you gotta be mean now?
(O, Katrina!)
Why you gotta be mean?
(O, Katrina!)
Why you gotta be mean now?
(O, Katrina!)
Oh, Katrina, no!
Oh, Katrina, no!
Why you got to be mean now?
Why you got to be mean?
Oh, why you got to be mean now?
She loves her mama's lemonade
Hates the sound that goodbyes make
She prays one day she'll find someone to need her
She swears that there's no difference
Between the lies and compliments
It's all the same if everybody leaves her
And every magazine tells her she's not good enough
The pictures that she sees make her cry
She would change everything, everything
Just ask her
Caught in the in-between a beautiful disaster
She just needs someone to take her home
She's given boys what they want
Tries to act so nonchalant
Afraid they'll see that she's lost her direction
She never stays the same for long
Assuming that she'll get it wrong
Perfect only in her imperfection
She's not a drama queen
She doesn't want to feel this way
Only seventeen, but tired
She would change everything for happy ever after
Caught in the in-between, a beautiful disaster
She just needs someone to take her home
She's just the way she is but no one's told her that's okay
She would change everything, everything
Just ask her
Caught in the in-between, a beautiful disaster
She would change everything, for happy ever after
Caught in the in-between, a beautiful disaster
She just needs someone to take her home
She just needs someone to take her home
In the middle of the summer
I'm not sleeping
Cold wind
Blowing
In the middle of the night they
Try to find me
But I'm still
Driving
If you're going to San Francisco
Lay some flowers
On the
Gravestone
There's music on a station
And I'm just listening
To cold wind
Whistling
And if they ever find me
Tell the papers
Cold wind
Cold wind
Cold
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Hey hey hey
Something ain't right
Something ain't right
And if they ever find me
Tell the papers
Cold wind
Cold wind
Cold cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
They painted up your secrets
With the lies they told to you
And the least they ever gave you
Was the most you ever knew
And I wonder where these dreams go
When the world gets in your way
What's the point in all this screaming?
No one's listening anyway
Your voice is small and fading
And you're hiding here alone
And your mother loves your father
'Cause she's got nowhere to go
And she wonders where these dreams go
'Cause the world got in her way
What's the point in ever trying?
Nothing's changing anyway
They press their lips against you
And you love the lies they say
And I tried so hard to reach you
But you're falling anyway
And you know I see right through you
'Cause the world gets in your way
What's the point in all this screaming?
You're not listening anyway
Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over, oh
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had and what was left after that, too, oh
Happiness a-hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height by someone who should've known better than that
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
(The dog days are over)
(The dog days are done)
Here they come
(The horses are coming)
(So you better run)
Here they come
(The dog days are over)
(The dog days are done)
Here they come
(The horses are coming)
(So you better run)
We broke
Everything that was right
We both enjoyed a good fight
And we solved
All the holes we had to breathe
To make the other one leave
And I loved the way you looked at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone
When we were alone
And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you
And we stole
Every moment we had to make the other one feel bad
And we hoped that we could be what we knew
We'd never turn out to be real
And I loved the way you looked at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone
When we were alone
And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live right
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live right
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live right
And if we turn back time
Could we learn
And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you
Like I used to
Amphetamine Annie-Dog
Has her leash and a face
Her velvet spleen, her shackle spine
Her diamond curse, it comes with mine
A vessel she, for violent I
Confession arms awake
Mine, mine, you were always mine
Possessed by my taste
And below the angel dog
Combs her hair and sings her psalms
The bombs go off, she doesn't notice
It all goes wrong, she sets things tragic
She is Venus, she is Mars
She's electric, and the struggle of
Upon my face we leave no trace
But in her stomach mercury aged
She holds the blood, she carves the knives
She digs the wives in our babies
Amphetamine Annie-Dog
Pulls her trash and her stories
From place to place, and bed to bed
Gives of herself and the magnet head
Another floor, another ceiling
Counting stairs with double meanings
Is it wrong to swallow whole?
To disappear in her?
To give her the priceless peace
Of giving up control?
We tumble out into the streets
And Annie-Dog, she drags her leash
Pretty face, ugly mouth
Bitter bred and so released
And by the no, and in the yes
Annie goes if you couldn't guess
A simple man, a sycophant
Her elephant with the laughing call
She wants clean sheets, and fresh flowers
And dental shots, and the Hong Kong glue
Amphetamine Annie-Dog
Has her leash and a face
I have nothing left to give
I have found the perfect end
You remain to make it hurt
Disappear into the dirt
Carry me to heaven's arms
Light the way and let me go
Take the time to take my breath
I will end where I began...
And I will find the enemy within
'Cause I can feel it crawl beneath my skin...
Dear Agony
Just let go of me
Suffer slowly
Is this the way it's got to be?
Dear Agony...
Suddenly,
The lights go out
Let forever
Drag me down
I will fight for one last breath
I will fight until the end...
And I will find the enemy within
'Cause I can feel it crawl beneath my skin...
Dear Agony
Just let go of me
Suffer slowly
Is this the way it's got to be?
Don't bury me
Faceless enemy
I'm so sorry
Is this the way it's gotta be?
Dear Agony...
Leave me alone
God, let me go
I'm blue and cold
Black sky will burn
Love, pull me down
Hate, lift me up
Just turn around
There's nothing left...
Somewhere far beyond this world,
I feel nothing anymore...
Dear Agony
Just let go of me
Suffer slowly
Is this the way it's got to be?
Don't bury me
Faceless enemy
I'm so sorry
Is this the way it's gotta be?
Dear Agony...
I feel nothing anymore...
Farewell my friends
Farewell my dear ones
If I was rude
Forgive my weakness
Goodbye my friends
Goodbye to evening parties
Remember me
In the spring
To work for your bread
Soon you must leave
Remember your families
And look for your children
I don't need much
And the older I become
I realize
My friendships
Will carry me over
On a course of distance
You're a cause of sorrow
Friends that last
Will dance
With me
I don't need words
This, I need.
So far away from where you are
These miles have torn us worlds apart
And I miss you, yeah I miss you
So far away from where you are
I'm standing underneath the stars
And I wish you were here
I miss the years that were erased
I miss the way the sunshine would light up your face
I miss all the little things
I never thought that they'd mean everything to me
Yeah I miss you
And I wish you were here
I feel the beating of your heart
I see the shadows of your face
Just know that wherever you are
Yeah, I miss you
And I wish you were here
I miss the years that were erased
I miss the way the sunshine would light up your face
I miss all the little things
I never thought that they'd mean everything to me
Yeah I miss you
And I wish you were here
So far away from where you are
These miles have torn us worlds apart
And I miss you, yeah I miss you
And I wish you were here
I'm glad you came around today
I sure need a good companion
I'm losing it but you're the same
Without you I move at random
Abusing 'cause you're a friend
And there's no Jesus here to explain
And take me higher
Come take me higher
Come take me high above our time
Take me higher
Oh take me higher
Come take me high above our time
We'll make it out of here?oh yeah
You justify, you're not afraid
And I won't feel like this forever
You wait with me, because you know
There's so much more than this before we go
To take us higher
Come take us higher
Come take us high above our time
Take us higher
Oh take us higher
Come take us high above our time
We'll make it out of here
Come take us out of here
Take us anywhere?oh yeah
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away, so far away
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feelin', knowin' you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day
I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven
Darlin' I never showed you (no, no, no)
Assumed you'd always be there (always be there)
And I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (but I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day
Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Yeah, and Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
(I know you're looking down from heaven)
And I know eventually we'll be together (together we will)
One sweet day
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
So our open wounds will bleed
Until our veins run dry
Now we have to take this thorn
And tear it from our side
Agitated at the fault line
Still agreed to disagree
You're connected to the heart
But tonight we'll set you free
So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again
Even now as I write this down
All pretensions disappear
Now our impulses will bite
At the ankles of our fear
So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again
Words are spoken
Words are broken down
So let's make this night
Be our best mistake
So let's take the time
To wipe the blood away
Now our hands are tied
And the world is caving in
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again
Now our hands are tied
And the problems lie within
Words are spoken
Words are broken down
Broken down
Broken down
Son, you've got a way to fall
They'll tell you where to go
But they won't know
Son, you'd better take it all
They'll tell you what they know
But they won't show
Oh
I've got something in my throat
I need to be alone
While I suffer
Son, you've got a way to kill
They're picking on you still
But they don't know
Son, you'd better wait to shine
They'll tell you what is yours
But they'll take mine
Oh (Left my sweet soul)
I've got something in my throat (Beneath the bedclothes)
I need to be alone (I'm not coming down)
While I suffer
Oh (Walls have ears)
There's a hole inside my boat (But no one hears)
I need to stay afloat (When nobody's around)
For the summer...
Son, you'd better wait to fall
They'll tell you where to go
But they won't know
There's a world outside
And I know, 'cause I've heard talk
In my sweetest dream
I would go out for a walk
But I don't think I'm ready yet
Not feelin' up to it now
Just not that steady yet
And I don't need you telling me how
There's some happiness
If my stone face cracks again
Maybe some time sooner or later
But I don't think I'm ready yet
I'm not feelin' up to it now
Just not that steady yet
And I don't need you telling me how
So if I leave my room
Don't you tell me to lighten up
Maybe some time sooner or later
But I don't think I'm ready yet
Not feelin' up to it now
Just not that steady yet
I don't need you telling me how
I don't need you telling me how
I don't need you telling me how
I don't need you telling me how
I don't need you telling me how
I don't need you telling me how
I don't need you telling me how
I don't, don't need you telling me how
Baby, we can talk all night
But that ain't getting us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm crying icicles instead of tears
And all I can do is keep on telling you
I want you
I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box
I can't lie
I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
No matter how I try
I'll never be able to give you something
Something that I just haven't got
Well, there's only one girl that I will ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back, ooo I know
Well, I remember how she left me on a stormy night
Ah she kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away
And she kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
I want you
I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
I want you
Oh I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Baby, we can talk all night
But that ain't getting us nowhere
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
Those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left
Ah, but you got away, didn't you babe?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said: "Well never mind
We are ugly but we have the music"
And then you got away, didn't you babe?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that often
I got the message long before you said you knew
There was no chance of us at all
With no velocity, an empty headed heart and far too long
I spent two years alone with you
Just when I thought I had forgotten
You came back soft without a sound
You said we were an accident
With accidents you'll never know, what could have been
So we were an accident
You'll always be my favorite one
You hit the road and left me an ocean
I can't swim in the silence of your skin, skin, please let me in
Inside the times we never had it right 
Inside two years alone with you
You said we were an accident
With accidents you'll never know, what could have been
So we were an accident
You'll always be my favorite one
We could have been
We could have been
Instead of accidental running, always running
Again
Why can't you believe?
We could have been
We could have been...
Again
Long winded promises of future company
Up close the sound remains the same
Without the reign of terror over every momentary change
We are exactly as before
You hit the road and left me an ocean
I can't swim in the silence of your skin, skin, please let me in
Inside the time I have to forget you
There was no chance of us at all
Pace mine for you, hold my horses, patience
Hey man, tricks can't wait to hear my emotions
Every time the sun comes up I'm in trouble
Every time the sun comes up I'm in trouble
People say I'm a one-hit wonder
But what happens when I have two?
I washed your dishes
But I shit in your bathroom
Even when the sun comes up I'm in trouble
Even when the sun comes up I'm in trouble
We broke your glasses but covered our asses
Take time silently, feel real room, high five
When every time the sun comes up I'm in trouble
Every time the sun comes up I'm in trouble
Yeah, every time the sun comes up I'm in trouble
Imagine when
Every time the sun comes up I see double
Yes she is
Maybe something will change
Sorry, my headphones fell off
Whenever I run
Whenever I run to you, lost one
It's never done
Just hanging on
The past has let me be
Returning as if dream
Shattered as belief
If you have to go, don't say goodbye
If you have to go, don't you cry
If you have to go, I will get by
Someday I'll follow you and see you on the other side
But for the grace of love
I'd will the meaning of
Heaven from above
But for the grace of love
I'd will the meaning of
Heaven from above
Your picture out of time
Left aching in my mind
Shadows kept alive
If you have to go, don't say goodbye
If you have to go, don't you cry
If you have to go, I will get by
I will follow you and see you on the other side
But for the grace of love
Who'd will the meaning of
Heaven from above
But for the grace of love
Who'd will the meaning of
Heaven from above
Long horses, we are born
Creatures more than torn
Mourning our way home
Universe surrounds
When you're ready, it waits for us
To leave this earth, come on
They're calling your name out
I don't know
I could stay or leave
Either way
'Cause the comet can take us
All the way through
Goodbye
Same Heaven
New, new world
I'll be waving
Goodbye
Same Heaven
New, new world
I'll be waving
Goodbye
Return
To see everything looks the same
I don't know if the change made was grave
'Cause the craving remains the same
Goodbye
Same Heaven
New, new world
I'll be waving
Goodbye
Same Heaven
New, new world
I'll be waving, I'll be waving (goodbye)
I'll be waving, I'll be waving (goodbye)
I'll be waving, I'll be waving (goodbye)
I'll be waving, I'll be waving goodbye
My mummy's dead
I can't get it through my head
Though it's been so many years
My mummy's dead
I can't explain
So much pain
I could never show it
My mummy's dead
Long were the nights, when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine
You paint a blue sky, then go back and turn it to rain
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known
Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John
I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young 
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
When I loved you so
I should've known
You are an expert at Sorry!
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed
By me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad, empty town
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known
You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known
Oh grandmother 
How I miss you 
Under the earth 
Wish I was with you 
To Talk To You 
I found somebody 
Try to give myself to 
Many times 
I wanted to talk to you 
If I laid on the Earth 
Could you hear? 
Oh Grandmother 
I'm so lonely 
All my life 
If I laid on the earth 
Could you hear? 
If I lay 
Mary
No sleep today
Can't even rest when the sun's down
No time there's not enough
And nobody's watching you now
When we were children we played
Out in the streets just tempting fate
When we were children we'd say
That we don't know the meaning of
Fear, fear, fear
Fear, fear, fear
(We don't know the meaning of)
When we were children we played
Out in the streets just tempting fate
When we were children we'd say
That we don't know the meaning of
Fear, fear, fear
Fear, fear, fear
(We don't know the meaning of)
Wish I didn't know the meaning of
On a day like today
I looked at you and I
Saw something in the way
You stared into the sky 
I saw you were sick and tired
Of my wrong turns
If you only knew the way I feel
I'd really love to tell you 
But I could never seem to say
The things I needed to
On a day like today
No other words would do 
I saw you were sick and tired
Of my wrong turns
If you only knew the way I feel
I'd really love to tell you 
But I can never find the words to say
And I don't know why
I can't find the words to say
And I don't know why
Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough
In these last days
Her tears fell
On her pages found me well
On her words I don't know what
To do or say
Wading through
Warm canals and pools clear blue
Tuscarawas flows into
The Great Lake
Right in back
Where the highway met dead-end tracks
The ground is now cement and glass
So far away
Heal her soul
Carry her, my angel
Ohio
Green, green youth
What about the sweetness we knew?
What about what's good, what's true
From those days?
Can't count to
All the lovers I've burned through
So why do I still burn for you?
I can't say
Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough
In these last days
Heal her soul
Carry her, my angel
Ohio
Children blessed
Gather round the home she rests
So poor and cold in their Midwest
Moon and sun
Flashes bringing on
My open eyes to lightning storm
The touch of mist felt soft, felt warm
On my face
Graving dreams
A million miles ago, you seem
The star that I just don't see
Anymore
Words long gone
Lost on journeys we walked on
Lost are voices heard along
The way
Sorry for
Never going by your door
Never feeling love like that
Anymore
Heal her soul
Carry her, my angel
Ohio
Try as he might he's unable to speak
He grabs her by the hair, he strokes her on the cheek
The bed is unmade like everything is
Dark little heaven at the top of the stairs
Take me like that, ruin it all
Then build it again by the light in the hall
He drops to his knees, says please my love, please
I'll kill who you hate, take off that dress, you won't freeze
One more night, that was a good one
One more night, I dreamed it was a good one
One more, one more night, that was a good one
One more night, the end should be a good one
A good one
He starts with her back cause that's what he sees
When she's breaking his heart she still fucks like a tease
Release to the sky, look him straight in the eye
And tell him that now, that you wish he would die
You'll never touch him again so get what you can
Leaving him empty just because he's a man
So good when it ends, they'll never be friends
One more night, that's all they can spend
One more night, that was a good one
One more night, I dreamed it was a good one
One more, one more night, that was a good one
One more night, the end should be a good one
A good one
You're gonna walk on home
You're gonna walk alone
You're gonna see this through
Don't let 'em get to you
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Love is good and love is kind
Love is drunk and love is blind
Love is good and love is mine
Love is drunk all the time
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
You're gonna walk on home
You're gonna walk alone
You're gonna walk so far
You're gonna wonder who you are
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame
Shame
Shame
Love is good and love is kind
Love is good and love is blind
Love is good and love is mine
Love is good all the time
Hello, goodbye, you know you made us cry
Hello, goodbye, you know you made us cry
I keep floating down the river but the ocean never comes
Since the operation I heard you're breathing just for one
Now everything is imaginary, especially what you love
You left another message said it's done,
It's done
When I hear beautiful music it's always from another time
Old friends I never visit, I remember what they're like
Standing on a doorstep full of nervous butterflies
Waiting to be asked to come inside
Just come inside
But I keep going out
I can't sleep next to a stranger when I'm coming down
It's 8 a.m. my heart is beating too loud
Too loud
Don't be so amazing or I'll miss you too much
I felt something that I had never touched
Everything gets smaller now the further that I go
Towards the mouth and the reunion of the Known and the Unknown
Consider yourself lucky if you think of it as home
You can move mountains with your misery if you don't
If you don't
It comes to me in fragments, even those still split in two
Under the leaves of that old Lime Tree I stood examining the fruit
Some were ripe and some were rotten, I felt nauseous with the truth
There will never be a time more opportune
So I just won't be late
The window closes, shock rolls over in a tidal wave
And all the color drains out of the frame
So pleased with a daydream that now living is no good
I took off my shoes and walked into the woods
I felt lost and found with every step I took
Give me a reason to believe
That you're gone
I see your shadow so I know
They're all wrong
Moonlight on the soft brown earth
It leads me to where you lay
They took you away from me
But now I'm taking you home
I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death, our love goes on
Some say I'm crazy for my love
Oh my love 
But no bonds can hold me from your side
Oh my love 
They don't know you can't leave me
They don't hear you singing to me
I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death, our love goes on
And I can't love you any more than I do
I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death, our love goes on
And I can't love you any more than I do
People die, but real love is forever
Today's the day I realized that I could be loved
It echoed though the park last night, he wasn't our son
He belonged to everyone 
And this loss isn't good enough for sorrow or inspiration
It's such a loss for the good guys afraid of this life
That it just is, 'cause everybody dies 
This loss isn't good enough for sorrow or inspiration
It's such a loss for the good guys afraid of this life
That it just is, everybody 
This loss isn't good enough for sorrow or inspiration
It's such a loss for the good guys afraid of this life
That it just is, 'cause everybody dies
Blank page was all the rage
Never meant to say anything
In bed I was half dead
Tired of dreaming of rest
Got dressed drove the state line
Looking for you at the five and dime
Stop sign told me stay at home
Told me you were not alone
Blank page was all the rage
Never meant to hurt anyone
In bed I was half dead
Tired of dreaming of rest
You haven't changed
You're still the same
May you rise as you fall
You were easy you are forgotten
You are the ways of my mistakes
I catch the rainfall
Through the leaking roof
That you had left behind
You remind me
Of that leak in my soul
The rain falls
My friends call
Leaking rain on the phone
Take a day plant some trees
May they shade you from me
May your children play beneath
Blank page was all the rage
Never meant to say anything
In bed I was half dead
Tired of dreaming of rest
Got dressed drove the state line
Looking for you at the five and dime
But there I was picking pieces up
You are a ghost
Of my indecision
No more little girl
Close my eyes
And move to the back of my mind
The worries are washed out to sea
See the changes, people's faces blurred out
Like sunspots or raindrops
Now all those feelings,
Those yesterday's feelings
Will all be lost in time
But today
I've wasted away
For today is on my mind
Left the only worries I had in my hands
Away from the light in my eyes
Holding tight and try not to hide how I feel
'Cause feelings mean nothing
Now all those feelings,
Those yesterday's feelings
Will all be lost in time
But today
I've wasted away
For today is on my mind
Yeah, today is on my mind
I can't get a worry
I'm feeling so lonely
Breaking apart all this love in my heart
Close my eyes
And move to the back of my mind
Where feelings mean nothing
Now all those feelings
Those yesterday's feelings
Will all be lost in time
(All be lost in time)
But today
I've wasted away
For today is on my mind
For today is on my mind
Yeah, today is on my mind
I can't get a worry
I'm feeling so lonely
Breaking apart all this love in my heart
Above 
The mountain 
The mountain 
An eagle is flying 
High above the mountain 
An eagle comes down 
To the soldier who faltered 
The soldier on the ground 
By the mountain 
I feel nothing 
For in my own heart 
Every tree is broken 
The first tree will not blossom 
The second will not grow 
And the third is almost fallen 
Since you betrayed me so 
Since you.
Lover, there will be another one
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come
Today
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over
Nestled in your wings, my little one
This special morning brings another sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come
Today
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over
Instrumental
How long have I been in this storm?
So overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form
Water's getting harder to tread
With these waves crashing over my head
If I could just see you
Everything would be all right
If I'd see you
This darkness will turn to light
And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
I know everything will be all right
I know everything is all right
I know you didn't bring me out here to drown
So why am I ten feet under and upside down?
Barely surviving has become my purpose
'Cause I'm so used to living underneath the surface
If I could just see you
Everything would be all right
If I'd see you
This darkness will turn to light
And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
I know everything will be all right
And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
I know everything will be all right
I know everything is all right
Everything's all right
Everything's all right
Despondent, distracted,
You're vicious and romantic;
These are a few of my favorite things.
All of those flavors and
This is what you choose:
Past the blues, past the blues,
And on to something new,
Something real, make it timeless,
An act of God and nothing less will be accepted.
So if you're calling me out,
Then count me out.
Yeah, we're stubborn and melodramatic,
A real class act.
You see, I know a few of your favorite things.
Five in the morning it all comes out pouring,
Love, out the same way in.
Something real, make it timeless,
An act of God and nothing less will be accepted.
Now if you're calling me out,
Then count me out.
Something real, make it timeless,
An act of God and nothing less will be accepted.
I said real, make it timeless,
An act of God and nothing less will be accepted.
Now if you're calling me out,
Then count me out.
Sunday is gloomy,
My hours are slumberless,
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will
Never awaken you
Not where the black coach
Of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of
Ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday.
Gloomy is Sunday
With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have
Decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles
And prayers that are sad,
I know, let them not weep,
Let then know
That I'm glad to go
Death is no dream,
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my
Soul I'll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday
Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of
My heart
Dear
Darling I hope that my dream
Never haunted you
My heart is telling you
How much I wanted you
Gloomy Sunday.
Ev'ry night I just wanna go out
Get out of my head
Ev'ry day I don't wanna get up
Get out of my bed
Ev'ry night I want to play out
And ev'ry day I wanna do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
But tonight I just wanna stay in
And be with you-ooh
And be with you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ev'ry day I lean on a lamp post
I'm wasting my time
Ev'ry night I lay on a pillow
I'm resting my mind
Ev'ry morning brings a new day
And ev'ry night that day is through
But tonight I just wanna stay in
And be with you
And be with you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, believe me, momma
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, momma
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all...
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to...
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel
In the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well
Time won't fly
It's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days
And nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
And I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again
Where I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Good night my love
Remember me as you fall to sleep
Fill your pockets with the dust and the memories
That rises from the shoes on my feet
I won't be back here though we may meet again
I know it's dark outside
Don't be afraid
Every time I ever cried from fear was just a mistake that I made
Wash yourself in your tears and build your church
On the strength of your faith
Please, listen to me
Don't let go
Don't let this desperate moonlight leave me
With your empty pillow
Promise me the sun will rise again
I too am tired now
Embracing thoughts of tonight's dreamless sleep
My head is empty
My toes are warm
I am safe from harm
What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?
I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely
And it hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
'Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away
I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion
Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper (deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)
I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need...
I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Everytime I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
That it be over, over
Inside I'm screaming,
Begging pleading no more
I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you
It hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause i
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, oh
I'm about to break
And I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, oh
I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from
I say...
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away
Only thing I need to do is walk away
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun...
I'm ready for my sun to...
I'm ready for my sun...
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Our love is dead but without limit
Like the surface of the moon
Or the land between here and the mountains
It is not these hiding places that have kept us innocent
But the way you taught me to just let it all go back
And so we've learn to be as faithless 
Stand behind bulletproof glass
Exchanging our affections through a drawer
And it was always horribly convenient and happening too fast
You should count your change before you're even out the door
Well, yes you should 
But please return, return
To the person that you were, and I will do the same
'Cause it's too hard to belong to someone who is gone
My compass spins, but wilderness remains
Once too often I've retreated into the depths of my despair
I built a barricade to block you on the road
But standing there with all of my possessions piled higher than a house
I felt closer to you than you ever would have known
So let's let these tiny acts of charity be common ground on which to build
A monument to commemorate our time
And though you say you've found another who will surely speed you on your way
Don't let the forest grow over that path you came there by
But you will, so
So hurry up and run to the one that you love
And blind him with your kindness
And he'll make war, oh, war, on who you were before
And claim all that has spoiled in your heart
Alright, now help me out boys
But now I tell myself I've mended under these patches of blue sky
There's still a few holes that let in a little rain
And so it's crying on my shingles
My floorboards moan under my feet
The refrigerator's whining so I've got reason to complain
But I'm not gonna bless you with such compliments
Some degrading song of praise 
Like the kind that converted you to me so long ago
Because the truth is that gossip's as good as gospel in this town
You can save face but you won't ever save your soul
And that's a fact so
So hurry up and run to the one that you love
And tie him up in your likeness
And he'll become, become, oh, the prisoner I was
And know all that has spoiled in your heart
He'll know it all
He'll know all that has spoiled in your heart
So hurry up and run to the one that you love
And blind him with your kindness
And he'll make war, oh, war, on who you were before
And claim all that has spoiled in your heart
Yeah, he'll claim all that has spoiled in your heart
So hurry up and run to the one that you love
And blind him with your kindness
And he'll make war, oh, war, on who you were before
And claim all that has spoiled in your heart
Yeah, he'll claim all that has spoiled
When the sun comes down
Will the rain wash away
All the hopes and the dreams
Into another day, another day
When the trees start to sway
And the wind makes them groan
I can tell that
You don't know
To all the fights I've conquered and beyond
The times have changed and I will now move over slowly
But through it all I still feel lost without you
Hard to find a new soul, as silence takes it's toll
(You sway)
When you are lost
(You sway)
When you don't know
(You sway)
That all you want is to find home
As the light pours in
Feel the volume of the sky
Mark your place in time with another question why
Tiny flickers in the night, always looking to be right
To all the fights I've conquered and beyond
The times have changed and I will now move over slowly
But through it all I still feel lost without you
Hard to find a new soul, as silence takes it's toll
(You sway)
When you are lost
(You sway)
When you don't know
(You sway)
That all you want is to find home
(You sway)
(You sway)
(You sway)
Here I am on the phone again and
Awkward silence is on the other end
I used to know the sound of a smile in your voice
But right now (but right now )
All I feel (all I feel)
Is the pain of the fighting starting up again
All the things we talk about
You know they stay on my mind, on my mind
All the things we laugh about
They'll bring us through it every time,
After time, after time
Don't say a word,
I know you feel the same
Just give me a sign
Say anything, say anything
Please don't walk away,
I know you wanna stay
If you just give me a sign
Say anything, say anything
Some say that time changes,
Best friends can become strangers
But I don't want that, no not for you
If you just stay with me we could make it through
So here we are again, the same old argument
Now I'm wondering if things will ever change, yeah
When will you laugh again
Laugh like you did back when
We'd make noise 'til 3 am,
And the neighbors would complain
All the things we talk about
You know they stay on my mind, on my mind
All the things we laugh about
They'll bring us through it every time,
After time, after time
Don't say a word,
I know you feel the same
Just give me a sign
Say anything, say anything
Please don't walk away,
I know you wanna stay
If you just give me a sign
Say anything, say anything
I'm fallin...
I'm fallin...
I'm fallin down
I'm fallin...
I'm fallin...
I'm fallin down
Down, down, down...
Don't say a word,
I know you feel the same
Just give me a sign
Say anything, say anything
Please don't walk away,
I know you wanna stay
If you just give me a sign
Say anything, say anything
Don't say a word, (Please don't leave)
I know you feel the same
Just give me a sign
Say anything, say anything
Please don't walk away, (Please don't leave)
I know you wanna stay
If you just give me a sign
Say anything, say anything
It's the last goodbye I swear
I can't rely on a dime a day love that don't go anywhere
I learn to cry for someone else
I can't get by on an odds and ends love that don't ever match up
I heard all you said and I took it to heart
I won't forget I swear
I have no regrets for the past is behind me
Tomorrow reminds me just where
Can't quite see the end
How can I rely on my heart if I break it with my own two hands?
I heard all you said and I love you to death
I heard all you said don't say anything
It's the last goodbye I swear
I can't survive on a half-hearted love that will never be whole
Love, I have wounds
Only you can mend
You can mend
I guess that's love
I can't pretend
Can't pretend
Feel, my skin is rough
But it can be cleansed
Can be cleansed
And my arms are tough
But they can be bent
Can be bent
And I wanna fight
But I can't contend
I guess that's love
I can't pretend
Can't pretend
Oh feel our bodies grow
And our souls they blend
Yeah love I hope you know
How much my heart depends
But I guess that's love I can't pretend
I guess that's love I can't pretend
Oh feel our bodies grow
And our souls they blend
Yeah love I hope you know
How much my heart depends
I guess that's love I can't pretend
I guess that's love I can't pretend
Tidal waves don't beg forgiveness, crashed and on their way
Father he enjoyed collisions, others walked away
A snowflake falls in may
And the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out
'Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow, goodbye for now
Nature has its own religion, gospel from the land
Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend
Old men comprehend.
And the sky breaks at dawn, shedding light upon this town, they'll all come 'round
Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow, goodye for now
And the road the old man paved
The broken seams along the way
The rusted signs, left just for me
He was guiding me, Love, his own way
Now the man of the hour is taking his final bow
As the curtain comes down I feel that this is just goodbye for now
Si es cuestión de confesar, 
no sé preparar café 
y no entiendo de fútbol 
Creo que alguna vez fui infiel, 
juego mal hasta el parqués 
y jamás uso reloj 
Para ser más franca, 
nadie piensa en ti como lo hago yo 
aunque te dé lo mismo 
Si es cuestión de confesar, 
nunca duermo antes de diez 
ni me baño los domingos 
La verdad es que también 
lloro una vez al mes 
sobre todo cuando hay frío 
Conmigo nada es fácil, 
ya debes saber 
me conoces bien 
(Y sin ti todo es tan aburrido) 
El cielo está cansado ya de ver 
la lluvia caer 
y cada día que pasa es uno más 
parecido a ayer 
no encuentro forma alguna de olvidarte 
porque seguir amándote es inevitable 
Siempre supe que es mejor, 
cuando hay que hablar de dos 
empezar por uno mismo 
Ya sabrás la situación, 
aquí todo está peor 
pero al menos aún respiro 
No tienes qué decirlo, 
no vas a volver, te conozco bien 
(Ya buscaré qué hacer conmigo) 
El cielo esta cansado ya de ver 
la lluvia caer 
y cada día que pasa es uno más 
parecido a ayer 
No encuentro forma alguna de olvidarte 
porque seguir amándote es inevitable 
Siempre supe que es mejor, 
cuando hay que hablar de dos, 
empezar por uno mismo.
Translation
if it is a question to admit 
i don't know how to prepare coffee 
and i don't understand soccer 
i think that one time i was unfaithful 
i play bad until ¿parqués? 
and i never use a watch 
and to be frankly nobody 
i think of you as i made myself 
although she gives you the same 
if it is a question to admit 
i never sleep before 10 
never take a bath on sundays 
the truth is that i also 
cry once a month 
mainly when it's cold 
for me nothing's easy 
you should know to know 
me well 
and without you everything is so boring 
the sky is tired of seeing 
rain fall 
and each day that passes by 
seems like yesterday 
i don't find something 
forgetting because 
loving you is inevitable or unavoidable 
i always knew it was better 
when it's necessary to speak of two 
to begin for the same 
you'll already know the situation 
here everything is worse 
but at least i'm breathing 
you don't have to say it 
you're not going to come back 
i know you well 
i will already look for what makes me 
the sky is tired of seeing 
rain fall 
and each day that passes by 
seems like yesterday 
i don't find something 
forgetting because 
loving you is inevitable or unavoidable 
i always knew it was better 
when it's necessary to speak of two 
to begin for the same
You're out in the park and you're peeking
Piss pools in your seat
She's standing inside but you surely repeat
Oh God don't leave me here
I will freeze till you leave
Love is love's reprieve
Winter is coming and you're stacking
All your summer sheets
Now when the wind blows you cover your tooth
And our tool shed
Where you trade in your blues
Love is love's sad news
That was Wisconsin, that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
'Cause every place I go I take another place with me
Love is love's mystique
You're up on the bar and you're shaking
With every grimy word
Who will you love? What's love when you've hurt?
The winter as your scene
The snow kissed the curb
Love is love's return
That was Wisconsin, that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
'Cause every place I go I take another place with me
Love is love's critique
At Cavanaugh Park
Where I used to sit
All alone in the dark
And dream about things
That I cannot say
You always said destiny
Would blow me away
And nothings gonna blow me away
At Cavanaugh Park
Where you used to take me
To play in the sand
And said to me son
One day you'll be a man
And men can do terrible things
Yes they can
There was never any place
For someone like me
To be totally happy
I'm running out of clock
And that ain't a shock
Some things never do change
Never do change
At Cavanaugh Park
We used to get high
Watchin teams as they fought
They loved my friend Adam
But he always got caught
Man that kid made fucking up look cool
Aren't we all so cool now, No
There was never any place
For someone like me
To be totally happy
I'm running out of clock
And that ain't a shock
Some things never do change
Never do change
Never do change
Never do change
Never do change
At Cavanaugh Park
Where I used to think
That this life would be good
And I would do things
That I thought that I should
And no one's going to tear me down
There was never any place
For someone like me
To be totally happy
I'm running out of clock
And that ain't a shock
Some things never do change
There was never any place
For someone like me
To be totally happy
I'm running out of clock
And that ain't a shock
Some things never do change
Never do change
Never do change
Never do change
Never do change
I forgot fools run
Between, half the time I'm so dead
It's okay - this'll help, inside
I won't fall behind
I won't forget all that I've done
Don't be scared it's over now, I swear
Try to push it back
Try to keep from missing love
It's okay - this'll help, inside
I won't fall behind
I won't forget all that I've done
Don't be scared
It's fine
It's okay, it's over now
I'm goin' to a town that has already been burnt down
I'm goin' to a place that has already been disgraced
I'm gonna see some folks who have already been let down
I'm so tired of America
I'm gonna make it up for all of The Sunday Times
I'm gonna make it up for all of the nursery rhymes
They never really seem to want to tell the truth
I'm so tired of you, America
Makin' my own way home
Ain't gonna be alone
I got a life to lead, America
I got a life to lead
Tell me do you really think you go to hell for having loved
Tell me enough of thinkin' everything that you've done is good
I really need to know
After soakin' the body of Jesus Christ in blood
I'm so tired of America
I really need to know
I may just never see you again or might as well
You took advantage of a world that loved you well
I'm goin' to a town that has already been burnt down
I'm so tired of you, America
Makin' my own way home
Ain't gonna be alone
I got a life to lead, America
I got a life to lead
I got a soul to feed
I got a dream to heed
And that's all I need
Makin' my own way home
Ain't gonna be alone
I'm goin' to a town
That has already been burnt down
Lost in a haunting thought
Spinning me around once more
I wake, just to feel the weight
As the daylight comes around, I turn
With my eyes on the back door
Your face is light and cocaine white
One message beating through
Smoke's filled the air
And I'm struggling to breathe
Let them be calm so I finally can sleep
Everything you intended to say
Don't go back on your words
You always said you'd tell me first
Verse after endless verse
I can't escape the echoed words
I long, long to find a cure
For the fear that I find in these chords
I smile as it burns
Your face is light and cocaine white
One message beating through
I've been erased
I've been erased from the picture
Excuse, oh no, anything goes
Excuses, you know it doesn't work
Excuse, oh no, anything goes
Excuses don't work
Excuse me, this will close, I'm desperate
Excuse me, this will close, I'm desperate
Smoke's filled the air
And I'm struggling to breathe
Let them be calm so I finally can sleep
Everything you intended to say
Don't go back on your words
You always said you'd tell me first
Smoke's filled the air
And I'm struggling to breathe
Let them be calm so I finally can sleep
I've searched the holy books
Tried to unravel the mystery of Jesus Christ, the saviour
I've read the poets and the analysts
Searched through the books on human behaviour
I travelled the whole world around
For an answer that refused to be found
I don't know why and I don't know how
But she's nobody's baby now
I loved her then and I guess I love her still
Hers is the face I see when a certain mood moves in
She lives in my blood and skin
Her wild feral stare, her dark hair
Her winter lips as cold as stone
Yeah, I was her man
But there are some things even love won't allow
I held her hand but I don't hold it now
I don't know why and I don't know how
But she's nobody's baby now
This is her dress that I loved best
With the blue quilted violets across the breast
And these are my many letters
Torn to pieces by her long-fingered hand
I was her cruel-hearted man
And though I've tried to lay her ghost down
She's moving through me, even now
I don't know why and I don't know how
But she's nobody's baby now
Instrumental
Little light, shining
Little light, will guide them to me
My face is all lit up
My face is all lit up
If they find me racing white horses
They'll not take me for a buoy
Let me be weak
Let me sleep
And dream of sheep
"Attention shipping information in sea areas within
Bell Rock, Tiree, Cromarty, gale east..."
"Come here with me now"
"...Malin, Sellafield"
Oh I'll wake up
To any sound of engines
Ev'ry gull a seeking craft
I can't keep my eyes open
Wish I had my radio
I'd tune into some friendly voices
Talking 'bout stupid things
I can't be left to my imagination
Let me be weak
Let me sleep
And dream of sheep
Ooh their breath is warm
And they smell like sleep
And they say they take me home
Like poppies, heavy with seed
They take me deeper and deeper
(Iesu, Rex amirabilis)
I still remember the world
From the eyes of a child
Slowly those feelings
Were clouded by what I know now
Where has my heart gone?
An uneven trade for the real world
Oh! I, I want to go back to
Believing in everything
And knowing nothing at all
I still remember the sun
Always warm on my back
Somehow it seems colder now
Where has my heart gone?
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger
Oh! I, I want to go back to
Believing in everything
(Iesu, Rex amirabilis
Et triumphator nobilis
Dulcedo ineffabilis
Ineffabilis totus desiderabilis)
As the years pass by before my face
(Totus desiderabilis)
As wars rage before me
Finding myself in these last days of existence
This parasite inside me I forced it out
In the darkness of the storm
(Iesu, Rex amirabilis)
Lies an evil
But it's me
Where has my heart gone?
An uneven trade for the real world
Oh! I, I want to go back to
Believing in everything
Oh! Where? Where has my heart gone?
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger
Oh! I, I want to go back to
Believing in everything
I still remember
(Iesu, Rex amirabilis)
And I'm waiting for the day
I know you've got your part
And I'm waiting for the day
I know you'll have the heart
And I'm hoping that you'll say
That you loved me all this time
But it turns out just the same
And you break apart the things I had
Hold On, what did you say that for?
Hold On, what did you say that for?
Hold On, what do you take me for?
Hold On, what do you take me for?
And I'm waiting for the day
Inside my mother's clothing store
And I'm waiting for the day
What am I waiting for?
Hold On, what did you say that for?
Hold On, what did you say that for?
Hold On, what do you take me for?
Hold On, what did you say that for?
In a dream, I saw you walkin'
Like a kid alive and talkin', that was you
In the classroom, you were teachin'
On the streets you were policin' that was you
To the one I now know most
I will tell them of your ghost like a thing that never, ever was
And all that ever mattered
Will some day turn back to batter like a joke
Behind thin walls, you hid your feelings
Takes four legs to make a ceilin' like a thing
In a dream I saw you walkin'
With your friends alive and talkin', that was you
Well I saw it in your movements
And even though you never knew it, well I knew
Just how sweet it could be
If you'd never left these streets
You had me worried, so worried that this would last
You had me worried, so worried that this would last
But now I'm learning, learning that this will pass
But now I'm learning, learning that this will pass
He waits for her to understand
But she won't understand at all
She waits all night for him to call
But he won't call anymore
He waits to hear her say "forgive"
But she just drops her pearl-black eyes
And prays to hear him say "I love you"
But he tells no more lies
He waits for her to sympathize
But she won't sympathize at all
She waits all night to feel his kiss
But always wakes alone
He waits to hear her say "forget"
But she just hangs her head in pain
And prays to hear him say "No more
I'll never leave again"
How did we get this far apart?
We used to be so close together
How did we get this far apart?
I thought this love would last forever
He waits for her to understand
But she won't understand at all
She waits all night for him to call
But he won't call
He waits to hear her say "forgive"
But she just drops her pearl black eyes
And prays to hear him say "I love you"
But he tells no more lies
How did we get this far apart?
We used to be so close together
How did we get this far apart?
I thought this love would last forever
I'm thinking of you
In my sleep
They're not good thoughts
The worst kind of sad
I've noticed things
Cannot be repaired
When I wake up
I'll be in despair
'Cause I know I've got to say
I know I've got to say
Goodbye
Baby goodbye
Goodbye
Baby goodbye
You're my sweetheart
Goodbye
You're my sweetest
Goodbye
I know I'm gonna look
So so so so bad
But there's no easier way
For me to have to walk away
But I don't want to hear this no more
And I don't want to feel this no more
And I don't want to see this no more
And I don't want to experience this no more
'Cause I know I've got to say
I know I've got to say
Goodbye
Baby goodbye
Goodbye
Baby goodbye
You're my sweetheart
Goodbye
You're my sweetest
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye (You're my sweetest)
...

The build-up lasted for days 
Lasted for weeks 
Lasted too long 
Our hero withdrew 
When there was two 
He could not choose one
So there was none 
Worn into the vaguely announced 
Worn into the vaguely announced 
The spinning top made a sound like a train across the valley 
Fading, oh so quiet, but constant 'til it passed 
Over the ridge into the distances, written on your ticket 
To remind you where to stop 
And when to get off
The spinning top made a sound like a train across the valley 
Fading, oh so quiet, but constant 'til it passed 
Over the ridge into the distances, written on your ticket 
To remind you where to stop 
And when to get off
The spinning top made a sound like a train across the valley 
Fading, oh so quiet, but constant 'til it passed 
Over the ridge into the distances, written on your ticket 
To remind you where to stop 
And when to get off
When to get off
When to get off
When to get off
Don't leave home again
If empathy takes energy
'Cause everyone feels just like you
But that's life, so social
But that's life, so social
But that's life, so social
But that's life, so social
But that's life, so social
But that's life, so social
But that's life, so social
But that's life, so social
But that's life, so social
But that's life, so social
But that's life, so social
But that's life, so social
But that's life, so social
So physical
But that's life, it's so "so-so"
So emotional
So stay home
Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight
Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and loved
Building up inside of me
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me,
You're not the one to place the blame
As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight
Sorrow sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away
Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight
So far away, I'm gone.
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
Sometimes in the morning I am petrified and can't move
Awake, but cannot open my eyes
And the weight is crushing down on my lungs, I know I can't breathe
And hope someone will save me this time
And your mother's still calling you insane and high
Swearing it's different this time
And you tell her to give in to the demons that possess her
And that God never blessed her insides
Then you hang up the phone and feel badly for upsetting things
Crawl back into bed to dream of a time
When your heart was open wide and you loved things just because
Like the sick and the dying
And sometimes when you're on, you're really fucking on
And your friends they sing along and they love you
But the lows are so extreme that the good seems fucking cheap
And it teases you for weeks in its absence
But you'll fight and you'll make it through
You'll fake it if you have to and you'll show up for work with a smile
You'll be better and you'll be smarter and more grown up
And a better daughter or son and a real good friend
And you'll be awake, you'll be alert, you'll be positive though it hurts
And you'll laugh and embrace all your friends
You'll be a real good listener, you'll be honest, you'll be brave
You'll be handsome and you'll be beautiful
You'll be happy
Your ship may be coming in
You're weak, but not giving in
To the cries and the wails of the valley below
And your ship may be coming in
You're weak, but not giving in
And you'll fight it, you'll go out fighting all of them
Mr. Muscle forcing bursting
Stingy thingy into little me, me, me
But just "ripple" said the cripple
As my jaw dropped to the ground
Smile, smile
It's true I always wanted love to be
Hurtful
And it's true I always wanted love to be
Filled with pain
(And bruises)
Yes, so Cripple-Pig was happy
Screamed, "I just completely love you
There's no rhyme or reason
I'm changing like the seasons
Watch, I'll even cut off my finger
It'll grow back like a starfish
It'll grow back like a starfish
It'll grow back like a starfish"
Mr. Muscle, gazing boredly
And he, checking time, did punch me
And I sighed and bleeded like a windfall
Happy bleedy, happy bruisy
I am very happy
So please hit me
I am very, very happy
So please hurt me
I am very happy
So please hit me
I am very, very happy
So come on and hurt me
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
Whispered:
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
I'll grow back like a starfish
Out of sight
Out of mind
Out of time
To decide
Do we run?
Should I hide?
For the rest
Of my life
Can we fly?
Do I stay?
We could lose
We could fail
In the moment
It takes
To make plans
Or mistakes
30 minutes, a blink of an eye
30 minutes, to alter our lives
30 minutes, to make up my mind
30 minutes, to finally decide
30 minutes, to whisper your name
30 minutes, to shoulder the blame
30 minutes, of bliss, thirty lies
30 minutes, to finally decide
Carousels
In the sky
That we shape
With our eyes
Under shade
Silhouettes
Casting shade
Crying rain
Can we fly?
Do I stay?
We could lose
We could fail
Either way
Options change
Chances fail
Trains derail
30 minutes, a blink of an eye
30 minutes, to alter our lives
30 minutes, to make up my mind
30 minutes, to finally decide
30 minutes, to whisper your name
30 minutes, to shoulder the blame
30 minutes, of bliss, thirty lies
30 minutes, to finally decide
To decide
To decide, to decide, to decide
To decide
To decide, to decide, to decide
To decide
A bruised full moon play fights with the stars
This place is our prison, its cells are the bars
So take me to town, I wanna dance with the city
Show me something ugly and show me something pretty
Damn, this place
Makes a boy out of me
The ring meets my face
By the count of three
An unwanted sun pulls rank in the sky
The boxer isn't finished, he's not ready to die
I'm attracted to the light, I'm attracted to the heat
It's a violent night, there are boxers in the street
Damn, this place
Makes a boy out of me
The ring meets my face
By the count of three
And damn, this place
Makes a boy out of me
The ring meets my face
I'm a fallen old tree
Dazed in the final count
Dazed in the final count
Oh, dazed in the final count
Dazed in the final count
Louis was my dearest friend
Fighting in the ANZAC trench
Louis ran forward from the line
I never saw him again
Later in the dark
I thought I heard Louis' voice
Calling for his mother, then me
But I couldn't get to him
He's still up on that hill
20 years on that hill
Nothing more than a pile of bones
But I think of him still
If I was asked I'd tell
The colour of the earth that day
It was dull and browny red
The colour of blood, I'd say
I just found a friend,
In one of your lies.
To treat me so nice,
I, can't believe my bones...
When they say,
So many things...
They tell me I am fine,
Believe me I, I try...
((Making ooh's))
...Ever so sweet,
You make this seem,
The way things go...
It's not my fault.
And I'll miss,
I'll miss you so good...
All of those nights,
We lost our way back home.
Ever so sweet,
You baked it in cakes for me.
Were you left behind?
It hurts my teeth...
Bring in the past with the postcards you send for me...
Every line,
It brings me right back down.
Can't you see the wall you built for me? (bis x 3)
We're not special (bis x 3)
I'm not special (bis x 2)
Ever so sweet,
You baked it in cakes for me...
Were you left behind?
It hurts my teeth...
Bringing the past with the postcards you sent for me...
Every line...
It brings me right back down.
Two hearts fading, like a flower
And all this waiting, for the power
For some answers, to this fire
Sinking slowly, the waters higher
Desire
Desire
With no secrets, no obsession
This time I'm speeding, with no direction
Without a reason, what is this fire?
Burning slowly, my one and only
Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire
You know me, you know my way
You just can't show me, but God I'm praying
That you'll find me, and that you'll see me
That you'll run and never tire
Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire
And we sing this morning that wonderful and grand old message
Well, I don't know about you, but I never get tired of it 
Number 99: Just as I am
I'm a mountain that has been moved
I'm a river that is all dried up
I'm an ocean nothing floats on
I'm a sky that nothing wants to fly in
I'm a sun that doesn't burn hot
I'm a moon that never shows its face
I'm a mouth that doesn't smile
I'm a word that no one ever wants to say
I don't wanna be 
He wasn't fighting anybody when he was on a shelf
I saw him in my dream
I'm a mountain that has been moved
I'm a fugitive that has no legs to run
I'm a preacher with no pulpit
Spewing a sermon that goes on and on and on (and on and on and on and on and on)
Well if we take all these things and then bury them fast
And we pray that they turn to seeds, to roots and then grass
It'd be all right, it's all right 
It'd be easier that way
Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain
Like you knew it was time to start things over again
It'd be all right, it's all right
It'd be easier that way
(But don't lose all that seed)
Well if we take all these things and then bury them fast
(She won't go underground)
And we pray that they turn to seeds, to roots and then grass
(You don't want to mess with this honey)
It'd be all right, it's all right
(Feel the flow)
It'd be easier that way
(Don't say you won't get scared and leave)
Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain
(And don't you mention all the good there would be)
Like you knew it was time to start things over again
(Don't say "is he gone?")
It'd be all right, it's all right
(Feel the flow)
It'd be easier that way
Daddy, please hear this song that I sing
In your heart there's a spark that just screams for a lover to bring
A child to your chest that could lay as you sleep
And love all you have left like your boy used to be
Long ago, wrapped in sheets warm and wet
Blister please with those wings in your spine
Love to be with a brother of mine, how he'd love to find
Your tongue in his teeth in a struggle to find
Secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight
Sounding only at night as you sleep
And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying
As your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet
Rings of flowers 'round your eyes and I'll love you
For the rest of your life when you're ready
Brother, see we are one in the same
And you left with your head filled with flames and you watched as your brains
Fell out through your teeth, push the pieces in place, make your smile sweet to see
Don't you take this away, I'm still wanting my face on your cheek
And when we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place where some holy spectacle lies
When we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life
Two-headed boy, she is all you could need
She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires
And retire to sheets safe and clean
But don't hate her when she gets up to leave
There's clothes all over the floor
Don't remember them being here before
Smell of perfume isn't here
Why's lipstick on the mirror
Still I don't understand
No pictures left in the hall
There is three new holes in my wall
Where the hell's my credit cards
Why's my wallet in the yard
Still I don't understand
Well I guess I should've listened
When you said you had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other 
Why's love gotta be so tough
Should seen the look on my face
My shits all over the place
Why's this happening to me
Why'd you take both sets of keys
And still I don't understand
Well now I guess I should've listened
When you said you had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other 
Why's love gotta be so tough
And now I guessed I should've listened
There's clothes all over my floor
Don't remember them being here before
There are no candles in here
Lipstick still on my mirror
Still I don't understand
Now I guess I should've listened
When you said you had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other 
Why must life be so tough
Well I guess I should've listened
When you said you had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other 
Why life gotta be so tough
When all is said and done
And dead does he love you
The way that I do
Breathing in lighting
Tonight's for fighting
I feel the hurt so physical
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around come around no more
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around no more
She spreads her love
She burns me up
I can't let go
I can't get out
I've said enough
Enough by now
I can't let go
I can't get out
Wait till the day you finally see
I've been here waiting patiently
Crossing my fingers and my t's
She cried on my shoulder begging please
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around come around no more
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around no more
She spreads her love
She burns me up
I can't let go
I can't get out
I've said enough
Enough by now
I can't let go
I can't get out
What is it you really want?
I'm tired of asking
You come wasted
When I showed up and he was there
I tried my best to grin and bear
And took the stairs but didn't stop at the street
And as we speak I'm going down
'Cause she spread her love
And burnt me up
I can't let go
I can't get out
I've said enough
Enough by now
I can't let go
I can't get out
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around come around no more
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around no more
Once there was a man, who had a little too much... time on his hands
He never stopped to think that he was getting older
And when his life came to an end, he tried to grasp for his last friend
And pretend that he could wish himself health on a four leaf clover
He said: Is this the return to Oz?
The grass is dead, the gold is brown and the sky has claws
There's a wind-up man walking round and round
What once was Emerald City is now a crystal town
Three o' clock in the morning
You get a phone call from the queen with a hundred heads
She says that they're all dead
She tried the last one on, it couldn't speak fell off,
And now she just wanders the halls,
Thinking nothing, thinking nothing at all...
She said: Is this the return to Oz?
The grass is dead, the gold is brown and the sky has claws
There's a wind-up man walking round and round
What once was Emerald City is now a crystal town
The wheelies are cutting pavement and the skeksis at the rave meant
To hide deep inside their sunken faces and their wild rolling eyes
But their callous words reveal
That they can no longer feel love or sex appeal
The patchwork girl has come to cinch the deal
To return to oz - we've fled the world with smiles and clenching jaws
Please help me friend from coming down
I've lost my face and now it can't be found
Is this the return to Oz?
The grass is dead, the gold is brown and the sky has claws
There's a wind-up man walking round and round
What once was a Emerald City is now a crystal town
(Oh if you could see me now)
(Oh if you could see me now)
It was February 14 Valentines Day
The roses came but they took you away
Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
And I'll never get to show you these songs
Dad you should see the tours that I'm on
I see you standing there next to Mom
Both singing along, yeah arm in arm
And there are days when I'm losing my faith
Because the man wasn't good he was great
He'd say "Music was the home for your pain"
And explained I was young, he would say
Take that rage, put it on a page
Take that page to the stage
Blow the roof off the place
I'm trying to make you proud
Do everything you did
I hope you're up there with God saying "That's my kid!"
I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
(Oh if you could see me now)
If you could see me now would you recognize me?
Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me?
Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face
Put your hand on my heart that was cold
As the day you were taken away
I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day
Right now, I wish I could hear you say
I drink too much, and I smoke too much dutch
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must
You used to say I won't know a wind until it crossed me
Like I won't know real love till I've loved and I've lost it
So if you lost a sister, someone's lost a mom
And if you lost a dad then someone's lost a son
And they're all missing out, yeah they're all missing out
So if you get a second to look down on me now
Mom, Dad I'm just missing you now
I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Oh, oh
Would you call me a saint or a sinner?
Would you love me a loser or winner?
Oh, oh
When I see my face in the mirror
We look so alike that it makes me shiver
I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Yeah I'm just missing you now
I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
If you could see, you could see me now
If you could see, you could see me now
One more little one, I'll go down
And stay down
And sleep the rest of the day
Dream new music to calm down
And stay down
And keep evil away
I can hear you asleep
Changing your shape
Dissolved in some dream
As a new one appears
To take you along
Where you've never been
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Moonlight tonight
Seems to belong to me
'Cause I
Even though soon can sleep
I need some company
One hit wouldn't hurt a bit  
I'll slow down
And sleep the rest of the time
If it's good shit you won't know
And I won't know
The fact that I'll die
If I seem to be reckless with myself
It's the fault of no one 
All things have a place
Under the moon
As well as the sun
One more little one I love you
Ants are in the sugar
Muscles atrophied
We're on the other side
The screen is us and we're TV
Spread me open
Sticking to my pointy ribs
Are all your infants
In abortion cribs
I was born into this
Everything turns to shit
The boy that you loved
Is the man that you fear
Pray until you're number
Asleep from all your pain
Your apple has been rotting
Tomorrow's turned up dead
I have it all and
I have no choice but to
I'll make everyone pay
And you will see
You can kill yourself now
Because you're dead in my mind
The boy that you loved
Is the monster you fear
Peel off all those eyes
Crawl into the dark
You poisoned all your children
To camouflage your scars
Pray unto the splinters
Pray unto your fear
(Pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream)
Pray your life was just a dream
The cut that never heals
Pray now baby
Pray your life was just a dream
(You're still dreaming)
(I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape)
(I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape)
Pinch the head off
Collapse me like a weed
Someone had to go this far
I was born into this
Everything turns to shit
The boy that you loved
Is the man that you fear
Peel off all those eyes
Crawl into the dark
You poisoned all your children
To camouflage your scars
Pray unto the splinters
Pray unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream
The cut that never heals
Pray now, baby
Pray your life was just a dream
The world in my hands
There's no one left to hear you scream
No one left for you
(When all of your wishes are granted
Many of your dreams will be destroyed)
People just ain't no good
I think that's well understood
You can see it everywhere you look
People just ain't no good
We were married under cherry trees
Under blossom we made our vows
All the blossoms come sailing down
Through the streets and through the playgrounds
The sun would stream on the sheets
Awoken by the morning bird
We'd buy the Sunday newspapers
And never read a single word
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
Seasons came, seasons went
The winter stripped the blossoms bare
A different tree now lines the streets
Shaking its fists in the air
The winter slammed us like a fist
The windows rattling in the gales
To which she drew the curtains
Made out of her wedding veils
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
To our love send a dozen white lilies
To our love send a coffin of wood
To our love let all the pink-eyed pigeons coo
That people they just ain't no good
To our love send back all the letters
To our love a valentine of blood
To our love let all the jilted lovers cry
That people they just ain't no good
It ain't in their hearts they're bad
They can comfort you, some even try
They nurse you when you're ill of health
They bury you when you go and die
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
They'd stick by you if they could
But that's just bullshit
People just ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
On a cold day, nothing's gonna stop us
'Cause on a cold day, you can see forever
On a cold day, nothing's gonna stop us
'Cause on a cold day, you can walk through metal
In a brick yard, we'll be making babies
In a brick yard, it's raining up in heaven
Solid gold now, nothing's gonna stop us
Solid gold now, solid, solid gold
A man can be happy with the weather
As long as he doesn't love her
Snow will fall, be a storm, there's nowhere warm
To run and hide
Wintertime is a razor blade the devil made
It's the price we pay for the summertime
In a brick yard, we'll be making babies
In a brick yard, it's raining up in heaven
Solid gold now, nothing's gonna stop us
Solid gold now, solid, solid gold
A man can be happy with the weather
As long as he doesn't love her
Snow will fall, be a storm, there's nowhere warm
To run and hide
Wintertime is a razor blade the devil made
It's the price we pay for the summertime
Three wasted years, standing still
As you opened up, 18 miles wide
On this country drive
I can't keep up
'Cause you're so far gone
And it's all too much hindsight
Three wasted years, wasting time
As the hunger pains grow inside
I can't keep up
'Cause you're so far gone
And it's all too much hindsight
Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is there's no one else to blame
Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me
Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah, I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe
Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me
Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me
Better call the ships, they been caught sailing
Better call the captain, he's been caught stealing
Better call the porter man, he's been caught leaving
Better call all the guys on the deck; they've been caught with no feeling
Better call the fisherman, 'cause they're coming on land
Better call the head nurse, wrap us up, to throw us in the dark
Better call with some resistance, better way to feel no shame
Better call with some persistence, that way you feel nothing at all
Better call on evolution, better way to make a revolution
Better make your mind up quick
Better make your mind up quick
Looking out across the next few days
I can see, nothing
Looking out across the next few year
I can see, they're gonna go by fast
Looking out across the next few days
Smoke's gonna clear slowly
Looking out across the next few days
I can see, they're gonna go by fast
They're gonna go by
Lying for, me
So I won't hear a thing
To bat me back
So I'll notice some grave thing
I'm not made of successful things
I'm not made of successful things
I'm not made of success
I've got what it takes
I've got what it takes
To rest
To rest
To rest
But I'm still around
Looking across the faces I've know
I can see
Nothing
Looking out across my family members
I know they miss me
I know they must miss me
Never had a lot of fun
Better things to do around the house
Never had a lot of fun
Better things to do without
Lying for, me
So I won't hear a thing
To bat me back
So I'll notice some grave thing
I'm not made of successful things
Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay.
He cut out my tongue,
There is nothing to save.
Love me, oh Lord,
He threw me away.
He laughed at my sins,
In his arms I must stay.
He wrote,
I am broke,
Please send for me.
But I am broken too,
And spoken for,
Do not tempt me.
Her skin is white,
And I'm light as the sun,
So holy light shines on the things you have done.
So I asked him how he became this man,
How did he learn to hold fruit in his hands,
And where is the lamb that gave you your name,
He had to leave though I begged him to stay
Left me alone when I needed the light,
Fell to my knees and I wept for my life.
If he had've stayed you might understand,
If he had've stayed you never would have taken my hand.
He wrote,
Oh love, please send for me,
But I am broken too,
And spoken for,
Do not tempt me.
And where is the lamb that gave you your name,
He had to leave though I begged him to stay.
Begged him to stay in my cold wooden grip,
Begged him to stay by the light of this ship.
Me fighting him, fighting life, fighting dawn,
And the waves came and stole him and took him to war.
He wrote,
I'm broke,
Please send for me.
But I'm broken too,
And spoken for,
Do not tempt me.
Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay,
Cut out my tongue,
There is nothing to save.
Love me, oh Lord, he threw me away,
He laughed at my sins,
In his arms I must stay.
We write,
That's all right,
I miss his smell.
We speak when spoken to,
And that suits us well
That suits us well.
That suits me well.
I could liken you to a werewolf
The way you left me for dead
But I admit that I provided a full moon
And I could liken you to a shark
The way you bit off my head
But then again
I was waving around a bleeding open wound
But you are such a super guy
Till the second you get a whiff of me
We are like a wishing well
And a bolt of electricity
But we can still support each other
All we gotta do's avoid each other
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
The lava of a volcano
Shot up hot from under the sea
One thing leads to another
And you made an island of me
 
And I could liken you to a chemical
The way you made me compound to compound
But I'm a chemical too
Inevitable you and me would mix
And I could liken you to a lot of things
But I always come around
'Cause in the end I'm a sensible girl
I know the fiction of the fix
But you are such a super guy
Till the second you get a whiff of me
We are like a wishing well
And a bolt of electricity
But we can still support each other
All we gotta do's avoid each other
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Piss-poor, ride in her sun bathing fireside
We're here for the porn and the sirloin
Get your T-bone
Let your backbone slide
Tunnel and sky collide
Lose friends to the air waves and the airlines
I wanna make it right
Some future in my eyes, bright
Hush don't explain
When you water down my name
I'll be up too late
Call me when you get
Better at your game
You haven't beat me yet
The waitress
The actress
Got the skin and the bones
With a hairbrush and an air brush
She'd be white gold
She asked the piss-poor "Why you lookin' for that
Party in the sky
It's just a movie 'bout a movie to old to die"
But I'm gonna make it right
Future in my eyes, bright
Hush, don't explain
When you water down my name
I'll be up too late
Call me when you get
Better at your game
You haven't beat me yet
Though my vision is strainin'
I'm gonna make it right
Some future in my eyes, bright
Hush, don't explain
When you water down my name
I'll be up too late
Call me when you get
Better at your game
You haven't beat me yet
Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet
Dead roses
Saki and strings divine
You'll make it
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war
Don't fake it
Sadden glissando strings
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell
I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
(See the lights all shining bright on Broadway)
Baby says I can't come with him.
And I had read all of this
In his eyes.
Long before he even said so,
Why go? I asked.
You know,
And I know why.
And it'll be just as quiet
When I leave
As it was
When I first got here.
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything...
Take care.
I've been hurt before.
Too much time spent
On closing doors.
You may hate me,
But I'll remember to love you.
Goodbye,
Don't cry.
You know why.
And it'll be just as quiet
When I leave
As it was
When I first got here.
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything...
All the waves of blame arrange as broken scenery,
As they steal your best memories away.
What if I was someone different in your only history?
Would you feel the same
As I walk out the door?
Never to see your face again;
Never to see your face again.
And it'll be just as quiet
When I leave
As it was
When I first got here.
It'll be just
As quiet,
When I leave
As it was
When I first got here.
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything
To change
When I leave.
'Twas Halloween and the ghosts were out
And everywhere they'd go, they shout
And though I covered my eyes I knew
They'd go away
But fear's the only thing I saw
And three days later was clear to all
That nothing is as scary as election day
But the day after is darker
And darker and darker it goes
Who knows, maybe the plans will change
Who knows, maybe he's not deranged
The news men know what they know, but they
Know even less than what they say
And I don't know who I can trust
For the come what may
'Cause we believed in our candidate
But even more it's the one we hate
I needed someone I could shake
On election day
But the day after is darker
And deeper and deeper we go
Who knows, maybe it's all a dream
Who knows if I'll wake up and scream
I love the things that you've given me
I cherish you, my dear country
But sometimes I don't understand
The way we play
I love the things that you've given me
And most of all that I am free
To have a song that I can sing
On election day
She said 'Meet me at the gates at eight
'Leave now, don't be late'
She said one day she'd walk away
'Cause I was always late
Thought things were okay
Didn't care though anyway
Say 'Sorry, babe, I had to meet a mate'
Tempting fate
We first met through a shared view
She loved me and I did too
It's now seven-fifty
Getting ready, better be nifty
Do my hair quickly
Step out, it's cloudy
Mate bells me to borrow money
I've got two Henrys and a dealer to pay
Call up on Geezers to rid these green trees
From my reeking jeans
Got a You-Think-I-Care air
Out glaring geezers' stares
I'm here and I'm there
Couldn't see past the end of my beer
What was gettin' near
All of the silence after the tears
I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late, too late
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?
She said 'Meet me at the gates, don't be late'
But pretty soon the day came for change
And I was glad she never walked away
So I'm choosing what to wear
Doing my hair with an hour to spare
When my life went pear
She'd been there with a fixed stare
Big wheel climbed to the top
Geezers' stares bounced off
Standin' at the top of this huge mountain
Smilin' and shoutin'
Spring flowers sproutin'
Not one inch of doubt in my mind
As I reached the gates
Came 'round the corner at a rate
Risked her love
But I was gonna set things straight
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late
I didn't know it was over
'Til it was too late, too late
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?
I said 'Meet me at the gates
Leave now, don't be late'
I waited for a while
Listening to her voicemail
Mind set sail
Then the facts turned me pale
Wind, rain and hail
My fears unveiled for my fair female
She'd walked away
Too little too late
I step up the pace
Walk past the gates
Rain runs over my face
Spirit falls from grace
I purchase a hazy escape at the alcohol place
In the Chase
I sat down, got a fat frown
Weepin' and drownin' my senses
For this love game's expensive
I walk in a trance
Got a wounded soldier stance
And the everyday geezers' stares throw me off balance
Now nothin' holds significance
And nothin' holds relevance
Cause the only thing I can see is her elegance
I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late, too late
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?
I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late, too late
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?
Half underwater
I'm half my mother's daughter
A fraction's left up to dispute
The whole collection
Half off the price they're asking
In the halfway house of ill repute
Half accidental
Half painful instrumental
I have a lot to think about
You think they're joking?
You have to go provoke him
I guess it's high time you found out
It's half biology and half corrective surgery gone wrong
You'll notice something funny if you hang around here for too
Long ago in some black hole before they had these pills to take it back
I'm half Jill
And half Jack
Two halves are equal
A cross between two evils
It's not an enviable lot
But if you listen
You'll learn to hear the difference
Between the halves and the half nots
And when I let him in I feel the stitches getting sicker
I try to wash him out but like they say, the blood is thicker...
I see my mother in my face, but only when I travel
I run as fast as I can run
But Jack comes tumbling after
And when I'm brave enough and find a clever way to kick him out
And I'm so high, not even you and all your love could bring me down
On 83rd, he never found the magic words to change this fact:
I'm half Jill
And half Jack
I'm halfway home now
Half hoping for a showdown
'Cause I'm not big enough to house this crowd
It might destroy me
But I'd sacrifice my body
If it meant I'd get the Jack part out
See Jack
Run Jack
Run Jack
See Jack
See Jack
Run Jack
Run Jack
See Jack
See Jack
Run Jack
Run Jack
See Jack
See Jack
Run Jack
Run Jack
Run Jack
Run Jack, Run
Well and I can and I die
I can, I die
Well and I'm freezing
I'm freezing
Well, it's a sly curse
A sly curse
Well and I'm spiralling
I'm spiralling
In my broken heart game
I got all my fives
I got all my ones to choose from
My cave
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
I'm ravage like a dog and meat
I'm gone, gone
In Carthusian Red I get cut along
I am
I am undone
I am undone
Where go?
Where now?
Can't stand
And if I can
Can die
I'm freezing
Sly curse
I'm spiralling
In my cruel love gold poisoned
I was born, born
Not a girl and not a jewel
I am
I am some son
I am some bum
Where go?
Where now?
Can't stand
And if I can
Can die
I'm freezing
Sly curse
I'm spiralling
Spiralling
Spiralling
Spiralling
Spiralling

L.A. lights never shine quite as bright as in the movies
Still wanna go
There's something here
In the way, in the way that we're constantly moving
Reminds you of home
So you're taking these pills
For to fill up your soul
And you're drinking them down with cheap alcohol
And I'd be inclined to be yours for the taking
And part of this terrible mess that you're making
But me, I'm the catalyst
When you say love is a simple chemical reaction
Can't say I agree
'Cause my chemicals, yeah, left me a beautiful disaster
Still love's all I see
So I'm taking these pills for to fill up my soul
And I'm drinking them down with cheap alcohol
And you'd be inclined to be mine for the taking
And part of this terrible mess that I'm making
But you, you're the catalyst
You'll be the vein
You'll be the pain
You'll be the scar
You'll be the road, rolling below
The wheels of a car
And all of your thoughts on... God
Don't know if I'm strong enough... no
You'll be the vein
You'll be the pain
You'll be the
Catalyst
These L.A. lights, no no,
They don't shine quite as bright as back in Frisco
Do you wanna though...
Still wanna go?
Hear me out
Day follows day
Light turns to
Clay in my hands
How to explain,
So pristine the pain
Kindness made
The cut so
Clean
I still care for you
Hear me out
Wanted me to be
Less your lover
Than a mirror
Can't you see
What you mean to me?
(Even promises may bleed)
I still care for you
The hours grow
Heavy,
And hollow,
And cruel as a grave
Open Me
You'll find
Only bones
Burned to glass.
I still care for you
Oh, noose
Tied myself in, tied myself too tight
Looking kind of anxious in your cross-armed stance
Like a bad tempered prom queen at a homecoming dance
And I claim I'm not excited with my life anymore
So I blame this town, this job, these friends, the truth is it's myself
And I'm trying to understand myself and pinpoint who I am
When I finally get it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan
Oh, noose
Tied myself in, tied myself too tight
Oh, noose
Tied myself in, tied myself too tight
Talking shit about a pretty sunset
Blanketing opinions that I'll probably regret soon
Changed my mind so much I can't even trust it
My mind changed me so much I can't even trust myself
There is no one left in the world
That I can hold onto
There is really no one left at all
There is only you
And if you leave me now
You leave all that we were undone
There is really no one left
You are the only one
And still the hardest part for you
To put your trust in me
I love you more than I can say
Why won't you just believe?
Wherever you're going
I wanna go
Wherever you're headed
Can you let me know?
I don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought
Of you miles away
And I know you're going somewhere
To make a better life
I hope that you find it
On the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have you go
I know that I'll be sadder
If you never hit the road, so
Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here, that somebody's me
I will write to tell you
What's going on
But you won't miss nothing
But the same ol' song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend a day
Telling you stories
About a land far way
But I know you're going somewhere
To make a better life
I hope that you find it
On the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have you go
I know that I'll be sadder
If you never hit the road, so
Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here
Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here, that somebody's me
And I'm gonna try to hold it all in
Try to hold back my tears
So it don't make you stay here, yeah
I'm'a try to be a big girl now
'Cause I don't wanna be
The reason you don't live
Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here
Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
You were here, that somebody's me
Was losing all my friends
Was losing them to drinking and to driving
Was losing all my friends
But I got 'em back
I am on the mend
At least now I can say that I am trying
And I hope you will forget
Things that I still lack
Yeah, yeah
Is it in you now
To bear to hear the truth that you have spoken
Twisted up by knaves
To make a trap for fools
And is it in you now
To watch the things you gave your life to broken
And stoop and build 'em up
With worn-out tools
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Nothing gets so bad
A whisper from your father couldn't fix it
He whispers like a bridge
It's a river spanned
Take all that you have
And turn it into something you would miss if
Somebody threw that brick
To shatter all your plans
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
It takes a while to grow anything
Before it's coming to an end, yeah
Before you put my body in the cold ground
Take some time and warm it with your hands
Before it's coming to an end, yeah
Do you miss the blend
Of color she left in your black and white field
Or do you feel condemned
Just for being there
I am not your friend
I am just a man who knows how it feels
I am not your friend, I'm not your lover
I'm not your family
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
It takes a while to grow anything
Before it's coming to an end, yeah
Is it true what I heard about the Son of God?
Did he come to save, did he come at all?
And if I dried his feet 
With my dirty hair 
Would he make me clean again?
They say they don't know when but a day is gonna come 
When there won't be a moon and there won't be a sun;
It will just go black 
It will just go back 
To the way it was before.
I knew a lovely girl with such pretty pride,
And every man wanted her and so did I...
And so did I,
But she up and died 
In a fit of vanity.
Now men with purple hearts carry silver guns 
And they will kill a man for what his father has done,
But what my father did 
You know it don't mean shit 
I'm not him.
And you think I need some discipline well I've had my share 
Now I've been sent to my room, I've been sat in a chair 
And I held my tongue 
I didn't plug my ears 
No I got a good talking to.
Now I don't know why but I still try to smile 
When they talk at me like I'm just a child 
Well I'm not a child 
No I am 
Much younger than that.
And now I have read some books and I have grown quite brave 
If I could just speak up I think I would say 
That There is no truth 
There is only you 
And what you make the truth.
So I will just sing my songs and I'll pass a hat,
Then I'll leave your town and I'll never look back,
No I don't look back 
Because the road is clear 
Laid out ahead of me.
I'll get home and meet my friends at our favorite bar 
We'll get some lighter heads for our heavy hearts 
And we will share a drink 
Yeah we'll share our fears 
And they will know how I love them 
They will know how I love 
They will know how I love them 
I am nothing without their love 
Now I don't know when but a day is gonna come 
When there won't be a moon and there won't be a sun 
It will all go black 
It will all go back 
To the way it is supposed to be.
Well, is it true what they say about the Son of God?
Did he die for us, did he die at all?
And if I sold my soul 
For a bag of gold to you
Which one of us would be the foolish one?
Which one of us would be the fool?
Which one of us would be the foolish one?
Which one of us would be the fool?
Could you please start explaining?
You know I need some understanding. 
I could do with some explaining,
You know I want to understand.
Caravans lost
To the sun and the dust
No-one loves you
When you are lost
Yeah I'm a clown
Pulling my world down
I believed I was strong
But you are the sun
And when it comes, you'll feel the weight of it
The weight of it
The day will come, when you'll get away from it
Away from it
Sometimes everything is easy
Sometimes everything is easy
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
I try to quit
But my heart won't buy it
I got family
The caravan comes back for me
And when it comes, you'll feel the weight of it
The weight of it
And the day will come, when you'll get away from it
Away from it
Sometimes everything is easy
Sometimes everything is easy
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Sometimes everything is easy
Sometimes everything is easy
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
The fragile keep secrets
Gathered in pockets
And they will sell them for nothing
A cheap watch or locket
That kind of gold washes off
And the sad act like lepers
They stick to the shadows
They long to ring bells of warning
To tell of their coming
So that the pure can shut their doors
The angry are animals
Senseless and savage
They act without order
In logical lapses
They stain their mouths with blood
So take my hand
This barren land is alive tonight
Oh, the corn has grown stalks
That form a wall to hide
But the wind carries sounds
That I can't see from beyond that line
Then the stalks begin to sway...
Oh, stay with me, Arienette
Until the wolves are away
The wicked are vultures
And they bake in the canyons
They circle in sunlight
And wait for their victims
To collapse and call to them
The desperate are water
They'll run down forever
And soak into silence
And end up together
In a dark and distant, dark and distant place
So don't leave me here with only mirrors watching me
This house, it holds nothing but the memories
And the moon, it leaves silver but never sleep
And then the silver turns to gray...
Oh stay with me, Arienette
Until the wolves are away
Oh, my baby, don't cry
Oh, my babe, just say goodbye
Oh, now, baby, don't cry
Oh, my babe, at least we tried
At least we tried to make it
But in these days I'm so confused
Oh, my love, at least we had it
Let me hold on to you
Oh, my baby, don't cry
Oh, my babe, just say goodbye
Oh, now, baby, don't cry
Oh, my babe, at least we tried
At least we tried, but we lost it
I will remember
How you stood there and you smiling
And you smile there with me
Oh, my baby, don't cry
Oh, my babe, just say goodbye
Oh, now, baby, don't cry
Oh, my babe, at least we tried
Oh, my baby, don't cry
Oh, my babe, just say goodbye, say goodbye
Oh, now, baby, don't cry
Oh, my babe, at least we tried, oh
Oh, my baby, don't cry
Oh, my babe, just say goodbye
Goodbye, my baby, don't cry
Oh, my babe, at least we tried
Oh
I wish this could be
A happy song
But my happiness disappeared
The moment you were gone
Don't think I ever believed that
This day will come
Now all I'm feeling
Is lost and numb
And Ooh
I know I promised
That I will try but...
I
Yes I
Miss you
And its killing inside
I'll always be thankful
For the time we had
We were blessed I should celebrate
But I feel too sad
Our wonderful memories
Just make me fall apart
And it feels like somebody is
Stepping in my heart
No
I know I promised
Mmmm
That I wouldn't cry
But i, yes i
Miss you
And its killing inside
And i, yes i
Miss you
Want you by my side
Walking, holding hands
Talking making plans
Touching my heart, my soul
I wish this could be
A happy song
But my happiness disappeared
The moment you were gone
Tell me it's not happening
Say it's not as it seems
Tell me that I'm gonna wake up
Its just a bad dream
Please tell me that its fiction
Tell me its just a lie
What ever you choose to tell me
Please say you didn't die
I, yes i
Miss you
And its killing inside
Oh
I, yes i
Miss you... want you by my side
Oh
I, oh i
Miss you... want you by my side
Right here by my side
Here by my side
I keep on looking through the window again
But I'm not sorry if I do insult you
And I'm sad, not sorry 'bout the way that things went
And you'll be happy and I'll be forsaken thee
I swore I'd never feel like this again
But you're so selfish
You don't see what you're doing to me 
I keep on looking through the window again
No, I'm not sorry if I do insult you
No, I'm not sorry if I do insult you 
You told me lies
And I sighed, and I sighed, and I sighed
Cause you lied, lied
And I cried,
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I try again
I realize
As you sighed, and you sighed, and you sighed
Cause you lied, lied
And I cried,
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I die again 
Keep on looking through the window again
But I'm not sorry if I do insult you
I'm sad not sorry 'bout the way that things went
And you'll be happy and I'll be forsaken thee
I swore I'd never feel like this again
But you're so selfish
You don't see what you're doing to me 
Keep on looking through the window again
And I'm not sorry if I do detest you
No, I'm not sorry and I do detest you 
You told me lies
And I sighed, and I sighed, and I sighed
Cause you lied, lied
And I cried,
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I try again
I realize
And you sighed, and you sighed, you sighed
Cause you lied, lied
And I cried,
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I try again 
Keep on looking through the window again
Keep on looking through the window again
It's been a long cold winter without you
I've been crying on the inside over you
Just slipped through my fingers as life turned away
It's been a long cold winter since that day
And it's hard to find, hard to find
Hard to find the strength now but I try
And I don't want to, don't want to
Don't want to go on and speak now of what's gone by
'Cause no matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened
You just slipped through my fingers
And I feel so ashamed
You just slipped through my fingers
And I have paid
'Cause no matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened
No no I can't change
Just slipped through my fingers
And I feel so ashamed
You just slipped through my fingers
And I have paid
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened
Just slipped through my fingers
And I feel so ashamed
You just slipped through my fingers
And I have paid
Remember how it used to be
When the sun would fill the sky
Remember how we used to feel
Those days would never end
Those days would never end
Remember how it used to be
When the stars would fill the sky
Remember how we used to dream
Those nights would never end
Those nights would never end
It was the sweetness of your skin
It was the hope of all we might have been
That fills me with the hope to wish
Impossible things
To wish impossible things
To wish impossible things
But now the sun shines cold
And all the sky is grey
The stars are dimmed by clouds and tears
And all I wish is gone away
All I wish is gone away
All I wish is gone away
Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, make me wonder
And they say back then our universe
Was an empty sea, until a silver fox
And her cunning mate began to sing
A song that became the world we know
Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, make me wonder
And they say back then our universe
Was a coal black egg until the god inside
Burst out and from its shattered shell
He made what became the world we know
Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, make me wonder
And they say back then our universe
Was an endless land until our ancestors
Woke up and before they went back to sleep
They carved it up into the world we know
Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, make me wonder
And they say back then our universe
Wasn't even there until a sudden bang
And then there was light, was sound, was matter
And it all became the world we know
Heaven, heaven's bodies
Whirl around me, dance eternal
See her come down, through the clouds
I feel like a fool
I ain't got nothing left to give
Nothing to lose
So come on, love, draw your swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Let's not fuck around
'Cause you are the only one
'Cause you are the only one
I see them snakes come through the ground
They choke me to the bone
They tie me to their wooden chair
Here are all my songs
So come on, love, draw your swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Let's not fuck around
'Cause you are the only one
'Cause you are the only one
Only one
'Cause you are the only one
The only one
'Cause you are the only one
The only one
The only one
The only one
The only one
So come on, love, draw your swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Let's not fuck around
The only one
The only one
The only one
Man, it's been a long day
Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway
Wondering if I really tried everything I could
Not knowing if I should try a little harder
Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess that I'm only holding on by a thin thin thread
I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad
Man, it's been a long night
Just sitting here, trying not to look back
Still looking at the road we never drove on
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one
Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess that I'm only holding on by a thin thin thread
I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad
I'm so sad, so sad
Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess that I'm only holding on by a thin thin thread
I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
And I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
I'm so sad, so sad
Her eyes are underneath the ground
I have heard the crying sound
No one can stop you now
No one can stop you now
Her eyes are basking in the sun
No one knows why she did the things she's done
Ocean, swallow me now
Ocean, swallow me now
In the garden with my mother
I stole a flower
With my mother and in her power
I stole a flower
I saw six eyes glistening in my womb
I felt you calling to me in the gloom
Rest assured your love is pure
Rest assured your love is pure
In the garden with my mother
I stole a flower
With my mother and in her power
I chose a flower
There is a woman in Somalia
Scraping for pearls on the roadside
There's a force stronger than nature
Keeps her will alive
This is how she's dying
She's dying to survive
Don't know what she's made of
I would like to be that brave
She cries to the heaven above
There is a storm in my heart
She lives a life she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes
Hurts like brand-new shoes
There is a woman in Somalia
The sun gives her no mercy
The same sky we lay under
Burns her to the bone
Long as afternoon shadows
It's gonna take her to get home
Each grain carefully wrapped up
Pearls for her little girl
Allelujah!
Allelujah!
She cries to the heaven above
There is a storm in my heart
She lives in a world she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes
Hurts like brand-new shoes
Pangs of silence
From the room upstairs
How's the view there?
Do you read what they're saying about you?
That you're no fun
Since the war was won
In fact, you have become
All of the things you've always run from
The ascent of Stan
Textbook hippie man
Get rest while you can
So where'd the years go?
All the time we had
Being poor was not such a drag in hindsight
And you wonder
Why your father was so resigned
Now you don't wonder anymore
The ascent of Stan
Textbook hippie man
Textbook hippie man
Get rest while you can
(Stan) Once you wanted revolution
(Stan) Now you're the institution
(Stan) How's it feel to be the man?
It's no fun to be the man
La-da-da
La-da-da-da
La-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
And now, watch it all go down
The ascent of Stan
Textbook hippie man
(Stan)
Textbook hippie man
Get rest while you can
(Stan) Once you wanted revolution
(Stan) Now you're the institution
(Stan) How's it feel to be the man?
It's no fun to be the man
Tell me how you seek your man
And tell me all your secret spells
Tell me how you learn
To tell by his voice that he fell
I know a ghost will walk through walls
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall
Try to re-imagine me
And I'll re-invent myself
Still I remember scenes
Of when you looked at someone else
I know a ghost can walk through the wall
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall
When you start doubting me
Then I start to doubt myself
And never look through me
'Cause I'll keep close to myself
I know a ghost can walk through the wall
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall
I am what I am
And what I am is who I am
I know what I know
And all I know is that I fell
If only I could walk through the wall
Then maybe I would tell who I was
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall
Black eyed dog he called at my door
The black eyed dog he called for more
A black eyed dog he knew my name
A black eyed dog he knew my name
A black eyed dog
A black eyed dog
I'm growing old and I wanna go home, I'm growing old and I don't wanna know
I'm growing old and I wanna go home
Black eyed dog he called at my door
The black eyed dog he called for more
Look at me
Who am I supposed to be?
Who am I supposed to be?
Look at me
What am I supposed to be?
What am I supposed to be?
Look at me
Oh my love, oh my love 
Here I am
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
Here I am
What can I do for you?
What can I do for you?
Here I am
Oh my love, oh my love 
Please look at me, oh please look at me, my love
Here I am
Oh my love 
Who am I?
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows but me
Who am I?
Nobody else can see
Just you and me
Who are we?
Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love
White walls surround us
No light will touch your face again
Rain taps the window
As we sleep among the dead...
Days go on forever
But I have not left your side
We can chase the dark together
If you go, then so will I...
There is nothing left of you
I can see it in your eyes
Sing the anthem of the angels
And say the last goodbye...
Cold light above us
Hope fills the heart
And fades away
Skin white as winter
As the sky returns to gray...
Days go on forever
But I have not left your side
We can chase the dark together
If you go, then so will I...
There is nothing left of you
I can see it in your eyes
Sing the anthem of the angels
And say the last goodbye...
I keep holding onto you
But I can't bring you back to life
Sing the anthem of the angels
And say the last goodbye...
You're dead-alive...
Sing the anthem of the angels
And say the last goodbye...
Sing the anthem of the angels...
I don't know why I let go
I want to be your friend
Flowers grow through my window and I love you again
Oh I love you oh
When you laid me down
Into your beautiful garden
Flowers in the love of my arms
It's God shining through to me I guess
It's God shining through to me I guess
Oh I love you Amy
Do you still love me?
I go to the places where we used to
I feel sad
I am out here looking for you
Sometimes I pretend
Oh I miss you oh
When you laid me down
Into your beautiful garden
Flowers and the love in my arms
Is God playing evil tricks on me
Is God playing evil tricks on me
Oh I love you Amy
Do you still love me?
Oh I love you oh
When you laid me down
Into your beautiful garden
Flowers in the love of my arms
Is God playing evil tricks on me
Is God playing evil tricks on me
Oh I love you Amy
Do you still love me?
Pray God you can cope
I stand outside this woman's work
This woman's world
Ooh it's hard on the man
Now his part is over
Now starts the craft of the father
I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left
I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left
I should be crying but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking
Of all the things I should've said
That I never said
All the things we should've done
That we never did
All the things I should've given
But I didn't
Oh darling make it go
Make it go away
Give me these moments back
Give them back to me
Give me that little kiss
Give me your hand
I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left
I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left
I should be crying but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking
Of all the things we should've said
That we never said
All the things we should've done
That we never did
All the things that you needed from me
All the things that you wanted for me
All the things I should've given but I didn't
Oh darling make it go away
Just make it go away now
It's a motherfucker
Being here without you
Thinking 'bout the good times
Thinking 'bout the bad
And I won't ever be the same
It's a motherfucker
Getting through a Sunday
Talking to the walls
Just me again
But I won't ever be the same
I won't ever be the same
It's a motherfucker
How much I understand
The feeling that you need someone
To take you by the hand
And you won't ever be the same
You won't ever be the same
Started a search to no avail
A light that shines behind the veil, trying to find it
And all around us everywhere
Is all that we could ever share if only we could see it
Feel there's truth that's beyond me
Life ever changing weaving destiny
And it feels like I'm flying above you
Dream that I'm dying to find the truth
Seems like your trying to bring me down
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Layers of dust and yesterdays
Shadows fading in the haze of what I couldn't say
And though I said my hands were tied
Times have changed and now I find I'm free for the first time
Feel so close to everything now
Strange how life makes sense in time now
And it feels like I'm flying above you
Dream that I'm dying to find the truth
Seems like your trying to bring me down
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down
Please understand
This isn't just goodbye
This is I can't stand you
This is where the road crashed into the ocean
It rises all around me
And now we're barely breathing
A thousand faces we'll choose to ignore
Curse my enemies forever
Let's slit our wrists and burn down something beautiful
This desperation leaves me overjoyed
With fading lights that lead us past the lives that we destroy
I listen to you cry
I cry for less attention
But both my hands are tied
And I'm pushed into the deep end
I listen to you talk but talk is cheap
And my mouth is filled with blood
From trying not to speak
So search for an excuse
And someone to believe you
And for entrusting wounds
I'm empty with the need to
Curse my enemies forever
Let's slit our wrists and burn down something beautiful
This desperation is leaving me overjoyed
With fading lights that lead us past the lives that we destroy
Curse my enemies forever
Let's slit our wrists and burn down something beautiful
This desperation is leaving me overjoyed
With fading lights that lead us past the lives that we destroy
Please understand
Lay rotting where I fall
I'm dead from bad intentions
Suffocated and embalmed
And now all our dreams are cashed in
You swore you wouldn't lose then lost your brain
You make a sound that feels like pain
So please understand
This isn't just goodbye
This is I can't stand you
Every time we do this
I fall for her
Wave after wave after wave
It's all for her
"I know this can't be wrong" I say
And I'll lie to keep her happy
"As long as I know that you know
That today I belong right here with you
Right here with you"
And so we watch the sun come up
From the edge of the deep green sea
And she listens like her head's on fire
Like she wants to believe in me
So I try
"Put your hands in the sky
Surrender
Remember
We'll be here forever
And never say goodbye"
I've never been
So colourfully-see-through-head before
I've never been
So wonderfully-me-you-want-some-more
And all I want is to keep it like this
You and me alone
A secret kiss
And don't go home
Don't go away
Don't let this end
Please stay
Not just for today
"Never never never never never never never never never let me go" she says
"Hold me like this for a hundred thousand million days"
But suddenly she slows
And looks down at my breaking face
"Why do you cry?
What did I say?"
"But it's just rain" I smile
Brushing my tears away
I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears
Too many times
Too many years I've cried over you
Over you
How much more can we use it up?
Drink it dry?
Take this drug?
Looking for something forever gone
But something we will always want?
"Why why why are you letting me go?" she says
"I feel you pulling back
I feel you changing shape"
And just as I'm breaking free
She hangs herself in front of me
Slips her dress like a flag to the floor
And hands in the sky
Surrenders it all
I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears
Too many times
Too many years I've cried for you
It's always the same
Wake up in the rain
Head in pain
Hung in shame
A different name
Same old game
Love in vain
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles away
From home again
My lullaby
Hung out to dry
What's up with that
It's over
Where are you dad
Mom's looking sad
What's up with that
It's dark in here
Why, bleeding is breathing
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
Try, bleeding is believing
I used to
My mouth is dry
Forgot how to cry
What's up with that
You're hurting me
I'm running fast
Can't hide the past
What's up with that
You're pushing me
Why, bleeding is breathing
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
Try, bleeding is believing
I used to
I used to
Why, bleeding is breathing
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
Try, bleeding is believing
I saw you crawling on the floor
Why, bleeding is breathing
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
Try, bleeding is believing
I saw you crawling to the door
Why, bleeding is breathing
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
Try, bleeding is believing
I saw you falling on the floor
Staring out into the world across the street
You hate the way your life turned out to be
He's pulling up in the driveway and you don't make a sound
Cause you always learn to hold the things you want to say
You're always going to be afraid
There's only hate
There's only tears
There's only pain
There is no love here
Oh so what will you do?
There's only lies
There's only fears
There's only pain
There is no love here
Broken down like a mirror smashed to pieces
You learned the hard way to shut your mouth and smile
If these walls could talk they would have so much to say
Cause every time you fight the scars are gonna heal but they're never gonna go away
There's only hate
There's only tears
There's only pain
There is no love here
Oh so what will you do?
There's only lies
There's only fears
There's only pain
There is no love here
Oh no So what will you do?
You're falling, you're screaming
You're stuck in the same old nightmare
He's lying, you're crying
There's nothing left to salvage
Kick the door cause this is over
Get me out of here
(Kick the door)
There's only hate
There's only tears
There's only pain
There is no love here
Oh so what will you do?
There's only lies
There's only fears
There's only pain
There is no love here
Tell me what will you do?
There's only hate
There's only tears
There's only pain
There is no love here
Every thought that I repent
There's another chip you haven't spent
And you're cashing them all in
Where do we begin
To get clean again
Can we get clean again
I walk home alone with you
And the mood you're born into
Sometimes you let me in
And I take it on the chin
I can't get clean again
I want to know
Can we get clean again
The God of Wine comes crashing
Through the headlights of a car
That took you farther than you thought
You'd ever want to go
We can't get back again
We can't get back again
She takes a drink and then she waits
The alcohol it permeates
And soon the cells give way
And cancels out the day
I can't keep it all together
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I can't keep it all together
And the siren song that is your madness
Holds a truth I can't erase
All alone on your face
Every glamorous sunrise
Throws the planets out of line
A star sign out of whack
A fraudulent zodiac
And the God of Wine is crouched down in my room
You let me down, I said it
Now I'm going down
And you're not even around
And I said no, no, no, no...
I can't keep it all together
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I can't keep it all together
And there's a memory of a window
Looking through I see you
Searching for something
I could never give you
And there's someone who
Understands you more than I do
A sadness I can't erase
All alone on your face
Last night they said the fire had spread and we said our prayers
And now the flames are burning me in my bed but I just don't care
We all go to sleep in the same place and in the morning hope that we're all the same
We'll just sit around like broke down cars in the lot waiting for repairs
There you go
There it goes
Well I wish that I was as good as you at caring and trusting
And I wish that my condition was new but I'm old and rusted
So we just hurry up only to wait
And add to the list of all the places we hate
And I'll pretend like I've got something to say but I've got nothing
And now I know what you stole
Yeah you stole
From the cradles they were rocked in
You took the first words that they spoke
Yeah you stole
Yeah you stole
So if I'm a liar then you're a thief
At least we both know where the other one sleeps and lets end this tonight.
Stole
Yeah you stole
From the cradles they were rocked in
You took the first words that they spoke
Yeah you stole
Yeah you stole
So if I'm a liar then you're a thief
At least we both know where the other one sleeps and lets end this tonight
Instrumental
When the silence beckons,
And the day draws to a close,
When the light of your life sighs,
And love dies in your eyes,
Only then will I realise,
What you mean to me
The book of love is long and boring
No one can lift the damn thing
It's full of charts and facts and figures
And instructions for dancing
But I,
I love it when you read to me.
And you,
You can read me anything.
The book of love has music in it,
In fact that's where music comes from.
Some of it is just transcendental,
Some of it is just really dumb.
But I,
I love it when you sing to me.
And you,
You can sing me anything.
The book of love is long and boring,
And written very long ago.
It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes,
And things we're all too young to know.
But I,
I love it when you give me things.
And you,
You ought to give me wedding rings.
And I,
I love it when you give me things.
And you,
You ought to give me wedding rings.
You ought to give me wedding rings.
It feels like I'm looking at life 
Through a telescope because I'm so high 
And ground never seemed so far away 
Truth shall be told one day 
I'll be under ground one day 
I've got a woman
That'll put roses on my grave
I've got a woman
That'll put roses on my grave
Roses on my grave 
Feels like I'm looking at life 
Through a telescope because I'm so high 
The ground never seemed so far away 
Truth shall be told one day 
I'll be under ground one day 
I've got a woman
That'll put roses on my grave
I've got a woman
That'll put roses on my grave
I've got a woman
That'll put roses on my grave
I've got a woman
That'll put roses on my grave
Roses on my grave 
Don't forget me 
Don't forget me 
Please forgive me 
(Don't forget me) 
It's my redemption (time for redemption)
Time for redemption (it's my redemption)
It's my redemption (time for redemption)
Time for redemption 
I'll see you on the other side 
I'm waiting on the other side [x2]
Spoken
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.
Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright
It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom
Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright
And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies' neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (ha ha)
Let the show begin
It's a sorry sight
Let it all deceive
Now I'm
Pains in me that I've never found
Let the show begin
Let the clouds roll
There's a life to be found in this world
And now I see it's all but a game
That we hope to achieve
What we can
What we will
What we did suddenly
But it's all just a show
A time for us and the words we'll never know
And daylight comes and fades with the tide
And I'm here to stay
But it's all just a show
A time for us and the words we'll never know
And daylight comes and fades with the tide
I'm here to stay
You're on your own my little nightmare, you cannot stay here
It's far too bright for you
If they attack you, just lay there
Play dead dear, it's your only hope of pulling through
And seconds, they seem like a lifetime, a dream
Recurring, a dream that can't come true
And they'll pin it all on you
After all you've been put through
Sadie G, she's crazy, see?
That's what the white coats say
And now, miss Susan A, you're losing every opportunity
To put us all away
Now run along my little nightmare, your job is done here
You've scared them all to death
If they revive them, just sit there
Just smile dear, make them thankful for every breath
This sentence may seem like a lifetime, a scream
That's curdling the blood they found on you
And your knives and clothing too
Charlie's broken .22
Sadie G, she's crazy, see?
That's what the white coats say
And now, miss Susan A, you're losing every opportunity
Well they found you and they shipped you up the river the same way
That you've bound and gagged, you've shot and stabbed
You tried to set them free
But they've thrown away the keys
You see the cripple dance
Pay your money, baby
Now's your chance
Eyes like cyanide
I am so dumb
Just beam me up
I've had it all forever
I've had enough
Remember, you promised me
I'm dying, I'm dying, please
I want to, I need to be
Under your skin
Our love is quicksand
So easy to drown
They steal the gravity, yeah
From moving ground
Remember, you promised me
I'm dying, I'm dying, please
I want to, I need to be
Under your skin
And now I understand
You leave with everything
You leave with everything I am
Memories
And now I know that love is dead
You come to bury me
There's nothing left here to pretend
And it fades
Remember, you promised me
I'm dying, I'm dying, please
I want to, I need to be
Under your skin
I'm dying, I'm dying, please
I'm dying, I'm dying, please
I'm dying, I'm dying, please
Under your skin
Under your skin
I wake up to find you lying awake with your hands in your head
You cannot run can't escape from the things that you said
And you can tell anybody
Anybody who comes
You can tell anybody
But the damage is done
The new day's begun
One night
Can change everything in your life
One night
Can make everything alright
One night
Can turn all your colours to white
One night
It's easier said than done
Turning and turning but never returning to what you once had
Learning to care for the ones you hold dear but it's too... it's too bad
One night
Can change everything in your life
One night
Can make everything alright
One night
Can turn all your colours to white
One night
It's easier said than done
All that I am
All that I am
All that I am
Lying beside you as cold as a statue your hands are still warm
Trying to wake you as daylight it breaks through the eye of the storm
So you can tell everybody
Everybody who comes
You can tell everybody
But the damage is done
The new day's begun
One night
Can change everything in your life
One night
Can make everything alright
One night
Can turn all your colours to white
One night
It's easier said than done
One night
One night
One night
One night
It's easier said than done
When the joys of living just leave you cold
Frozen from the failing mess you made your own
And if you want an ending to your screenplay life
Well, here's the consolation that will change your heart and mind
All the glitz messiahs just pass the time
A cure for no real sickness, cross your hopes and die
Your supermarket Jesus comes with smiles and lies
Where justice he delays is always justice he denies
This will make you love again
This will make you love again
This will make you love again
This will make you love again
And now you save love again
To feel the rays, love again
The sweet delays love again
Shoot the breeze
Early Thursday mornings, wipe away the flies
The crossfire fight for action in between your thighs
Every touch is sacred when they leave the room
If I have to switch the lights off, I wanna switch them off with you
This will make you love again
This will make you love again
This will make you love again
This will make you love again
And now you save love again
To feel the rays, love again
The sweet delays love again
To shoot the breeze, love again
They call holidays an option for a reason
I heard you're coming back to life just for the fourth
I've been catching all your ghosts for every season
I pray to god you won't come back here anymore
Do you pray with him, too?
They should deliver all my blessings
In small brown paper handbags near the porch
And I wish I'd known that you were bleeding while I sat
And watched you reading with the lord
I read with him, too
When you look at me
I'll be digesting your legs
'Cause I can hardly see
What's in front of me these days
And those days, too.
I've got to take what I'm making
And turn it into something
I've got to take what I'm making
And turn it into something
For you
I've got to break what I'm making
And turn it into nothing
I've got to break what I'm making
And turn it into nothing
For you
God, where have you been?
Did it all get real, I guess it's real enough
They got refrigerators full of blood
Another century spent pointing guns
At anything that moves
Sometimes I worry that I've lost the plot
My twitching muscles tease my flippent thoughts
I never really dreamed of heaven much
Until we put him in the ground
But it's all I'm doing now
Listening for patterns in the sound
Of an endless static sea
But once the satellite's deceased
It blows like garbage through the streets
Of the night sky to infinity
But don't you weep (don't you weep for them)
Don't you weep (don't you weep)
There is nothing as lucky
Honey, don't you weep (don't you weep for them)
Don't you weep (don't you weep)
There is nothing as lucky, as easy, or free
Don't be a criminal in this police state
You better shop and eat and procreate
You got vacation days then you might escape
To a condo on the coast
I set my watch to the atomic clock
I hear the crowd count down till the bomb gets dropped
I always figured there'd be time enough
I never let it get me down
But I can't help it now
Looking for faces in the clouds
I got some friends I barely see
But we're all planning to meet
We'll lay in bags as dead as leaves
All together for eternity
But don't you weep (don't you weep for them)
Don't you weep (don't you weep)
There is no one as lucky
Honey, don't you weep (don't you weep for them)
Don't you weep (don't you weep)
There is nothing as lucky, as easy, or free
Or free, or free, or free
There's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing...
Another day goes by me
Another day of life without you
And as I look around me
I feel so lonely, there's no one here
No one here beside me
No one here to help to see me through
To see me through
To see me through
'Cause I need you
'Cause I need you
Been standing still for much too long
And I realise there's something wrong
I'm feeling strange, I need a change
And I realise that there's something wrong
There's something wrong
There's something wrong
Another two years older
Don't understand what's happened to me
These days are so much colder
Up against the fire, don't feel any heat
Cracked up years behind me
Cracked up years ahead are all I see
Are all I see
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at one fifty-eight
The words that you whispered, for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
If I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
And now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
So I'll watch your life in pictures
Like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me
Like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind
So I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have our last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last
Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face
The kind you'd find on someone that could save
If they don't put me away
Well, it'll be a miracle
Do you believe you're missing out
And everything good is happenin' somewhere else?
But with nobody in your bed
The night's hard to get through
And I will die all alone
And when I arrive, I won't know anyone
Well, Jesus Christ, I'm alone again
So what did you do those three days you were dead?
'Cause this problem's gonna last
More than the weekend
Well, Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die
I'm a little bit scared of what comes after
Do I get the gold chariot?
Do I float through the ceiling?
Do I divide and pull apart?
'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark
And this ship went down in sight of land
And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands?
I know you'll come in the night like a thief
(I know this song)
But I've had some time alone, to hone my lying technique
(Breathe Eve, save that one)
I know you think that I'm someone you can trust
(Eve, you're wrong, love)
But I'm scared I'll get scared, and I swear I'll try to never give up
(Everyone now)
So do you think that we could work out a sign?
So I'll know it's you and that it's over, so I won't even try
(They're all on file)
I know you're coming for the people like me
(One two three)
But we all got wood and nails
We tore down that hatin' factory
Yeah, we all got wood and nails
We tore down that hatin' factory
Yeah, we all got wood and nails
And we sleep inside of this machine
(Sorry)
Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
it's tearing up inside of me
Every day, every hour
I wish that I
Was bulletproof
Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it
Was bulletproof
Was bulletproof
So pay me money, take a shot
Lead-fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
Bulletproof
I'm not ready for it
But then ever I could be
I'm not ready for it
But then ever I could be
I'm not, I'm not
I'm not, I'm not
No name for her but as it comes
We'll name each after its way
No name for her but as it comes
We'll name each after its way
I'm not, I'm not
I'm not, I'm not
As with all else any piece
Has its place and form to fill
As with all else any piece
Has its place and form to fill
I'm not, I'm not
I'm not, I'm not
I'm not, I'm not
I'm not, I'm not
He played himself
Didn't need me to give him hell
He could be cool and cruel to you and me
Knew we'd put up with anything
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames
I'm hallucinating
Hallucinating
I hear you cry
Your tears are cheap
Wet hot red swollen cheeks
Fall alseep
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames
I want to hurt him
I want to hurt him
I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
And make him feel this pretty burn
William:
And here I am softer than a shower
And here I am to garland you with flowers
To lay you down in clover bed
The stars, a roof above our heads
And all my life I never felt the tremor 
And all my life that now disturbs my fingers
I'll lay you down in clover bed
The stars, a roof above our heads
And we'll lie 'til the corncrake crows
Bereft the weight of our summer clothes
And I'd wager all, the hazards of love, the hazards of love
And take my hand and cradle it in your hand
And take my hand to feel the pull, the quicksand
I'll lay you down in clover bed
The stars, a roof above our heads
And we'll lie till the corncrake crows 
Bereft the weight of our summer clothes
And I'd wager all, the hazards of love, the hazards of love
The hazards of love, the hazards of love
Rain on the brain
Now there's flowers in your window
She, well she's so strange
I don't know anything about her
But if it's all the same to you
Here's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna write a song
Gonna sing it to everyone
And then I'll sing it to you
'Cause it was you that wrote it too
This could be the last train
Search within yourself for feelings
Everybody's got them
You left me on the shelf
And no there's no one to rely on
But if it's all the same to you
Here's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna buy a gun
Gonna shoot everything everyone
And then I'm coming for you
'Cause it was you that drove me to
This could be the last train
Rear window with the room in the hair
And on her jacket there's a picture in white of Che Guevara
As he sits beneath the tree
But that's not important
But he looked a bit like me
If you took all the little feelings in your heart
And took all those little feelings all apart
Oh well now what's the point in doing all of that
Your picture is far too big to look at kid.
Your eyes won't open wide enough
And you are constantly surrounded by the swirling stream
Of what is and what was.
Well, we've all made out predictions but the truth still isn't out.
So if you want to see the future, go stare into a cloud.
And keep trying to find your way out of that maze of memories.
It all sort of looks familiar
Until you get up close and it's different, clearly.
But each time you turn a corner,
You're right back where you were
And your only hope is that forgetting might make a door appear.
Is it your fear of being buried that makes you so afraid to speak?
An avalanche of opinions
Like the one that fell that I am now underneath.
It was my voice that moved the first rock
And I would do it all again.
So I mean, it's cool if you keep quiet but I like singing.
So I'll be holding my note and stomping and strumming
And feeling so very lucky.
There is nothing I know except that this lifetime is one moment
And wishing will just leave me empty.
So you can try and live in darkness but you will never shake the light.
It will greet you every morning
And it will make you more aware with its absence at night,
When you're wrapped up in your blanket,
Babe, that comfortable cocoon.
But I have seen the day of your awakening boy and it's coming soon.
So go ahead and lose yourself in liquor
And you can praise the clouded mind
But it isn't what you're thinking
No, it's the course of history your position in line.
You're just a piece of the puzzle so
I think you'd better find your place.
And don't go blaming you knowledge on some fruit you ate.
Because there's been a great deal of discussion, yes,
About the properties of man.
Animal or Angel? You were carved from bone
But your heart, is just sand.
And the wind is gonna scatter it and cover everything with love.
So if it makes you happy, then keep kneeling, Mom,
But I'm standing up.
Because this veil is has been lifted.
Yes, My eyes are wet with clarity.
I have been a witness to such wonders.
Oh I've searched for them across the country
But I think I'll be returning now
To the town where I was born.
And I understand you must keep moving, friend, but I'm headed home.
I'm gonna follow the road and let the scenery weeping by
Easily enter my body.
I'll send you all this message in code,
Under ground, over mountains, through forests and deserts and cities.
All across electric wire, it's a baited line.
The hook is in deep, boys, there is no more time.
So you can struggle in the water
And be too stubborn to die
Or you could just let go and be lifted to the sky.
In this hole that we have fixed
We get further and further and further 
From the world 
We must do 
I saw you asleep beside a wall 
Your skull inside a ball 
Your eyes blackened by 
The sound and the thought of God 
Where should I hang my head?
Where would you like for me to hang my head?
One absence of truth 
And one horrible thing I saw 
What you truly wanted to become 
And who you thought I was
The fall, the fall
Afraid to love
What is deeper than the grave
Goes all the way down those tracks
Everybody bow your head for the greatest inspiration
Complete contradiction
Away
In this hole that we have fixed 
We get further and further 
From the world 
We must do 
I know this, I know this
You know this, you know this
In this hole that we have fixed 
We get further and further and further
From the world 
We must do 
I saw you outside that wall 
Your skull outside that wall 
Your eyes perceived by the sound 
And the light of God
